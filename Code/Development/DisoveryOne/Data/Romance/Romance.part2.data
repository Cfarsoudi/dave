	FADE IN

	EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

	A restaurant supply truck is curbside, near a small 
	restaurant.  GERALD GRUNICK, forty-one, is closing the back 
	door of his truck, feeling good about the world, a common
	state for him.  He moves towards the cab of the truck and gets
	inside as we SUPER:

		KANSAS CITY, MO. - 1963

	INT. TRUCK - DAY

	As he sits down beaming over his recent good fortune... now we
	REVEAL his twelve-year-old son, TOM, seated quietly beside him. 
	He seems a bit down.  Gerald glances at his son.

				GERALD
		I don't know a recent Saturday I've
		sold more.  You didn't think I'd
		sell that health restaurant, did you?

				TOM
		No.  Not even you.

				GERALD
		Why so glum?

				TOM
		I don't know.

				GERALD
			(a beat)
		Go ahead.

				TOM
		No, nothing.  I've got a problem,
		I guess.

				GERALD
		Were you bothering by those
		waitresses making a fuss?

				TOM
		No.  But, honest.  What are you
		supposed to say when they keep
		talking about your looks?  I don't
		even know what they mean -- "Beat
		them off with a stick."

	Gerald stiffs a grin.

				GERALD
		You know, Tom, I feel a little
		proud when people comment on your
		looks.  Maybe you should feel that
		way.

				TOM
		Proud?  I'm just embarrassed that
		I like when they say those things.

				GERALD
		As long as that's your only problem
		you're...

				TOM
		It's not.

	He looks directly at his father and talks quietly, and sincerely.

				TOM
		I got my report card.  Three Cs,
		two Ds and an incomplete.

				GERALD
		Oh my.  I see you studying so hard,
		Tom.  What do you think the problem is?

				TOM
		I'll just have to try harder.  I don't 
		know.  I will.
			(talking himself
			 into it)
		I will.  I will.  I will.

	He shakes his head for emphasis, glad he's received this pep
	talk from himself -- he hands the card to his father.

				TOM
		Thanks, Dad, this talk helped.  Will 
		you sign it, please?

				GERALD
			(as he signs)
		Would it help if I got you a tutor?

				TOM
			(suddenly hopeful)
		That would be great.
			(worried)
		It better help.  What can you do with
		yourself if all you do is look good?

	FADE IN

	BOSTON, MASS. - 1965

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY

	AARON ALTMAN, looking almost preposterously young in his
	graduation gown -- is delivering his valedictory.  He is a
	rare bread -- a battle-scarred innocent.

				AARON
		...and finally to the teachers of
		Whitman High School, I don't have the
		words to express my gratitude which
		may have more to say about the quality 
		of the English Department here than 
		my own limitations...

	He awaits a laugh and gets only the weird sound of collective
	discomfort.

				AARON
		...that was, of course, not meant to
		be taken seriously.  A personal note.  
		I am frequently asked what the special 
		difficulties are in being graduated 
		from High School two months shy of my 
		fifteenth birthday.  I sometimes 
		think it was the difficulties 
		themselves which enabled me to do it.
		If I'd been appreciated or even tolerated
		I wouldn't have been in such a hurry to
		graduate.  I hope the next student who
		comes along and is able to excel isn't
		made to feel so much an outcast.  But
		I'm looking forward to college; this is
		the happiest day I've had in a long
		time.  I thank you and I forgive you.

	This is very little applause.

	ANGLE ON TEACHERS

				MALE TEACHER
		I'm always so confused by Aaron.
		Is he brave and earnest or just
		a conceited little dick-head?

	BACK TO AARON AS WE SUPER: "FUTURE NETWORK NEWS REPORTER"

	ANGLE ON STAGE

	As Aaron walks to his seat past three full grown tough looking
	semi-literate high school graduates.

				YOUTH #1
		Later, Aaron.

	EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY

	Clusters of graduates at the fence bordering the sunken school
	yard looking down as the tough cap and gowners seen earlier
	cuff Aaron around.

	CLOSER IN

	Aaron feeling from a blow -- his lip bleeding -- his teeth
	covered with blood...as he gets to his feet.  He is livid --
	something primal triggered by this brutality.

				AARON
		Go ahead, Stephen -- take your
		last licks.
			(points at his
			 face)
		But this will heal -- what I'm
		going to say to you will scar you
		forever.  Ready?  Here it is.

	He dodges as they come after him.  They catch him by the hair
	and hurl him to the ground.  As he gets up he hurls his
	devastating verbal blow.

				AARON
		You'll never make more than
		nineteen thousand dollars a year.
		Ha ha ha.

	They twist his arm and grip him -- his face scraped on the
	concrete.

				AARON
		Okay, take this:  You'll never
		leave South Boston and I'm going
		to see the whole damn world.  You'll
		never know the pleasure of writing
		a graceful sentence or having an
		original thought.  Think about it.

	He's punched in the stomach and sinks to the ground.  As the
	Young Toughs walk off Aaron catches a phrase of their
	conversation.

				YOUTH TOUGH
		Nineteen thousand dollars...
		Not bad.

	FADE IN

	ATLANTA, GEORGIA - 1968

	INT. SUBURBAN HOME - NIGHT

	JANE CRAIG, ten years old, is in her room typing.  Above the
	desk where she works is a bulletin board with letters and
	pictures tacked to each one.  Her desk has several file racks
	which contain bulging but neat stacks of air mail envelopes --
	a roll of stamps in a dispenser is to one side.  Jane types
	very well in the glare of her desk lamp.

				JANE
			(voice over; as
			 she types)
		Dear Felatzia, it's truly amazing
		to me that we live a world apart
		and yet have the same favorite music.
		I loved the picture you sent and
		have it up on my bulletin board.
		You're growing so much faster than
		I am that I...

	OTHER ANGLE

	SHOWING Jane's FATHER standing near the door.

				JANE
			(voice over)
		...am starting to get jealous.
		I read in the newspapers about
		the Italian strike and riots in
		Milan.  I hope you weren't...

				FATHER
			(softly)
		Honey?...

	Jane SCREAMS, and grabs her heart, breathing heavily, babbles
	nervously at her Dad.

				JANE
		Oh God -- Daddy -- don't...don't...
		don't ever scare me like that --
		please.

	We SUPER:  "FUTURE NETWORK NEWS PRODUCER"

	Her father is himself taken aback with the shock of her reaction.
	Falling back towards the door:

				FATHER
		Jane -- For God's sake...
			(recovering)
		Look, it's time for you to go
		to sleep.

				JANE
		I just have two more pen pals and
		then I'm done.

				FATHER
		You don't have to finish tonight.

				JANE
			(he doesn't get in)
		Nooo.  This way the rotation stays
		the same.

				FATHER
		Finish quickly.  I don't want you
		getting obsessive about these 
		things.  Good night.

	We REMAIN WITH Jane who has obviously become disconcerted and
	troubled.

	INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

	As Jane moves to room at the other end of the hall -- a family
	room where her Father reads the latest Rolling Stone of the
	mid-60's -- Hunter Thompson, the New Journalism, the slim
	Jann Wenner -- Jane bursts into the room.

				JANE
		Dad, you want me to choose my words
		so carefully and then you just throw
		a word like 'obsessive' at me.  Now,
		unless I'm wrong and...
			(enunciating)
		...please correct me if I am, 'obsession'
		is practically a psychiatric term...
		concerning people who don't have anything
		else but the object of their obsession --
		who can't stop and do anything else.  Well,
		Here I am stopping to tell you this.  Okay?
		So would you please try and be a little
		more precise instead of calling a person
		something like 'obsessive.'

	She advances furiously on her Father since even this strung out,
	even with two additional pen pal letters to get off, she had
	enough sense of duty to kiss him good night before storming from 
	the room.  She exits the room INTO BLACK.

	Stay on BLACK as we begin MAIN TITLES:

	OVER EXT. SMALL MID-WESTERN CITY - DAY

	Emerging from the blackness -- Jane Craig -- now a
	twenty-eight-year-old woman -- a long speed walker wearing a
	jacket to which reflecting stripes have been glued -- the kind
	of gear only possessed by someone who runs at off-hours.  The
	Jacket itself is a wish-I-had-it souvenir from some important
	news assignment, the sort of treasure you love about all else
	yet never mention.  She stops running as she feeds quarters into
	the first of a phalanx of newspaper machines -- getting seven
	different papers before moving on.

	INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

	As she enters from the bathroom, having showered and dressed.
	The sun is jus now rising.  She sits next to her phone.

	INSERT:  JANE'S ROOM

	The Filofax book is almost an additional character -- a crucial
	hand-fashioned tool of Jane's trade.  She flicks at a page --
	takes down a typewritten sheet scotch-taped to it showing the
	room number of her crew and reporter.

	ON JANE

	As she dials one room number.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Hi...It's me...

	INT. DUPLICATE MOTEL ROOM - DAY

	ANGLE ON CAMERAMAN -- his equipment in evidence though
	essentially asleep holding his bedmate's hand, as he listens
	to Jane.

				JANE'S VOICE
			(voice over)
		It's thirty minutes before you have
		to meet me in the lobby -- nudge
		your wife.

	BACK TO SCENE

				JANE
		There's probably no time to eat...
		but there's a cafeteria at the bus
		depot once we get down there.  I
		love working with you two...It 
		saves me a call.

	She dales.

	INT. DUPLICATE MOTEL ROOM

	Where Aaron is switching his TV from station to station,
	monitoring the early morning news.  His PHONE RINGS.

				AARON
		Hi.  Turn on your TV...
		Good Morning America, the
		Morning News and Today are all
		about to talk to Arnold 
		Schwarzenegger and I think he's 
		live on at least two of them.

	BACK TO SCENE

				JANE
		At six o'clock on the wake-up
		news they used the wrong missile
		graphic.

				AARON
			(Austrian accent)
		Now listen, Arnold just said that
		he's been making three million a
		movie now.  But he's not ever 
		gonna change.  He's still the same
		person when he was making two 
		million dollars a movie.  He feels
		no different.  He also bought a brand-
		new condo with Maria, they gonna
		furnish tastefully.

				JANE
		A half hour in the lobby.

				AARON
			(Austrian accent)
		Okay, I'll see you in the lobbies [sic].

	She hangs up -- takes the phone off the hook and lays it on the
	bed for a moment's solitude.  She sits stiffly, palms on top of
	her legs.  It looks like someone with unusually good posture,
	waiting for something, and now we BEGIN TO SEE the first signs
	redden and she begins to cry.  Now she sobs -- then miraculously
	shakes it off and exits quickly to the bathroom.  This crying
	episode is clearly part of her morning routine.

	INT. BUS STATION - DAY

	Jane standing behind her husband-wife - camera-sound team
	as they train their attention on Aaron; who is getting ready to 
	do a stand-up.  There is a DERELICT off to one side.  Aaron holds 
	his microphone at the ready.

				AARON
		Ready.
 
				CAMERAMAN
		Your hair's a little funny.

				AARON
		It's an ethnic curl, I can't do
		anything about it.

				CAMERAMAN
		In front of a little -- it's a bit...
		You want a mirror?

				AARON
		No -- Don't worry about it.  Let's
		do this.

	Jane nods her assent.

				CAMERAMAN
		Okay.

	AARON SEEN THROUGH CAMERA

				AARON
		In other times, for other purposes,
		there might be a band and bunting
		here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's
		return from war.  He...

				JANE
			(interrupting)
		I'm sorry.  But look at how
		wonderful his face is.

	She points to the derelict.

				AARON
		Oh, you mean use him...That's
		nice.  Okay.

				CAMERAMAN
		I'll put him in the low corner of
		the frame -- good.

				AARON
		In other times, with other purposes,
		there might be a band and bunting
		here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's
		return from war.  Last week he was
		decorated by a president for heroism
		in a war.  But it was the civil war --
		in Angola -- and he was in it for the
		money.

	He puts the microphone down.

				AARON
		Thanks.

	He passes a vending machine and checks the stray hair.

	INT. GATE AREA - DAY

	Jane in the distant b.g. on the phone.  Aaron and crew shooting
	as the bus pulls up, hisses to a stop and tired, rumpled
	passengers exit the bus.  J.D. SINGER, strong, 9'6" figure
	emerges and is displeased to find a camera trained on him.
	He reacts with all the grace of a short mercenary.

				J.D.
		Go 'way.

	J.D. gets his luggage from the compartment under the bus.  The
	crew shooting.

				AARON
		Just a few questions?

				J.D.
		No.

	He starts walking -- the four person newsteam staying with him.

				AARON
		We came from Washington.

				J.D.
		Move away from me.

				AARON
			(holding out
			 microphone)
		How long has it been since you've
		been home.

				J.D.
			(moving)
		Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuckes.  Snot...
		Fuckee.  You want to use that?

				AARON
		It depends on how big a news day it 
		is.

	They reach Jane.  She calls to him.

				JANE
		J.D.  I'm Jane Craig.  I spoke to
		you in Angola.  I gave you some
		sugarless gum and Handi-Wipes.

	As he reacts to her:

	INT. JANE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Jane sitting next to Aaron making detailed timing notes as she
	screens the material shot that day on a portable monitor unit.

				AARON
		Where's where I asked him about
		being scared?
			(then)
		You should work on your speech.

				JANE
		No.  It makes me nervous to think
		about it.  Let's do this.

	She consults her notes and goes back to the exact spot.

				AARON
			(on tape)
		All this business of war -- do you
		get scared?

				J.D.
			(on tape; he smiles)
		Uh-uh.
			(then)
		I'm a little freaked right now about
		seeing my father though.

	He laughs self-consciously and turns briefly away.

				JANE
		I love that turn away.

	INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

	Jane is at the lectern in the darkened auditorium as two large
	monitors display some taped news pieces she has assembled.  On
	the lectern is a sign telling us we are at the Conference of
	Local Television News Broadcasters.

				JANE
			(in darkness)
		There's a point I'm trying to make
		about these pieces coming up.

	A WOMAN'S OUTLINE blacked out from behind -- her VOICE
	ELECTRICALLY DISGUISED.

				WOMAN
			(o.s.; angrily)
		I don't think any client of mine
		makes less than fifty thousand dollars
		a year which means they can afford the
		best and you're damn right I feel good
		that that includes me.

							CUT TO:

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ANOTHER WOMAN
	in blackness, her VOICE DISGUISED.

				WOMAN TWO
			(o.s.)
		No.  You'd be surprised at who a
		working girl meets.  I've been a
		working girl for what? -- over a year
		anyway and that must be a thousand
		men and I don't think there's an age
		or type that hasn't been in there.

				INTERVIEWER'S VOICE
			(voice over)
		Policemen?  -- Doctor? -- Lawyer...?

				WOMAN TWO
			(o.s.)
		Oh, sure.  Television reporters.

	A laugh from the audience.  There is a:

							CUT TO:

	ANOTHER ANGLE - FULL FIGURE
	A WOMAN in blackness.

				WOMAN THREE
			(o.s.)
		I'm seventeen now and I've been
		working the streets for two years
		and I guess to be honest -- I stopped
		thinking of it as temporary.

	The lights come up on the room.  The two screens go black...
	there is general APPLAUSE.  Jane blinks nervously.

				JANE
		Please don't applaud.

	ON AUDIENCE

	Sitting in groups of three -- NEWS TEAM from around the country,
	remarkably similar in comparison...a great looking woman, good
	looking man (either young or attractively avuncular) and a Black
	or Hispanic.  They still APPLAUD -- not yet having grasped the
	sincerity of Jane's plea which she presses with more urgency.

				JANE
		Please.  Don't!!
			(she yells)
		I gathered these pieces as an
		example of what's WRONG with local
		television news.

	The applause stops.

				JANE
		The excerpts from THREE SEPARATE
		SERIES on prostitution were
		SIMULTANEOUSLY broadcast by all
		stations in one city during sweeps
		week.  By what bend of either or
		suspension of duty is that broadcast
		news?

	She pauses half a beat for possible applause -- hearing none,
	she continues.  An anchorman sneezes -- four people shout
	"gesundheit" simultaneously -- they laugh.

				JANE
		The legacy of Edward R. Murrow,
		Eric Sevareid, William Shirer,
		David Brinkley and Walter Cronkite
		is being squandered in a desperate
		popularity contest.  Our profession
		is in danger:

	TRACKING SHOT

	As Jane continues, REVEALING that the news team now have even
	more in common.  They do not like Jane.

				JANE
		Yesterday's compliment has somehow
		managed to become today's kiss of
		death.  To be considered a serious
		journalist is no longer flattering.
		It presents the risk of being labeled
		ponderous, or worse yet, elitest, 
		right?

	SHOT CONTINUES

	Women playing with their hair, young man bored...one
	middle-aged anchorman fusses with a spot on his tie...

	ON JANE

	Briefly departing from text.

				JANE
		All of you know what I'm talking about.  
		We're all trying to act together than 
		we are.  But we care.  So, we're all 
		secretly terrified, aren't we?

	Not a peep -- she is thrown but doggedly presses on with her
	prepared speech though her throat constricts a bit, her voice
	begins to rasp.

				JANE
		We are being increasingly influenced
		by the star system.  The network
		anchormen are so powerful they 
		compromise our last best hope.  The 
		current group is clearly qualified, 
		tied still to our best traditions, but 
		who follows these men?

	TRACKING SHOT MOVES TO TOM GRUNICK

	Seated with other members of his news team, a young blonde
	woman whose hand is resting on his inner leg, a good looking
	Hispanic.  Tom feels a growing excitement -- Jane is not just
	a speaker, she seems a savior.

				TOM
		Wow.

	His female colleague looks at him.

				FEMALE COLLEAGUE
		Oh, I've known so many women like
		that.  They don't like their looks
		so they're angry.

	BACK TO JANE

	Fumbling with her cards, sunk but game -- gamer than she would
	wish.

				JANE
		I was going to talk about other
		trends but...
			(mumbling)
		...the magazine shows, news at
		profit, influence of
		Entertainment Tonight, the danger, the
		hope, the dream, the question...Oh, I
		was going to show you a tape -- a story
		that was carried by all networks on the
		same night -- the same night -- not one
		network noted a major policy change in
		Salt Two nuclear disarmament talks...
		Here's what they ran instead...Go ahead. 
		Show the tape.

	ON MONITORS

	Showing the Japanese Domino Championships as broadcast by all
	networks in the Spring of 1985.  It is quite spectacular -- the
	dominoes falling into one another provoking waves, crossing tiny
	bridges, setting off little fireworks.  JANE'S AUDIENCE applauds
	loudly and squeals with delight.

	ON SCENE

	Jane between the two monitors.  She begins to speak loudly OVER
	the AUDIENCE NOISES of approval.

				JANE
			(loudly)
		I know it's good film.  I know it's
		fun.  I like fun.  It's just not news.
			(as they continue
			 to applaud)
		Well, you're lucky you love it --
		you're going to get a lot more just
		like it.

	STRAY VOICE - SHOUT "GOOD"

	OTHER ANGLE

	Jane sitting rocked into momentary catatonia, by the event.
	Dazed as an animal stung by a tranquilizer dart.  She takes
	some irregular breaths waiting for normal life to return.

	WIDER

	Tom the last person remaining in the room.  He approaches her --
	she is totally unaware of his presence, even when he casually
	mounts the stage with an athletic leap.  It takes courage for
	Tom to fully intrude himself, which he now does:

				TOM
		Hello.

	She looks up at him.

	ANGLE ON TOM

	Earnest, nervous -- handsome...Just when she needed a mirage
	there it is.

				JANE
		Hi.

				TOM
		I just wanted to tell you  how great 
		you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.

				JANE
			(dumbly)
		Thank you.
			(then)
		They hated me.  I don't hate them.

				TOM
		Well, they say if you can reach
		even one person, it means something...
		And you did that.

	Jane looks up at his smile -- a beat then:

				JANE
		Would you like to have dinner
		with me?

	INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	Jane arrives at the maitre d' stand.  She has attempted to dress
	up to the extent that  packing for a short-day trip allows.  She
	looks for Tom.  Tom rises from a table and is immediately at
	her side.

				JANE
		Hi.  I was worried I was early.

				TOM
		I was a lot earlier.

	They are lead to a table and sit down.

				TOM
		I kept thinking what a great break
		it was for me to get to see you
		tonight.  More than a great break,
		maybe just what I needed...just when
		I needed it...Angel of mercy --
		godsend...lifesaver...what?

				JANE
			(picking one)
		I like "godsend."

				TOM
		I haven't been in news that long.
		I've just been looking for the
		right person to talk to.  I have
		about two thousand questions for you.

	He notices that her head has gone into her hands where it
	continues to rest.  He looks at her a beat.

				TOM
		It's possible now's not the right
		time.

	She lifts her head.

				JANE
		If we could just eat first.

				TOM
		Totally understood.  Totally
		wrong of me to talk shop after
		the day you've had.  Totally
		sorry.

				JANE
		Nooo.  If I could just have a
		roll, I'd be okay.

	She takes a roll from the roll plate.  He smiles at her.  She
	takes a bite.

				JANE
		Thank you.

	EXT. CONVENTION HOTEL - NIGHT

	As they walk along -- dumping occasionally and self-consciously.
	Jane is feeling a version of being turned on -- that is, a little
	adrift and temporarily free of obligations.  She is open to
	making a memorable mistake.

				JANE
		Another thing I can't stand --
		Is this dull?

	Tom shakes his head almost violently.

				TOM
		No, no, no, no...

	Jane looks at him curiously -- then:

				JANE
			(broadly)
		Another thing I can't stand is
		...when White House reporters
		bullshit with each other after
		a briefing and then one of them
		has a theory and the other quotes
		it in his story as "White House"
		sources say...

				TOM
		That actually goes on...

				JANE
		Yes.  My room is down here --
		I'm not tired.  Do you want to
		keep talking?

				TOM
		Yes, sure.

	INT. JANE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	A small good room -- her working paraphernalia very much in
	evidence...the quality briefcase...the reams of well organized
	notes...the thick contact book -- Jane is sitting on the bed --
	Tom, not far away in the room's only chair.  One lamp is on
	and it serves to place Jane in the shadows and cast Tom in an
	enormously flattering light.  MUSIC comes from her miniature
	portable STEREO system.

				JANE
		Come on...Even I'm not that
		hard on myself.

				TOM
		No, I really got this job on a
		fluke and wait till you hear where
		it ends up.

	Jane smiles a calming smile.

				JANE
		I was doing sports at the station.
		The newspaper ran this untrue story
		that I was leaving and they got all
		these tons of protest mail.  So they
		made me anchor.

				JANE
		So great -- right?

				TOM
		Except I'm no good at what I'm being
		a success at.

				JANE
		How are you at back rubs?

	Jane shifts her position so that her back is to Tom... He is
	immobilized by the sudden turn.  Jane waits, just a bit longer
	than it would take a man to run from the chair to her side before
	experiencing the ghost-like clutch of rejection.  She moves
	briskly past the moment -- grabbing a "good night" chocolate
	from the pillow and munching it as she return to his agenda.

				JANE
		It's sort of normal -- the way you
		feel.  In graduate school everyone
		thought the only mistake the
		admission committee made was letting
		them in.

	He moves to the bed.

				TOM
		Listen to me.  You keep on thinking
		I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence.
		That's not it.  I know I can talk well
		enough and I'm not bad at making contact
		with people, but I don't like the 
		feeling that I'm pretending to be a 
		reporter.
			(cont'd)
		And half the time I don't really get 
		the news I'm talking about.  It isn't
		that I'm down on myself.  Trust me,
		I stink.

				JANE
			(levelly)
		I trust you.

				TOM
		I didn't even have the chance to get
		really good at sports.  I wasn't bad.
		I thought I was starting to do
		interesting features but hockey is
		big at the station and...

				JANE
			(interrupting)
		What about the obvious remedy?
		Reversing things.  Maybe getting a
		job on a newspaper.

				TOM
		I don't write.

	Jane laughs or, more accurately, scoffs as Tom Continues.

				TOM
		But that didn't stop me from
		sending out audition tapes to
		bigger stations and the networks.

				JANE
		Well, come on -- it is your life.
		Nobody is tying you to the fast
		track.  Did you go to college?

				TOM
		One year...almost one year.

				JANE
		So, you're not well educated and
		you have almost no experience and
		you can't write.

	He nods agreement.

				TOM
		And I'm making a fortune.

	Jane laughs very briefly -- then rubs her face vigorously with
	her hands... He's making her feel a little crazy.  She gets off
	the bed.

				JANE
		It's hard for me to advise you
		since you personify something that
		I truly think is dangerous.

				TOM
		Uh-huh.

				JANE
			(holding it in)
		I agree with you -- you're not qualified.
			(letting it out)
		So get qualified.  You can insist on
		being better prepared.  You don't have
		to just leave it as...
			(mimicking him)
		'I don't write.  I'm not schooled.
		I don't understand the news I'm reading.
		But at least I'm upset about it, folks.'

	A beat, then he mumbles softly to himself.

				TOM
		Whoa, this was a mistake.

				JANE
		Just what do you want from me, anyway?
		Permission to be a fake?  Stop whining
		and do something about it.

	He gets up to leave.  She follows him.

				JANE
		Well, you don't have to start right now.

	He turns to her.

				TOM
		I hated the way you talked to me just
		now...and it wasn't just because you
		were right.

	He exits.

	INT. JANE'S HOTEL - NIGHT

	She is on the phone.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		No.  It wasn't just the speech --
		the same thing happened with this
		guy.  I have passed some line some
		place.  I am beginning to repel people
		I'm trying to seduce.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	As he talks with Jane.

				AARON
			(agreeably)
		He must have been great-looking, right?

				JANE
		Why do you say that?

				AARON
		Because nobody invites a bad-
		looking idiot to their bedroom.

	She smiles.

				AARON
		Okay.  Let's do me.

				JANE
		Sure.

				AARON
		Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but
		do people who are actually slipping
		feel that way or is it always the
		really good people who are moving up
		who invariably think they're slipping
		because their standards are so high?

				JANE
		This conversation is not worthy of you.

				AARON
		I'd give anything if that were true.

				JANE
			(laughing)
		Good night.

				AARON
		Wouldn't this be a great world if
		insecurity and desperation made us
		more attractive?  If needy were a
		turn-on?

				JANE
		Call if you get weird.

	INT. JANE'S HOTEL - NIGHT

	She hangs up -- pulls back the bedspread on the double bed --
	on the other half are papers, schedules -- tapes.  She doesn't 
	clear them off so that she is literally sleeping with her work.  
	The PHONE RINGS.

				JANE
			(answering)
		I was just thinking it was the
		shortest phone conversation we
		ever had.

	EXT. PHONE BOOTH

	A deserted well-lit area.  Tom on the phone.

				TOM
		I never told you the reason I was
		telling you everything for.

				JANE
			(pleasantly surprised
			 it's him)
		Hey?

	INTERCUT:

	ON TOM

				TOM
		Those audition tapes I sent out...
		I've been hired by your network for
		the Washington bureau.  So I'll
		probably see you at work.  Sorry.

	Jane is rocked and soured.

				JANE
		What???

	EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. STREET - MORNING

	Jane and Aaron walking to work -- agitated.

				AARON
		They didn't hire Peter Stiller from
		the Times and he had a great
		audition tape.

				JANE
		You want to start going over who they
		could have gotten?  They can't take on
		people like this for network news.  For
		God's sake.  What's going on?

	INT. NEWS BUILDING LOBBY - DAY

	Tom arrives for first day of work.

	INT. ERNIE MERRIMAN'S OFFICE

	ERNIE MERRIMAN is the network's Washington Bureau Chief.  He
	is in his early 60's, has worked for the network about 40 years
	-- part of the golden age -- a family man, an honorable man,
	a good guy.  Right now he is welcoming Tom to the network
	thereby good-naturedly helping with the destruction of all he
	holds dear.  As he hands Tom his credentials:

				ERNIE
		Any particular area you feel
		strongest in?

				TOM
		To be honest, I was best at anchor.

	Ernie gives him a long look -- is he kidding?

				ERNIE
		Why don't you take a few days observing
		the system?  Then we'll put you on
		general assignment.

	EDITING ROOM - NIGHT

	Two small TV monitors -- a smallish room.  Jane goes over her
	timing notes which correspond to the time code SUPERED on the
	monitors.  BOBBIE -- an extraordinarily silent man -- is doing
	Jane's bidding.  On the monitor we SEE the mercenary piece
	which Jane is editing against a tightening deadline.  The
	PHONE RINGS periodically -- Jane conducting abrupt conversations
	which continuing to edit.  The pressure is palpable to begin
	with but builds and builds; almost like a family fight getting
	out of hand and threatening to bend lives.  Through it all, Jane
	remains remarkable calm.  Her focus is amazing; her command sexy.

				JANE
			(consulting notes)
		Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound
		bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I
		don't know how I'll feel...'

				BOBBIE
		We could...

				JANE
			(interrupting)
		Please, Bobbie, we're pushing.

	As Bobbie expertly reverses the tape, Tom's face appears in
	the glass doorway and then he enters the already crowded room --
	Jane's eyes click to him briefly.  She makes not a move to
	welcome him.  He pauses, but is committed and tries to find
	a piece for himself against the wall.

				TOM
		They said I should observe the...

	Jane is distracted by the noise... Tom leaning over towards her.

				TOM
		They said it would be okay if...

				JANE
			(incredulous)
		We're working here!!  You can stand
		over in the uh, uh, uh...

	She momentarily can't think of the word 'corner.'  Then back
	to Bobbie:

				JANE
		Play back the last line...

				BOBBIE
		He said something about...

				JANE
			(sharply)
		Let me hear it!

	Bobbie, taking the sharp commands with ever increasing,
	yet still repressed resentment.

	The Assistant Director, BLAIR LITTON, enters the editing room.
	She is about 26 and every night since she got her job as
	Assistant Director she has been the first to crack under pressure.

				BLAIR
		We'll need it in ten minutes.  We're
		putting it directly into...

	Jane holds up a finger of warning to Blair as she picks up a
	ringing phone and talks to Bobbie at the same time.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Craig, just a second --
			(to Bobbie)
		Let me hear it!

	Through much of this chaos we focus on:

	TOM

	Wedged into an uncomfortable position between two tape racks --
	He is wide-eyed at this circus of tension and fear.  His eyes
	dart around constantly -- trying to take in as much as he can,
	always returning with wonder to focus on Jane.

				MERCENARY
			(voice over)
		It's been a long time since I've seen
		my folks and all but...I don't expect
		any big-deal homecoming.

				JANE
		Stop there.
			(into phone she's
			 been holding)
		I want to shoot a picture from
		a book I have in the office.

				BLAIR
		You don't have time.  Not a chance.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		I'll be right down.  It's right tight.

	She crosses out.

				BLAIR
		I've got to tell Ernie...because
		there isn't enough time.

				JANE
		Yes, there is.

	Blair leaves, as Jane gathers up her notes.  She charges out
	leaving Tom awkwardly along with Bobbie.

				TOM
		I'm Tom Grunick.  I started on
		General Assignment today.

	Bobbie stops the machine, turns in his chair and shakes hands.
	Then he smiles secretly and speaks his first full sentence.

				BOBBIE
		I don't think she's going to make it.

	Tom exits.

	INT. BUREAU NEWSROOM

	Aaron is having a theoretical discussion with Ernie and
	JENNIFER MACK, a correspondent in her early 40's, a pioneer
	beauties in news.  She is well-schooled, bred, trained and
	known... GEORGE WEIN, a black correspondent in his 40s, and
	MARTIN KLEIN, formerly with the Johnson administration --
	State Department correspondent for the network.

				KLEIN
		Okay, what about this?  Here's a
		tough ethical one.  Would you tell
		a source that you loved them just
		to get some information?

				AARON
		Yes.

				GEORGE
		Yes.

				ERNIE
		Me too.

				JENNIFER
		Sure.

				AARON
		Jennifer didn't know there
		was an alternative.

	Jennifer laughs that laugh one always hopes beautiful women
	will laugh when one says something funny.  Aaron smiles at her.

				AARON
		Here's one.  They allow us to have
		cameras at an execution in Florida.
		Do you broadcast tape of the guy  in
		the chair when they turn on the
		voltage?

				KLEIN
		Sure.

				JENNIFER
		Why not?

				ERNIE
		Absolutely.

				GEORGE
		You bet.

				AARON
		Nothing like wrestling with a
		moral dilemma is there?

	Blair enters the scene, Tom trailing several feet behind,
	continuing to monitor the budding deadline crises.

				BLAIR
		Excuse me, Ernie, we're several minutes
		to air and Jane's shooting an insert
		still for tonight's piece.

				ERNIE
		She knows how much time she has.

	Blair flashes a tortured smile -- panic is growing.

				BLAIR
		Okay.  I just wanted you to know.

				AARON
		What is she shooting?

				BLAIR
		Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'

				AARON
			(thinks then)
		Oh, that's nice...
			(walking away)
		We'll need some new lines.

	INT. EDITING ROOM - NIGHT

	Jane up against it now -- but still seemingly calm.  Tom
	watching, keeps on glancing at the clock fascinated,
	impressed.

				JANE
		Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second
		dissolve to the Rockwell.

				BOBBIE
		Should I...

				JANE
			(interrupting)
		Just a two-second dissolve.

				BLAIR
			(hurting)
		Oh, Jesus, we have three minutes...
		Why do you do this to me.  Is it
		because I won an award?

	INT. RECORDING BOOTH - NIGHT

	Where Aaron is writing his last line on a folded over piece of
	paper even as he gets ready to record.  He times it with a
	stop watch.

				AARON
		Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait
		of a Homecoming  The return of a
		fighting man has always been one of
		the more moving ceremonies of war...
		Tearful women, proud men, excited
		children.  But J.D. Singer was right --
		his homecoming was no big deal.

	INT. EDITING ROOM - NIGHT

				BLAIR
		We have a minute and a half.  It's my
		responsibility to tell them we won't
		be ready.

				JANE
		Uh-uh.  We're be ready.

	Blair glances frantically at her watch.

				BLAIR
		In 84 seconds?

	ON CLOCK

	Sweeping from 28 minutes to -- 84 seconds from deadline.  Aaron
	walks in, Jane looks up.

				JANE
			(hopefully)
		Nine seconds.

				AARON
		Eleven and a half.

				JANE
		Oh, God.  Back it, Bobbie -- Bobbie?

	ALMOST SIMULTANEOUS DIALOGUE FOLLOWS.  IT BUILDS UNTIL IT
	DUPLICATE THE SOUND OF LOUD AND BAWDY SEX.

				BLAIR
		You're saying 'Oh, God..."  They are
		going to go to up and the screen will
		be black -- they're going to go to black
		because we're not there.  How about
		careers, huh?  How about careers?

	ON CLOCK

	42 seconds away.

				BLAIR
		We're not going to make it.

	Bobbie makes a small bobble -- Jane giving the merest evidence
	of the strain, scratching her face repeatedly.

				BOBBIE
		Whoops.

				BLAIR
			(unravelling)
		Whoops?!?  Whoops?!?  No, please...
		no, ooh, ahhh, ohhh.

				AARON
		Shit, shit, shit...

				TOM
			(caught up)
		You're almost there, you can do it --
		can do -- can do.

	And as the pitch reaches its zenith, 27 seconds left.  Bobbie
	hands the tape to Blair.

				BOBBIE
		Ready.

	INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT

	Blair hikes up her skirt and takes off.

	VARIOUS SHOTS

	Our "chase scene" as Blair soars through the newsroom, leaping a
	chair smoothly, smashing her leg against a table in full flight,
	the adrenaline deadening the pain -- she arrives at a waiting
	elevator -- uses a key dangling from her neck to unlock it... jumps
	nervously during the ride and now, in FULL EXTENDED FLIGHT, barrels
	down the long corridor heading to the control room where she
	arrives; slamming the tape into a technician's hand even as it is
	introduced on the air.

	INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT

	Aaron, Jane, the others looking at the end of the piece on the
	air -- Tom in the b.g. as Blair enters -- relaxed, almost jaunty.

				BLAIR
		I was a little nervous there for
		a minute.

				AARON
		Oh, come on -- tell us another.

	ON MONITOR

	The end of the piece -- the Rockwell painting giving way to the
	mercenary's actual homecoming which matches the portrait.  The 
	irony works nicely.  The network anchorman comes up for his close.  
	BILL RORISH, 50 years old and able to flutter much younger pulses.  
	He is able and experienced -- a reporter who has become a 
	journalistic king.

				BILL
			(on monitor, smiling)
		Bill Rorish...Thank you...Good night.

				JENNIFER
		Look at that smile.  Oh, that was
		good and oh my, Bill smiled -- he
		liked it.

				AARON
		He loved it.  Big smile.

	He gives Jane a congratulatory sock in the shoulder which she
	returns -- Tom in the b.g. of the SHOT.

				BLAIR
		I haven't seen Bill smile like that
		in weeks.

	Ernie has walked a few steps to the office.

				BLAIR
		Ernie, you missed his close... He smiled.
			(mimicking)
		Thank you...Good night.

	She smiles.

				ERNIE
		I saw the smile -- good piece.

				AARON
		I'm gonna go look at it again.

	They leave -- Aaron waving to Tom who stands in the b.g.  The
	others leave.  Tom approaches Jane.

				TOM
		I'm sorry if I was in the way.  It
		was totally impressive.  Great piece.

				JANE
			(somewhat formal)
		You weren't.  Thanks.  How does it
		feel being here?

				TOM
		I can't believe I'm really here.  No
		kidding.  If you're through work now --

				JANE
		No.  Aaron and I go to Central America
		on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.

				TOM
		I thought you were incredible in there.
		I know how much I have to learn.  I'd
		really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...

				JANE
		'Really a lot appreciate it...'

				TOM
		You  make me nervous.  Anyway if I
		can pick your brain --

	Jane grimaces at "pick your brain."

				JANE
		I can't help you, sorry.  I'm not
		here to teach remedial reporting.

				TOM
		And it has nothing to do with the fact
		I left your room instead of staying 
		there?

	Jane looks at him.

				JANE
		Oh, please.
			(then, almost gently)
		You're gonna have to understand
		something.  This isn't personal.

	She exits.

	EXT. CENTRAL AMERICAN JUNGLE - MORNING

	As Aaron, Jane and their CREW march along with a CONTRA SQUAD deep
	in their own conversation.  Except for the DIN of TROPICAL BIRDS
	they seem almost like a cranky married couple on their way to work.

				AARON
		I didn't sleep.  They're giving me less
		and less air time.  They don't think
		I'm at all anchor material.

				JANE
		If we don't get to their camp soon,
		we won't be able to tape the supplies
		coming in.

				AARON
		Last time Paul was sick they gave
		Connie the weekend news instead of me.

				JANE
		You spend too much time -- much too
		much worrying about that crap...
			(suddenly reacting)
		Oh good.

	They have entered a clearing where supplies have been dropped,
	the Guerrillas already tearing apart boxes with army boots
	inside.

	ANGLE ON

	A guerrilla soldier rubbing his shoeless foot.  A pair of new boots 
	sit alongside him.  Jane's Cameraman prepares to shoot, saying in 
	Spanish, then English:

				CAMERAMAN
		Put on the boot.

	Jane rushes into the scene incensed.

				JANE
		Stop!  We are not here to stage the news.
		Wait and see what he does.

	Then to the totally confused soldier.

				JANE (cont'd)
		Sir, you do whatever you want.  It's
		your choice.

	By now there is a fair-sized cluster of armed men as well as
	the news team staring at the guerrilla, who is at loss as to
	what is expected.  He looks to Jane, who can offer no help
	save her own determination not to interfere.  Finally he puts
	on the boot.

				JANE
			(to Cameraman)
		Okay.

	He shoots the scene.

	INT. HAY ADAMS HOTEL

	Tom, in shirt and tie, is on the phone.  This is a big day.

				TOM
		Okay, I'll meet the crew there then.
		Could you give me that address again?
		Great.  Yes, it's good to finally be
		getting to work.  Okay that's
		17204?  1-7-2-0-4.  Thanks.

	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

	As Tom gets directions from the CONCIERGE.

				CONCIERGE
		It's only ten minutes if you prefer
		to walk...
			(as he walks away)
		I'll look for you on the news tonight.

	EXT. HOTEL - DAY

	Tom has a real sense of the moment -- of having arrived.  The
	strange bubble of pleasure rises to the surface as he walks off
	to cover his first story.  He laughs out loud, loving his lot.

	EXT. CENTRAL AMERICAN JUNGLE - LATER AFTERNOON

	Jane in the f.g. with her crew while Aaron talks in rapid Spanish
	to the GUERRILLA LEADERS.

				AARON (in Spanish)
		Are you guys kidding or do you really
		think you'll run into something...?
		I mean, do you feel that every time
		and it never happens?  Or is it the
		first time it felt that way and it's
		going to happen?... I mean, how bad
		can it be?... Are you nervous...?
		What's the chances on a scale of one
		to ten -- that we're going to be in
		a war within the next few hours?...
		Really?

	He starts to walk towards Jane -- one of the men he was
	talking with calling after him with an added thought.

				AARON
		Thanks, you speak English very well
		too.
			(to Jane)
		Great news.  He says they've been
		engaging the Sandinistas pretty
		regularly and that he'd be really
		surprised if we didn't take fire 
		tonight.

	Jane reacts -- a flash of exhilaration.  Aaron is amazed at her
	attitude.

				AARON
		Look at her.
			(to Jane)
		If anything happens to me tell every
		woman I've ever dated I was talking
		about them at the end.  That way they'll
		have to reevaluate me.

	Jane laughs out loud, attracting the Guerrillas' attention.
	Aaron repeats his speech in Spanish.  The Guerrillas laugh.

	EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

	Aaron and Jane in line behind the Guerrillas.  They HEAR A SHOT.
	The head of the patrol gestures -- deploying his men.  Aaron
	grabs Jane and heads for some cover to the left.  As they run --
	more SHOTS.  Jane in work mode.  As soon as they settle.

				JANE
		Let's tape.

				CAMERAMAN
			(Spanish accent)
		Much too dark.  Black.

				JANE
		That's okay.

	ON AARON BARELY DISCERNIBLE

	As they start taping he is breathless with the nervousness of
	the nearly gunfire.

				AARON
		The first shots were fired not thirty
		seconds ago.  The Contras feel they
		must be outnumbered this is so small
		a unit:  that's a given.  Still they
		hold their ground despite the fact
		that their weapons have been acting
		up -- misfiring or jamming.  A new
		shipment of rifles is expected tomorrow --
		all they got today were the shoes.

	There is the SOUND OF GUNFIRE.

				JANE
			(to Cameraman)
		Okay.
			(to Aaron)
		Great line at the end.

				AARON
		Did you shoot their boots?

				JANE
		Of course.

				AARON
		We can cut back at the end.

				JANE
		To the pan of the supplies boxes --

				AARON
		Can you believe it?  I just risked my
		life for a network that tests my face
		with focus groups.

	EXT. GOVERNMENT BLDG - AFTERNOON

	Tom, squashed in amidst a small mob of reporters... behind a
	police line.  He HEARS a reporter next to him say:

				REPORTER
		I think he's coming out now.

				TOM
			(to his crew)
		They say he's coming out now.

	A surge.

				TOM
			(to Reporter)
		Is that him?

				TOM'S CAMERAMAN
		Yes.

	Tom checks his notes.


	INSERT - TOM'S BLACK BOOK

	The same model we've seen Jane use.  A list of questions
	written in big color highlighted letters.  As he looks down
	to study them, everyone else moves suddenly off.

	TOM'S P.O.V.

	The mass of journalists and technicians shouting questions.
	"Will you dispatch troops?" after the Ambassador they've been
	awaiting -- clumping on his limo and then being shaken by the
	movement of the vehicle.

	ON TOM

	Standing alone and forlorn as his crew trots back.

				CAMERAMAN
			(observing Tom)
		What's wrong?

				TOM
		I had a lot of questions here.  I
		missed the story.

				CAMERAMAN
		Don't worry, it's okay.  I got
		a piece of his face.

	EXT. GUERRILLAS CAMP - MORNING

	Jane is standing -- talking to her crew.  Others asleep
	in b.g. -- a drowsy, morning-after feeling.

				JANE
		Are you all packed and ready?

				CAMERAMAN
		The stuff in the dark is not good.
		Nobody wants news lit like that.

				JANE
		Will you just get packed?

	She waves him off -- then she walks several yards away, holding
	a knapsack in her hand.  She takes off a brush and runs it
	through her hair -- opens a plastic case and takes out a travel
	toothbrush, brushes her teeth and rinses her mouth with water
	from her canteen.  She puts everything back in place, then looks
	about, sobs for several beats.  One of the Guerrillas hears her
	sobbing and enters the scene -- he stands a respectful distance
	away.  Jane finishes, notices him, makes a face by way of
	explanation, and exits the scene feeling measurably better.

	INT. WASHINGTON CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	The Washington Control Room.  Jennifer, Jane, Aaron, Blair stand
	watching the intro to the Central American piece.  Tom stands in
	the distant b.g.  There are over a dozen monitors -- including
	one which is constantly on the anchor man, Bill Rorish.

	ON TELEVISION MONITORS

	Bill Rorish on camera -- an INSERT behind showing Aaron in
	blackness planted into a Central American map bordered by rifles.
	A separate monitor shows the INSERT alone.

				BILL (voice over)
		A fire fight along the Nicaraguan
		border...in one minute.

	The INSERT MOVES OUT AT US TO FILL THE SCREEN -- WE SEE Aaron's
	dim outline and HEAR him say:

				AARON (voice over; on camera)
		The first shots were fired not thirty
		seconds ago.

	The MUSICAL "EVENING NEWS" SIGNATURE COMES IN ever-so-briefly.
	The SCREEN GOES TO A COMMERCIAL -- as Blair screams
	enthusiastically.

				BLAIR
		Great graphic, great graphic.

	Ernie ENTERS THE  SCENE... He kisses Jane in greeting -- pats
	Aaron on the back.

				ERNIE
		You finally got a piece in a few
		minutes early and I hear Bill loved it.

	Jennifer gives Jane a mock pat on the back.

				ERNIE (continuing)
		I have somebody downstairs who one of
		the clerks brought in and vouches for.
		He says he has something to say about
		gays getting promotions at State...
		It can't hurt to tape him.

	ON JANE

	As she feels Tom staring at her -- turns and notices him
	for the first time.

				TOM
		Hi.

				JANE
		How's it going?

				TOM
		Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?

				JANE
			(thrown)
		I just got back -- I don't know
		which end is up.

				TOM
		Okay.

	In the b.g. WE MAY HAVE NOTICED Bill Rorish on one monitor as he
	picks up the phone at his anchor desk, during the commercial
	break.

				BLAIR
		Jane!  Bill Rorish wants to speak
		to you at the break.
			(as she hands it to her)
		I never heard of him handing over
		compliments in the middle of the
		show.

	There is a stillness in the Control Room as Jane speaks to the
	anchor man in New York who WE CAN VIEW on a monitor.

	ON MONITOR

	We see Bill Rorish.

				BILL
			(into phone)
		Jane?

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Yes.

				BILL
			(into phone)
		Well, darling, if it gets any better than
		that, I'm going to have to bring you up
		here to New York.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Thanks.  I just wish you'd kept the first
		twenty seconds.

	Blair cringes at Jane's blunt reply.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		But thanks.

				BILL
			(over phone)
		Well, the visual with the boots at the
		end was just perfect.

	Jane covers the mouthpiece and turns to Aaron.

				JANE
		God, he loved the boots.

	Aaron reaches happily for the phone.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Aaron should be hearing this so I
		have an extra witness.

				BILL
			(over phone)
		Well, you always want to give the 
		credit away, do you?

				JANE
			(into phone)
		No, I don't.  He happens to deserve
		the credit.  He's right here.

				BILL
			(over phone)
		I'll speak to you soon

	We see Rorish over the monitor.  He hangs up.

				JANE
			(to Aaron)
		He had to read over some new copy.

	We see on the monitor that this is not so.  It's a very eggy moment
	Aaron.  Tom breaks the silence.

				TOM
			(to the rescue)
		Okay if I watch you tape that interview
		downstairs?

				AARON
		Yeah.

	As he passes Jane he leans next to her and WE HEAR him WHISPER.

				AARON
		Please laugh so they think I'm not
		dying inside but have so much style
		I just said something funny.

	Jane does her part enormously well -- laughing with amusement...
	but her eyes blaze -- her friend has been needlessly humiliated.
	Blair wants desperately to be inside Aaron's joke.

				BLAIR
		What did he say?

				JANE
			(as if still amused)
		I'll never tell.

	INT. SMALL TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT

	BUDDY FELTON waits alone.  A CAMERA CREW watches him.  He is
	well dressed, exceedingly nervous.  He summons the courage to
	ask a question.

				BUDDY
		Could I see how I photograph?

				CAMERAWOMAN
		Huh?  Sorry?

				BUDDY
		'Cause for the interview they're
		going to use a screen and disguise
		me to protect my anonymity so could
		I see myself before that?

				CAMERAWOMAN
		Sure.

	The Camerawoman punches a button and immediately Buddy's image
	comes up on a standing monitor on the studio floor.  He's not
	happy with the image -- but works at concealing his reaction --
	gasping a bit of air -- trying to touch it.  Aaron enters.
	Tom smiles a friendly smile which flusters Buddy momentarily.
	But again he almost manages to conceal his private rush.  Buddy's
	internal drama is such he invariably finds himself covering up,
	fearful roomfuls of people will simultaneously guess his
	thoughts.

	Aaron directs him behind a screen and looks at his notes.

				AARON
		It's Mr. Buddy Felton?

				BUDDY
		Yes.

				AARON
		That's your full name?

				BUDDY
		Yes.

				AARON
		I might as well ask you the questions
		on tape.  Is that all right?

				BUDDY
		Yes.

				AARON
		You worked at one time as 
		Foreign Service Trainee in the
		State Department.

				BUDDY
		I was there two years and was promoted
		on merit nine times.

				AARON
		Eventually rising to...

				BUDDY
		Office Bimbo. 
			(curbing his amusement) 
		No, I'm sorry.

	Aaron is having a hard enough day,  He is visibly annoyed.

				AARON
		You're saying the fact that you're
		gay had something directly to do with
		your promotions?

				AARON
		Eventually rising to?

				BUDDY

		G.S.  I don't know.
			(scratches his head)
		I don't know numbers.

	Tom laughs.  Aaron shoots him a look.

				AARON
		You're saying the fact that you're gay had
		something directly to do with your promotions?

				BUDDY
		I don't like the word gay.

				AARON
		Which would you prefer?

				BUDDY
		Ravenous homosexual.

				AARON
		Stop the tape, okay.  Forget it,
		Ellen.  Let's call security and
		get him out.

	As Aaron walks out -- Tom is momentarily fixed on the sight of Buddy
	walking in small circles giving himself a talking to.

				BUDDY
			(self flagellating)
		Great time to act out, Buddy.  You
		won't be happy until you turn the
		whole world off.

	He notices Tom.

				BUDDY
		They're not really going to call
		security are they?

				TOM
		No, I don't think so.

				BUDDY
		How do I get out of here?

				TOM
		Follow me.

				BUDDY
			(dazzled)
		You talked me into it.

	INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	Tom distracted -- his day has been a bit of a bummer.  Buddy
	self conscious -- the proximity creating an almost unbearable
	tension of romance and adventure.

	INT. BUILDING LOBBY - NIGHT

	A Guard on duty -- a BLACK WOMAN.  She sees Buddy.

				GUARD
		Oh, you're the gay guy.  I was just
		coming to find you.

				BUDDY
		I'm leaving.

				TOM
			(to Guard)
		It's okay.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	Walking.  Buddy in step with him.

				BUDDY
		Sir?

	Tom turns.  Buddy talks rather quickly -- He cares very much
	about leaving Tom with the right impression.  The last words
	of his speech he hadn't expected to say.

				BUDDY (cont'd)
		Thank you for not shunning me and
		all.
			(more)
		I really did have all that information
		but I thought I might just be being
		vindictive to get a little hunk of
		the ol' spotlight.  I know, horrible --
		but I didn't do it, so okay?  And
		thanks again and would you like to
		have a drink -- at a regular bar?

				TOM
		Oh, sure.  Okay.

	His heart racing, Buddy attempts casual matter-of-factness.

				BUDDY
		Is there a regular bar around here?

	INT./ENT. REGULAR BAR - NIGHT

	Tom and Buddy on adjoining stools.  For Tom, the last weeks have
	been humbling, antagonistic.  He's enjoying Buddy who listens
	attentively and wholeheartedly endorses every word Tom speaks.

				TOM
		I've been doing some morning show
		stuff, but mostly radio -- that doesn't
		bother me.  I'm in no rush for
		anything.  It's just the snotty
		attitude, even if I have it coming,
		it's still...

				BUDDY
		Bad manners.

				TOM
		Yes.  That's right.

				BUDDY
		I know...I mean you didn't do anything
		special for me tonight.  You just had
		what I think are good manners, decency.
		And it really makes me want to be nice
		back and it has nothing to do with any
		homosexual thing.
			(looks right at him)
		Honestly.
			(then away)
		Because I don't know if you've
		homosexual or not and -- you're not,
		are you?

				TOM
		No...no.

				BUDDY
		One's enough.

	Tom signals for the check.

				BUDDY (cont'd)
		I wasn't doing anything.

				TOM
		I really have to go.

				BUDDY
		Okay.  At least let me show my
		appreciation.  The Secretary of Labor
		is going to be indicted on Wednesday.
		For the graft thing he supposedly did
		before he was appointed.

				TOM
		What?

				BUDDY
		Yes, it's true.  They're going to
		make it public Wednesday but isn't
		it a big deal for you to have it a
		day and a half early?

				TOM
		Yes.  How do you know?

				BUDDY
			(shrugs)
		My roommate's very social -- somebody
		from Justice was over and...I always
		hear things before they happen.  Hey,
		and from now on, so do you.

	INT. ERNIE'S OFFICE - DAY

	George Weln, the black correspondent and Tom are seated in the
	office with Ernie -- they are in mid-meeting.

				GEORGE
		I'm virtually certain it's not true.
		He may be indicted eventually, but I
		don't think it will be this month.

				ERNIE
			(to Tom)
		You want to be alone with me --
		tell me your source?

				TOM
		If I told you I'm not sure it would 
		totally convince you, but I totally 
		believe the guy.

				GEORGE
			(insufferable)
		Labor is my Department -- I can't
		conform it and my contacts go very
		deep.

				TOM
		So if it's true -- I'm terrific,
		right?

				ERNIE
		It's not even a close call.  Of
		course we can't go with it.

	INT. EDITING ROOM - FOLLOWING DAY

	Jane is working with Bobbie the editor... Snatches of the tape
	make it obvious that the Labor Secretary has been indicted --
	George Weln stands behind Jane, who is dialing a number.

				BOBBIE
		Do you want him all the way to the 
		car?

				JANE
		No stop where he's all besieged.

				BOBBIE
		Because...

				JANE
			(to Bobbie)
		Right there, Bobbie.

	Tom enters.

				TOM
		So he was indicted?

				JANE
		Yes.

				GEORGE
		We were right not to go with it.

				TOM
		But I was right -- just somebody give
		it to me.  I had a good story.

				JANE
			(to George)
		Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.

				TOM
		Ah, I don't want any credit.  Bobbie
		and I serve anonymously.

	He pats Bobbie on the back... and exits.

				BOBBIE
			(pausing in his work)
		You know, I like Tom, because hi...

				JANE
		Bobbie, please.

	INT. METRO BUS - DAY

	Crowded rush hour... Buddy and Tom stand next to each other.

				BUDDY
		...and the White House is hoping to
		keep a lid on it for a few days till
		they figure out what to do.

				TOM
		Thanks a lot, Buddy.

				BUDDY
			(brushing it off)
		Oh, please.  So they were really
		impressed with you at work.

				TOM
		Not impressed exactly -- but a break
		in the clouds.

				BUDDY
		I see the change in you -- I see it.

	INT. WHITE HOUSE PRESS ROOM - DAY

	The 10 A.M. briefing just breaking up -- Jennifer leaves her
	network seat in the front row, only to be grabbed by Tom who
	steers her outside.

	EXT. WHITE HOUSE EAST WING - DAY

	In the near distance a circular driveway and a silent armed
	MARINE GUARD, standing at attention.

				TOM
			(to Jennifer)
		So he bought this Peugeot sedan at
		a greatly reduced price while he was
		there in charge of the White House
		Advance Team.

				JENNIFER
		How come you're not chasing it down
		yourself?

				TOM
		Look, I'm junior man -- and it's
		your beat.

				JENNIFER
		Boy, that's nice...I wish we could
		all deal with each other like this.
		I'll check it.  Anything I can do
		for you?

				TOM
		This is my first time at the White House.
		Is there any chance to look at where
		he works and the rest of it?

				JENNIFER
		I didn't have the guts to ask when
		I first came up.  I'll get you a
		great tour.

	INT. BAR - EARLY EVENING

	Buddy and Tom watching the Evening News as Jennifer finishes
	her story.

				JENNIFER
			(voice over; on TV set)
		The President says it's not a violation
		but nonetheless White House sources
		say the full price will be paid for the
		Peugeot and new rules will put future
		bargain hunting off limits for
		Presidential Aides.  This is Jennifer Mack
		at the White House.

	Tom and Buddy smile at each other... energized -- up.

				BUDDY
		Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating
		being a news source.

				TOM
		Nobody else had it.

				BUDDY
		I wish it were you giving the story.

				TOM
		That's okay.

				BUDDY
		What if we just don't tell them
		anything anymore unless they let
		you do the story?

				TOM
		No.  Really...don't worry about it.

				BUDDY
		Okay.  And look, in the future I can
		call you when I have news for you.
		Don't feel you have to spend time
		with me just to get the information.
			(a breath; then
			 to himself)
		Well, that wasn't as hard to say as
		you thought, was it, Buddy?

				TOM
		What do you mean?  You're one of the
		few people in this town I can talk
		to.

	Buddy puts his hand to his heart and makes a LOUD SOUND OF
	RAPTURE.

				BUDDY
		Hoooo.

	The BARTENDER and some nearby patrons turn and look.  Tom shifts
	with discomfort.

				TOM
		Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore.

				BUDDY
			(simply)
		Okay.

	INT. WASHINGTON BUREAU - NIGHT

	Jane waiting for an elevator... It comes and she steps on just
	as Tom clearly excited comes around the bend from Ernie's office
	calling for her.  He goes to the stairs.

	INT. WALKWAY - NIGHT

	He runs out and sees Jane in the lobby below, then takes off
	after her.

	INT. LOBBY - NIGHT

	As he enters and runs outside, looking in both directions then
	running off to the right.  A BEAT -- REVEALING Jane has stopped
	to talk with Blair -- now she exits.

	EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - NIGHT

	Tom on the street, ahead of her, thinking he's behind her...
	He runs another half a block and stops dejected... Turns to walk
	back to the office.  He keeps looking back to see if he missed
	her, so that his head is turned as Jane reaches him, says a
	fairly social:

				JANE
		Hi, how are you?

	She keeps moving -- Tom spinning after her.

				TOM
		Wait -- I need you.

	She stops.

				TOM
		I've got another story.

				JANE
		Some public official skipped a week
		on his Christmas Club?

				TOM
		The House Armed Service Committee
		has a secret report which says that
		the General Stillwell tank the Army
		has dumped a fortune into plain 
		won't work.  I have it cold,
		confirmed.  They have five million
		dollars in this thing already.

				JANE
		Billion.

				TOM
		Okay, billion...right, of course.
		They told me I could have any producer
		I wanted -- and I want you.

	As Tom savors the moment.

	INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - EVENING

	Various bureau personnel standing at their desks watching Tom's
	piece being broadcast.  We SEE a TANK MISFIRING.

				TOM
			(voice over)
		One source referred to it as a
		five billion dollar metal sculpture
		to ugly to look at and too big to bury.

				AARON
			(to Jane)
		You write this?

				JANE
		I write for you sometimes.

				AARON
		Not because you have to.

	ON MONITOR

	We SEE a General walking away from Tom.

				TOM
			(voice over)
		General Elton McGuire is in charge of
		the weapon system.

	ON MONITOR - TWO SHOT

				GENERAL
		I've been in the Army twenty-seven
		years -- so I'll let the Army ask
		the questions, not you.

				TOM
		General, I don't want to bother you
		anymore or your family.  But tomorrow
		there will be a mob of me back here --
		so, if you have anything to say, why
		not say it now, sir, the way you want?

	ON TOM

	He is a study.

	Looking at himself -- and though it's far from his first time on
	television -- it's the first time he's seen himself doing serious
	work and, by all appearances, doing it well.  As the General
	answers in the b.g. --

				BLAIR
		I think it's great of us to have left
		in what you said -- just great of us.

	Tom smiles modestly.

				AARON
		Yeah, let's never forget.  We're
		the real story.  Not them.

	Tom and Jane look over -- then Tom looks to Jane for a verdict.
	In the b.g., the news goes to a commercial.

				JANE
		Yeah, I know, I went back and forth
		on it.

				BLAIR
		I liked it.  He's not afraid to be
		human.

	Ernie ENTERS THE SCENE with his fourteen-year-old DAUGHTER
	in tow... He approaches Tom.

				ERNIE
		My youngest wanted to meet you.
		This is Ellie.

				TOM
		Hi, Ellie.

				ERNIE
		You should be honored -- she
		never cares about meeting
		anyone here.  But she liked you
		on television just now.

				AARON
			(entering scene)
		Hi, Ellie -- remember me?

				ELLIE
		I'm sorry -- from where?

				AARON
		I've been to your house a lot...

				ERNIE
			(helping)
		And Aaron went on that fourteen
		day raft trip with us last year.

				ELLIE
			(vaguely)
		Oh yes -- hi.

	INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT (LATE)

	Tom is on the phone.

				TOM
			(into phone)
		Hi, Dad...Did you see it?  Great --
		I'll send you a tape...I'm sorry I
		haven't called.  Things were a little
		bumpy for a while.  It's not important...
		I'm fine now.
			(what he's been
			 wanting to say aloud)
		Hey, Dad -- I just may be able to
		do this job...Well, I'm glad you
		were sure.

	INT. ERNIE MARRIMAN'S VIRGINIA HOME - DAY

	Ernie is hosting the news staff for Sunday brunch -- they stand
	around drinking in small groups... Aaron is standing with Blair
	and a MAN in his fifties we have not seen before.

				BLAIR
		I don't know why we have to feel
		defensive about it.  Newspapers
		are in business to make money --
		why not us?

	Aaron looks at her in amazement.

				BLAIR
		They criticize us for supposedly
		pandering while they run WINGO
		Games.

				GREY HAIRED MAN
			(amused)
		Exactly right.  Excuse me.  I'm
		paid to mix.

	Blair and Aaron laugh appreciatively as he walks off to another
	group.

				BLAIR
		Goodbye, Paul.

				AARON
		Take care, Paul.
			(back to Blair)
		It takes a certain kind of courage
		for you to say that in front of
		the President of the News Division.

				BLAIR
		You think anyone who's proud of
		the work we do is an ass kisser.

				AARON
		No.  I think anyone who puckers their
		lips and presses it against his boss'
		buttocks and then smooches is an ass
		kisser.

				BLAIR
		My gosh, and for a while there, I was
		attracted to you.

	She walks off.

				AARON
		Wait a minute -- that changes
		everything.

	ON JANE

	At the bar getting a drink.

	Jennifer ENTERS THE SCENE... and leads Jane down the hall until
	they are standing alone.

				JENNIFER
		This is very awkward.

				JANE
		Go ahead -- what?

				JENNIFER
		Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but
		I see Tom around you a lot and this
		is such a small office and I'd like
		to see him outside of work, unless
		there's some reason for you to mind...
		in which case I just won't do anything.

				JANE
		God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind?
		Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What
		a shock -- I don't have a right to...
		I don't think I like him.  I know
		I don't respect him...So what am
		I talking about -- what am I saying
		to you?

				JENNIFER
		You're saying stay away from him.

				JANE
			(stupefied)
		I can't be.

	She blinks in wonder.

				JENNIFER
		We don't have to settle this
		definitively right now.

	Jennifer moves toward the drinking table -- Jane, unsteadied
	by the dose of self-revelation, moves towards Aaron's circle
	and scratches his back in friendship... Tom approaches an she
	moves off -- not wanting to deal with him.  She takes a few
	breaths as she keeps walking.  We HEAR snatches of PARTY
	CONVERSATIONS, i.e:

				GEORGE WELN
		Tell me one person who ever left
		television news to work on a
		newspaper.

	She moves on; Tom still following.

				ERNIE'S WIFE
			(holding Paul's arm)
		I felt so proud when he turned
		down News Vice President so we
		could stay here.  Suddenly, after
		all these years, we have a life.

	Jane turns -- sees that Tom is still looking at her from a few
	feet away.

				JANE
			(badly)
		Hi, Tom.

	She stands there, genuinely frightened.  She must deal with him
	now.  He crosses to her.

				TOM
		It's the firs time I've seen 
		you dressed like this.  You look
		so clean and pretty.

				JANE
		What do you mean clean?

				TOM
		At work there's always this
		sort of film over you.

				JANE
		Well, thumps like me leave appearance
		to guys like you.

				TOM
		You're great at taking the edge
		off a good time.

	Jane starts twitching.  She pauses -- holds a hand lightly on
	his arm to steady herself.

				TOM
		You okay?

				JANE
		Yes.  Just don't say anything mean
		for a while.  Thanks.

	She meets his gaze for an instant -- and, in that instant, loses
	control for the first time in her memory.  She looks strange as
	she retreats from this glimpse of upheaval.

				JANE
		I've got to find someone.  It's
		important.  Excuse me.

	She walks away.

	ON AARON AND ERNIE

				ERNIE
		I had the strangest thing happen
		yesterday.  Anne and I have been
		married what? -- Thirty-six years...
		Everything fine -- two days after the
		promotion came through, I was checking
		myself in the mirror and she was
		making a face at me behind my back.
		So yesterday I looked in the mirror
		and she was doing it again.

				AARON
		You didn't say anything to her?

	He shakes his head.

				ERNIE
		My instincts tell me not to.

	Annie comes up.

				ANNE
		The office is phoning, honey.

	He EXITS SCENE as Anne watches him go.

				ANNE
		I hope he moves that fast when
		it's me on the line.

	ON JANE

	As she passes a chair with an afghan shawl on the back -- she
	picks it up and wraps it around herself, a bit chilled.  She
	sees Jennifer on the stairs and moves toward her calling in a
	too loud, anxiety-ridden voice as she goes.

				JANE
		Jennifer.  Hey, Jennifer.

	ON STAIRCASE

	Jennifer turning as Jane whips up the stairs.

				JANE
		Forget what I said -- you do
		whatever you want to with him.

	She pushes at Jennifer a little.

				JENNIFER
		Well, there's nothing I'm going
		to do right this second.

	Jane pushes her again.

				JENNIFER
		But it's a party, right?

	Jane smiles back feigning female bonding -- Jennifer goes back
	down the steps and crosses to Tom.

	FULL SCENE

	Aaron takes in Jane, who is taking in Jennifer and Tom -- then
	Aaron begins to sense a new dynamic in the room as Ernie re-enters
	and huddles briefly with Paul... The News President is intent...
	The two of them walk over to Tom and Jennifer.  We PICK UP just
	a few words:

				ERNIE
		This would be a good time to tap
		that source of yours.  He could
		have an angle or something.

	AARON'S P.O.V.

	Tom is startled but cool -- nods his head -- Jennifer is amazed
	looking at Tom with new and even prettier eyes... Paul and Ernie
	now move toward Jane, a whole flow of movement creating a new
	energy in the area.  Jane sheds her Afghan as she rises to meet
	them.

				ERNIE
			(to Jane)
		We want you to exec produce a
		Special Report...

				JANE
		What?

	Aaron has come over to join them now in time to HEAR.

				ERNIE
		A Libyan plane shot up one of our
		bases in Egypt.  It's all still
		happening.

				JANE
		Let's figure out the field.

				ERNIE
		Unfortunately, since Paul's here,
		he's made out the assignments...
		Jennifer at the White House...
		George at the Pentagon...Martin
		at State...and we need an anchor
		since Rorish is in his boat, so we're
		gonna do the whole report this
		afternoon from here...with Tom.

				AARON
		That's it.  I resign as of now.

				ERNIE
			(to Aaron)
		Stop it.

				AARON
		I'll tell you what.  I'll stay if
		Tom knows how to spell Gaddafi.

				JANE
		Ernie, as much as I like you, I
		think I have to tell Paul what I
		think, because this is really sort
		of obscenely stupid.

				ERNIE
		Jane, if you want to, go ahead.  I
		don't disagree with you.

	Jane moves quickly off, awed at the prospect of taking on the
	big boss.

	ON JANE

	As she moves past Tom who is talking on the phone, eventually
	catching up with Paul.  In the b.g. Tom has just HEARD the
	"BEEP" of an ANSWERING MACHINE.

				TOM
		Hello, Buddy.  It's 1:35 -- and
		this is Tom.  You can reach me
		at the office.  It's important.
		I can use a little help.

	Jane, because of the proximity to Tom is speaking in whispered
	intensity.

				JANE
		Tom isn't ready for the job
		you're about to hand him.  Not
		near ready.  Not by the longest
		shot.  Aaron's spent six weeks
		in Tripoli, he's interviewed
		Gaddafi -- he reported on the
		Eight-one story.  I think he's
		essential to do the job we're
		capable of and I think it's my
		responsibility to tell you that.

				PAUL
		Okay, that's your opinion.  I
		don't agree.

				JANE
		It's not opinion.

				PAUL
		You're just absolutely right
		and I'm absolutely wrong?

	She nods.

				PAUL
		It must be nice to always believe
		you know better.  To think you're
		always the smartest person in the
		room.

				JANE
			(from her depths)
		No, it's awful.  Oh my, it's awful.

				JANE
			(turning to leave)
		We'd better get moving.

	As they move out... Jane goes to Aaron... He moves with her
	towards the door.

				AARON
		What happened?

				JANE
		I'll tell you later -- where
		you going to watch from?

				AARON
		Watch? --

				JANE
		I'll come by your place, right
		after...drink, take pills...
		Love you.

	She runs out the door.  Aaron turns mean and mocks Jane's
	last words -- screwing up his face in a savage burlesque.

				AARON
		Yeah, love you, too.

	EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY

	As Jane briefly pauses to see which war has room.  Tom opens
	the passenger seat of his car -- she gets in.  It moves off.

	INT. TOM'S CAR - DAY

	As it moves off.

				JANE
		Nervous?

				TOM
		Excited.

	Jane looks over at him -- there's no question he's just told
	the truth.

	INT. TOM'S OFFICE - DAY

	In the b.g. we SEE the Bureau Newsroom beginning to pulse with
	activity.  Tom closes the door.  He sits down behind his desk
	and opens a bottom drawer -- a clean whit shirt lies there.
	He opens the center drawer -- two ties are inside.  He picks
	one.  He reaches for a package of new red suspenders.  He takes
	off the shirt and puts on the new one -- all of this the work
	of an expert craftsman.  By the time he finishes he looks like
	the authority figure we know he's now.

	INT. BUREAU NEWSROOM - JANE AND BLAIR

	Jane is NOT hyper.  She is purposeful -- organized -- even
	calming Blair with a little physical contact -- a touch on
	the arm, to still her colleague's hysterical demons.

				JANE
		Tell George and Jessica to try
		and cover everything without
		Tom having to ask additional
		questions.

				BLAIR
		And Bobbie says...

				JANE
		Did you hear what I just said --
		do you have that?  Take a breath.

				BLAIR
			(a breath, then)
		Yes.

	In the b.g. Tom has exited his office and looks about --
	waiting for some indication as to what to do next.

				JANE
		And the most important thing
		make sure his earpiece works,
		have back-ups ready.  That's
		never been more vital.  He
		must be able to hear me at
		every second and clearly.

	Jane sees him.  She moves across the room -- takes Tom by the
	arm.

				JANE
		We have twenty minutes -- you can
		wait in the studio.

	Tom coughs nervously into his hand and takes a pen from a
	nearby desk, clips it into his inside pocket and walks off.

	GRAPHICS ROOM - DAY

	Jane is screening and asking corrections in a graphic
	representation of an F-14 shooting down a Libyan Air Force
	Mirage Fighter.

				JANE
		Put in the radar plane that spotted
		them to begin with.

				GRAPHIC ARTIST
		We have no pictures on file.

				JANE
		I can't draw -- but this is a
		rough idea.

	She uses the stylus from the ELECTRONIC PAINT MACHINE to outline
	an American Air Force E-2C Hawkeyes Radar Plane.  Her work is
	stunning.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - DAY

	He has a glass in hand -- some chips on the table with a
	bottle of wine as he selects a Cassette Desk to play.  He picks
	a French song -- looks at some of his books.  He might even
	read.  He is feigning disinterest for an audience of no one.
	He SINGS ALONG with the RECORD in perfect French.

	INT. STUDIO HALLWAY - DAY

	Tom checking copy in the long hallway leading to the studio --
	there is the merest of hubbubs causing him to look up.  Buddy
	is being stopped at the other end of the hallway.

	ON BUDDY AND SECURITY GUARD

				GUARD
		I have to check first.

				BUDDY
			(a bit frantic)
		Well, then check -- but hurry --
		There he is!!!

	Buddy runs the length of the hallway to Tom's aide despite Tom's
	gestures to slow down.

				BUDDY
		Is everything all right?

				TOM
		Yes.  You didn't have to come here.
		It's just that I'm going to anchor
		this special report on this Libyan
		thing...

				BUDDY
			(delighted)
		Anchor?

				TOM
			(amused despite
			 situation)
		Yes, stop!  I wondered if you could
		find out anything about what's
		happening.
			(on Buddy's reaction)
		What's wrong?

				BUDDY
		I broke up with my roommate --
		He was really the magnet for
		everyone who knew anything.

				TOM
		Oh.

				BUDDY
		Look, I can start up with him again
		if you really...

				TOM
		No.  I'm doing fine...Look.

	Tom stands there -- a man at home in this media castle.

				BUDDY
		Good.  He's on the world's longest
		ego trip, let him take it alone.

				TOM
		Hey, okay.  Look Buddy -- I've 
		got to go to work.

				BUDDY
			(to Tom)
		...good-bye then.

				TOM
		I'll speak to you.

				BUDDY
		Well, who knows.  Just let m tell
		you what my favorite teacher ever,
		told me -- 'Don't be afraid to be
		wonderful.'

	He leans forward, gives Tom a quick embrace, a small kiss on
	the cheek.  Tom turns and walks off down the hallway to meet
	his immediate destiny as Buddy looks on.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

	Jane mounts some steps in the control room -- she moves past
	the DIRECTOR and TECHNICAL CREW up to the next level where the
	two news execs, Ernie and Paul stand with their backs to the
	wall, and then up one more step slightly above the desk and
	table occupied by Blair.  Now she slips into the large well
	paddled throne-like seat -- as WE BEGIN MUSIC CUE.

	Literally at her fingertips is the row of buttons which provide
	immediate access to the field reporters at the Pentagon, State
	and the White House.  In front of her the bank of monitors, the
	Technical Team and past them the studio where Tom is seated at
	Anchor, a FLOOR PRODUCER and WRITER feeding him copy.

	ANGLE FAVORING BLAIR

	As she looks at Jane, poised to control the complicated apparatus
	of minds and machines comprising the big time network news.
	And Jane Craig is at the helm.  Blair experiences a flash of 
	emotion which transcends envy and verbalizes it.

				BLAIR
			(sotto to Jane)
		Executive Producer -- wow.

	Jane looks at her and, in a moment of atypical merriment, does
	a choking gesture at her own throat as the monitors flash a
	graphic reading:  SPECIAL REPORT... We HEAR an ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
	say, "This is a Special Report from..."

	INSERT:  JANE'S CONTROL PANEL

	Each of four buttons labeled so that the microphone can connect
	her to Tom and the Field Reporters.  She presses the button
	marked "Tom."

				JANE
		You hear me, Tom?  Tom?  Tom?
		Damn it...He can't hear me...
			(to Blair)
		I told you if there was one thing...

	Tom's VOICE on speakers.

				TOM
			(voice over; relaxed)
		I can hear you.  I was just teasing.

	Gulping the air in relief, she slumps nonetheless impressed by
	the macho cool as:

	Tom smiles towards her then -- poises himself just as the
	Announcer's last words clear.

				ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
			(voice over)
		...in Washington, Tom Grunick.

	He begins his report.  He seems authoritative, compelling, even
	in a low key way.  We trust him.

				TOM
		Good afternoon.  A Libyan fighter
		plane attacked a United States
		Military Installation early this
		morning and was, itself, shot down
		by American F-14 Interceptors.

	Another monitor shows the Graphic running.  In the b.g. two
	men approaches Paul.  They look out of place, decidedly
	non-business like.

				MAN ONE
		Mr. Moore, I'm Marvin Usher and this 
		is my brother, Stuart.

				PAUL
		Not now!!!
			(gesturing)
		Look.

				TOM
		The Libyan Missile destroyed an Army
		Warehouse which, just thirty minutes
		earlier, had been crowded with 
		servicemen.  No one was injured.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Aaron is seated, feet up, drinking, listening to MUSIC -- reading
	a book, two remote controls are on the cushion next to him.  He
	SINGS OUT LOUD with the record as he reads -- at one point
	providing his own lyric line OVER THE MUSIC.

				AARON
			(SINGING LOUDLY)
		And I can read while I sing.

	He picks up the television remote-control device an puts the
	television on, the SOUND OFF.

	ON TV

	We SEE the graphic of the Libyan plane's flight route, its
	missile firing -- the U.S. planes taking off and the shooting
	down of the Mirage jet... At one point Aaron lowering the MUSIC
	and raising the TV SOUND hearing Tom.

				TOM'S VOICE
			(voice over)
		The heat seeking missile virtually
		disintegrated the  plane on...

	Aaron turns down the TV SOUND and turns up the MUSIC.

	INT. BOOTH

	Jane's hand flicks at the button marked "PENTAGON."

				JANE
		George, you're ready.

	ON PENTAGON MONITOR

	We SEE George and HEAR him through Jane's voice box.

				GEORGE
			(voice over)
		Should I cover everything or should
		I save something for Tom to ask about?

				JANE
		Cover everything!

	George nods.

				JANE
			(hitting Tom's button)
		We're going to George.  Say 'the
		Joint Chiefs are meeting -- we have
		George Weln at the Pentagon'.

	ON TOM

				TOM
		George Weln is at the Pentagon where
		the attack launched by the lone
		Libyan pilot has resulted in a massive
		movement of military might.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Where he still balances STEREO and TV SOUND.

				AARON
		A lot of alliteration from anxious
		anchors placed in powerful posts.

	He picks up the phone.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

	As Blair hands it to Jane.

				BLAIR
		It's Aaron.

				JANE
		Yes?

				AARON
		I think the pilot that shot down the
		Libyan in 1981 is stationed right
		here.  Maybe you could get him --
		and maybe Tom should say that our F-14
		is one of the hardest planes to fly.
		They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.

				JANE
		Thanks.
			(to Tom)
		The F-14 is one of the most difficult
		planes to master.
			(remembering)
		Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in
		the 70's the first crop had a number
		of crashes.

				TOM
		George, isn't the F-14 Tomcat one of 
		the most difficult machines for a
		pilot to master?

				GEORGE
		I think you're right -- it's certainly
		one of our hottest planes.

	INT. AARON'S ROOM - DAY

				AARON
		I say it here -- it comes out there.

	He giggles.

				TOM
			(voice over)
		There was trouble with them in the
		early days -- back in the 70's.

	Aaron dials again... As we SEE Jennifer standing at the
	White House.

				AARON
			(into phone)
		Me again.  Hi.  Listen Gaddafi doesn't
		foam at the mouth or anything.  When
		you speak to him he's not at all nuts.
		He seems like a leader -- very
		impressive, self-control...that's
		what's so strange.

	ON JANE

				JANE
		Right and we have the '81
		pilot on the way in -- Nobody else
		will have him.

				AARON
			(voice over)
		You're welcome.  Sow how does it
		feel to...I know you gotta go --
		Me too.  We're very busy here.

	He hangs up -- LONG SHOT... Aaron with his remote controls.
	The picture switches back to Tom.  He turns UP the VOLUME.

				TOM
			(voice over)
		...outlaw nation but strangely those
		who have interviewed Gaddafi find
		him, in a phrase we like to use in
		this country, very 'presidential'.

				AARON
		Nice, Jane.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

	Jane is on the phone.  The atmosphere buckling with strain.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Just a minute.

	Her finger hits the "Tom" button.

				JANE
			(to Tom)
		To State for the message from Libya,
		then you'll have the carrier pilot
		from the Sidra in time to...
			(a sudden shriek)
		What?  No!

	ON TOM

	Jolted by the shriek in his earpiece but nonetheless continuing.

	BACK TO JANE

	As she SCREAMS INTO the phone -- this is more than volume, she
	is over-the-top livid, her face red, neck cords popping.

				JANE
		We only have ten minutes left --
		how can you talk to me about parking
		problems?  No, not you'll try...you'll
		do it -- do it or I'll fry your fat
		ass, Estelle.  Good-bye.

	As she BANGS the PHONE down.  Paul comments sotto to Ernie.

				PAUL
			(sotto)
		I had no idea she was this good.

				JANE
			(hitting Tom's button)
		Fill for a second.

				TOM
			(fluidly)
		The latest message seems to indicate
		that the Libyan pilot was acting on
		his own without authority from anyone
		else.
			(into camera directly)
		In other words, I think we're okay.

	INT. STUDIO - EIGHT MINUTES LATER

	MOVING CAMERA FROM Tom's left profile TOWARDS HIS RIGHT PROFILE,
	TAKING IN THE Production Assistant who madly shuffles pages,
	even as Tom talks on camera, the monitor through which he sees
	the subject of his interview at the Pentagon, the clusters of a
	assistants on the floor and now WE CONTINUE TO CIRCLE BEHIND him,
	beginning to SEE the Control Room in the b.g. and as we MOVE IN
	TOWARDS HIS EAR, the white ear piece firmly in place, we BEGIN
	TO HEAR, the barely audible crackle of Jane's VOICE as she tells
	him roughly what to say and how long he has to say it.

				TOM
		...So, Commander, it must have been
		a bit tougher today -- shooting down
		the French-made Mirage Jet.  The one
		you got was a SU-22...etc...

	And NOW ALL IS OBSCURED EXCEPT THE ANCHOR'S EARS, the ear piece
	and the RED LIGHT on the CAMERA and beyond... almost an abstract
	vision.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

				TOM'S VOICE
		...Once again:  The Libyan Government
		has disavowed any prior knowledge of
		the flight.  This has been Tom Grunick
		reporting from Washington.

	The special report ended, Jane breathes a breath -- she and
	Blair momentarily grasp hands.  The first talk concerns Tom.

				PAUL
		He was brilliant.  I've never been
		as proud of one of my decisions.

				ERNIE
			(calls back to Jane)
		Great work, Jane, really -- You know?
		Really.

	She nods... totally depleted.

				JANE
		Well, there were no major gaffs anyway.

	Ernie scoffs in her direction.

				JANE
		Thanks, everybody.

	She exits the scene.

				PAUL
			(to the Usher brothers)
		This was important for Tom -- there's
		that bonding thing that happens with
		the public and an anchorman during a
		crisis.  It's not the conventions
		anymore; it's this kind of moment.

	Tom enters.  He is exuberant.

				PAUL
			(to Tom)
		What a baptismal.  Congratulations.

				TOM
		Thanks.  With all the help you get,
		it's sure easier than local.

	Paul and Ernie exchange a glance.

				TOM (cont'd)
		Where's Jane?  I'm still juiced.

	Ernie points off... as Tom exits.  The Usher brothers hover.

				ERNIE
			(to the Usher brothers)
		Can I help you?

				MARVIN
		We're here to play the new news theme.

				ERNIE
		New theme?  You don't need me for this.

				PAUL
		Stay.  Why should I be the only one
		to feel silly?

				MAN ONE
		We need a synthesizer -- but this
		will give you an idea.

				PAUL
		Go ahead.
			(to Ernie)
		Wasn't he great?

				ERNIE
		It worked.

	Man Two has the keyboard out and begins playing the prospective
	news theme:  a suite meant to have majesty and drive, a towering
	composition -- the effect of it somewhat lessened by the fact
	that the two men VOCALIZE OTHER INSTRUMENTS over the keyboard.

	INT. NEWSROOM - DAY

	As Tom makes his way across it -- crews are drifting in... He
	enters Jane's cubby, flushed with the electricity of the "win"
	the most noteworthy moment of his working life.

	INT. JANE'S CUBBY - DAY

				TOM
		You're an amazing woman.  What a feeling
		having you inside my head.

				JANE
			(a bit thrown)
		Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.

				TOM
		Indescribable -- you knew just when to 
		feed me the next thing, just a split 
		second before I needed it.  There was a 
		rhythm we got into, like great sex.

	Jane looks at him and nods slightly -- an unconscious spasm of
	truthfulness.

				TOM
		You have to celebrate with me, don't
		you?  Everybody's going to that bar
		on the corner, 'Caps.'

				JANE
		I'm going over to Aaron's.  Maybe I'll
		hoop up with all of you later.  How
		long do you think you'll be there?

	Tom indicates that it's an impossible question to answer.  They
	enters the elevator.

	EXT. NEWS BUILDING - NIGHT

	As several people cross the street towards the bar.  Tom has
	been holding back on one question.

				TOM
		It's tempting to ask you how you think
		I did.
			(she starts to reply)
		No.  I'm enjoying myself.  Take it easy.

	He starts across the street.

				JANE
			(trying to be casual)
		Maybe I'll see you over there.

	Indicates Bar.

				TOM
		You'll never show up.

	He starts across the street -- then turns and calls to her.

				TOM
		Jane?

				JANE
		Yeah?

				TOM
		I'll wait for you till seven.

				JANE
			(shouting back)
		Okay.

	Tom races to catch up with the others -- Jane in the distant b.g.
	pauses a beat before walking off in the opposite direction.  Jane
	moving quickly along.

	SOUND OF MEN VOCALIZING NEWS THEME comes UP AND continues
	through:

	EXT. AARON'S APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING

	As Jane approaches and is surprised to find him sitting on the
	stoop outside.

	ON AARON

	Happy to see her, rising fairly soberly to his feet.  He APPLAUDS
	as she comes toward him.

				JANE
		Really?  It was good.

	He nods and APPLAUDS some more.

				JANE
		Your calling in that information --
		you're the classiest guy I know.

	He waves her off... And sits down on the stoop.

				AARON
		It was strange to watch him.  What's
		the next step?  Lip synching?

	She sits a step or two above him, waiting to gauge his mood.

				AARON
		I've been doing some of the most
		important thinking of my life.  I
		wonder if this is the right time to
		tell you about it.

	She steals a glance at her watch.

				JANE
		Well, whatever you think.

				AARON
		I figured out exactly why it is I'm so
		hung up on getting a chance at weekend
		anchor...It's because if I do that well,
		they'll pay me more, treat me great and
		my life will be better.  That's why.

				JANE
		Sounds like you may be on to something.

				AARON
		Which means I'm at their mercy and who
		wants that?...I'm not going to tell
		you where this thought led me...
		Anyway, well, why not  tell you? --
		it's a happy thing.  In the middle of
		all this I start to think about something
		that does nothing but make me feel good
		and makes immediate sense and that's you
		...And I'll stop here but, Jane, I'd give
		anything if you were two people so I could
		call up the one who's my friend and tell
		her about the one I'm in I...I don't think
		I should go any further.  Come on --
		I'll walk you to the corner.

	He tales her by the arm and leads her to the corner.

				JANE
		You know you've had a strange day...
		I'd sleep on all these things you've
		been thinking.

				AARON
		Absolutely...You go have a good time...
		You have some place to go?

				JANE
		Yes.

				AARON
		Good.

	He grabs her and hugs her exuberantly -- takes her face in his
	hands and kisses her full on the lips.

				AARON
		Well, I felt something.

	He leaves her on the corner and walks back.

	ON JANE

	As the SOUND OF NEWS THEME VOCALIZING PICKS UP ONE MORE...
	Jane moving quickly, hailing a cab.

	INT. CAB - EVENING

				JANE
		We're going to Caps Bar at
		Seventeenth and Vermont;
		Connecticut is clear on Sunday...
		take that over to Fifteenth, then
		around Vermont and we'll bypass
		the circle that way...if you don't
		go over forty we should catch mostly
		green lights.

	ON the DRIVER'S annoyed look.

				JANE
		Come on -- don't take it the
		wrong way.  I just know about
		things.

	He hits the meter.

	EXT. CAPS BAR - EVENING

	As the cab pulls up, Jane gets out and pays him.

				DRIVER
		Great route.  I never made
		anywhere near that fast before.

				JANE
		Thanks -- good driving --

				DRIVER
		Thanks.  Coming from you I
		appreciate it.

				JANE
		Thanks.

	As she turns to enter the restaurant -- Tom and Jennifer exit.
	As they confront each other:

				TOM
		I didn't think you'd make it.

				JANE
		Well, I thought I'd check if all
		of you were still here.  I'll just
		go in and join the gang and you
		two go on.

				TOM
		There's no gang in there -- We
		were the last ones.

				JANE
		Well, I'll go in and have a bite.

				TOM
			(to Jennifer)
		Jennifer, you want to have another
		drink?

				JANE
		Hey, I know how to have a burger by
		myself.  I feel like a little solitude.

				JENNIFER
			(as they move off)
		I sure know that feeling.  Terrific
		work today.

				JANE
			(too jock-like)
		Right back to you.

				TOM
		Thanks for getting me through.

	He puts his hand behind her neck in an awkward gesture of
	camaraderie.  She awkwardly disengages... waves and steps
	inside the door to the restaurant... standing there between
	the two sets of doors watching Tom and Jennifer walk away.

	ON TOM AND JENNIFER

	As they walk to his car, first exchanging a look of reflection
	over Jane... then bumping accidentally, then bumping back, a
	look, then kissing with passion, wrapped around each other.

	INT. JENNIFER'S APT - NIGHT

	As Tom and Jennifer rush in locked in an embrace, shedding
	clothes even as they enter.

	INT. JENNIFER'S APT - NIGHT

	We are aware of MOVING FORMS.

				JENNIFER
			(intense shout)
		Damn all you sons-of-bitches.  Oh
		shit, you bastards...

	They finish.  A beat, then:

				JENNIFER
		Sorry.

	ON TOM AND JENNIFER

	Tom taken aback by the outburst from this woman he's just made
	love to.

				TOM
		No, it's okay...People say different
		things.  They do...the plural threw
		me.

	She laughs.

				JENNIFER
		The last time I was with someone we
		went through this awful mutual disease
		questionnaire but I guess it beats
		getting paranoid the next day.  Okay,
		I'll go first.  I haven't...

				TOM
			(stopping her)
		It would never occur to me to worry
		at all about you.

	Jennifer is touched...

				JENNIFER
		You know something?  I'm deeply
		complimented.   Isn't it strange to
		be deeply complimented because the
		man you're with doesn't think you
		have a venereal disease?...

	Tom slides out of bed naked -- she moves quickly across the bed
	one outstretched hand reaching for his ass, a free -- even lusty
	sort of motion punctuated by her comment:

				JENNIFER
		Give me some of that.

	He dances away -- out of range -- liking the action, a stupid
	grin on his face.

				TOM
		Where's the bathroom?

				JENNIFER
		Through the closet.

	He opens the door and turns on the light in the closet.

	INT. CLOSET - NIGHT

	It is a converted room -- given over the racks of clothes and
	shoes extraordinarily well organized.  Tom stands there agape.
	Various rain coats -- clothes for all climates -- lots of
	luggage.

	She joins him in the closet -- holding out a sheet in front of
	her.

				JENNIFER
		I converted a bedroom -- this
		stuff builds up.  Wait till
		you've been doing this sixteen
		years.

				TOM
		I'm not knocking it.  It's a
		great solution.  Not only the
		storage but you can see everything
		you have.

	Jennifer laughs -- he follows her gaze and sees himself in
	silhouette against the door -- his penis prominent in outline.

				JENNIFER
		Do you do bunny rabbits?

	Tom is enjoying himself immensely.

				TOM
		Isn't this a great date?

	We HEAR the SOUND OF SCRATCHING as we:

	INT. JANE'S EDITING CUBICLE - MORNING

	Jane feeds another tape in -- she is taking editing notes alone
	and SCRATCHING her arm.  She looks worn out -- STOCK FOOTAGE OF
	STATESMEN move across the small screen.  She sighs and, without
	realizing, implores the heavens to help cure a malady she's yet
	to recognize in herself.

				JANE
			(to herself)
		God help me.

	People have begun to filter into the newsroom in the b.g.

				AARON
		Jesus, Jane.  How long have you
		been here?

				JANE
		A long time.  I was restless.
		Will you crack my neck?

	He starts massaging her neck as the phone rings.  she lets it
	ring for a beat as Aaron works on her.  As she picks up the
	receiver we HEAR a CRACK.  She reacts to it at the same time
	she utters a greeting.

				JANE
		Aaah --
			(into phone)
		-- ello.  You sure they said the
		management meeting?
			(hangs up; then
			 to Aaron)
		They want me to be at the
		management meeting.

				AARON
		They're not that dumb, after all.

	He pats her on the back.

	INT. WALKWAY - DAY

				BLAIR
		Do you know you're the second woman
		in network news history to produce?

				JANE
			(though distracted)
		No, I'm not.  I'm the fourth.
		Joan Richmond.  Pauline Fredericks
		got that credit once on a U.N.
		special and there's Susan Zirinsky.

	INT. MANAGEMENT MEETING - DAY

	Paul is running the meeting from behind Ernie's desk.
	TWO OTHER NON-EDITORIAL MEN are in attendance.  As Paul
	discusses the more pressing problems of the network news
	division, Jane sits near the window strangely unmoved by
	her first moment at the seat of power.  She has the blues.

				PAUL
		Anyway, they seem to be very serious
		about making me out eight million from
		the budget and that means massive firings.
		I'm doing everything I can... It's too
		early to make up a 'death list' but I
		just wanted you to be aware of the
		situation... We're also going to cover
		the Alaskan serial killer trial on a
		continuing basis.  I'd like it done out
		of Washington which means we've got to
		get somebody on a plane for Anchorage.
		We can't fool around anymore...Jane...

	She looks up at him -- a bit sleepy-eyed.

				PAUL (cont'd)
		This is going to be high-profile on
		the Evening News -- who do you think?
		George Weln or Jennifer?

				JANE
			(much, much too quickly)
		Jennifer.

	The men look at her curiously.  She repeats herself more
	rationally.

				JANE (cont'd)
		Jennifer.

	INT. TOM'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

	He has been reading from a respectable stack of mail -- Jane
	appears in his doorway.  For the first time, we notice that
	she is woefully ba at at least one endeavor -- flirting.

				JANE
		Come on, I'll buy you a drink.
		There's a big thing over at the
		Italian embassy.

				TOM
		I'm not sure I'd be good
		company tonight.

				JANE
			(self-conscious joke)
		I'll be the judge of that.

	INT. ITALIAN EMBASSY - NIGHT

	As they walk in -- one MAN looks at Tom with a glint of
	recognition.  Then another -- a handshake -- A WOMAN introduces
	herself.  A small knot of people form.

				JANE
		It's much too soon for you to have
		this kind of buzz around you.

				TOM
		Do I have to stand here in the middle
		and meet them all?

				JANE
		I'll get you through.  Move and smile.
			(she pushes him
			 a little)
		And smile and move...

	They start crossing the room -- he is moving now, making progress.
	But an EGYPTIAN BUSINESSMAN stops him.

				EGYPTIAN BUSINESSMAN
		Is it safe for me to fly home?

				TOM
		Yes.  We're fine now.

				JANE
		AND SMILE.

	He smiles -- people smile back.

				JANE
		AND MOVE.

	ANGLE ON STAIR LANDING

	Where Aaron (Pimm's Cut in hand -- a cucumber sticking out)
	stands with Martin Klein.  Martin is eating from a huge platter
	of appetizers.

				MARTIN KLEIN
		The Italians serve the second best
		things right after the Chinese...I
		could do an article comparing Embassy
		food...Gourmet free-loading...sell it
		anyplace.  I'm sure not getting the
		assignments.

				AARON
		Who the heck could that be?

	AARON'S P.O.V.

	From the excited group of people blocking his view,
	it's clear there is some personage in attendance.

	ON AARON

	And now he sees that it's Tom.

				AARON
		Is God testing me or something?

				MARTIN KLEIN
		Paul loves him.  I heard him give
		him the most poetic compliment in
		his command.  'He's hot.'  Sometimes
		groups of executives get together just
		to say that work back and forth...'He's
		hot, oh, she's hot.  Oh, he's really
		hot.'  Hot-hot-hot-hot-hot-hot-hot...
			(looking at Aaron)
		And here we are.

				AARON
		Martin, you're not allowed to use the
		word 'we' or I'm moving.

				MARTIN KLEIN
			(sudden thought)
		Maybe Jane would like my food idea as
		a spot...Try the one in the middle.

	He moves off to intercept Jane -- as he stops her... Tom is
	stranded -- then sees Aaron and moves over to his side.

				TOM
		Hi, Aaron...What's doing?

				AARON
		Same old stuff.  I'm watching a man
		who won three Overseas Press Awards
		pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.

	A MAN stops and introduces himself to Tom -- shaking his hand:

				TOM
		You want to go out there --
			(indicating balcony)
		get out of this for a second?

				AARON
		Why don't you lead?  I'll just
		follow the flurry you cause.

	Tom turns -- the sharpness of the tone unsettles him.

				TOM
		What did I do to you?

				AARON
		You've made my dreams silly.

	Tom decides not to deal with the remark.  He's jolted by the
	hostility.  He leads the way out French Doors to a ground floor
	terrace, where Aaron joins him, closes the door and the two men
	stare at the party.

				TOM
			(gesturing at the
  			 party)
		Heavy hitters.

	Aaron nods.

	They look inside.

				AARON
			(several beats; then)
		How you doing?

				TOM
			(warming)
		Great.  Network news, Washington...
		I love it.  What do you do when your
		real life exceeds your dreams?

				AARON
		Keep it to yourself.

				TOM
		You know the other day I really wanted
		your reaction to how we did with the
		Libyan report -- I was going to ask but
		I guess I feel a little intimidated with
		you.

				AARON
		Oh, stop it.

	On Tom's reaction.

				AARON
		You can't talk about feeling
		intimidated when you're on top of
		the world.  It's unseemly.

				TOM
		I'm not buying into any of that.  I
		have a load to learn.  I'm not going
		to act as if...

				AARON
			(finishing for him)
		You have the job you have...

	The sudden debate is important to Tom -- but it's moving too
	fast for him.

				TOM
		Shut up a second...

				AARON
			(amiably)
		Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't
		it, pal?

				TOM
			(picking his words)
		I made one rule for myself when this
		started and I realized I was going
		to take a lot from you people because
		of being from sports...

				AARON
		And the rule was...

				TOM
		Never to pretend to know more than
		I did.

				AARON
		Can you name all the members of the
		Cabinet?

				TOM
			(flustered)
		Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean
		I'd take a test for you -- I mean if
		that came up in conversation I'd...

				AARON
		We're conversing...Oh my, the names
		of the entire Cabinet has slipped my
		mind.  What are they?

	Tom is getting pissed.

				AARON
			(compromising)
		Don't name them.  Just tell me if
		you know.

				TOM
		Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of
		the Cabinet.

				AARON
		Okay.

	A beat.

				AARON (cont'd)
		All twelve?

				TOM
		Yes.

				AARON
		There are only ten.

	Aaron's suddenly a good deal happier -- damned if it
	isn't a little infectious.

				TOM
		You're feeling good, aren't you?

				AARON
			(sincerely)
		I'm starting to... We may do
		the capitols of the states.

				TOM
			(dry)
		Fifty, right?

	Aaron almost smiles.

	Tom enters the party leaving the door open.

	LONG SHOT

	Aaron in the f.g. -- his BACK TO CAMERA... Beyond him
	Tom being approached... then joining Jane.

	EXT. JANE'S STREET - NIGHT

	As Tom's car comes to a stop.

	INT. TOM'S CAR - NIGHT

				TOM
		I'm so exhausted.  Punchy.  Sick
		tired.  I can't think and I can't move.
		I'm just a dead lump of poured out
		flesh.
			(then)
		Would you like to come up?

	Tom thinks -- then:

				TOM
		Maybe we could just sit here --
		talk a little?

				JANE
		Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?

				TOM
		Too many smart people in one room --
		it's not healthy...

	Jane's confused by this.  She looks at him.

				TOM
		I'm going to have to do a story
		from beginning to end on my own.

				JANE
		Eventually.  Does it have to be
		right now?

				TOM
			(nodding)
		Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this
		unless it was absolutely necessary.
		I have an idea for something.

				JANE
		What?

				TOM
		I just read about it in a magazine
		and it affected me.

				JANE
		Well, what is it?

				TOM
		If I tell you, can you manage not
		to put it down or tell me why it
		won't work or is in bad journalistic
		taste or anything like that?

				JANE
			(broadly)
		Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage.

	He turns towards her -- about to stick his chin out.  Hesitates.

				JANE (cont'd)
		I promise.

				TOM
		It's about women who are attacked
		by someone they know on a date...
		'Date-rape,' that's the piece...
		Well?

	Jane clamps a hand over her own mouth.

				TOM
		Okay -- good move.  Keep it there.

	She continues to clamp her mouth shut as he exits the car,
	opens her door and then begins to half carry, half pull her out.
	She keeps her hand clamped over her mouth.  Laughing from 
	behind her door and runs for it.

	ON TOM

	His spirits lifted.

	ON JANE

	Behind the door, trying to hide the glow in her eyes.

	INT. JANE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	The phone rings... Jane's hand bounces off her nightstand to
	turn on the light knocking over and breaking the clock radio
	instead.  Three alarm clocks stand next to the clock radio...
	Finally the light comes on.  Jane's voice is so thick with
	sleep the words she utters are just barely distinguishable.

				JANE
		Hello.

				TO
			(uncertain)
		Hello?

				JANE
		Hello...Who is it?

	INTERCUT:

	INT. TOM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

				TOM
		I'm not sure I dialed right --
		Jane?

				JANE
		Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you?
		Is this Tom?

				TOM
		Yes.

				JANE
		I had to sleep fast so I took two
		allergy pills to help me...I'm
		sorry...Hey, you called me.

				TOM
		It's not important.

				JANE
		Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha.
		I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't
		tell -- how embarrassing for me.
		Gosh.

				TOM
		What pills did you take?  You
		sound more like someone on a general
		anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak
		to you tomorrow.

				JANE
		Nooo.  Is it your story?

				TOM
		No.  Are you going to the
		Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?

				JANE
		Why, you need me for the story?

				TOM
		No.  Were you going to you?

				JANE
		Uh-huh.

				TOM
		Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like
		to go.

				JANE
		Oh, good.

				TOM
		We can go together.


				JANE
		So you like me, huh?

				TOM
		I like you as much as I can like
		anyone who thinks I'm an asshole.

	INT. JANE'S EDITING ROOM - DAY

	Tom editing a piece with Bobby -- He also has a little typewriter
	table set up.  He is reading from the page in the typewriter as
	he looks at the piece he has written.

				TOM
			(reading)
		But cops on the street continue to
		view it as...
		Shit -- too long.  But street cops
		say...that fits.  That last cut work
		for you, Bobbie?

				BOBBIE
		Yes, and thanks for asking.

	INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT

	As the regulars watch the Evening News, in particular the Date
	Rape piece which is now in progress.  Tom anxiously eyeing Jane
	out of the corner of his eye as she watches the monitor.  Her
	face impossible to read as she studies the screen.

	ON MONITOR

				UNIFORMED COP
		What can you do?  If a woman invites
		a man in and he says they uh, had
		sex and she says he raped her and
		then you find out they've been out
		together two, three times...how can
		you prove a crime?

	NEW SHOT ON MONITOR

	Tom and a woman of about thirty -- dignified but fragile -- she
	looks like someone who might be cast for a church production
	of "Glass Menagerie."

				YOUNG WOMAN
		It will be a year next month since it
		happened...I never thought I'd talk
		about it outside of counseling...

	ON NEWSROOM

	As Aaron enters the scene.

				AARON
		Hi.

	He is shushed by every woman in the room, accepts this and takes
	up a position near Tom and Jane to watch them.

	ON MONITOR

				YOUNG WOMAN
		We'd gone out twice and I hadn't
		enjoyed myself that much but it gets
		to a point -- I don't know if you can
		appreciate this but where you don't
		want to sit home or be with your
		girlfriends and people had always been
		telling me that I was 'too picky.'
		I'm not.  It's just you want to meet
		a nice guy...So anyways, it was that
		'give-him-a-chance' thing.  No, it
		wasn't.  I was lonely.  So we went
		to a movie and when he brought me home
		he said could he just come up and have
		one beer and then he'd go.  How do you
		say 'no', to that?  So first it was
		this wrestling match which was awful
		enough because it got to be really
		a fight...because I'm a modest person...
		then he ripped my clothes and he 
		forced me to...make love.  He stayed in
		my apartment and forced me more times
		-- he didn't leave until...
			(she has started to cry)
		I promised myself I wouldn't cry...
		It's just hard not to --
			(ruefully)
		You sure have a sympathetic face.
			(she cries a bit more)
		...I was so sure I wouldn't do this --
		but the whole thing messed me up --
		maybe more than it should...

	ON MONITOR

	As the news piece cut to:  Tom's face -- he turns clearing a tear
	from his eyes.

	ON NEWSROOM

	These watching struck -- perhaps embarrassed but riveted.  Aaron
	is aghast.  Aaron approaches the set.

				AARON
		Can I turn on the news for a second?
		...Oh, wait a minute.  Sex -- Tears --
		This must be the news.

	Tom stares daggers at him as a public official appears on the
	monitor.

	ON MONITOR

				PUBLIC OFFICIAL
		I don't think you can overestimate it --
		on any given Saturday night tens of
		thousands of women are being attacked
		and there isn't much they or we can do
		about it...

				TOM
			(on monitor)
		The victims often remain too terrified
		to talk -- the police powerless and all
		the social welfare groups can finally do
		is monitor this epidemic of crime without
		punishment.  This is Tom Grunick in
		Annandale, Virginia.

	As his piece concludes.

	NEWSROOM

	Tom continues to glare at Aaron.

				AARON
		I'm in a pissy mood.  I'm sorry.

				TOM
		What's wrong with it?

				AARON
		Nothing.  I think you really blew
		the lid off nookie.

	Blair moans with displeasure.  Aaron exits scene.  Others start
	to congratulate Tom on the piece -- in the b.g. on the:

	MONITOR

	We SEE frozen wilderness -- men digging in the ground -- clumps
	of people watching them work.

	ON JANE

	Probing her own ambivalence -- or, to be more accurate, working
	towards a positive stance.

				JANE
			(to Tom)
		Nice work...
			(checks watch)
		I've got to get a crew off the clock.

	She starts off -- Tom stopping her.

	ON TOM AND JANE

	Now off a bit by themselves.

				TOM
		So what did you think?

				JANE
		It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I
		really did.  It was unusual for you to
		cut to yourself when you tear up -- and
		that might not have been my choice...but
		it's real and it got me...and I think a
		lot of the time I'm too conservative about
		that kind of stuff.  Okay?

				TOM
			(enormously pleased)
		Yeah.

	He walks back towards the area of the monitor.

	ON MONITOR

				JENNIFER
		Tomorrow the jury returns to this
		site as each day brings more revelations
		of horror, four more bodies now taken
		from the frozen earth...This is Jennifer
		Mack in Wota Hamlet, Alaska.

	INT. NEWSROOM - TWO WEEKS LATER (SPRING) - DAY

				BLAIR
		Ernie's been looking for you.

	As Aaron walks to his office.

	INT. AARON'S OFFICE - DAY

	As he enters and finds Ernie bent over his desk.

				ERNIE
		Oh, I was just writing you a note.
		What do you say we take a walk?

				AARON
			(puzzled)
		Outside?

				ERNIE
		Yeah --

	EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - DAY

	Ernie is silent... He's having difficulty.  Aaron is feeling knots
	form.  Finally Ernie breaks his silence.

				ERNIE
		I don't know if we have any
		younger man more respected in our
		operation than you.

				AARON
		Just tell me what's really going
		on.  I think we know each other
		well enough for me to expect that.

				ERNIE
			(agitated)
		We know each other well enough
		for me to care how I put something
		to you which could wipe you out.
		So I will phrase things the way I
		think they should be phrased.  All
		right?

				AARON
		Wipe me out?

	Ernie sits on a bench.

				ERNIE
		Anyway.  I want you to think of this as...

				AARON
		Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really
		appreciate bluntness.

				ERNIE
		Upper management thinks you're dull.

	Aaron deflates.

				ERNIE
		Aaron, I've never seen them like
		this -- I think Paul's nervous
		about his own job and for some
		reason he thinks you only appeal to...

				AARON
		Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm
		beginning to appreciate it.

				ERNIE
		I'm no suggesting the worst will
		happen...but someone with your
		brilliance gets nibbles about other
		jobs and maybe, the next time that
		happens, down the road -- you should
		look into it.

				AARON
			(emotional)
		Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My,
		God.  They want to fire me.

				ERNIE
		All I know is that they've got to
		fire a large number of people...
		and they're not going by seniority.
		There's a recklessness in the air.  
		They...

				AARON
			(interrupting)
		Do one thing to me?  Get me one shot
		at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've
		never seen me do it.  I think it could
		turn them around.

				ERNIE
		I could do it this Saturday -- everyone
		wants off for the Correspondents' Dinner.

	Aaron turns -- his spirit lifted by the unexpected ray of hope.

				AARON
		Do it then.

				ERNIE
		Please prepare carefully.  This
		couldn't come at a better time.

				AARON
		Prepare what?  You have Saturday's
		news handy?

				ERNIE
		It's been a while since you read
		the news -- I'll have somebody work
		with you.  Just on superficial
		performance things.

	Several beats.

				ERNIE (cont'd)
		Please.

				AARON
		Okay.  I think I'd better be alone
		for a while.

				ERNIE
		I understand.  I'll go with you.

				AARON
		Thanks.

	INT. SMALL TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT

	Aaron is seated behind a desk -- some old news copy in
	his hand.  An unmanned camera is pointing at him.  Tom
	is standing a few feet further back studying him.

				AARON
		This is uncomfortable for me --
		because, well, I don't mean it as
		a knock, but we approach this
		differently.

				TOM
		We sure do.  I don't mean it as a
		knock either.
			(he smiles)
		Go ahead.  I'll just say what I think
		and you can disregard it if you want.

				AARON
		It just might not work for me because
		of our different approaches.

	Tom nods and gestures that he proceed.  Aaron begins reading
	the news.  Barely a sentence in, he is interrupted.

				TOM
		Wait.

				AARON
		What?

				TOM
		Your coat jacket is rising up in 
		back.

	Aaron ignores the tip.

				TOM
		When you sit down -- sit on your
		jacket a little -- that gives you
		a good line.  Look at yourself in
		the monitor.

	Aaron looks but is unimpressed and resumes reading the news.
	Tom, not about to be ignored when he knows it's important, moves
	behind Aaron and begins to force his jacket down.

				AARON
			(very uncomfortable)
		I don't like being handled.

				TOM
		Sit on it!  Now look.

				AARON
		Just don't physically...
			(he sees himself in the
			 monitor and is suddenly
 			 enthusiastic)
		Fantastic tip -- fantastic.

	He starts to read again.

				TOM
		No.  That's not going to tell us
		anything.  Let's get this prompter
		going.

				AARON
		It's not loaded.

				TOM
		I'll find some copy.  Be right back.

	Tom exits -- Aaron looking after him, clearly taken with the
	genuine camaraderie... the unmistakable joy Tom derives from 
	helping out.  Several beats and Tom comes back with a CAMERAMAN in 
	tow.

				TOM
		I got copy, I got Ellen to heat up
		the camera and I got Master Control
		taping so you can study it later.

	He puts the roll of copy in the prompter.

				AARON
		Hey, Tom...

	Tom turns.

				AARON
		I'm very appreciative.

	SAME SCENE - LATER

	Tom totally focused on him down one knee checking him from
	various angles.  He interrupts.  Aaron reading from the prompter.

				TOM
		No.  No.

				AARON
		No?

				TOM
		Don't let your eyes go from the
		beginning of the sentence to the end
		like that.  You don't want to look
		shifty, do you?

				AARON
		Oh, God, no!

				TOM
		And the left side of your face is the
		good one.  Go again.  And try to punch
		one word or phrase in every sentence --
		punch one idea a story.  Punch -- come
		on --

	Aaron does same with the story he is reading...

				TOM
		Good...very nice.

	Aaron acknowledges the compliment in news mode.  Punching the
	first words.

				AARON
		Thank you for the compliment, Tom.

	He draws a laugh from the Cameraman as he goes right into the
	next story.

				TOM
		Try not to move your head or wrinkle
		your forehead...this is good, very
		good...

	EXT. NEWS BUREAU - NIGHT

	Aaron, tape in head, is saying his farewell to Tom.  He is facing
	his left side as he will do for the rest of his life on earth.

				TOM
		You were smokin' toward the end there.

				AARON
		The pointers were great.  I'll study
		the tape.

	Tom is into helping Aaron he finds himself delivering a locker
	room pep talk:

				TOM
		And remember -- you're not just reading
		the news or narrating.  Everybody has to
		sell a little.  You're selling them this
		idea of you.  You know, what you're sort
		of saying is, 'trust me.  I'm, uh,
		credible.'  So whenever you catch yourself
		just reading...stop and start selling a
		little.  So long.

	He moves off -- Aaron watching him go, feeling decidedly
	uncomfortable by this last piece of advice and vaguely corrupted.

	INT. JANE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Jane FLIES INTO FRAME, carrying her dress, two large shoulder
	pads clipped to her bra-straps.  She is obviously running a little
	late.  Now she slips on the dress -- her pace so quickened that
	it momentarily dulls the effect of seeing her in a pretty formal
	gown; the kind good girls wear on special nights.  The DOORBELL
	RINGS... She opens the door while trying to put on her necklace...
	Aaron enters carrying four bulging garment bags and a fistful
	of neckties.

				AARON
		I spilled some rum on the outfit you
		picked out.  Let me show you the
		alternates.

	She eyes the amount of clothing, goes to the phone and dials.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Tom...why don't I meet you there?
		I've got some last minute stuff I've
		got to take care of...Hey, how did
		you resolve your dilemma -- did you
		rent the tux or buy it...I knew it.
		How much?  Wow...Okay...See you
		there...

				AARON
		I didn't know you were going with him.

				JANE
		Did you bring your grey suit?

				AARON
		Yes...I was thinking that way too...
		Which tie?

	She holds them in her hand -- indicates with the necklace that
	she wants him to help her... he fastens her necklace while looking
	over her bare right shoulder as she riffles through his tie
	collection.

				JANE
			(the clasp in place)
		Thanks.  Try this one.

	She hands him the tie and he extracts his grey jacket from a bag --
	puts it on and ties the tie... She reaches into a white paper bag
	full of fresh purchases and takes out a vial of perfume with a
	built-in atomizer and sprays the air in front of hr and walks into
	the mist.  ON Aaron's reaction:

				JANE
		I read about it -- that's how you can
		make sure you don't put on too much
		perfume...

				AARON
		Could you at least pretend that this
		is an awkward situation for you --
		me showing up while you're getting
		ready for a date.

				JANE
			(flaring)
		It's not a date.  It's co-workers going
		to a professional conclave.

	Jane, unnoticed, reaches into the paper bag, takes a small box
	of condoms and drops it into her evening bag.

	EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - NIGHT

	Jane on a public phone, Aaron standing nearby within sight
	of a taxi stand.

				JANE
			(on phone)
		How long will it tale you to send
		one?...

	She hangs up... paces... Then looks at Aaron, relaxes.

				JANE
		You look terrific.

	Aaron poses a question which he feels in his deepest core:

				AARON
		Really?

	Jane nods.

				AARON
		Because this is important -- so don't
		just be polite.  I'd really like to
		look...what's the word I'm looking for?...

				JANE
		As good as humanly possible.

				AARON
		Yes.

				JANE
		Well, the line of the jacket -- No
		really....just very nice...just right.
		I wish I could be there.

				AARON
		Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little
		before 11:00, drop by the studio.

				JANE
		I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...

				AARON
		If...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll
		wait for you at my apartment.

				JANE
		Okay, great -- good luck.

	Before she can deal with that, a cab arrives.

				AARON
		Thanks, Jane.  Have a good time tonight.

				JANE
		You too.

	Aaron takes her in -- she looks lovely.

				AARON
		I'd hug you, but why risk mussing
		either of us?

	She half-laughs... kisses him, wipes the slight lipstick mark
	from his cheek and, in a sudden decision, takes each of her
	shoulder pads from her jacket and puts them in his -- improving
	his look while diminishing her own.  She gets in the cab.

	AARON'S P.O.V.

	Jane, leaning all the way over the front seat, giving detailed
	instructions to the DRIVER as the cab pulls away... As Aaron
	turns and walks off.

	INT. CAB - NIGHT

	Jane, in her formal, sitting back -- anticipating her date.

	EXT. WASHINGTON HOTEL - NIGHT

	A hefty percentage of the Washington journalism industry's
	men and women dressed formally for one of those evenings where
	they can finally assert their own glamour.  Jane ENTERS THE SCENE.

	INT. WASHINGTON HOTEL - ATRIUM - NIGHT

	As Jane enters, lost momentarily in the lobby -- greenhouse,
	the majority of the throng passing through in formal clothes.
	A bit of DIALOGUE OVERHEAD from TWO MEN in dinner jackets.

				MAN ONE
		The L.A. times is a great outfit.  Best
		severance pay in the business.

	Jane keeps looking for Tom -- passing another MAN, talking to
	his SHARP-LOOKING DATE.

				MAN THREE
		He was lecturing me and finally
		I just said -- I'm sorry, I refuse
		to look at it as a negative that
		I'm young and my news appeals to
		people my age.

				WOMAN
		And it's not like he just didn't
		hire a twenty-six-year-old producer
		himself.

				MAN
		No kidding, twenty-six.

	Jane moves to the steps and starts up, greeting several
	people nervously.  More bits of DIALOGUE, leaking from
	conversations of both substance and expedience.

				ANONYMOUS OLDER MAN
		Remember Brinkley's great line
		-- "It's as irrevocable as a
		haircut."

	Now, on the second level, she scans the crowd.

	JANE'S P.O.V.

	The floor below.  Tom in the world's best-fitting tux... Clusters
	of people from around him but he works his way easily through them
	as he looks for Jane and grins his greetings, men are buoyed,
	women's pulses throb.

	ON JANE

	As she silently mouths the words -- "smile and move and smile
	and move."  Which is exactly what he's doing.  Then a contract
	with the gods.

				JANE
			(to herself)
		If he doesn't see me soon, we're not
		supposed to be together.

	ON TOM

	Seeing her.  -- He does a tap step -- a brief giddy burst, the
	meaning of which is not lost on Jane.  He is acting like her
	boyfriend.

	ON JANE

	Anxiety stripped away revealing a first glimpse of Jane as a
	joyous pretty young woman.

	ON TOM

	Moving quickly up the stairs -- as she walks toward him.

				TOM
			(excitedly)
		It's incredible who's here.

				JANE
		Who?

				TOM
		Me!

	She laughs.  Almost completes an affectionate gesture -- takes
	his arm instead.

	INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT

	Aaron seated in the main newsroom in shirt-sleeves, writing.  He
	takes the just-completed page out of the typewriter and walks over
	to the weekend news PRODUCER. (W.N.P.)

				AARON
		Want to look at this?

				W.N.P.
		Sure.

	George Weln appears...

				GEORGE
			(to Aaron)
		What are you doing here?

				AARON
			(feigning casualness)
		The weekend news...anchoring...
		anchoring the weekend news.

				GEORGE
		Way to go.

	Aaron nods, as the Producer finishes the copy.

				W.N.P.
		This is terrific news, Aaron.  It's
		a pleasure to read.

				AARON
		Thanks.  Oh, there's water on the set,
		isn't there, in case I get an attack
		of cotton mouth.

				W.N.P.
		Sure.  You'll be fine.

				AARON
			(feeling patronized
  			 and repelling)
		I'll be fine!  Yes!!  I know!!!

	INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

	Bomb sniffing dogs, SECRET SERVICE MEN and D.C. POLICE monitoring
	the members of Washington's most trustworthy elite as they pass
	through the metal detector.  The line moves slowly -- Jane and
	Tom several couples back.

				OFF-CAMERA VOICE
			(o.s.)
		Can I have your autograph for my wife?

	Tom and Jane turn to see a grinning Paul.

				TOM
		How you doing, Paul?

				PAUL
		So this is why you wouldn't do the
		Weekend New, you can't turn down
		a free meal.

				TOM
		Yes, born to party.

	Paul enjoys the riposte, looks at Jane who is shrinking within
	herself.

				PAUL
		I'll see you two inside -- I think
		we're all at the same table.
			(sotto to Jane)
		You're finally learning to be flexible.
		Glad you changed your mind about Tom.

	He passes through the detector... Tom starts to step through it --
	she pulls him back.

				JANE
		I'm sorry.  I don't want to go in
		there and sit with everybody.
			(imagining it)
		I can't...why don't you go?

	He considers this option as she waits.

				TOM
		Suppose I go in for a little while and
		you wait in the lobby-bar.  How's that?

				JANE
		Good.  That's it...See you.

	She walks off.  He runs a few steps to stop her.

				TOM
		Jane.

	She turns.

				TOM
		You're not going to take off on
		me, are you?

				JANE
		Uh-uh.

	She steps on the escalator... Riding upwards, concern deepens,
	anxiety flows.

	ON TOM

	Watching her to up the escalator, he finds himself doing
	simplest thing, stepping onto a moving step.

	FULL SHOT

	Jane four steps ahead of him -- not yet aware of him.  He moves
	past one other man until he is standing directly behind her.

				TOM
		I just want you to know that my
		giving up the Correspondents' Dinner
		puts tremendous pressure on you.

	Jane turns and is a bit blown away by his gesture -- life
	threatens to be good.  And now Jane bumps a bit at the top of
	the escalator, regaining her balance by grabbing Tom's offered
	hand.  As they walk they continue to deliberately hold hands.

	INT. NEWS STUDIO - NIGHT

	WE are on the studio floor, FOCUSING on the activity around
	the Anchor Desk and three cameras... The FLOOR MANAGER stands
	ready to cue Aaron, the script is ready to roll on the prompter
	machine.

				FLOOR MANAGER
		Twenty seconds.

	ON AARON

	Making sure he is seated on his jacket -- taking one last look
	at the hand mirror being held by the MAKEUP WOMAN.  She starts
	off -- but Aaron regrabs the mirror almost making her lose her
	footing -- a check -- then another check -- he points to a spot
	on his forehead which she dabs with the makeup sponge... Both of
	them fuss enormously with his hair -- four busy hands.

				FLOOR MANAGER
		Ten seconds.

				AARON
		How many?

				FLOOR MANAGER
		Ten.

				AARON
		Okay.

	He watches the Makeup Woman scurry underneath a camera lens,
	resits on his jacket and finally has the moment the system has
	been denying him for years.  We can HEAR the END OF HIS CUE
	in a barely AUDIBLE CRACKLE from the Floor Manager's earphones...
	"...with Aaron Altman."

				AARON
			(on TV)
		Good Evening...In mood and language
		better suited to an espionage novel
		than the delicate world of the Western
		Alliance, the British Foreign Secretary
		today pounced on what he termed, 'The
		nest of profession spies and amateur
		traitors who were turning NATO
		Headquarters into an instrument whose
		only true function is folly.'  We begin
		our coverage with Edward Towne in London.

	Aaron looks up -- takes a breath.  He's done well -- he's
	punched his words and his one thought for the story.  His gaze
	has been steady, his voice firm but he has begun to perspire.
	He dabs with his finger at the first trickles from his brow --
	brushes some more prominent sweat from his upper lip... He
	beckons nervously to the Makeup Woman -- who comes in and dabs --
	then dabs again as Aaron feels himself under his arms...

				MAKEUP WOMAN
		Gee whiz.

				FLOOR MANAGER
		Five seconds.

	She scurries away, Aaron reaching for another Kleenex from her
	box and missing it... A graphic illustrating his next scripted
	section appears behind him.

				AARON
		...the sub-bases referred to are
		located in five countries...

	And now the moisture on his face is clearly discernible -- the
	Floor Manager and Makeup Woman grimacing at the growing specter
	as they look at a large monitor.

				AARON
		France, Belgium, the Netherlands,
		Spain as...

	And now so much moisture sprouts from his upper lip that he
	pushes his lower lip out to slurp away the sweat... The Makeup
	Woman laughs briefly out loud before catching herself...
	Aaron's eyes dart angrily in her direction.

				AARON
		We well as Great Britain...Our own
		State Department was rocked not only
		by the revelation but from the highly
		unusual persistence from the State 
		Press Corps.  Martin Klein reports on 
		the ruckus at Foggy Bottom.

	Half-beat until he's sure that he's off -- his shirt now
	showing distinct sweat stains...

				AARON
		Help me.

	The Makeup Woman picks up her Kleenex box -- then thinks
	better of it...

				MAKEUP WOMAN
		Someone finds me some big towels.

	ON AARON

	He blots his face -- some makeup streaked -- by the towel.

				FLOOR MANAGER
		Five seconds.

	ON MAKEUP WOMAN

	As she scurries away, this time entering the control room
	trotting up one stair to look at the monitor... the Director
	talking to his Camera Operators.

				DIRECTOR
		I'd go looser but we wouldn't
		see the graphic.

				TECHNICIAN
			(to other Technician)
		No -- this is more than Nixon ever
		sweated.

	The Makeup Woman now looks at the bank of monitors.

				MAKEUP WOMAN
		Can't you just die for him?

	ON MONITOR

	Aaron's makeup-streaked face.

	EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - NIGHT

	Tom and Jane walking drinks in hand, her arm around his waist.
	They stop -- he rests a drink on a ledge and boosts her up
	and then sits next to her.

				TOM
		You okay?

				JANE
		Great.

	FULL SHOT

	REVEALING that they are sitting on an anti-terrorist concrete
	abutment protecting a major government building on a beautiful
	night in our capitol.  He is still holding her hand -- and
	now he notes this.

				TOM
			(loudly to himself)
		Why can't I let go of this woman?

				JANE
		Well...

	He interrupts her with the smallest of kisses -- so mall and
	swift a kiss that she is left doing her return kisses to mid-
	air.  And then he does something he's thought about many times
	before -- he briefly caresses her breasts -- while continuing
	to look at her.

				JANE
		At least kiss me when you do
		that.

				TOM
			(a grin)
		You just can't stop editing me.
		Huh?

				JANE
		This is hysterical.

	She laughs a little -- then kisses him.  They break --
	surprised and aroused and look at each other...

				JANE
		I was half hoping I wouldn't
		have a good time tonight.  You
		know why?

				TOM
		Because you're nuts.

				JANE
		Right, right -- Isn't she fun to
		tease?

	He leans forward and speaks softly and truly.

				TOM
		More and more lately when I've
		watched you in action -- seen all
		your energy -- I've been
		wondering what it would be like
		to be inside all that energy.

	She takes a gulp of her drink -- puts a hand to feel the heat
	on her own cheek.  Then turns to him.

				JANE
		Right back at you.

	Several beats.

				TOM
		I don't remember saying anything
		like that -- exactly...I don't
		know why I just did.

				JANE
			(immediately at work)
		Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well,
		I can think of two reasons.

				TOM
		What?

				JANE
		Three...I just thought of a third...
		If you talk about it, you don't have
		to do it.

				TOM
		That's not it.

				JANE
		Good...Another is you're trying to
		make it all about sex and heat and
		nothing else.

	She looks at him -- he's thinking.

				JANE
		Or it's that great feeling that you
		don't want to hold anything back.
		You know, intimacy.

	She elbows him.  Tom takes in the choices -- then:

				JANE
			(suddenly)
		Oh, shit.  I'm a creep.

	She moves off the concrete wall.

				JANE
		I forgot all about Aaron.  I
		promised to stop by and see
		how he did.

				TOM
		I'd like to know.  I'll go along.

				JANE
		No.  I'll see you at your apartment
		as soon as I can.

	She starts to flurry with activity -- moves to the curb when
	out of nowhere Tom barks a sharp command, the first time any
	of his actions has been tinged with fury.

				TOM
		JANE!

	Thrown, she stops and turns.  He walks to her.

				JANE
		What happened?

				TOM
		Don't run off --  like everything's
		settled the minute you make up your
		mind.

				JANE
		He might be weird -- he can talk more
		freely if I go alone -- why's that so
		hard to understand?

				TOM
		It's not that it's hard.  I just want you
		to give me a minute to catch up.

				JANE
		Okay.
			(she hugs him)
		Sorry.
			(another beat)
		Don't yell at me like that again,
		you scared the life out of me.

	EXT. AARON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	As Jane exits a cab and moves up the steps.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT

	It is at the top of a flight of steps.  She KNOCKS on the DOOR.
	RINGS.  KNOCKS.  Aaron opens it.  He is wearing a sweatshirt
	and cords.

				AARON
		I was in the shower.

	She enters.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

				JANE
		How'd it go?

				AARON
		You didn't see it or speak to
		anybody?

				JANE
		No.

				AARON
		Then it went well.

				JANE
		Did it really go well?

				AARON
		Define your terms.

				JANE
		Do you feel good about it?

				AARON
		No.

				JANE
		Do others feel that you did well?

				AARON
		No.

				JANE
		Then what was good about it?

				AARON
		I lost six pounds...

				JANE
		Aaron, will you tell me?

				AARON
		It was great...writing my little
		first rate copy, sitting on my
		jacket, punching my one thought.
		But I had this historic attack of
		flop sweat so they'll never let
		me another again.  Oh, I lost one
		of your shoulder pads -- how was
		your evening anyway?

				JANE
		What do you mean, flop sweat? --
		you're making too much out of
		it...I'll bet you were the only
		one aware of it...

				AARON
		People phoned in.

				JANE
		Stop kidding.  I want to know
		what happened.

				AARON
		I'm not kidding.

				JANE
		There were complaining phone calls
		because you were sweating?

				AARON
		No, nice ones worried that I was
		having a heart attack.

				JANE
		If all that happened, how come you're
		so chipper?

				AARON
		I don't know.  At a certain point
		it was so off the chart bad --
		it got funny.  My central nervous
		system was telling me something.
		Jane -- sweat running down my face --
		makeup falling into my eyes -- people
		turning this fusillade of blow dryers
		on me -- all so I could read
		introductions to other people who
		were covering stories which is
		what I like to do anyway.  And I'm
		chipper because you finally showed
		up.  I thought I'd cook for us.
		Tequila and eggs sound good?

				JANE
		I have to be somewhere.

	He looks at a clock reading 1:15 in the morning.

				JANE
		I told what's his name -- Tom --
		that I'd meet him.

				AARON
		Call him -- I mean it can wait, 
		right?

				JANE
			(now the plunge)
		I don't know.  I may be in love
		with him.

				AARON
			(as if he just burned
			 his hand)
		No!!!!!

	She starts for the door.

				AARON
		Don't go.

				JANE
		This is important to me.

				AARON
		Yeah.  Well...I think it is
		important for you too.  Sit down.

	She sits.  He walks to a desk and looks at her briefly... Silence.

				JANE
		What?

				AARON
			(looking at her)
		Let me think a second.  It's
		tough.

	A remarkably long silence -- her mind wanders, she takes stock...
	it is evident that he is straining to get it right, reaching
	into himself.

				AARON
		Aaach...Jane...
			(glancing at note)
		Let's take the part that has
		nothing to do with me.  Let's let
		me be your most trusted friend,
		the one that gets to say awful
		things to you.  You know?

				JANE
			(testy and wary
			 but fair)
		Yes, I guess.  Yes.

				AARON
		You can't end up with Tom because
		it goes totally against everything
		you're about.

				JANE
		Yeah -- being a basket case.

				AARON
		I know you care about him.  I've
		never seen you like this about
		anyone, so please don't take it
		wrong when I tell you that I believe
		that Tom, while a very nice guy, is
		the Devil.

				JANE
			(quickly)
		This isn't friendship.

				AARON
		What do you think the Devil is going
		to look like if he's around?  Nobody
		is going to be taken in if he has a
		long, red, pointy tail.  No.  I'm
		semi-serious here.  He will look
		attractive and he will be nice and
		helpful and he will get a job where
		he influences a great God-fearing
		nation and he will never do an evil
		thing...he will just bit by little bit
		lower standards where they are important.
		Just coax along flash over substance...
		Just a tiny bit.  And he will talk about
		all of us really being salesmen.
			(seeing he's not
			 reaching her)
		And he'll get all the great women.

	She is getting pissed.

				JANE
		I think you're the Devil.

				AARON
		No.  You know that I'm not.

				JANE
		How?

				AARON
		Because we have the kind of
		relationship where if I were the
		Devil, you'd be the only one I
		told.

	She's briefly impressed.  He has a point.

				JANE
		You were quick enough to get
		Tom's help when...

				AARON
		Yes, yes.  I know.  Right.  And
		if it had gone well for me tonight,
		maybe I'd be keeping quiet about all
		this...I grant you everything but
		give me this...he does personify
		everything you've been fighting
		against...And I'm in love with you.
			(realizing)
		How do you like that? -- I buried
		the lead.

	He pauses to catch his breath -- breathing deeply through his
	nose.

				AARON
			(an aside)
		I've got to not say that aloud;
		it takes too much out of me.

				JANE
			(thawing)
		Sit down, stop.

	Aaron slumps down -- it's been a long round.

				AARON
		I've never fought for anyone before.
		Does anybody win one of these things?

	INT. TOM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	A CAR DOOR SLAMS in the street below -- he goes towards the
	window which is blocked by his sofa -- puts his knees in and
	looks out.

	TOM'S P.O.V.

	A woman walking from a car.

	ON TOM

	Momentarily thinking it's Jane.  Elated.

	TOM'S P.O.V.

	It is not Jane.  The PHONE RINGS.

	INTERCUT:

	BACK TO SCENE

	As he answers and we have the following conversation between
	Jane, who is using the phone, with Aaron seen just a few feet
	away.  Tom in his apartment.

				JANE
		Hi.  It's me.

				TOM
		Where are you?

				JANE
		I can't get away just yet.  I'm 
		at Aaron's.

				TOM
		Well, when?

				JANE
		I'm not sure.  It seems like he
		had sort of a mishap on the news.

				TOM
		I know.  I taped it.

				JANE
		It wasn't as bad as he think, was
		it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or
		anything?

				TOM
		Not if you count 'Singing in the
		Rain.'  Do him a favor and don't
		treat it like a tragedy.  You want
		me to talk to him?

	Her eyes meet Aaron's.

				JANE
		Uh-uh.
			(to Aaron)
		He says you could hardly notice it.

	Aaron beckons for the phone.  Jane hands it to him, as she does
	so:

				JANE
		Don't say anything about anything.

				AARON
		Hi.  Will I ever sing again?

				TOM
		Everybody has one like that.  I
		thought it was great when you
		started to laugh at the end.

				AARON
		Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying
		up Jane, I didn't realize you two
		would be going this late.  Sorry.

				TOM
		No.  Don't worry about it.

				AARON
		I'll put her on.

	She takes the phone.

				JANE
		Hi, again.  Sorry about...

				TOM
		No.  That sounds more important.
		Let's forget about tonight.

				JANE
		I don't know if that's absolutely
		necessary.

				TOM
		I've got my father coming through
		tomorrow anyway.  I should get
		some sleep.

				JANE
			(hampered by Aaron's
			 presence)
		Uh-huh.

				TOM
		I'll see you at the office.  Good night.

	Several beats of silence.  Finally:

				TOM
			(finally)
		Hello?

				JANE
		Yes.

				TOM
		Okay.  Good night.

				JANE
			(aghast)
		Good night??!

				TOM
		Jane, I'm not some chore you have
		to finish so you can stay on schedule.

				JANE
		Okay, great, Grunick -- Easy shots
		now -- huh?  Good night.

 	She puts the phone down.  A beat -- she looks stricken.  Aaron
	looks at her.

				JANE
		He just cancelled.  He had a
		chance to think and he
		cancelled.

	She bows her head.

				JANE
		I can't breathe.
			(aghast)
		Over a guy?!?
			(then)
		But I can't -- I can't breathe.
		Damn it!

	She gulps a breath.  Her hands on her knees, leaning over --
	another deep breath.  Aaron takes in the specter.

				AARON
		Well, Jane, it was nice of you
		to drop by.

	INT. JANE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	As she enters -- goes immediately to the phone.

	ON PHONE...

	Cradled in an answering machine -- indexes for sixteen
	one-button calls, mostly people from work -- "Parents" etc.
	Jane plays her answering tape.  It is silent -- no messages...
	She fast forwards to double-check.  Just the SOUND of blank
	tape.  She pushes the button next to the "Tom Grunick."  We
	HEAR a busy signal.

	ON JANE

	She hangs up the phone.  Then compulsively hits the "Tom"
	button again.  Busy.  And again.  Busy.  She considers for
	a moment hitting the button next to Aaron's name.

				JANE
			(stopping herself)
		Be fair.

	She presses the button next to Tom's name.  Busy.  And again.
	Busy.

	EXT. ERNIE MERRIMAN'S HOUSE - MONDAY MORNING

	As he picks up for newspapers dotting his lawn and opens the
	door of his car -- just as his wife calls from the door.

				WIFE
		Ernie, they're calling from work.

				ERNIE
		Tell me I'm on the way in.

				WIFE
		It's Paul.

	Ernie, just a bit concerned, walks back to his house -- the
	four newspapers thick enough to be an awkward carry.

	INT. ERNIE'S HOUSE

	A phone in the immaculate living room.

				ERNIE
			(into phone)
		Hello.  Yes...

	He holds the phone down at his side for a beat, composing
	himself in the face of a sudden and horrible turn of events.

				ERNIE
		Would there be any point to my going	
		to New York and talking to them?  Would
		there be any point in going over it with
		you?  No, I'm still coming in.

	He hangs up.

				WIFE
		What?

				ERNIE
		They fired me.

	She takes his hand and kisses it -- then hugs him.

				WIFE
			(weeping)
		How horrible.  We'll be fine.  You'll
		be fine.  Stay here with me -- we'll
		go for a drive, have some drinks, make
		happy plans.

				ERNIE
		No.  They're firing even more people
		than they said.  Some will want to
		talk.  It could help.

				WIFE
			(timidly)
		I could use somebody to talk to on
		a day like this.
			(on his reaction)
		Sorry. Go ahead.

	He kisses her sad face.

				ERNIE
		Bye, sweetie.

				WIFE
		Okay, sweetie.

	He walks towards the door -- picks up his newspapers on the
	tray beneath the hall mirror and does a start.

	HIS P.O.V.

	In the mirror he SEES his wife making faces at him behind his
	back.  He EXITS his home without comment.

	INT. EDITING ROOM - DAY

	Jane is sitting in her editing cubby -- it is past noon.  She
	rises and stands in her doorway looking toward Tom's office --
	the door is open, the room is empty.  Blair ENTERS carrying
	an armload of tapes.  She looks extraordinary.

				BLAIR
		I've got four hours of French
		demonstrations --

	Jane waves it off.

				BLAIR
		Some of it they use water cannons.

	Jane takes the tape.

				JANE
		What are you dressed up for?  Oh,
		that's right -- because the Evening
		News is here this week.

				BLAIR
		I spent a fortune on this.

	Blair EXITS... Jane pops the tape in, automatically making
	timing notes, then standing -- looking again towards Tom's
	door.

	JANE'S P.O.V.

	The door now closed.

	JANE

	She stops the tape -- summons herself.  She walks towards Tom's

	office and opens the door.  Tom is seated behind his desk.

				JANE
			(without passion)
		I kept trying to call you -- you
		never called me.  Were you just
		diddling me?  Is that it--?  I'm
		great if I'm helping your career.
			(mimicking)
		But when I'm a woman for a second, I
		get immediately fucked around by
		you.

	She is obviously in pain but still alert enough to catch Tom's
	answer.

	INT. TOM'S OFFICE - DAY

				TOM
		Jane, this is my Dad.

	And, now OPENING the door a bit more -- Tom's father is REVEALED
	seated across from him.

				JANE
			(that quickly)
		Please forgive what I said.
			(to Tom)
		Sorry.

	As she retreats:

				TOM
		You just light up a room and leave,
		huh?

	She laughs nervously as she exits.

	TOM AND HIS DAD

				DAD
		You want my opinion?

				TOM
		The thing that's easy to miss about
		Jane is...

				DAD
		You want my opinion?  And it's okay
		if you don't.

	Tom thinks a beat.

				TOM
		Yes, I would.

				DAD
		The way she just acted is not the
		way an affectionate person acts.

	Tom finds the comment off-the-wall enough to be thought
	provoking.

	INT. NEWSROOM - DAY

	Paul arriving with Bill Rorish.  The first time we have seen
	the multi-millionaire anchorman in the flesh.  He has the grace
	and dignity of a man who spends every waking moment working on
	grace and dignity,

	He and Paul are in the midst of an important conversation --
	muted and ominous.

				BILL
		Just when do you start, telling people?

				PAUL
		Almost immediately.

				BILL
		I'd like to take everyone out after
		the show.

				PAUL
		Bill...This is hard on all of us
		and it's no time for compliments.
		But I think it's extraordinary of
		you to come down here for this.

				BILL
		If we're not here for each other
		during the tough time, we're not a
		news organization.

	Blair ENTERS scene.  The smallest flicker of interest from Bill,
	but more than enough to justify her going into hock for the
	outfit.

				BLAIR
		Welcome back to Washington.

				BILL
		Thanks.

	A self-conscious look of greeting to Paul and she's gone.

				BILL
		I've forgotten.  Was she on the list?

	Paul nods "yes."

				BILL
		This is a brutal layoff...And all
		because they couldn't program Wednesdays.

				PAUL
			(can't resist)
		You can make it a little less brutal
		by knocking a million dollars or so off
		your salary.

	AS Bill turns:

				PAUL
		Just a bad joke.  I'm sorry.  Awful.
		It's a miserable day and that was
		some kind of totally sick-joke
		defense mechanism which does not
		indicate any of my feelings -- not
		one -- but just shows the kind of
		stress this represents for all of us.

	Tom and his Father ENTER the scene from Tom's office.  Bill
	walks to Tom.

				BILL
		Hi.  It's about time.

				TOM
		Good to see you, Bill.

	AS they shake:

	INSERT

	A great handshake.

	ON MR. GRUNICK'S FACE

	touched, as he watches the networks' most prominent journalist
	greet his son.

				TOM
		This is my father.

				BILL
		Good to meet you, sir.

	ON TOM

	Equally touched as he watches the world's most prominent
	journalist greet his Dad, who turns goofy with excitement.

				MR. GRUNICK
		Good-bye, Tom.

	He puts a big hand on his son's cheek -- a farewell pat.  Then
	whispers in his ear.

				MR. GRUNICK
		I'm going to go back home and tell
		all your old teachers.

	Tom watches his father walk off and moves immediately to Jane's
	editing room.

	INT. JANE'S EDITING ROOM - DAY

	AS Tom enters...

				JANE
		I feel terrible about what happened.
		What did he say?

				TOM
		He -- uh -- said he liked you because
		you looked like you had -- fire and
		honesty.

				JANE
			(enormously pleased)
		No.  Did he really?

				TOM
		Yes.  Then he said a really weird
		thing...

				JANE
			(so softly)
		What?

				TOM
			(he means this)
		That it would be a treat to make
		someone like you feel better...
		He gets like that sometimes.

				JANE
		That's so perfectly...It really
		makes me feel a little faint...
			(actually woozy)
		Whooo.

	Blair enters wildly into the scene.

				BLAIR
		They canned me.  Well, my brother
		will feel great -- now he's not the
		only screw-up.

				JANE
		It's started.

	Bobbie sticks his head out of his office...

				BOBBIE
		Tom -- Paul wants to see you.

	AS Tom focuses and moves off:

	INT. NEWSROOM AND HALLWAYS - DAY

	Moving with Tom.  Nervousness growing, confidence gone, he
	proceeds down the hallway.

	INT. ERNIE'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY

				SECRETARY
		He'll just be a minute.

	Tom sits down -- pats his tie in place... A beat and the door
	opens.  Paul leads out Martin Klein.  They shake hands.

				MARTIN KLEIN
		You know I'm just old enough to be
		flattered by the term, 'early retirement.'

				PAUL
		That's wonderful...what a lovely line.
		If there's anything I can do.

	They shake.

				MARTIN KLEIN
			(evenly)
		I certainly hope you die soon.

	A little smile to Tom and he's off.

				PAUL
		Tom.

	Tom enters the room.  A nervous cough in evidence as he
	crosses to a seat.

				PAUL
		We're having a severe cutback, Tom --
		17 people in this bureau including
		technical personnel and we're going
		to reorganize at the same time.
		We're going to take you out of Washington
		for a while and assign you to London.

	INT. NEWSROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

	Aaron and Ernie are off to the side in the newsroom -- People
	are packing their belongings -- as secretaries cry and embrace --
	from an office rumbles a shouted denunciation:

				ANONYMOUS VOICE
		No.  I won't keep my voice down.
		Those sons-of-bitches...They are
		worse than accountants -- they
		are bad accountants.

	Tom enters scene.

				TOM
		Have you guys seen Jane?

				ERNIE
		She's in there becoming the first
		woman bureau chief we've had here.

	Tom takes this in.

				AARON
		What did they do with you?

				TOM
		They booted me out of Washington.

				AARON
		Impossible.  There's no system that
		wouldn't value one of us.

				TOM
		Why?  What did they do to you?

				ERNIE
			(pointing at Aaron)
		It's what he did.  I'm proud of
		him.

				AARON
		They told me they'd keep me because
		they could plug me into any story
		and my salary was in line.

				ERNIE
		The cost-efficient reporter.

				AARON
		So I quit.

	A weeping woman bursts into their circle and sweeps Ernie away.
	Tom and Aaron stand there -- comrades at last -- victims of
	the same sword.

				TOM
		You packing up tonight?

				AARON
		Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're
		sending you down for a while, but
		you'll make it back...Where they
		sending you?

				TOM
		London.

				AARON
			(incensed)
		London.  That's a promotion!

				TOM
			(defensively)
		I don't think so.

				AARON
		It is.  Yes -- that's where they
		had Rorish, for God's sake, before
		they made him anchor.  I can't stand
		it -- they're grooming you for it
		all and you don't even know it.

				TOM
		Hold it down, okay?

				AARON
		Can I ask you something?  You only
		had one crew on the date rape piece,
		right?

	He extends his hand.

				TOM
		Yes.  You're not going to stick
		around for the farewell party?

				AARON
		No.  I don't know how much fun it
		will be when Martin Klein and Ernie
		have to drop off their credentials
		with the security guard.

	Aaron looks at people packing their belongings in boxes -- a
	few pockets of conversation... Ernie reading some copy.

				AARON
		This story they won't cover.  And if
		the network doesn't cover it -- it
		must not be important so why worry.

				TOM
			(eyeing him)
		I'm going to miss you -- you're a
		prick in a great way...

	Aaron taken by surprise -- laughs.

				TOM
		You know what I...

				AARON
		No, I liked the way it made me sound.
		Okay.  Be good.  So long.

	He exits.

	INT. TOM'S OFFICE - DAY

	AS he picks up a clean wastebasket and deposits his belongings.
	A scheduled book, clean shirt, two ties, cuff-links, a travel
	mirror, cassettes of his Washington reporting.  His desk clear --
	he writes on a clean piece of copy paper.  He centers it on his
	desk.

	INSERT - PAPER

	"Good luck, you'll love the bureau chief... Previous Occupants."

	INT. NEWSROOM - DAY

	AS Tom enters from his office, a wake is slowly igniting.  Tom
	moves along the edge of the room, carrying his wastebasket full
	of belongings, not really a part of the mournful festivities.

	TOM'S P.O.V.

	Jane across the room hugging one person after another.

	ON JANE

	AS she embraces an older secretary.

				OLDER SECRETARY
		You know what I always wanted to
		tell you -- that...

				JANE
		Shhh.  This isn't the last time
		we'll see each other.  It's not.

	A two-armed tight embrace of Martin Klein.

				JANE
		We'll get them back -- it's going
		to change.

	Blair is at hand as they embrace.

				BLAIR
		Except for socially, you're my role
		model.

	And now she sees Tom -- he mouths one word at her -- "London."
	She nods that she already knows and then lets her body sag a
	little.  He gestures her towards her editing room, so they can
	rendezvous.

	INT. EDITING ROOM - DAY

	AS Tom enters and waits for Jane.  When she enters he closes
	the door.

				JANE
		These people -- it's all so awful.
		It just hurts physically, doesn't
		it?  Like something's wrong with
		your bones, like your organs are
		shifting inside your body.

	She looks at him expectantly.  It's not what he's feeling.

				TOM
		Maybe I haven't been here long
		enough.
			(great)
		But, hey, congratulations on the
		promotion.

				JANE
		How can you say that to me?

				TOM
		Sorry.
			(a beat)
		I can't stand here feeing bad that
		I don't feel worse.  This has happened
		at every station I ever worked for.
		Look, I think it's crazy for you to
		come in here tomorrow and start a
		new job.  I have a week to get to
		my job.  Let's get the hell away to some
		island fast and find out how we are
		together away from this.

	A beat -- Jane takes it in.

				JANE
		Well, I just think that' an extraordinary 
		proposal.

				TOM
		That's yes?

				JANE
		That's more than 'yes' -- that's
		'you bet.'

	They kiss.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	The phone rings.  He answers.

				AARON
		Hello.

	INT. JANE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	Jane -- still at the office -- it is quite late.

				JANE
		Bastard, sneak, quitter.

				AARON
		Speaking.

				JANE
		I just found out.  You didn't say
		anything to me?  You just resign?
		Will you meet me now? -- No, now!
		I'm going away tomorrow.  Please.

	INT. SIDEWALK - RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	Across the street from the bureau's building.  Aaron and Jane
	are having a beer.  They are in mid-conversation.

				JANE
		Why not try it for a few weeks?

				AARON
		Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too --
		he couldn't help.  My agent has a
		hot prospect -- the number two station
		in Portland.  The general manager says
		he wants to be every bit as good as the
		networks.  Personally, I think he should
		aim higher.

				JANE
		Tell me the God's honest truth --
		are you leaving because of me?
		Because if you are...

				AARON
		Ernie told this story.  How he used
		to write obits and when the people
		in town called him up with death
		notices, he cried.  He was till
		that way when they promoted him
		out of obits.  He says you're lucky
		if you can get out while you could
		still cry.
			(a beat)
		I should have quit this place  three
		years ago.

				JANE
		You're just trying to say all great
		stuff so I'll feel even worse that
		you're not around.

	He laughs.

				AARON
		Let's go...

				JANE
		I just want to sit here longer, I mean
		the feeling is powerful -- why's that?

				AARON
		Maybe the best part of your life is over
		and you don't want to get up and start
		the bad part.

	Jane looks at him levelly.

				JANE
		You are now required to sit here with
		me.
			(a beat; then)
		Come on...be smart for a second --
		what do you think will happen to us?

				AARON
		Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six
		years from now I'll be in town to
		collect an award representing the surge
		in foreign coverage by local stations.

				JANE
			(smile, it's like 
			 old times)
		Yes.

				AARON
		I'll be walking with my wife and two
		children -- we'll bump into you on
		the street, my youngest son will say
		something and I'll tell him...
			(deliberately)
		...it's not nice to make fun of single,
		fat ladies.

				JANE
		You won't be able to stay mad at me,
		right?

				AARON
		I hope so...
			(on her look he relents)
		No.  I'm not really mad.
			(nodding head as if
			 reciting a catechism)
		I'll miss you, we'll talk, we'll always
		be friends...we'll get hot for each other
		every few years at dinner and never act
		on it, okay?

	Jane smiles -- Aaron has grown suddenly angry.  He rises,
	walks away, then turns.

				AARON
		Jane, you know how Tom had tears in
		the piece the other night?  Ask
		yourself how we were able to see
		them when he only had one camera
		and that was pointing at the girl
		during the interview.
			(on her reaction)
		I'm fairly sure I was right to tell 
		you.

	EXT. OFFICE - NIGHT

	We LOOK THROUGH THE WINDOW as Jane enters -- in a frenzy --
	searching the stacks.

	INT. TAPE LIBRARY - NIGHT

	As she locates the cassette labelled "DATE-RAPE - 9/26 -
	EVENING NEWS - OUTTAKES."

	INT. TAPE CUBBY - NIGHT

	As she inserts the tape into the player.

	ANGLE ON JANE... AND MONITOR

	As she watches... this is what she sees...

				YOUNG WOMAN
		...but the whole thing messed me
		up more than it should.

	She cries.  We HEAR Tom.

				TOM'S VOICE
		Okay, that will do it.  You okay?

	The tape is rocky now -- the Sound Woman and Cameraman
	continue to roll as they move towards their next shot --
	at times the camera pointing towards the carpet -- but
	the sound continues.  The crew chatting -- mentioning
	that the tape is still rolling.

				TOM
		That's enough.  That's enough.

				YOUNG WOMAN
		I'm sorry.

				TOM
		Are you okay?

				YOUNG WOMAN
		Yes, I'm sorry.

				TOM
		Don't be silly.  What are you sorry 
		about?

				YOUNG WOMAN
		The way you were looking at me, I just went.

	Tom moves through the SHOT.

				TOM
		I just need you for another minute now,
		so we can shoot from behind towards me,
		and, um...

				YOUNG WOMAN
		Uh-huh.

				TOM
		...that way we have someplace to go when 
		we cut.  And I just sit here, I nod my 
		head and look nerdy.

	Young Woman chuckles.

	Jane chuckles.

				SOUNDWOMAN'S VOICE
		Tom

				TOM
		Yeah.

				SOUNDWOMAN'S VOICE
		It kills me we didn't have a second camera.  
		It was so powerful seeing your reaction.

				TOM
		Really?

				YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE
		Yes, it is.

				SOUND WOMAN'S VOICE
		For a second there, I thought you were 
		gonna cry yourself.  That would have 
		been something.

				TOM
			(considering, then)
		Then give me a minute...

				JANE
			(fully realizing)
		You fucking...

	As Jane watches we SEE Tom work up the tears we saw in the
	Evening News piece -- as he does so:

				YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE
		Oh, that's amazing.

	ON Jane's shocked reaction:

	EXT. BWI AIRPORT - DAY

	Jane's cab pulls up to the curb.  She gets out -- she is
	carrying no luggage.  She sees Tom who hurriedly walks up
	to her.  Jane is fighting to maintain a calm.

				TOM
		Look who's the organized one.
		I've got everything.

	He briefly opens a paper gift shop bag he is holding and shows
	her he has bought them each a bathing suit.

				JANE
		I'm not going.

	He looks at her with anticipatory distaste evident on his face.

				TOM
		Why?

				JANE
		I saw the taped outtakes of the
		interview with the girl.  I know
		you 'acted' your reaction after
		the interview.

	Tom half turns from her and moves back toward the bench.  Jane close 
	behind, stalking him.

				TOM
		I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's
		verboten, huh?  I thought since I did
		it for real the first time -- but I get
		you.  That's not the reason you're not
		coming?

				JANE
			(raising her voice)
		Of course it's the reason.  It's
		terrible what you did.

				TOM
		We disagree on how God-awful it
		was.  Why don't you come with me
		and we can disagree and get a tan
		at the same time?

				JANE
			(livid)
		Jesus, if you're glib about this
		I'm going to lose it.  I was up
		all night and...

				TOM
			(calmly)
		Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...

				JANE
		It made me ill.  You could get
		fired for things like that.

				TOM
		I got promoted for things like that.

				JANE
		Working up tears for a new piece
		cutaway...You totally crossed the
		line between...

				TOM
		It's hard not to cross it; they keep
		moving the little sucker, don't they?

				JANE
			(distaste)
		It just proves that the difference we 
		have are...

				TOM
		This is a one-way argument.  We've got
		six days; if you go and we fight and
		we hate it -- we'll come home.  If you
		don't go?  Well, that's a much bigger
		deal.  I go to London right after that.
		So, it'd be very big deal if you stay
		here.  The plane's boarding.  You're
		good at deadline.  Here's your ticket.

				JANE
			(taking ticket)
		It's amazing.  You commit this
		incredible breach of ethics and
		you act as if I'm nitpicking.  Try
		and get this.  When you edited that...

				TOM
			(deliberately)
		I'm leaving now.  Gate 43.

	He simply turns and walks away -- looking back once as Jane
	stands there mucked up by his sudden departure -- the lack
	of resolution to their confrontation is palpable.

	INT. TERMINAL - DAY

	On Tom moving past the metal detector.  He too is frustrated
	-- pissed off at her.

	INT. OTHER TERMINAL AREA

	Jane moving quickly along towards the metal detectors.

	INT. METAL DETECTOR

	As Jane passes through and sets off the buzzer.  She stands
	there -- the heel of her hand pressed to her brow trying to
	stem the tears.  As others look on, she takes a huge key ring
	from her pocket -- deposits it in the box -- walks through
	without a buzzer and moves on.

	INT. BOARDING RAMP - DAY

	Tom waiting while in the b.g.  "People Eater" busses ferry
	passengers to the plane.

	As one full "People Eater" pulls away and another empty one arrives.

				TICKET AGENT
			(to Tom)
		This is the last one.

	Others start to board.  He sees Jane moving towards him.
	He walks to her, she gestures back towards the street.

				JANE
		That's not going to be the way
		we say good-bye.  Even though I
		think what you did was rotten --
		it's not all impersonal.  You mean
		something to me.

				TOM
			(interrupting)
		You keep coming after me and
		looking down on me.  It's starting
		to make me batty.

	She looks at him.

				TOM (cont'd)
		I can't help it that they like me.
		And I like that they like me.  And
		I think there's a lot of this job that
		I do well.  What do you think it takes
		to do this job -- the way they have
		it now?

				JANE
		I don't wan to discuss work.

				TOM
		Well, let's do a special report on
		that...I mean that's news.

				JANE
		I knew what you meant.

				TOM
		What I don't know, I can learn and
		what I know, nobody can teach.
		Excuse me for saying it about myself,
		but I think it's true.
			(old habit)
		What do you think?
			(catching himself)
		Never mind what you think.

	They look at each other.

				JANE
		You're lucky I came after you so
		you got that off your...

				TOM
		Yes, I am.  Thanks.  I mean it.

				JANE
		It's okay.

				TICKET AGENT
		Sir?

	The pressure begins to bend Jane's resolve.

				JANE
		So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?

				TOM
			(wary but hopeful)
		You want to come?

				JANE
			(totally open)
		It's just that one of the few things
		I'm not confused about is what I
		was saying downstairs, that...

				TOM
			(giving up -- sadly,
			 finally)
		Then you should stay here.

				JANE
			(softly)
		It's better when you let me say it.

	He hugs her.  Now that it's over, they can each openly care
	for each other.  While in the embrace:

				TOM
		Take it easy.

				JANE
		Why did I have to do this to
		myself?  Watch you take off.
			(then)
		Call me if you need anything.

	He kisses her lightly -- looking at her... Then heartfelt:

				TOM
		Oh, honey.

	He walks to the People Eater and gets on, still holding his
	paper bags of bathing suits.  The bus pulls away.

	ON JANE

	Watching him go.

	JANE'S P.O.V.

	Tom standing at the front window of the bus -- framed very
	much as he is when on television.

	INT. AIRPORT TAXICAB - DAY

	Jane gets quickly into cab.

				CABBIE
		Good morning.

				JANE
		Good morning.
			(after collecting herself)
		Dupont Circle, please.

	The cab pulls away.

				JANE
		Don't take the beltway, because at this
		time of day there's gonna be a lot...
			(stops herself, then)
		...Go any way you want.

	She sits back in the seat (containing herself) before finally and 
	quietly adding what she knows to be true:

				JANE
		But New York Avenue's faster.

							FADE OUT:

	FADE IN:

	EXT. CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

	Much the same place where Jane and Tom first met.  The
	words "SEVEN YEAS LATER" appears on the screen.

	A sign off to one side tells us it's the annual meeting of the
	Local Television Broadcasters... and that at 2 P.M.  Tom Grunick
	will be speaking on "Responsibilities of Broadcast Journalism
	for the '90s."

	INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

	Much the same audience, though two members of the audience
	may strike particular interest -- curly haired man seen
	from behind holding a similarly curly haired five-year-old.
	Tom is in mid-speech.

				TOM
		... when they told me Bill had decided
		to retire and offered me the Evening
		News, I thought it was the same kind
		of joke we used to pull back at the
		station -- turning off somebody's
		prompter in the middle of a show.

	Some good-natured laughter.

				TOM (cont'd)
		And then when they heard my reaction --
		they thought I was kidding.  I told them
		I'd be their anchor but I didn't want
		to be the Managing Editor -- that there
		were people better qualified than I to 
		control the content and if there 
		weren't we were all in trouble.

	The audience really enjoys this:

	SAME SCENE -- SOME MINUTES LATER

	MOVING SHOT...

	The anchor teams -- leaning forward.  They love this man,
	a humble specialist refusing the generalist trap.  Imagine
	the feeling -- you see, on the top of the mountain, a man
	not unlike yourself.

				TOM
		And now to something more
		important... I'd like to introduce
		my bride.
			(gestures to a woman in
			 the front row)
		Lila?

	A svelte, classic, warm beauty gets to her feet.

	ON CURLY HAIRED MAN AND BOY...

	Aaron and his son as Aaron cranes for a look at Mrs. Grunick.

	INT. AUDITORIUM - STAGE AREA - MOMENTS LATER

	Tom and Lila shaking hand.  Aaron, his son in his arms, wait.

	ON TOM

	As he sees Aaron... he is clearly delighted.

				TOM
		Holy shit, Aaron.

	He claps him on the back... Aaron is as pleased as he is
	uncomfortable with the attention.

				TOM
		Lila -- this is Aaron Altman.

				LILA
			(high British accent)
		Oh, yes -- you're one of Tom's
		50 or so role models.

				AARON
		Hi.

				TOM
		Well, this kid couldn't possibly
		belong to anyone else.  What's
		your name?

				BOY
		Clifford...

				AARON
			(indicating Tom)
		Do you know who this is, Cliff?

				BOY
		The big joke?

	Tom looks at him -- Aaron gives his son a disciplinary nudge.

				AARON
		I'm just bringing him over to give
		Jane a look at him --

				TOM
		I thought she'd be here.  I'll
		go with you.

				AARON
		Okay.

				TOM
			(to Lila)
		I'll see you back at the hotel.

				LILA
			(cool)
		All right.

	He starts off.  She pulls him back for an urgent communication.

				LILA
		Tom, the speech was magnificent.

				AARON
		Oh, I didn't say anything about
		your speech.

				TOM
		I appreciate it.

	INT. WALKWAY - DAY

	Tom, Aaron and the boy walking along.  Tom plays with Cliff
	as they move.  The boy is delighted.  Jane is in a park -- a
	blanket spread out -- she is wearing shorts and a top -- she
	has some wine and a small picnic -- a toy for Clifford.

	She HEARS her name being called.

	ON JANE

	Shielding her eyes from the sun -- now making out Tom.  As 
	they reach her.

				JANE
			(to herself)
		Well, why not?
			(as they arrive)
		Hey, what is this?  My life's
		rushing in front of my eyes.

				TOM
		A picnic?

				JANE
		I thought for ol' Cliff here --
		Look at you?  You're more adorable
		than your pictures.  Look what I
		got for you.

	She hands him a toy.

				AARON
		What do you say, Cliff?

	The boy kisses Jane's hand.

				AARON
		He excels at gratitude.

				TOM
			(to Jane)
		Are you any closer to a decision?

				JANE
		I think so...They've been talking
		to me about being Tom's Managing
		Editor.

				AARON
		Really?

				JANE
			(to Tom)
		I'm going to take it.

				TOM
		What a great surprise.  I didn't
		think we had a chance.  I heard
		you wanted to stay in Washington.

				JANE
		Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll
		fly up a lot.

				TOM
		Well, we should talk.  You going to
		have time for  dinner?  I'd like
		you to meet Lila.

				JANE
		I'm sorry because I was looking
		forward to that, but I' m going
		back in a few hours.

				TOM
		Okay...It's so good to see you.

	She gives him a quick kiss.  He shakes hands with Aaron.

				TOM
			(to Aaron)
		It's nice to see you.

				AARON
		Congratulations on history's longest
		winning streak.

				TOM
		If you ever get restless in Portland,
		let me know.

				AARON
		Why?

	Tom shuffles uncomfortably.

	ON JANE

	Smiling, appreciating Aaron's attitude toward a blandishment of the
	powerful.

				TOM
			(to Jane as he leaves)
		Bye...boss.

	Tom walks away.  He's a good twenty yards away when Aaron looks up
	to see his son running after Tom.

				AARON
			(calling)
		Hey!  Cliff!  Cliff!

	Tom now notices the boy, leans down and pats him.

				TOM
			(to Clifford)
		Go back to your daddy.

	The boy starts back.

				AARON
		Come on, Cliff.  Come on.

	As Clifford runs back to his father, Aaron sits next to Jane.

				AARON
			(to Jane)
		So who's the guy?

				JANE
		Well, we met about three months ago.
		He works at the surgeon general office.
		He loves boating.  So, he's been 
		getting me into water skiing.

	Aaron laughs at the very notion of Jane finding water sports a lure.
	Jane deliberately moves past this moment.

				JANE
		I like it!  So, doll, what about you
		lately?

				AARON
		Well -- my wife got this new job...

	He continues to talk.  As the two former colleagues catch up,
	their ease returns, if not their intimacy, as the frame locks and
	the scene slowly recedes into a black b.g. and we...

	EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

	A restaurant supply truck is curbside, near a small 
	restaurant.  GERALD GRUNICK, forty-one, is closing the back 
	door of his truck, feeling good about the world, a common
	state for him.  He moves towards the cab of the truck and gets
	inside as we SUPER:

		KANSAS CITY, MO. - 1963

	INT. TRUCK - DAY

	As he sits down beaming over his recent good fortune... now we
	REVEAL his twelve-year-old son, TOM, seated quietly beside him. 
	He seems a bit down.  Gerald glances at his son.

				GERALD
		I don't know a recent Saturday I've
		sold more.  You didn't think I'd
		sell that health restaurant, did you?

				TOM
		No.  Not even you.

				GERALD
		Why so glum?

				TOM
		I don't know.

				GERALD
			(a beat)
		Go ahead.

				TOM
		No, nothing.  I've got a problem,
		I guess.

				GERALD
		Were you bothering by those
		waitresses making a fuss?

				TOM
		No.  But, honest.  What are you
		supposed to say when they keep
		talking about your looks?  I don't
		even know what they mean -- "Beat
		them off with a stick."

	Gerald stiffs a grin.

				GERALD
		You know, Tom, I feel a little
		proud when people comment on your
		looks.  Maybe you should feel that
		way.

				TOM
		Proud?  I'm just embarrassed that
		I like when they say those things.

				GERALD
		As long as that's your only problem
		you're...

				TOM
		It's not.

	He looks directly at his father and talks quietly, and sincerely.

				TOM
		I got my report card.  Three Cs,
		two Ds and an incomplete.

				GERALD
		Oh my.  I see you studying so hard,
		Tom.  What do you think the problem is?

				TOM
		I'll just have to try harder.  I don't 
		know.  I will.
			(talking himself
			 into it)
		I will.  I will.  I will.

	He shakes his head for emphasis, glad he's received this pep
	talk from himself -- he hands the card to his father.

				TOM
		Thanks, Dad, this talk helped.  Will 
		you sign it, please?

				GERALD
			(as he signs)
		Would it help if I got you a tutor?

				TOM
			(suddenly hopeful)
		That would be great.
			(worried)
		It better help.  What can you do with
		yourself if all you do is look good?

	BOSTON, MASS. - 1965

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY

	AARON ALTMAN, looking almost preposterously young in his
	graduation gown -- is delivering his valedictory.  He is a
	rare bread -- a battle-scarred innocent.

				AARON
		...and finally to the teachers of
		Whitman High School, I don't have the
		words to express my gratitude which
		may have more to say about the quality 
		of the English Department here than 
		my own limitations...

	He awaits a laugh and gets only the weird sound of collective
	discomfort.

				AARON
		...that was, of course, not meant to
		be taken seriously.  A personal note.  
		I am frequently asked what the special 
		difficulties are in being graduated 
		from High School two months shy of my 
		fifteenth birthday.  I sometimes 
		think it was the difficulties 
		themselves which enabled me to do it.
		If I'd been appreciated or even tolerated
		I wouldn't have been in such a hurry to
		graduate.  I hope the next student who
		comes along and is able to excel isn't
		made to feel so much an outcast.  But
		I'm looking forward to college; this is
		the happiest day I've had in a long
		time.  I thank you and I forgive you.

	This is very little applause.

	ANGLE ON TEACHERS

				MALE TEACHER
		I'm always so confused by Aaron.
		Is he brave and earnest or just
		a conceited little dick-head?

	BACK TO AARON AS WE SUPER: "FUTURE NETWORK NEWS REPORTER"

	ANGLE ON STAGE

	As Aaron walks to his seat past three full grown tough looking
	semi-literate high school graduates.

				YOUTH #1
		Later, Aaron.

	EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY

	Clusters of graduates at the fence bordering the sunken school
	yard looking down as the tough cap and gowners seen earlier
	cuff Aaron around.

	CLOSER IN

	Aaron feeling from a blow -- his lip bleeding -- his teeth
	covered with blood...as he gets to his feet.  He is livid --
	something primal triggered by this brutality.

				AARON
		Go ahead, Stephen -- take your
		last licks.
			(points at his
			 face)
		But this will heal -- what I'm
		going to say to you will scar you
		forever.  Ready?  Here it is.

	He dodges as they come after him.  They catch him by the hair
	and hurl him to the ground.  As he gets up he hurls his
	devastating verbal blow.

				AARON
		You'll never make more than
		nineteen thousand dollars a year.
		Ha ha ha.

	They twist his arm and grip him -- his face scraped on the
	concrete.

				AARON
		Okay, take this:  You'll never
		leave South Boston and I'm going
		to see the whole damn world.  You'll
		never know the pleasure of writing
		a graceful sentence or having an
		original thought.  Think about it.

	He's punched in the stomach and sinks to the ground.  As the
	Young Toughs walk off Aaron catches a phrase of their
	conversation.

				YOUTH TOUGH
		Nineteen thousand dollars...
		Not bad.

	ATLANTA, GEORGIA - 1968

	INT. SUBURBAN HOME - NIGHT

	JANE CRAIG, ten years old, is in her room typing.  Above the
	desk where she works is a bulletin board with letters and
	pictures tacked to each one.  Her desk has several file racks
	which contain bulging but neat stacks of air mail envelopes --
	a roll of stamps in a dispenser is to one side.  Jane types
	very well in the glare of her desk lamp.

				JANE
			(voice over; as
			 she types)
		Dear Felatzia, it's truly amazing
		to me that we live a world apart
		and yet have the same favorite music.
		I loved the picture you sent and
		have it up on my bulletin board.
		You're growing so much faster than
		I am that I...

	OTHER ANGLE

	SHOWING Jane's FATHER standing near the door.

				JANE
			(voice over)
		...am starting to get jealous.
		I read in the newspapers about
		the Italian strike and riots in
		Milan.  I hope you weren't...

				FATHER
			(softly)
		Honey?...

	Jane SCREAMS, and grabs her heart, breathing heavily, babbles
	nervously at her Dad.

				JANE
		Oh God -- Daddy -- don't...don't...
		don't ever scare me like that --
		please.

	We SUPER:  "FUTURE NETWORK NEWS PRODUCER"

	Her father is himself taken aback with the shock of her reaction.
	Falling back towards the door:

				FATHER
		Jane -- For God's sake...
			(recovering)
		Look, it's time for you to go
		to sleep.

				JANE
		I just have two more pen pals and
		then I'm done.

				FATHER
		You don't have to finish tonight.

				JANE
			(he doesn't get in)
		Nooo.  This way the rotation stays
		the same.

				FATHER
		Finish quickly.  I don't want you
		getting obsessive about these 
		things.  Good night.

	We REMAIN WITH Jane who has obviously become disconcerted and
	troubled.

	INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

	As Jane moves to room at the other end of the hall -- a family
	room where her Father reads the latest Rolling Stone of the
	mid-60's -- Hunter Thompson, the New Journalism, the slim
	Jann Wenner -- Jane bursts into the room.

				JANE
		Dad, you want me to choose my words
		so carefully and then you just throw
		a word like 'obsessive' at me.  Now,
		unless I'm wrong and...
			(enunciating)
		...please correct me if I am, 'obsession'
		is practically a psychiatric term...
		concerning people who don't have anything
		else but the object of their obsession --
		who can't stop and do anything else.  Well,
		Here I am stopping to tell you this.  Okay?
		So would you please try and be a little
		more precise instead of calling a person
		something like 'obsessive.'

	She advances furiously on her Father since even this strung out,
	even with two additional pen pal letters to get off, she had
	enough sense of duty to kiss him good night before storming from 
	the room.  She exits the room INTO BLACK.

	Stay on BLACK as we begin MAIN TITLES:

	OVER EXT. SMALL MID-WESTERN CITY - DAY

	Emerging from the blackness -- Jane Craig -- now a
	twenty-eight-year-old woman -- a long speed walker wearing a
	jacket to which reflecting stripes have been glued -- the kind
	of gear only possessed by someone who runs at off-hours.  The
	Jacket itself is a wish-I-had-it souvenir from some important
	news assignment, the sort of treasure you love about all else
	yet never mention.  She stops running as she feeds quarters into
	the first of a phalanx of newspaper machines -- getting seven
	different papers before moving on.

	INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

	As she enters from the bathroom, having showered and dressed.
	The sun is jus now rising.  She sits next to her phone.

	INSERT:  JANE'S ROOM

	The Filofax book is almost an additional character -- a crucial
	hand-fashioned tool of Jane's trade.  She flicks at a page --
	takes down a typewritten sheet scotch-taped to it showing the
	room number of her crew and reporter.

	ON JANE

	As she dials one room number.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Hi...It's me...

	INT. DUPLICATE MOTEL ROOM - DAY

	ANGLE ON CAMERAMAN -- his equipment in evidence though
	essentially asleep holding his bedmate's hand, as he listens
	to Jane.

				JANE'S VOICE
			(voice over)
		It's thirty minutes before you have
		to meet me in the lobby -- nudge
		your wife.

	BACK TO SCENE

				JANE
		There's probably no time to eat...
		but there's a cafeteria at the bus
		depot once we get down there.  I
		love working with you two...It 
		saves me a call.

	She dales.

	INT. DUPLICATE MOTEL ROOM

	Where Aaron is switching his TV from station to station,
	monitoring the early morning news.  His PHONE RINGS.

				AARON
		Hi.  Turn on your TV...
		Good Morning America, the
		Morning News and Today are all
		about to talk to Arnold 
		Schwarzenegger and I think he's 
		live on at least two of them.

	BACK TO SCENE

				JANE
		At six o'clock on the wake-up
		news they used the wrong missile
		graphic.

				AARON
			(Austrian accent)
		Now listen, Arnold just said that
		he's been making three million a
		movie now.  But he's not ever 
		gonna change.  He's still the same
		person when he was making two 
		million dollars a movie.  He feels
		no different.  He also bought a brand-
		new condo with Maria, they gonna
		furnish tastefully.

				JANE
		A half hour in the lobby.

				AARON
			(Austrian accent)
		Okay, I'll see you in the lobbies [sic].

	She hangs up -- takes the phone off the hook and lays it on the
	bed for a moment's solitude.  She sits stiffly, palms on top of
	her legs.  It looks like someone with unusually good posture,
	waiting for something, and now we BEGIN TO SEE the first signs
	redden and she begins to cry.  Now she sobs -- then miraculously
	shakes it off and exits quickly to the bathroom.  This crying
	episode is clearly part of her morning routine.

	INT. BUS STATION - DAY

	Jane standing behind her husband-wife - camera-sound team
	as they train their attention on Aaron; who is getting ready to 
	do a stand-up.  There is a DERELICT off to one side.  Aaron holds 
	his microphone at the ready.

				AARON
		Ready.
 
				CAMERAMAN
		Your hair's a little funny.

				AARON
		It's an ethnic curl, I can't do
		anything about it.

				CAMERAMAN
		In front of a little -- it's a bit...
		You want a mirror?

				AARON
		No -- Don't worry about it.  Let's
		do this.

	Jane nods her assent.

				CAMERAMAN
		Okay.

	AARON SEEN THROUGH CAMERA

				AARON
		In other times, for other purposes,
		there might be a band and bunting
		here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's
		return from war.  He...

				JANE
			(interrupting)
		I'm sorry.  But look at how
		wonderful his face is.

	She points to the derelict.

				AARON
		Oh, you mean use him...That's
		nice.  Okay.

				CAMERAMAN
		I'll put him in the low corner of
		the frame -- good.

				AARON
		In other times, with other purposes,
		there might be a band and bunting
		here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's
		return from war.  Last week he was
		decorated by a president for heroism
		in a war.  But it was the civil war --
		in Angola -- and he was in it for the
		money.

	He puts the microphone down.

				AARON
		Thanks.

	He passes a vending machine and checks the stray hair.

	INT. GATE AREA - DAY

	Jane in the distant b.g. on the phone.  Aaron and crew shooting
	as the bus pulls up, hisses to a stop and tired, rumpled
	passengers exit the bus.  J.D. SINGER, strong, 9'6" figure
	emerges and is displeased to find a camera trained on him.
	He reacts with all the grace of a short mercenary.

				J.D.
		Go 'way.

	J.D. gets his luggage from the compartment under the bus.  The
	crew shooting.

				AARON
		Just a few questions?

				J.D.
		No.

	He starts walking -- the four person newsteam staying with him.

				AARON
		We came from Washington.

				J.D.
		Move away from me.

				AARON
			(holding out
			 microphone)
		How long has it been since you've
		been home.

				J.D.
			(moving)
		Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuckes.  Snot...
		Fuckee.  You want to use that?

				AARON
		It depends on how big a news day it 
		is.

	They reach Jane.  She calls to him.

				JANE
		J.D.  I'm Jane Craig.  I spoke to
		you in Angola.  I gave you some
		sugarless gum and Handi-Wipes.

	As he reacts to her:

	INT. JANE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Jane sitting next to Aaron making detailed timing notes as she
	screens the material shot that day on a portable monitor unit.

				AARON
		Where's where I asked him about
		being scared?
			(then)
		You should work on your speech.

				JANE
		No.  It makes me nervous to think
		about it.  Let's do this.

	She consults her notes and goes back to the exact spot.

				AARON
			(on tape)
		All this business of war -- do you
		get scared?

				J.D.
			(on tape; he smiles)
		Uh-uh.
			(then)
		I'm a little freaked right now about
		seeing my father though.

	He laughs self-consciously and turns briefly away.

				JANE
		I love that turn away.

	INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

	Jane is at the lectern in the darkened auditorium as two large
	monitors display some taped news pieces she has assembled.  On
	the lectern is a sign telling us we are at the Conference of
	Local Television News Broadcasters.

				JANE
			(in darkness)
		There's a point I'm trying to make
		about these pieces coming up.

	A WOMAN'S OUTLINE blacked out from behind -- her VOICE
	ELECTRICALLY DISGUISED.

				WOMAN
			(o.s.; angrily)
		I don't think any client of mine
		makes less than fifty thousand dollars
		a year which means they can afford the
		best and you're damn right I feel good
		that that includes me.

							CUT TO:

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ANOTHER WOMAN
	in blackness, her VOICE DISGUISED.

				WOMAN TWO
			(o.s.)
		No.  You'd be surprised at who a
		working girl meets.  I've been a
		working girl for what? -- over a year
		anyway and that must be a thousand
		men and I don't think there's an age
		or type that hasn't been in there.

				INTERVIEWER'S VOICE
			(voice over)
		Policemen?  -- Doctor? -- Lawyer...?

				WOMAN TWO
			(o.s.)
		Oh, sure.  Television reporters.

	A laugh from the audience.  There is a:

							CUT TO:

	ANOTHER ANGLE - FULL FIGURE
	A WOMAN in blackness.

				WOMAN THREE
			(o.s.)
		I'm seventeen now and I've been
		working the streets for two years
		and I guess to be honest -- I stopped
		thinking of it as temporary.

	The lights come up on the room.  The two screens go black...
	there is general APPLAUSE.  Jane blinks nervously.

				JANE
		Please don't applaud.

	ON AUDIENCE

	Sitting in groups of three -- NEWS TEAM from around the country,
	remarkably similar in comparison...a great looking woman, good
	looking man (either young or attractively avuncular) and a Black
	or Hispanic.  They still APPLAUD -- not yet having grasped the
	sincerity of Jane's plea which she presses with more urgency.

				JANE
		Please.  Don't!!
			(she yells)
		I gathered these pieces as an
		example of what's WRONG with local
		television news.

	The applause stops.

				JANE
		The excerpts from THREE SEPARATE
		SERIES on prostitution were
		SIMULTANEOUSLY broadcast by all
		stations in one city during sweeps
		week.  By what bend of either or
		suspension of duty is that broadcast
		news?

	She pauses half a beat for possible applause -- hearing none,
	she continues.  An anchorman sneezes -- four people shout
	"gesundheit" simultaneously -- they laugh.

				JANE
		The legacy of Edward R. Murrow,
		Eric Sevareid, William Shirer,
		David Brinkley and Walter Cronkite
		is being squandered in a desperate
		popularity contest.  Our profession
		is in danger:

	TRACKING SHOT

	As Jane continues, REVEALING that the news team now have even
	more in common.  They do not like Jane.

				JANE
		Yesterday's compliment has somehow
		managed to become today's kiss of
		death.  To be considered a serious
		journalist is no longer flattering.
		It presents the risk of being labeled
		ponderous, or worse yet, elitest, 
		right?

	SHOT CONTINUES

	Women playing with their hair, young man bored...one
	middle-aged anchorman fusses with a spot on his tie...

	ON JANE

	Briefly departing from text.

				JANE
		All of you know what I'm talking about.  
		We're all trying to act together than 
		we are.  But we care.  So, we're all 
		secretly terrified, aren't we?

	Not a peep -- she is thrown but doggedly presses on with her
	prepared speech though her throat constricts a bit, her voice
	begins to rasp.

				JANE
		We are being increasingly influenced
		by the star system.  The network
		anchormen are so powerful they 
		compromise our last best hope.  The 
		current group is clearly qualified, 
		tied still to our best traditions, but 
		who follows these men?

	TRACKING SHOT MOVES TO TOM GRUNICK

	Seated with other members of his news team, a young blonde
	woman whose hand is resting on his inner leg, a good looking
	Hispanic.  Tom feels a growing excitement -- Jane is not just
	a speaker, she seems a savior.

				TOM
		Wow.

	His female colleague looks at him.

				FEMALE COLLEAGUE
		Oh, I've known so many women like
		that.  They don't like their looks
		so they're angry.

	BACK TO JANE

	Fumbling with her cards, sunk but game -- gamer than she would
	wish.

				JANE
		I was going to talk about other
		trends but...
			(mumbling)
		...the magazine shows, news at
		profit, influence of
		Entertainment Tonight, the danger, the
		hope, the dream, the question...Oh, I
		was going to show you a tape -- a story
		that was carried by all networks on the
		same night -- the same night -- not one
		network noted a major policy change in
		Salt Two nuclear disarmament talks...
		Here's what they ran instead...Go ahead. 
		Show the tape.

	ON MONITORS

	Showing the Japanese Domino Championships as broadcast by all
	networks in the Spring of 1985.  It is quite spectacular -- the
	dominoes falling into one another provoking waves, crossing tiny
	bridges, setting off little fireworks.  JANE'S AUDIENCE applauds
	loudly and squeals with delight.

	ON SCENE

	Jane between the two monitors.  She begins to speak loudly OVER
	the AUDIENCE NOISES of approval.

				JANE
			(loudly)
		I know it's good film.  I know it's
		fun.  I like fun.  It's just not news.
			(as they continue
			 to applaud)
		Well, you're lucky you love it --
		you're going to get a lot more just
		like it.

	STRAY VOICE - SHOUT "GOOD"

	OTHER ANGLE

	Jane sitting rocked into momentary catatonia, by the event.
	Dazed as an animal stung by a tranquilizer dart.  She takes
	some irregular breaths waiting for normal life to return.

	WIDER

	Tom the last person remaining in the room.  He approaches her --
	she is totally unaware of his presence, even when he casually
	mounts the stage with an athletic leap.  It takes courage for
	Tom to fully intrude himself, which he now does:

				TOM
		Hello.

	She looks up at him.

	ANGLE ON TOM

	Earnest, nervous -- handsome...Just when she needed a mirage
	there it is.

				JANE
		Hi.

				TOM
		I just wanted to tell you  how great 
		you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.

				JANE
			(dumbly)
		Thank you.
			(then)
		They hated me.  I don't hate them.

				TOM
		Well, they say if you can reach
		even one person, it means something...
		And you did that.

	Jane looks up at his smile -- a beat then:

				JANE
		Would you like to have dinner
		with me?

	INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	Jane arrives at the maitre d' stand.  She has attempted to dress
	up to the extent that  packing for a short-day trip allows.  She
	looks for Tom.  Tom rises from a table and is immediately at
	her side.

				JANE
		Hi.  I was worried I was early.

				TOM
		I was a lot earlier.

	They are lead to a table and sit down.

				TOM
		I kept thinking what a great break
		it was for me to get to see you
		tonight.  More than a great break,
		maybe just what I needed...just when
		I needed it...Angel of mercy --
		godsend...lifesaver...what?

				JANE
			(picking one)
		I like "godsend."

				TOM
		I haven't been in news that long.
		I've just been looking for the
		right person to talk to.  I have
		about two thousand questions for you.

	He notices that her head has gone into her hands where it
	continues to rest.  He looks at her a beat.

				TOM
		It's possible now's not the right
		time.

	She lifts her head.

				JANE
		If we could just eat first.

				TOM
		Totally understood.  Totally
		wrong of me to talk shop after
		the day you've had.  Totally
		sorry.

				JANE
		Nooo.  If I could just have a
		roll, I'd be okay.

	She takes a roll from the roll plate.  He smiles at her.  She
	takes a bite.

				JANE
		Thank you.

	EXT. CONVENTION HOTEL - NIGHT

	As they walk along -- dumping occasionally and self-consciously.
	Jane is feeling a version of being turned on -- that is, a little
	adrift and temporarily free of obligations.  She is open to
	making a memorable mistake.

				JANE
		Another thing I can't stand --
		Is this dull?

	Tom shakes his head almost violently.

				TOM
		No, no, no, no...

	Jane looks at him curiously -- then:

				JANE
			(broadly)
		Another thing I can't stand is
		...when White House reporters
		bullshit with each other after
		a briefing and then one of them
		has a theory and the other quotes
		it in his story as "White House"
		sources say...

				TOM
		That actually goes on...

				JANE
		Yes.  My room is down here --
		I'm not tired.  Do you want to
		keep talking?

				TOM
		Yes, sure.

	INT. JANE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	A small good room -- her working paraphernalia very much in
	evidence...the quality briefcase...the reams of well organized
	notes...the thick contact book -- Jane is sitting on the bed --
	Tom, not far away in the room's only chair.  One lamp is on
	and it serves to place Jane in the shadows and cast Tom in an
	enormously flattering light.  MUSIC comes from her miniature
	portable STEREO system.

				JANE
		Come on...Even I'm not that
		hard on myself.

				TOM
		No, I really got this job on a
		fluke and wait till you hear where
		it ends up.

	Jane smiles a calming smile.

				JANE
		I was doing sports at the station.
		The newspaper ran this untrue story
		that I was leaving and they got all
		these tons of protest mail.  So they
		made me anchor.

				JANE
		So great -- right?

				TOM
		Except I'm no good at what I'm being
		a success at.

				JANE
		How are you at back rubs?

	Jane shifts her position so that her back is to Tom... He is
	immobilized by the sudden turn.  Jane waits, just a bit longer
	than it would take a man to run from the chair to her side before
	experiencing the ghost-like clutch of rejection.  She moves
	briskly past the moment -- grabbing a "good night" chocolate
	from the pillow and munching it as she return to his agenda.

				JANE
		It's sort of normal -- the way you
		feel.  In graduate school everyone
		thought the only mistake the
		admission committee made was letting
		them in.

	He moves to the bed.

				TOM
		Listen to me.  You keep on thinking
		I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence.
		That's not it.  I know I can talk well
		enough and I'm not bad at making contact
		with people, but I don't like the 
		feeling that I'm pretending to be a 
		reporter.
			(cont'd)
		And half the time I don't really get 
		the news I'm talking about.  It isn't
		that I'm down on myself.  Trust me,
		I stink.

				JANE
			(levelly)
		I trust you.

				TOM
		I didn't even have the chance to get
		really good at sports.  I wasn't bad.
		I thought I was starting to do
		interesting features but hockey is
		big at the station and...

				JANE
			(interrupting)
		What about the obvious remedy?
		Reversing things.  Maybe getting a
		job on a newspaper.

				TOM
		I don't write.

	Jane laughs or, more accurately, scoffs as Tom Continues.

				TOM
		But that didn't stop me from
		sending out audition tapes to
		bigger stations and the networks.

				JANE
		Well, come on -- it is your life.
		Nobody is tying you to the fast
		track.  Did you go to college?

				TOM
		One year...almost one year.

				JANE
		So, you're not well educated and
		you have almost no experience and
		you can't write.

	He nods agreement.

				TOM
		And I'm making a fortune.

	Jane laughs very briefly -- then rubs her face vigorously with
	her hands... He's making her feel a little crazy.  She gets off
	the bed.

				JANE
		It's hard for me to advise you
		since you personify something that
		I truly think is dangerous.

				TOM
		Uh-huh.

				JANE
			(holding it in)
		I agree with you -- you're not qualified.
			(letting it out)
		So get qualified.  You can insist on
		being better prepared.  You don't have
		to just leave it as...
			(mimicking him)
		'I don't write.  I'm not schooled.
		I don't understand the news I'm reading.
		But at least I'm upset about it, folks.'

	A beat, then he mumbles softly to himself.

				TOM
		Whoa, this was a mistake.

				JANE
		Just what do you want from me, anyway?
		Permission to be a fake?  Stop whining
		and do something about it.

	He gets up to leave.  She follows him.

				JANE
		Well, you don't have to start right now.

	He turns to her.

				TOM
		I hated the way you talked to me just
		now...and it wasn't just because you
		were right.

	He exits.

	INT. JANE'S HOTEL - NIGHT

	She is on the phone.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		No.  It wasn't just the speech --
		the same thing happened with this
		guy.  I have passed some line some
		place.  I am beginning to repel people
		I'm trying to seduce.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	As he talks with Jane.

				AARON
			(agreeably)
		He must have been great-looking, right?

				JANE
		Why do you say that?

				AARON
		Because nobody invites a bad-
		looking idiot to their bedroom.

	She smiles.

				AARON
		Okay.  Let's do me.

				JANE
		Sure.

				AARON
		Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but
		do people who are actually slipping
		feel that way or is it always the
		really good people who are moving up
		who invariably think they're slipping
		because their standards are so high?

				JANE
		This conversation is not worthy of you.

				AARON
		I'd give anything if that were true.

				JANE
			(laughing)
		Good night.

				AARON
		Wouldn't this be a great world if
		insecurity and desperation made us
		more attractive?  If needy were a
		turn-on?

				JANE
		Call if you get weird.

	INT. JANE'S HOTEL - NIGHT

	She hangs up -- pulls back the bedspread on the double bed --
	on the other half are papers, schedules -- tapes.  She doesn't 
	clear them off so that she is literally sleeping with her work.  
	The PHONE RINGS.

				JANE
			(answering)
		I was just thinking it was the
		shortest phone conversation we
		ever had.

	EXT. PHONE BOOTH

	A deserted well-lit area.  Tom on the phone.

				TOM
		I never told you the reason I was
		telling you everything for.

				JANE
			(pleasantly surprised
			 it's him)
		Hey?

	INTERCUT:

	ON TOM

				TOM
		Those audition tapes I sent out...
		I've been hired by your network for
		the Washington bureau.  So I'll
		probably see you at work.  Sorry.

	Jane is rocked and soured.

				JANE
		What???

	EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. STREET - MORNING

	Jane and Aaron walking to work -- agitated.

				AARON
		They didn't hire Peter Stiller from
		the Times and he had a great
		audition tape.

				JANE
		You want to start going over who they
		could have gotten?  They can't take on
		people like this for network news.  For
		God's sake.  What's going on?

	INT. NEWS BUILDING LOBBY - DAY

	Tom arrives for first day of work.

	INT. ERNIE MERRIMAN'S OFFICE

	ERNIE MERRIMAN is the network's Washington Bureau Chief.  He
	is in his early 60's, has worked for the network about 40 years
	-- part of the golden age -- a family man, an honorable man,
	a good guy.  Right now he is welcoming Tom to the network
	thereby good-naturedly helping with the destruction of all he
	holds dear.  As he hands Tom his credentials:

				ERNIE
		Any particular area you feel
		strongest in?

				TOM
		To be honest, I was best at anchor.

	Ernie gives him a long look -- is he kidding?

				ERNIE
		Why don't you take a few days observing
		the system?  Then we'll put you on
		general assignment.

	EDITING ROOM - NIGHT

	Two small TV monitors -- a smallish room.  Jane goes over her
	timing notes which correspond to the time code SUPERED on the
	monitors.  BOBBIE -- an extraordinarily silent man -- is doing
	Jane's bidding.  On the monitor we SEE the mercenary piece
	which Jane is editing against a tightening deadline.  The
	PHONE RINGS periodically -- Jane conducting abrupt conversations
	which continuing to edit.  The pressure is palpable to begin
	with but builds and builds; almost like a family fight getting
	out of hand and threatening to bend lives.  Through it all, Jane
	remains remarkable calm.  Her focus is amazing; her command sexy.

				JANE
			(consulting notes)
		Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound
		bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I
		don't know how I'll feel...'

				BOBBIE
		We could...

				JANE
			(interrupting)
		Please, Bobbie, we're pushing.

	As Bobbie expertly reverses the tape, Tom's face appears in
	the glass doorway and then he enters the already crowded room --
	Jane's eyes click to him briefly.  She makes not a move to
	welcome him.  He pauses, but is committed and tries to find
	a piece for himself against the wall.

				TOM
		They said I should observe the...

	Jane is distracted by the noise... Tom leaning over towards her.

				TOM
		They said it would be okay if...

				JANE
			(incredulous)
		We're working here!!  You can stand
		over in the uh, uh, uh...

	She momentarily can't think of the word 'corner.'  Then back
	to Bobbie:

				JANE
		Play back the last line...

				BOBBIE
		He said something about...

				JANE
			(sharply)
		Let me hear it!

	Bobbie, taking the sharp commands with ever increasing,
	yet still repressed resentment.

	The Assistant Director, BLAIR LITTON, enters the editing room.
	She is about 26 and every night since she got her job as
	Assistant Director she has been the first to crack under pressure.

				BLAIR
		We'll need it in ten minutes.  We're
		putting it directly into...

	Jane holds up a finger of warning to Blair as she picks up a
	ringing phone and talks to Bobbie at the same time.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Craig, just a second --
			(to Bobbie)
		Let me hear it!

	Through much of this chaos we focus on:

	TOM

	Wedged into an uncomfortable position between two tape racks --
	He is wide-eyed at this circus of tension and fear.  His eyes
	dart around constantly -- trying to take in as much as he can,
	always returning with wonder to focus on Jane.

				MERCENARY
			(voice over)
		It's been a long time since I've seen
		my folks and all but...I don't expect
		any big-deal homecoming.

				JANE
		Stop there.
			(into phone she's
			 been holding)
		I want to shoot a picture from
		a book I have in the office.

				BLAIR
		You don't have time.  Not a chance.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		I'll be right down.  It's right tight.

	She crosses out.

				BLAIR
		I've got to tell Ernie...because
		there isn't enough time.

				JANE
		Yes, there is.

	Blair leaves, as Jane gathers up her notes.  She charges out
	leaving Tom awkwardly along with Bobbie.

				TOM
		I'm Tom Grunick.  I started on
		General Assignment today.

	Bobbie stops the machine, turns in his chair and shakes hands.
	Then he smiles secretly and speaks his first full sentence.

				BOBBIE
		I don't think she's going to make it.

	Tom exits.

	INT. BUREAU NEWSROOM

	Aaron is having a theoretical discussion with Ernie and
	JENNIFER MACK, a correspondent in her early 40's, a pioneer
	beauties in news.  She is well-schooled, bred, trained and
	known... GEORGE WEIN, a black correspondent in his 40s, and
	MARTIN KLEIN, formerly with the Johnson administration --
	State Department correspondent for the network.

				KLEIN
		Okay, what about this?  Here's a
		tough ethical one.  Would you tell
		a source that you loved them just
		to get some information?

				AARON
		Yes.

				GEORGE
		Yes.

				ERNIE
		Me too.

				JENNIFER
		Sure.

				AARON
		Jennifer didn't know there
		was an alternative.

	Jennifer laughs that laugh one always hopes beautiful women
	will laugh when one says something funny.  Aaron smiles at her.

				AARON
		Here's one.  They allow us to have
		cameras at an execution in Florida.
		Do you broadcast tape of the guy  in
		the chair when they turn on the
		voltage?

				KLEIN
		Sure.

				JENNIFER
		Why not?

				ERNIE
		Absolutely.

				GEORGE
		You bet.

				AARON
		Nothing like wrestling with a
		moral dilemma is there?

	Blair enters the scene, Tom trailing several feet behind,
	continuing to monitor the budding deadline crises.

				BLAIR
		Excuse me, Ernie, we're several minutes
		to air and Jane's shooting an insert
		still for tonight's piece.

				ERNIE
		She knows how much time she has.

	Blair flashes a tortured smile -- panic is growing.

				BLAIR
		Okay.  I just wanted you to know.

				AARON
		What is she shooting?

				BLAIR
		Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'

				AARON
			(thinks then)
		Oh, that's nice...
			(walking away)
		We'll need some new lines.

	INT. EDITING ROOM - NIGHT

	Jane up against it now -- but still seemingly calm.  Tom
	watching, keeps on glancing at the clock fascinated,
	impressed.

				JANE
		Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second
		dissolve to the Rockwell.

				BOBBIE
		Should I...

				JANE
			(interrupting)
		Just a two-second dissolve.

				BLAIR
			(hurting)
		Oh, Jesus, we have three minutes...
		Why do you do this to me.  Is it
		because I won an award?

	INT. RECORDING BOOTH - NIGHT

	Where Aaron is writing his last line on a folded over piece of
	paper even as he gets ready to record.  He times it with a
	stop watch.

				AARON
		Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait
		of a Homecoming  The return of a
		fighting man has always been one of
		the more moving ceremonies of war...
		Tearful women, proud men, excited
		children.  But J.D. Singer was right --
		his homecoming was no big deal.

	INT. EDITING ROOM - NIGHT

				BLAIR
		We have a minute and a half.  It's my
		responsibility to tell them we won't
		be ready.

				JANE
		Uh-uh.  We're be ready.

	Blair glances frantically at her watch.

				BLAIR
		In 84 seconds?

	ON CLOCK

	Sweeping from 28 minutes to -- 84 seconds from deadline.  Aaron
	walks in, Jane looks up.

				JANE
			(hopefully)
		Nine seconds.

				AARON
		Eleven and a half.

				JANE
		Oh, God.  Back it, Bobbie -- Bobbie?

	ALMOST SIMULTANEOUS DIALOGUE FOLLOWS.  IT BUILDS UNTIL IT
	DUPLICATE THE SOUND OF LOUD AND BAWDY SEX.

				BLAIR
		You're saying 'Oh, God..."  They are
		going to go to up and the screen will
		be black -- they're going to go to black
		because we're not there.  How about
		careers, huh?  How about careers?

	ON CLOCK

	42 seconds away.

				BLAIR
		We're not going to make it.

	Bobbie makes a small bobble -- Jane giving the merest evidence
	of the strain, scratching her face repeatedly.

				BOBBIE
		Whoops.

				BLAIR
			(unravelling)
		Whoops?!?  Whoops?!?  No, please...
		no, ooh, ahhh, ohhh.

				AARON
		Shit, shit, shit...

				TOM
			(caught up)
		You're almost there, you can do it --
		can do -- can do.

	And as the pitch reaches its zenith, 27 seconds left.  Bobbie
	hands the tape to Blair.

				BOBBIE
		Ready.

	INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT

	Blair hikes up her skirt and takes off.

	VARIOUS SHOTS

	Our "chase scene" as Blair soars through the newsroom, leaping a
	chair smoothly, smashing her leg against a table in full flight,
	the adrenaline deadening the pain -- she arrives at a waiting
	elevator -- uses a key dangling from her neck to unlock it... jumps
	nervously during the ride and now, in FULL EXTENDED FLIGHT, barrels
	down the long corridor heading to the control room where she
	arrives; slamming the tape into a technician's hand even as it is
	introduced on the air.

	INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT

	Aaron, Jane, the others looking at the end of the piece on the
	air -- Tom in the b.g. as Blair enters -- relaxed, almost jaunty.

				BLAIR
		I was a little nervous there for
		a minute.

				AARON
		Oh, come on -- tell us another.

	ON MONITOR

	The end of the piece -- the Rockwell painting giving way to the
	mercenary's actual homecoming which matches the portrait.  The 
	irony works nicely.  The network anchorman comes up for his close.  
	BILL RORISH, 50 years old and able to flutter much younger pulses.  
	He is able and experienced -- a reporter who has become a 
	journalistic king.

				BILL
			(on monitor, smiling)
		Bill Rorish...Thank you...Good night.

				JENNIFER
		Look at that smile.  Oh, that was
		good and oh my, Bill smiled -- he
		liked it.

				AARON
		He loved it.  Big smile.

	He gives Jane a congratulatory sock in the shoulder which she
	returns -- Tom in the b.g. of the SHOT.

				BLAIR
		I haven't seen Bill smile like that
		in weeks.

	Ernie has walked a few steps to the office.

				BLAIR
		Ernie, you missed his close... He smiled.
			(mimicking)
		Thank you...Good night.

	She smiles.

				ERNIE
		I saw the smile -- good piece.

				AARON
		I'm gonna go look at it again.

	They leave -- Aaron waving to Tom who stands in the b.g.  The
	others leave.  Tom approaches Jane.

				TOM
		I'm sorry if I was in the way.  It
		was totally impressive.  Great piece.

				JANE
			(somewhat formal)
		You weren't.  Thanks.  How does it
		feel being here?

				TOM
		I can't believe I'm really here.  No
		kidding.  If you're through work now --

				JANE
		No.  Aaron and I go to Central America
		on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.

				TOM
		I thought you were incredible in there.
		I know how much I have to learn.  I'd
		really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...

				JANE
		'Really a lot appreciate it...'

				TOM
		You  make me nervous.  Anyway if I
		can pick your brain --

	Jane grimaces at "pick your brain."

				JANE
		I can't help you, sorry.  I'm not
		here to teach remedial reporting.

				TOM
		And it has nothing to do with the fact
		I left your room instead of staying 
		there?

	Jane looks at him.

				JANE
		Oh, please.
			(then, almost gently)
		You're gonna have to understand
		something.  This isn't personal.

	She exits.

	EXT. CENTRAL AMERICAN JUNGLE - MORNING

	As Aaron, Jane and their CREW march along with a CONTRA SQUAD deep
	in their own conversation.  Except for the DIN of TROPICAL BIRDS
	they seem almost like a cranky married couple on their way to work.

				AARON
		I didn't sleep.  They're giving me less
		and less air time.  They don't think
		I'm at all anchor material.

				JANE
		If we don't get to their camp soon,
		we won't be able to tape the supplies
		coming in.

				AARON
		Last time Paul was sick they gave
		Connie the weekend news instead of me.

				JANE
		You spend too much time -- much too
		much worrying about that crap...
			(suddenly reacting)
		Oh good.

	They have entered a clearing where supplies have been dropped,
	the Guerrillas already tearing apart boxes with army boots
	inside.

	ANGLE ON

	A guerrilla soldier rubbing his shoeless foot.  A pair of new boots 
	sit alongside him.  Jane's Cameraman prepares to shoot, saying in 
	Spanish, then English:

				CAMERAMAN
		Put on the boot.

	Jane rushes into the scene incensed.

				JANE
		Stop!  We are not here to stage the news.
		Wait and see what he does.

	Then to the totally confused soldier.

				JANE (cont'd)
		Sir, you do whatever you want.  It's
		your choice.

	By now there is a fair-sized cluster of armed men as well as
	the news team staring at the guerrilla, who is at loss as to
	what is expected.  He looks to Jane, who can offer no help
	save her own determination not to interfere.  Finally he puts
	on the boot.

				JANE
			(to Cameraman)
		Okay.

	He shoots the scene.

	INT. HAY ADAMS HOTEL

	Tom, in shirt and tie, is on the phone.  This is a big day.

				TOM
		Okay, I'll meet the crew there then.
		Could you give me that address again?
		Great.  Yes, it's good to finally be
		getting to work.  Okay that's
		17204?  1-7-2-0-4.  Thanks.

	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

	As Tom gets directions from the CONCIERGE.

				CONCIERGE
		It's only ten minutes if you prefer
		to walk...
			(as he walks away)
		I'll look for you on the news tonight.

	EXT. HOTEL - DAY

	Tom has a real sense of the moment -- of having arrived.  The
	strange bubble of pleasure rises to the surface as he walks off
	to cover his first story.  He laughs out loud, loving his lot.

	EXT. CENTRAL AMERICAN JUNGLE - LATER AFTERNOON

	Jane in the f.g. with her crew while Aaron talks in rapid Spanish
	to the GUERRILLA LEADERS.

				AARON (in Spanish)
		Are you guys kidding or do you really
		think you'll run into something...?
		I mean, do you feel that every time
		and it never happens?  Or is it the
		first time it felt that way and it's
		going to happen?... I mean, how bad
		can it be?... Are you nervous...?
		What's the chances on a scale of one
		to ten -- that we're going to be in
		a war within the next few hours?...
		Really?

	He starts to walk towards Jane -- one of the men he was
	talking with calling after him with an added thought.

				AARON
		Thanks, you speak English very well
		too.
			(to Jane)
		Great news.  He says they've been
		engaging the Sandinistas pretty
		regularly and that he'd be really
		surprised if we didn't take fire 
		tonight.

	Jane reacts -- a flash of exhilaration.  Aaron is amazed at her
	attitude.

				AARON
		Look at her.
			(to Jane)
		If anything happens to me tell every
		woman I've ever dated I was talking
		about them at the end.  That way they'll
		have to reevaluate me.

	Jane laughs out loud, attracting the Guerrillas' attention.
	Aaron repeats his speech in Spanish.  The Guerrillas laugh.

	EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

	Aaron and Jane in line behind the Guerrillas.  They HEAR A SHOT.
	The head of the patrol gestures -- deploying his men.  Aaron
	grabs Jane and heads for some cover to the left.  As they run --
	more SHOTS.  Jane in work mode.  As soon as they settle.

				JANE
		Let's tape.

				CAMERAMAN
			(Spanish accent)
		Much too dark.  Black.

				JANE
		That's okay.

	ON AARON BARELY DISCERNIBLE

	As they start taping he is breathless with the nervousness of
	the nearly gunfire.

				AARON
		The first shots were fired not thirty
		seconds ago.  The Contras feel they
		must be outnumbered this is so small
		a unit:  that's a given.  Still they
		hold their ground despite the fact
		that their weapons have been acting
		up -- misfiring or jamming.  A new
		shipment of rifles is expected tomorrow --
		all they got today were the shoes.

	There is the SOUND OF GUNFIRE.

				JANE
			(to Cameraman)
		Okay.
			(to Aaron)
		Great line at the end.

				AARON
		Did you shoot their boots?

				JANE
		Of course.

				AARON
		We can cut back at the end.

				JANE
		To the pan of the supplies boxes --

				AARON
		Can you believe it?  I just risked my
		life for a network that tests my face
		with focus groups.

	EXT. GOVERNMENT BLDG - AFTERNOON

	Tom, squashed in amidst a small mob of reporters... behind a
	police line.  He HEARS a reporter next to him say:

				REPORTER
		I think he's coming out now.

				TOM
			(to his crew)
		They say he's coming out now.

	A surge.

				TOM
			(to Reporter)
		Is that him?

				TOM'S CAMERAMAN
		Yes.

	Tom checks his notes.


	INSERT - TOM'S BLACK BOOK

	The same model we've seen Jane use.  A list of questions
	written in big color highlighted letters.  As he looks down
	to study them, everyone else moves suddenly off.

	TOM'S P.O.V.

	The mass of journalists and technicians shouting questions.
	"Will you dispatch troops?" after the Ambassador they've been
	awaiting -- clumping on his limo and then being shaken by the
	movement of the vehicle.

	ON TOM

	Standing alone and forlorn as his crew trots back.

				CAMERAMAN
			(observing Tom)
		What's wrong?

				TOM
		I had a lot of questions here.  I
		missed the story.

				CAMERAMAN
		Don't worry, it's okay.  I got
		a piece of his face.

	EXT. GUERRILLAS CAMP - MORNING

	Jane is standing -- talking to her crew.  Others asleep
	in b.g. -- a drowsy, morning-after feeling.

				JANE
		Are you all packed and ready?

				CAMERAMAN
		The stuff in the dark is not good.
		Nobody wants news lit like that.

				JANE
		Will you just get packed?

	She waves him off -- then she walks several yards away, holding
	a knapsack in her hand.  She takes off a brush and runs it
	through her hair -- opens a plastic case and takes out a travel
	toothbrush, brushes her teeth and rinses her mouth with water
	from her canteen.  She puts everything back in place, then looks
	about, sobs for several beats.  One of the Guerrillas hears her
	sobbing and enters the scene -- he stands a respectful distance
	away.  Jane finishes, notices him, makes a face by way of
	explanation, and exits the scene feeling measurably better.

	INT. WASHINGTON CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	The Washington Control Room.  Jennifer, Jane, Aaron, Blair stand
	watching the intro to the Central American piece.  Tom stands in
	the distant b.g.  There are over a dozen monitors -- including
	one which is constantly on the anchor man, Bill Rorish.

	ON TELEVISION MONITORS

	Bill Rorish on camera -- an INSERT behind showing Aaron in
	blackness planted into a Central American map bordered by rifles.
	A separate monitor shows the INSERT alone.

				BILL (voice over)
		A fire fight along the Nicaraguan
		border...in one minute.

	The INSERT MOVES OUT AT US TO FILL THE SCREEN -- WE SEE Aaron's
	dim outline and HEAR him say:

				AARON (voice over; on camera)
		The first shots were fired not thirty
		seconds ago.

	The MUSICAL "EVENING NEWS" SIGNATURE COMES IN ever-so-briefly.
	The SCREEN GOES TO A COMMERCIAL -- as Blair screams
	enthusiastically.

				BLAIR
		Great graphic, great graphic.

	Ernie ENTERS THE  SCENE... He kisses Jane in greeting -- pats
	Aaron on the back.

				ERNIE
		You finally got a piece in a few
		minutes early and I hear Bill loved it.

	Jennifer gives Jane a mock pat on the back.

				ERNIE (continuing)
		I have somebody downstairs who one of
		the clerks brought in and vouches for.
		He says he has something to say about
		gays getting promotions at State...
		It can't hurt to tape him.

	ON JANE

	As she feels Tom staring at her -- turns and notices him
	for the first time.

				TOM
		Hi.

				JANE
		How's it going?

				TOM
		Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?

				JANE
			(thrown)
		I just got back -- I don't know
		which end is up.

				TOM
		Okay.

	In the b.g. WE MAY HAVE NOTICED Bill Rorish on one monitor as he
	picks up the phone at his anchor desk, during the commercial
	break.

				BLAIR
		Jane!  Bill Rorish wants to speak
		to you at the break.
			(as she hands it to her)
		I never heard of him handing over
		compliments in the middle of the
		show.

	There is a stillness in the Control Room as Jane speaks to the
	anchor man in New York who WE CAN VIEW on a monitor.

	ON MONITOR

	We see Bill Rorish.

				BILL
			(into phone)
		Jane?

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Yes.

				BILL
			(into phone)
		Well, darling, if it gets any better than
		that, I'm going to have to bring you up
		here to New York.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Thanks.  I just wish you'd kept the first
		twenty seconds.

	Blair cringes at Jane's blunt reply.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		But thanks.

				BILL
			(over phone)
		Well, the visual with the boots at the
		end was just perfect.

	Jane covers the mouthpiece and turns to Aaron.

				JANE
		God, he loved the boots.

	Aaron reaches happily for the phone.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Aaron should be hearing this so I
		have an extra witness.

				BILL
			(over phone)
		Well, you always want to give the 
		credit away, do you?

				JANE
			(into phone)
		No, I don't.  He happens to deserve
		the credit.  He's right here.

				BILL
			(over phone)
		I'll speak to you soon

	We see Rorish over the monitor.  He hangs up.

				JANE
			(to Aaron)
		He had to read over some new copy.

	We see on the monitor that this is not so.  It's a very eggy moment
	Aaron.  Tom breaks the silence.

				TOM
			(to the rescue)
		Okay if I watch you tape that interview
		downstairs?

				AARON
		Yeah.

	As he passes Jane he leans next to her and WE HEAR him WHISPER.

				AARON
		Please laugh so they think I'm not
		dying inside but have so much style
		I just said something funny.

	Jane does her part enormously well -- laughing with amusement...
	but her eyes blaze -- her friend has been needlessly humiliated.
	Blair wants desperately to be inside Aaron's joke.

				BLAIR
		What did he say?

				JANE
			(as if still amused)
		I'll never tell.

	INT. SMALL TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT

	BUDDY FELTON waits alone.  A CAMERA CREW watches him.  He is
	well dressed, exceedingly nervous.  He summons the courage to
	ask a question.

				BUDDY
		Could I see how I photograph?

				CAMERAWOMAN
		Huh?  Sorry?

				BUDDY
		'Cause for the interview they're
		going to use a screen and disguise
		me to protect my anonymity so could
		I see myself before that?

				CAMERAWOMAN
		Sure.

	The Camerawoman punches a button and immediately Buddy's image
	comes up on a standing monitor on the studio floor.  He's not
	happy with the image -- but works at concealing his reaction --
	gasping a bit of air -- trying to touch it.  Aaron enters.
	Tom smiles a friendly smile which flusters Buddy momentarily.
	But again he almost manages to conceal his private rush.  Buddy's
	internal drama is such he invariably finds himself covering up,
	fearful roomfuls of people will simultaneously guess his
	thoughts.

	Aaron directs him behind a screen and looks at his notes.

				AARON
		It's Mr. Buddy Felton?

				BUDDY
		Yes.

				AARON
		That's your full name?

				BUDDY
		Yes.

				AARON
		I might as well ask you the questions
		on tape.  Is that all right?

				BUDDY
		Yes.

				AARON
		You worked at one time as 
		Foreign Service Trainee in the
		State Department.

				BUDDY
		I was there two years and was promoted
		on merit nine times.

				AARON
		Eventually rising to...

				BUDDY
		Office Bimbo. 
			(curbing his amusement) 
		No, I'm sorry.

	Aaron is having a hard enough day,  He is visibly annoyed.

				AARON
		You're saying the fact that you're
		gay had something directly to do with
		your promotions?

				AARON
		Eventually rising to?

				BUDDY

		G.S.  I don't know.
			(scratches his head)
		I don't know numbers.

	Tom laughs.  Aaron shoots him a look.

				AARON
		You're saying the fact that you're gay had
		something directly to do with your promotions?

				BUDDY
		I don't like the word gay.

				AARON
		Which would you prefer?

				BUDDY
		Ravenous homosexual.

				AARON
		Stop the tape, okay.  Forget it,
		Ellen.  Let's call security and
		get him out.

	As Aaron walks out -- Tom is momentarily fixed on the sight of Buddy
	walking in small circles giving himself a talking to.

				BUDDY
			(self flagellating)
		Great time to act out, Buddy.  You
		won't be happy until you turn the
		whole world off.

	He notices Tom.

				BUDDY
		They're not really going to call
		security are they?

				TOM
		No, I don't think so.

				BUDDY
		How do I get out of here?

				TOM
		Follow me.

				BUDDY
			(dazzled)
		You talked me into it.

	INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	Tom distracted -- his day has been a bit of a bummer.  Buddy
	self conscious -- the proximity creating an almost unbearable
	tension of romance and adventure.

	INT. BUILDING LOBBY - NIGHT

	A Guard on duty -- a BLACK WOMAN.  She sees Buddy.

				GUARD
		Oh, you're the gay guy.  I was just
		coming to find you.

				BUDDY
		I'm leaving.

				TOM
			(to Guard)
		It's okay.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	Walking.  Buddy in step with him.

				BUDDY
		Sir?

	Tom turns.  Buddy talks rather quickly -- He cares very much
	about leaving Tom with the right impression.  The last words
	of his speech he hadn't expected to say.

				BUDDY (cont'd)
		Thank you for not shunning me and
		all.
			(more)
		I really did have all that information
		but I thought I might just be being
		vindictive to get a little hunk of
		the ol' spotlight.  I know, horrible --
		but I didn't do it, so okay?  And
		thanks again and would you like to
		have a drink -- at a regular bar?

				TOM
		Oh, sure.  Okay.

	His heart racing, Buddy attempts casual matter-of-factness.

				BUDDY
		Is there a regular bar around here?

	INT./ENT. REGULAR BAR - NIGHT

	Tom and Buddy on adjoining stools.  For Tom, the last weeks have
	been humbling, antagonistic.  He's enjoying Buddy who listens
	attentively and wholeheartedly endorses every word Tom speaks.

				TOM
		I've been doing some morning show
		stuff, but mostly radio -- that doesn't
		bother me.  I'm in no rush for
		anything.  It's just the snotty
		attitude, even if I have it coming,
		it's still...

				BUDDY
		Bad manners.

				TOM
		Yes.  That's right.

				BUDDY
		I know...I mean you didn't do anything
		special for me tonight.  You just had
		what I think are good manners, decency.
		And it really makes me want to be nice
		back and it has nothing to do with any
		homosexual thing.
			(looks right at him)
		Honestly.
			(then away)
		Because I don't know if you've
		homosexual or not and -- you're not,
		are you?

				TOM
		No...no.

				BUDDY
		One's enough.

	Tom signals for the check.

				BUDDY (cont'd)
		I wasn't doing anything.

				TOM
		I really have to go.

				BUDDY
		Okay.  At least let me show my
		appreciation.  The Secretary of Labor
		is going to be indicted on Wednesday.
		For the graft thing he supposedly did
		before he was appointed.

				TOM
		What?

				BUDDY
		Yes, it's true.  They're going to
		make it public Wednesday but isn't
		it a big deal for you to have it a
		day and a half early?

				TOM
		Yes.  How do you know?

				BUDDY
			(shrugs)
		My roommate's very social -- somebody
		from Justice was over and...I always
		hear things before they happen.  Hey,
		and from now on, so do you.

	INT. ERNIE'S OFFICE - DAY

	George Weln, the black correspondent and Tom are seated in the
	office with Ernie -- they are in mid-meeting.

				GEORGE
		I'm virtually certain it's not true.
		He may be indicted eventually, but I
		don't think it will be this month.

				ERNIE
			(to Tom)
		You want to be alone with me --
		tell me your source?

				TOM
		If I told you I'm not sure it would 
		totally convince you, but I totally 
		believe the guy.

				GEORGE
			(insufferable)
		Labor is my Department -- I can't
		conform it and my contacts go very
		deep.

				TOM
		So if it's true -- I'm terrific,
		right?

				ERNIE
		It's not even a close call.  Of
		course we can't go with it.

	INT. EDITING ROOM - FOLLOWING DAY

	Jane is working with Bobbie the editor... Snatches of the tape
	make it obvious that the Labor Secretary has been indicted --
	George Weln stands behind Jane, who is dialing a number.

				BOBBIE
		Do you want him all the way to the 
		car?

				JANE
		No stop where he's all besieged.

				BOBBIE
		Because...

				JANE
			(to Bobbie)
		Right there, Bobbie.

	Tom enters.

				TOM
		So he was indicted?

				JANE
		Yes.

				GEORGE
		We were right not to go with it.

				TOM
		But I was right -- just somebody give
		it to me.  I had a good story.

				JANE
			(to George)
		Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.

				TOM
		Ah, I don't want any credit.  Bobbie
		and I serve anonymously.

	He pats Bobbie on the back... and exits.

				BOBBIE
			(pausing in his work)
		You know, I like Tom, because hi...

				JANE
		Bobbie, please.

	INT. METRO BUS - DAY

	Crowded rush hour... Buddy and Tom stand next to each other.

				BUDDY
		...and the White House is hoping to
		keep a lid on it for a few days till
		they figure out what to do.

				TOM
		Thanks a lot, Buddy.

				BUDDY
			(brushing it off)
		Oh, please.  So they were really
		impressed with you at work.

				TOM
		Not impressed exactly -- but a break
		in the clouds.

				BUDDY
		I see the change in you -- I see it.

	INT. WHITE HOUSE PRESS ROOM - DAY

	The 10 A.M. briefing just breaking up -- Jennifer leaves her
	network seat in the front row, only to be grabbed by Tom who
	steers her outside.

	EXT. WHITE HOUSE EAST WING - DAY

	In the near distance a circular driveway and a silent armed
	MARINE GUARD, standing at attention.

				TOM
			(to Jennifer)
		So he bought this Peugeot sedan at
		a greatly reduced price while he was
		there in charge of the White House
		Advance Team.

				JENNIFER
		How come you're not chasing it down
		yourself?

				TOM
		Look, I'm junior man -- and it's
		your beat.

				JENNIFER
		Boy, that's nice...I wish we could
		all deal with each other like this.
		I'll check it.  Anything I can do
		for you?

				TOM
		This is my first time at the White House.
		Is there any chance to look at where
		he works and the rest of it?

				JENNIFER
		I didn't have the guts to ask when
		I first came up.  I'll get you a
		great tour.

	INT. BAR - EARLY EVENING

	Buddy and Tom watching the Evening News as Jennifer finishes
	her story.

				JENNIFER
			(voice over; on TV set)
		The President says it's not a violation
		but nonetheless White House sources
		say the full price will be paid for the
		Peugeot and new rules will put future
		bargain hunting off limits for
		Presidential Aides.  This is Jennifer Mack
		at the White House.

	Tom and Buddy smile at each other... energized -- up.

				BUDDY
		Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating
		being a news source.

				TOM
		Nobody else had it.

				BUDDY
		I wish it were you giving the story.

				TOM
		That's okay.

				BUDDY
		What if we just don't tell them
		anything anymore unless they let
		you do the story?

				TOM
		No.  Really...don't worry about it.

				BUDDY
		Okay.  And look, in the future I can
		call you when I have news for you.
		Don't feel you have to spend time
		with me just to get the information.
			(a breath; then
			 to himself)
		Well, that wasn't as hard to say as
		you thought, was it, Buddy?

				TOM
		What do you mean?  You're one of the
		few people in this town I can talk
		to.

	Buddy puts his hand to his heart and makes a LOUD SOUND OF
	RAPTURE.

				BUDDY
		Hoooo.

	The BARTENDER and some nearby patrons turn and look.  Tom shifts
	with discomfort.

				TOM
		Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore.

				BUDDY
			(simply)
		Okay.

	INT. WASHINGTON BUREAU - NIGHT

	Jane waiting for an elevator... It comes and she steps on just
	as Tom clearly excited comes around the bend from Ernie's office
	calling for her.  He goes to the stairs.

	INT. WALKWAY - NIGHT

	He runs out and sees Jane in the lobby below, then takes off
	after her.

	INT. LOBBY - NIGHT

	As he enters and runs outside, looking in both directions then
	running off to the right.  A BEAT -- REVEALING Jane has stopped
	to talk with Blair -- now she exits.

	EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - NIGHT

	Tom on the street, ahead of her, thinking he's behind her...
	He runs another half a block and stops dejected... Turns to walk
	back to the office.  He keeps looking back to see if he missed
	her, so that his head is turned as Jane reaches him, says a
	fairly social:

				JANE
		Hi, how are you?

	She keeps moving -- Tom spinning after her.

				TOM
		Wait -- I need you.

	She stops.

				TOM
		I've got another story.

				JANE
		Some public official skipped a week
		on his Christmas Club?

				TOM
		The House Armed Service Committee
		has a secret report which says that
		the General Stillwell tank the Army
		has dumped a fortune into plain 
		won't work.  I have it cold,
		confirmed.  They have five million
		dollars in this thing already.

				JANE
		Billion.

				TOM
		Okay, billion...right, of course.
		They told me I could have any producer
		I wanted -- and I want you.

	As Tom savors the moment.

	INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - EVENING

	Various bureau personnel standing at their desks watching Tom's
	piece being broadcast.  We SEE a TANK MISFIRING.

				TOM
			(voice over)
		One source referred to it as a
		five billion dollar metal sculpture
		to ugly to look at and too big to bury.

				AARON
			(to Jane)
		You write this?

				JANE
		I write for you sometimes.

				AARON
		Not because you have to.

	ON MONITOR

	We SEE a General walking away from Tom.

				TOM
			(voice over)
		General Elton McGuire is in charge of
		the weapon system.

	ON MONITOR - TWO SHOT

				GENERAL
		I've been in the Army twenty-seven
		years -- so I'll let the Army ask
		the questions, not you.

				TOM
		General, I don't want to bother you
		anymore or your family.  But tomorrow
		there will be a mob of me back here --
		so, if you have anything to say, why
		not say it now, sir, the way you want?

	ON TOM

	He is a study.

	Looking at himself -- and though it's far from his first time on
	television -- it's the first time he's seen himself doing serious
	work and, by all appearances, doing it well.  As the General
	answers in the b.g. --

				BLAIR
		I think it's great of us to have left
		in what you said -- just great of us.

	Tom smiles modestly.

				AARON
		Yeah, let's never forget.  We're
		the real story.  Not them.

	Tom and Jane look over -- then Tom looks to Jane for a verdict.
	In the b.g., the news goes to a commercial.

				JANE
		Yeah, I know, I went back and forth
		on it.

				BLAIR
		I liked it.  He's not afraid to be
		human.

	Ernie ENTERS THE SCENE with his fourteen-year-old DAUGHTER
	in tow... He approaches Tom.

				ERNIE
		My youngest wanted to meet you.
		This is Ellie.

				TOM
		Hi, Ellie.

				ERNIE
		You should be honored -- she
		never cares about meeting
		anyone here.  But she liked you
		on television just now.

				AARON
			(entering scene)
		Hi, Ellie -- remember me?

				ELLIE
		I'm sorry -- from where?

				AARON
		I've been to your house a lot...

				ERNIE
			(helping)
		And Aaron went on that fourteen
		day raft trip with us last year.

				ELLIE
			(vaguely)
		Oh yes -- hi.

	INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT (LATE)

	Tom is on the phone.

				TOM
			(into phone)
		Hi, Dad...Did you see it?  Great --
		I'll send you a tape...I'm sorry I
		haven't called.  Things were a little
		bumpy for a while.  It's not important...
		I'm fine now.
			(what he's been
			 wanting to say aloud)
		Hey, Dad -- I just may be able to
		do this job...Well, I'm glad you
		were sure.

	INT. ERNIE MARRIMAN'S VIRGINIA HOME - DAY

	Ernie is hosting the news staff for Sunday brunch -- they stand
	around drinking in small groups... Aaron is standing with Blair
	and a MAN in his fifties we have not seen before.

				BLAIR
		I don't know why we have to feel
		defensive about it.  Newspapers
		are in business to make money --
		why not us?

	Aaron looks at her in amazement.

				BLAIR
		They criticize us for supposedly
		pandering while they run WINGO
		Games.

				GREY HAIRED MAN
			(amused)
		Exactly right.  Excuse me.  I'm
		paid to mix.

	Blair and Aaron laugh appreciatively as he walks off to another
	group.

				BLAIR
		Goodbye, Paul.

				AARON
		Take care, Paul.
			(back to Blair)
		It takes a certain kind of courage
		for you to say that in front of
		the President of the News Division.

				BLAIR
		You think anyone who's proud of
		the work we do is an ass kisser.

				AARON
		No.  I think anyone who puckers their
		lips and presses it against his boss'
		buttocks and then smooches is an ass
		kisser.

				BLAIR
		My gosh, and for a while there, I was
		attracted to you.

	She walks off.

				AARON
		Wait a minute -- that changes
		everything.

	ON JANE

	At the bar getting a drink.

	Jennifer ENTERS THE SCENE... and leads Jane down the hall until
	they are standing alone.

				JENNIFER
		This is very awkward.

				JANE
		Go ahead -- what?

				JENNIFER
		Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but
		I see Tom around you a lot and this
		is such a small office and I'd like
		to see him outside of work, unless
		there's some reason for you to mind...
		in which case I just won't do anything.

				JANE
		God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind?
		Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What
		a shock -- I don't have a right to...
		I don't think I like him.  I know
		I don't respect him...So what am
		I talking about -- what am I saying
		to you?

				JENNIFER
		You're saying stay away from him.

				JANE
			(stupefied)
		I can't be.

	She blinks in wonder.

				JENNIFER
		We don't have to settle this
		definitively right now.

	Jennifer moves toward the drinking table -- Jane, unsteadied
	by the dose of self-revelation, moves towards Aaron's circle
	and scratches his back in friendship... Tom approaches an she
	moves off -- not wanting to deal with him.  She takes a few
	breaths as she keeps walking.  We HEAR snatches of PARTY
	CONVERSATIONS, i.e:

				GEORGE WELN
		Tell me one person who ever left
		television news to work on a
		newspaper.

	She moves on; Tom still following.

				ERNIE'S WIFE
			(holding Paul's arm)
		I felt so proud when he turned
		down News Vice President so we
		could stay here.  Suddenly, after
		all these years, we have a life.

	Jane turns -- sees that Tom is still looking at her from a few
	feet away.

				JANE
			(badly)
		Hi, Tom.

	She stands there, genuinely frightened.  She must deal with him
	now.  He crosses to her.

				TOM
		It's the firs time I've seen 
		you dressed like this.  You look
		so clean and pretty.

				JANE
		What do you mean clean?

				TOM
		At work there's always this
		sort of film over you.

				JANE
		Well, thumps like me leave appearance
		to guys like you.

				TOM
		You're great at taking the edge
		off a good time.

	Jane starts twitching.  She pauses -- holds a hand lightly on
	his arm to steady herself.

				TOM
		You okay?

				JANE
		Yes.  Just don't say anything mean
		for a while.  Thanks.

	She meets his gaze for an instant -- and, in that instant, loses
	control for the first time in her memory.  She looks strange as
	she retreats from this glimpse of upheaval.

				JANE
		I've got to find someone.  It's
		important.  Excuse me.

	She walks away.

	ON AARON AND ERNIE

				ERNIE
		I had the strangest thing happen
		yesterday.  Anne and I have been
		married what? -- Thirty-six years...
		Everything fine -- two days after the
		promotion came through, I was checking
		myself in the mirror and she was
		making a face at me behind my back.
		So yesterday I looked in the mirror
		and she was doing it again.

				AARON
		You didn't say anything to her?

	He shakes his head.

				ERNIE
		My instincts tell me not to.

	Annie comes up.

				ANNE
		The office is phoning, honey.

	He EXITS SCENE as Anne watches him go.

				ANNE
		I hope he moves that fast when
		it's me on the line.

	ON JANE

	As she passes a chair with an afghan shawl on the back -- she
	picks it up and wraps it around herself, a bit chilled.  She
	sees Jennifer on the stairs and moves toward her calling in a
	too loud, anxiety-ridden voice as she goes.

				JANE
		Jennifer.  Hey, Jennifer.

	ON STAIRCASE

	Jennifer turning as Jane whips up the stairs.

				JANE
		Forget what I said -- you do
		whatever you want to with him.

	She pushes at Jennifer a little.

				JENNIFER
		Well, there's nothing I'm going
		to do right this second.

	Jane pushes her again.

				JENNIFER
		But it's a party, right?

	Jane smiles back feigning female bonding -- Jennifer goes back
	down the steps and crosses to Tom.

	FULL SCENE

	Aaron takes in Jane, who is taking in Jennifer and Tom -- then
	Aaron begins to sense a new dynamic in the room as Ernie re-enters
	and huddles briefly with Paul... The News President is intent...
	The two of them walk over to Tom and Jennifer.  We PICK UP just
	a few words:

				ERNIE
		This would be a good time to tap
		that source of yours.  He could
		have an angle or something.

	AARON'S P.O.V.

	Tom is startled but cool -- nods his head -- Jennifer is amazed
	looking at Tom with new and even prettier eyes... Paul and Ernie
	now move toward Jane, a whole flow of movement creating a new
	energy in the area.  Jane sheds her Afghan as she rises to meet
	them.

				ERNIE
			(to Jane)
		We want you to exec produce a
		Special Report...

				JANE
		What?

	Aaron has come over to join them now in time to HEAR.

				ERNIE
		A Libyan plane shot up one of our
		bases in Egypt.  It's all still
		happening.

				JANE
		Let's figure out the field.

				ERNIE
		Unfortunately, since Paul's here,
		he's made out the assignments...
		Jennifer at the White House...
		George at the Pentagon...Martin
		at State...and we need an anchor
		since Rorish is in his boat, so we're
		gonna do the whole report this
		afternoon from here...with Tom.

				AARON
		That's it.  I resign as of now.

				ERNIE
			(to Aaron)
		Stop it.

				AARON
		I'll tell you what.  I'll stay if
		Tom knows how to spell Gaddafi.

				JANE
		Ernie, as much as I like you, I
		think I have to tell Paul what I
		think, because this is really sort
		of obscenely stupid.

				ERNIE
		Jane, if you want to, go ahead.  I
		don't disagree with you.

	Jane moves quickly off, awed at the prospect of taking on the
	big boss.

	ON JANE

	As she moves past Tom who is talking on the phone, eventually
	catching up with Paul.  In the b.g. Tom has just HEARD the
	"BEEP" of an ANSWERING MACHINE.

				TOM
		Hello, Buddy.  It's 1:35 -- and
		this is Tom.  You can reach me
		at the office.  It's important.
		I can use a little help.

	Jane, because of the proximity to Tom is speaking in whispered
	intensity.

				JANE
		Tom isn't ready for the job
		you're about to hand him.  Not
		near ready.  Not by the longest
		shot.  Aaron's spent six weeks
		in Tripoli, he's interviewed
		Gaddafi -- he reported on the
		Eight-one story.  I think he's
		essential to do the job we're
		capable of and I think it's my
		responsibility to tell you that.

				PAUL
		Okay, that's your opinion.  I
		don't agree.

				JANE
		It's not opinion.

				PAUL
		You're just absolutely right
		and I'm absolutely wrong?

	She nods.

				PAUL
		It must be nice to always believe
		you know better.  To think you're
		always the smartest person in the
		room.

				JANE
			(from her depths)
		No, it's awful.  Oh my, it's awful.

				JANE
			(turning to leave)
		We'd better get moving.

	As they move out... Jane goes to Aaron... He moves with her
	towards the door.

				AARON
		What happened?

				JANE
		I'll tell you later -- where
		you going to watch from?

				AARON
		Watch? --

				JANE
		I'll come by your place, right
		after...drink, take pills...
		Love you.

	She runs out the door.  Aaron turns mean and mocks Jane's
	last words -- screwing up his face in a savage burlesque.

				AARON
		Yeah, love you, too.

	EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY

	As Jane briefly pauses to see which war has room.  Tom opens
	the passenger seat of his car -- she gets in.  It moves off.

	INT. TOM'S CAR - DAY

	As it moves off.

				JANE
		Nervous?

				TOM
		Excited.

	Jane looks over at him -- there's no question he's just told
	the truth.

	INT. TOM'S OFFICE - DAY

	In the b.g. we SEE the Bureau Newsroom beginning to pulse with
	activity.  Tom closes the door.  He sits down behind his desk
	and opens a bottom drawer -- a clean whit shirt lies there.
	He opens the center drawer -- two ties are inside.  He picks
	one.  He reaches for a package of new red suspenders.  He takes
	off the shirt and puts on the new one -- all of this the work
	of an expert craftsman.  By the time he finishes he looks like
	the authority figure we know he's now.

	INT. BUREAU NEWSROOM - JANE AND BLAIR

	Jane is NOT hyper.  She is purposeful -- organized -- even
	calming Blair with a little physical contact -- a touch on
	the arm, to still her colleague's hysterical demons.

				JANE
		Tell George and Jessica to try
		and cover everything without
		Tom having to ask additional
		questions.

				BLAIR
		And Bobbie says...

				JANE
		Did you hear what I just said --
		do you have that?  Take a breath.

				BLAIR
			(a breath, then)
		Yes.

	In the b.g. Tom has exited his office and looks about --
	waiting for some indication as to what to do next.

				JANE
		And the most important thing
		make sure his earpiece works,
		have back-ups ready.  That's
		never been more vital.  He
		must be able to hear me at
		every second and clearly.

	Jane sees him.  She moves across the room -- takes Tom by the
	arm.

				JANE
		We have twenty minutes -- you can
		wait in the studio.

	Tom coughs nervously into his hand and takes a pen from a
	nearby desk, clips it into his inside pocket and walks off.

	GRAPHICS ROOM - DAY

	Jane is screening and asking corrections in a graphic
	representation of an F-14 shooting down a Libyan Air Force
	Mirage Fighter.

				JANE
		Put in the radar plane that spotted
		them to begin with.

				GRAPHIC ARTIST
		We have no pictures on file.

				JANE
		I can't draw -- but this is a
		rough idea.

	She uses the stylus from the ELECTRONIC PAINT MACHINE to outline
	an American Air Force E-2C Hawkeyes Radar Plane.  Her work is
	stunning.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - DAY

	He has a glass in hand -- some chips on the table with a
	bottle of wine as he selects a Cassette Desk to play.  He picks
	a French song -- looks at some of his books.  He might even
	read.  He is feigning disinterest for an audience of no one.
	He SINGS ALONG with the RECORD in perfect French.

	INT. STUDIO HALLWAY - DAY

	Tom checking copy in the long hallway leading to the studio --
	there is the merest of hubbubs causing him to look up.  Buddy
	is being stopped at the other end of the hallway.

	ON BUDDY AND SECURITY GUARD

				GUARD
		I have to check first.

				BUDDY
			(a bit frantic)
		Well, then check -- but hurry --
		There he is!!!

	Buddy runs the length of the hallway to Tom's aide despite Tom's
	gestures to slow down.

				BUDDY
		Is everything all right?

				TOM
		Yes.  You didn't have to come here.
		It's just that I'm going to anchor
		this special report on this Libyan
		thing...

				BUDDY
			(delighted)
		Anchor?

				TOM
			(amused despite
			 situation)
		Yes, stop!  I wondered if you could
		find out anything about what's
		happening.
			(on Buddy's reaction)
		What's wrong?

				BUDDY
		I broke up with my roommate --
		He was really the magnet for
		everyone who knew anything.

				TOM
		Oh.

				BUDDY
		Look, I can start up with him again
		if you really...

				TOM
		No.  I'm doing fine...Look.

	Tom stands there -- a man at home in this media castle.

				BUDDY
		Good.  He's on the world's longest
		ego trip, let him take it alone.

				TOM
		Hey, okay.  Look Buddy -- I've 
		got to go to work.

				BUDDY
			(to Tom)
		...good-bye then.

				TOM
		I'll speak to you.

				BUDDY
		Well, who knows.  Just let m tell
		you what my favorite teacher ever,
		told me -- 'Don't be afraid to be
		wonderful.'

	He leans forward, gives Tom a quick embrace, a small kiss on
	the cheek.  Tom turns and walks off down the hallway to meet
	his immediate destiny as Buddy looks on.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

	Jane mounts some steps in the control room -- she moves past
	the DIRECTOR and TECHNICAL CREW up to the next level where the
	two news execs, Ernie and Paul stand with their backs to the
	wall, and then up one more step slightly above the desk and
	table occupied by Blair.  Now she slips into the large well
	paddled throne-like seat -- as WE BEGIN MUSIC CUE.

	Literally at her fingertips is the row of buttons which provide
	immediate access to the field reporters at the Pentagon, State
	and the White House.  In front of her the bank of monitors, the
	Technical Team and past them the studio where Tom is seated at
	Anchor, a FLOOR PRODUCER and WRITER feeding him copy.

	ANGLE FAVORING BLAIR

	As she looks at Jane, poised to control the complicated apparatus
	of minds and machines comprising the big time network news.
	And Jane Craig is at the helm.  Blair experiences a flash of 
	emotion which transcends envy and verbalizes it.

				BLAIR
			(sotto to Jane)
		Executive Producer -- wow.

	Jane looks at her and, in a moment of atypical merriment, does
	a choking gesture at her own throat as the monitors flash a
	graphic reading:  SPECIAL REPORT... We HEAR an ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
	say, "This is a Special Report from..."

	INSERT:  JANE'S CONTROL PANEL

	Each of four buttons labeled so that the microphone can connect
	her to Tom and the Field Reporters.  She presses the button
	marked "Tom."

				JANE
		You hear me, Tom?  Tom?  Tom?
		Damn it...He can't hear me...
			(to Blair)
		I told you if there was one thing...

	Tom's VOICE on speakers.

				TOM
			(voice over; relaxed)
		I can hear you.  I was just teasing.

	Gulping the air in relief, she slumps nonetheless impressed by
	the macho cool as:

	Tom smiles towards her then -- poises himself just as the
	Announcer's last words clear.

				ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
			(voice over)
		...in Washington, Tom Grunick.

	He begins his report.  He seems authoritative, compelling, even
	in a low key way.  We trust him.

				TOM
		Good afternoon.  A Libyan fighter
		plane attacked a United States
		Military Installation early this
		morning and was, itself, shot down
		by American F-14 Interceptors.

	Another monitor shows the Graphic running.  In the b.g. two
	men approaches Paul.  They look out of place, decidedly
	non-business like.

				MAN ONE
		Mr. Moore, I'm Marvin Usher and this 
		is my brother, Stuart.

				PAUL
		Not now!!!
			(gesturing)
		Look.

				TOM
		The Libyan Missile destroyed an Army
		Warehouse which, just thirty minutes
		earlier, had been crowded with 
		servicemen.  No one was injured.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Aaron is seated, feet up, drinking, listening to MUSIC -- reading
	a book, two remote controls are on the cushion next to him.  He
	SINGS OUT LOUD with the record as he reads -- at one point
	providing his own lyric line OVER THE MUSIC.

				AARON
			(SINGING LOUDLY)
		And I can read while I sing.

	He picks up the television remote-control device an puts the
	television on, the SOUND OFF.

	ON TV

	We SEE the graphic of the Libyan plane's flight route, its
	missile firing -- the U.S. planes taking off and the shooting
	down of the Mirage jet... At one point Aaron lowering the MUSIC
	and raising the TV SOUND hearing Tom.

				TOM'S VOICE
			(voice over)
		The heat seeking missile virtually
		disintegrated the  plane on...

	Aaron turns down the TV SOUND and turns up the MUSIC.

	INT. BOOTH

	Jane's hand flicks at the button marked "PENTAGON."

				JANE
		George, you're ready.

	ON PENTAGON MONITOR

	We SEE George and HEAR him through Jane's voice box.

				GEORGE
			(voice over)
		Should I cover everything or should
		I save something for Tom to ask about?

				JANE
		Cover everything!

	George nods.

				JANE
			(hitting Tom's button)
		We're going to George.  Say 'the
		Joint Chiefs are meeting -- we have
		George Weln at the Pentagon'.

	ON TOM

				TOM
		George Weln is at the Pentagon where
		the attack launched by the lone
		Libyan pilot has resulted in a massive
		movement of military might.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Where he still balances STEREO and TV SOUND.

				AARON
		A lot of alliteration from anxious
		anchors placed in powerful posts.

	He picks up the phone.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

	As Blair hands it to Jane.

				BLAIR
		It's Aaron.

				JANE
		Yes?

				AARON
		I think the pilot that shot down the
		Libyan in 1981 is stationed right
		here.  Maybe you could get him --
		and maybe Tom should say that our F-14
		is one of the hardest planes to fly.
		They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.

				JANE
		Thanks.
			(to Tom)
		The F-14 is one of the most difficult
		planes to master.
			(remembering)
		Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in
		the 70's the first crop had a number
		of crashes.

				TOM
		George, isn't the F-14 Tomcat one of 
		the most difficult machines for a
		pilot to master?

				GEORGE
		I think you're right -- it's certainly
		one of our hottest planes.

	INT. AARON'S ROOM - DAY

				AARON
		I say it here -- it comes out there.

	He giggles.

				TOM
			(voice over)
		There was trouble with them in the
		early days -- back in the 70's.

	Aaron dials again... As we SEE Jennifer standing at the
	White House.

				AARON
			(into phone)
		Me again.  Hi.  Listen Gaddafi doesn't
		foam at the mouth or anything.  When
		you speak to him he's not at all nuts.
		He seems like a leader -- very
		impressive, self-control...that's
		what's so strange.

	ON JANE

				JANE
		Right and we have the '81
		pilot on the way in -- Nobody else
		will have him.

				AARON
			(voice over)
		You're welcome.  Sow how does it
		feel to...I know you gotta go --
		Me too.  We're very busy here.

	He hangs up -- LONG SHOT... Aaron with his remote controls.
	The picture switches back to Tom.  He turns UP the VOLUME.

				TOM
			(voice over)
		...outlaw nation but strangely those
		who have interviewed Gaddafi find
		him, in a phrase we like to use in
		this country, very 'presidential'.

				AARON
		Nice, Jane.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

	Jane is on the phone.  The atmosphere buckling with strain.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Just a minute.

	Her finger hits the "Tom" button.

				JANE
			(to Tom)
		To State for the message from Libya,
		then you'll have the carrier pilot
		from the Sidra in time to...
			(a sudden shriek)
		What?  No!

	ON TOM

	Jolted by the shriek in his earpiece but nonetheless continuing.

	BACK TO JANE

	As she SCREAMS INTO the phone -- this is more than volume, she
	is over-the-top livid, her face red, neck cords popping.

				JANE
		We only have ten minutes left --
		how can you talk to me about parking
		problems?  No, not you'll try...you'll
		do it -- do it or I'll fry your fat
		ass, Estelle.  Good-bye.

	As she BANGS the PHONE down.  Paul comments sotto to Ernie.

				PAUL
			(sotto)
		I had no idea she was this good.

				JANE
			(hitting Tom's button)
		Fill for a second.

				TOM
			(fluidly)
		The latest message seems to indicate
		that the Libyan pilot was acting on
		his own without authority from anyone
		else.
			(into camera directly)
		In other words, I think we're okay.

	INT. STUDIO - EIGHT MINUTES LATER

	MOVING CAMERA FROM Tom's left profile TOWARDS HIS RIGHT PROFILE,
	TAKING IN THE Production Assistant who madly shuffles pages,
	even as Tom talks on camera, the monitor through which he sees
	the subject of his interview at the Pentagon, the clusters of a
	assistants on the floor and now WE CONTINUE TO CIRCLE BEHIND him,
	beginning to SEE the Control Room in the b.g. and as we MOVE IN
	TOWARDS HIS EAR, the white ear piece firmly in place, we BEGIN
	TO HEAR, the barely audible crackle of Jane's VOICE as she tells
	him roughly what to say and how long he has to say it.

				TOM
		...So, Commander, it must have been
		a bit tougher today -- shooting down
		the French-made Mirage Jet.  The one
		you got was a SU-22...etc...

	And NOW ALL IS OBSCURED EXCEPT THE ANCHOR'S EARS, the ear piece
	and the RED LIGHT on the CAMERA and beyond... almost an abstract
	vision.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

				TOM'S VOICE
		...Once again:  The Libyan Government
		has disavowed any prior knowledge of
		the flight.  This has been Tom Grunick
		reporting from Washington.

	The special report ended, Jane breathes a breath -- she and
	Blair momentarily grasp hands.  The first talk concerns Tom.

				PAUL
		He was brilliant.  I've never been
		as proud of one of my decisions.

				ERNIE
			(calls back to Jane)
		Great work, Jane, really -- You know?
		Really.

	She nods... totally depleted.

				JANE
		Well, there were no major gaffs anyway.

	Ernie scoffs in her direction.

				JANE
		Thanks, everybody.

	She exits the scene.

				PAUL
			(to the Usher brothers)
		This was important for Tom -- there's
		that bonding thing that happens with
		the public and an anchorman during a
		crisis.  It's not the conventions
		anymore; it's this kind of moment.

	Tom enters.  He is exuberant.

				PAUL
			(to Tom)
		What a baptismal.  Congratulations.

				TOM
		Thanks.  With all the help you get,
		it's sure easier than local.

	Paul and Ernie exchange a glance.

				TOM (cont'd)
		Where's Jane?  I'm still juiced.

	Ernie points off... as Tom exits.  The Usher brothers hover.

				ERNIE
			(to the Usher brothers)
		Can I help you?

				MARVIN
		We're here to play the new news theme.

				ERNIE
		New theme?  You don't need me for this.

				PAUL
		Stay.  Why should I be the only one
		to feel silly?

				MAN ONE
		We need a synthesizer -- but this
		will give you an idea.

				PAUL
		Go ahead.
			(to Ernie)
		Wasn't he great?

				ERNIE
		It worked.

	Man Two has the keyboard out and begins playing the prospective
	news theme:  a suite meant to have majesty and drive, a towering
	composition -- the effect of it somewhat lessened by the fact
	that the two men VOCALIZE OTHER INSTRUMENTS over the keyboard.

	INT. NEWSROOM - DAY

	As Tom makes his way across it -- crews are drifting in... He
	enters Jane's cubby, flushed with the electricity of the "win"
	the most noteworthy moment of his working life.

	INT. JANE'S CUBBY - DAY

				TOM
		You're an amazing woman.  What a feeling
		having you inside my head.

				JANE
			(a bit thrown)
		Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.

				TOM
		Indescribable -- you knew just when to 
		feed me the next thing, just a split 
		second before I needed it.  There was a 
		rhythm we got into, like great sex.

	Jane looks at him and nods slightly -- an unconscious spasm of
	truthfulness.

				TOM
		You have to celebrate with me, don't
		you?  Everybody's going to that bar
		on the corner, 'Caps.'

				JANE
		I'm going over to Aaron's.  Maybe I'll
		hoop up with all of you later.  How
		long do you think you'll be there?

	Tom indicates that it's an impossible question to answer.  They
	enters the elevator.

	EXT. NEWS BUILDING - NIGHT

	As several people cross the street towards the bar.  Tom has
	been holding back on one question.

				TOM
		It's tempting to ask you how you think
		I did.
			(she starts to reply)
		No.  I'm enjoying myself.  Take it easy.

	He starts across the street.

				JANE
			(trying to be casual)
		Maybe I'll see you over there.

	Indicates Bar.

				TOM
		You'll never show up.

	He starts across the street -- then turns and calls to her.

				TOM
		Jane?

				JANE
		Yeah?

				TOM
		I'll wait for you till seven.

				JANE
			(shouting back)
		Okay.

	Tom races to catch up with the others -- Jane in the distant b.g.
	pauses a beat before walking off in the opposite direction.  Jane
	moving quickly along.

	SOUND OF MEN VOCALIZING NEWS THEME comes UP AND continues
	through:

	EXT. AARON'S APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING

	As Jane approaches and is surprised to find him sitting on the
	stoop outside.

	ON AARON

	Happy to see her, rising fairly soberly to his feet.  He APPLAUDS
	as she comes toward him.

				JANE
		Really?  It was good.

	He nods and APPLAUDS some more.

				JANE
		Your calling in that information --
		you're the classiest guy I know.

	He waves her off... And sits down on the stoop.

				AARON
		It was strange to watch him.  What's
		the next step?  Lip synching?

	She sits a step or two above him, waiting to gauge his mood.

				AARON
		I've been doing some of the most
		important thinking of my life.  I
		wonder if this is the right time to
		tell you about it.

	She steals a glance at her watch.

				JANE
		Well, whatever you think.

				AARON
		I figured out exactly why it is I'm so
		hung up on getting a chance at weekend
		anchor...It's because if I do that well,
		they'll pay me more, treat me great and
		my life will be better.  That's why.

				JANE
		Sounds like you may be on to something.

				AARON
		Which means I'm at their mercy and who
		wants that?...I'm not going to tell
		you where this thought led me...
		Anyway, well, why not  tell you? --
		it's a happy thing.  In the middle of
		all this I start to think about something
		that does nothing but make me feel good
		and makes immediate sense and that's you
		...And I'll stop here but, Jane, I'd give
		anything if you were two people so I could
		call up the one who's my friend and tell
		her about the one I'm in I...I don't think
		I should go any further.  Come on --
		I'll walk you to the corner.

	He tales her by the arm and leads her to the corner.

				JANE
		You know you've had a strange day...
		I'd sleep on all these things you've
		been thinking.

				AARON
		Absolutely...You go have a good time...
		You have some place to go?

				JANE
		Yes.

				AARON
		Good.

	He grabs her and hugs her exuberantly -- takes her face in his
	hands and kisses her full on the lips.

				AARON
		Well, I felt something.

	He leaves her on the corner and walks back.

	ON JANE

	As the SOUND OF NEWS THEME VOCALIZING PICKS UP ONE MORE...
	Jane moving quickly, hailing a cab.

	INT. CAB - EVENING

				JANE
		We're going to Caps Bar at
		Seventeenth and Vermont;
		Connecticut is clear on Sunday...
		take that over to Fifteenth, then
		around Vermont and we'll bypass
		the circle that way...if you don't
		go over forty we should catch mostly
		green lights.

	ON the DRIVER'S annoyed look.

				JANE
		Come on -- don't take it the
		wrong way.  I just know about
		things.

	He hits the meter.

	EXT. CAPS BAR - EVENING

	As the cab pulls up, Jane gets out and pays him.

				DRIVER
		Great route.  I never made
		anywhere near that fast before.

				JANE
		Thanks -- good driving --

				DRIVER
		Thanks.  Coming from you I
		appreciate it.

				JANE
		Thanks.

	As she turns to enter the restaurant -- Tom and Jennifer exit.
	As they confront each other:

				TOM
		I didn't think you'd make it.

				JANE
		Well, I thought I'd check if all
		of you were still here.  I'll just
		go in and join the gang and you
		two go on.

				TOM
		There's no gang in there -- We
		were the last ones.

				JANE
		Well, I'll go in and have a bite.

				TOM
			(to Jennifer)
		Jennifer, you want to have another
		drink?

				JANE
		Hey, I know how to have a burger by
		myself.  I feel like a little solitude.

				JENNIFER
			(as they move off)
		I sure know that feeling.  Terrific
		work today.

				JANE
			(too jock-like)
		Right back to you.

				TOM
		Thanks for getting me through.

	He puts his hand behind her neck in an awkward gesture of
	camaraderie.  She awkwardly disengages... waves and steps
	inside the door to the restaurant... standing there between
	the two sets of doors watching Tom and Jennifer walk away.

	ON TOM AND JENNIFER

	As they walk to his car, first exchanging a look of reflection
	over Jane... then bumping accidentally, then bumping back, a
	look, then kissing with passion, wrapped around each other.

	INT. JENNIFER'S APT - NIGHT

	As Tom and Jennifer rush in locked in an embrace, shedding
	clothes even as they enter.

	INT. JENNIFER'S APT - NIGHT

	We are aware of MOVING FORMS.

				JENNIFER
			(intense shout)
		Damn all you sons-of-bitches.  Oh
		shit, you bastards...

	They finish.  A beat, then:

				JENNIFER
		Sorry.

	ON TOM AND JENNIFER

	Tom taken aback by the outburst from this woman he's just made
	love to.

				TOM
		No, it's okay...People say different
		things.  They do...the plural threw
		me.

	She laughs.

				JENNIFER
		The last time I was with someone we
		went through this awful mutual disease
		questionnaire but I guess it beats
		getting paranoid the next day.  Okay,
		I'll go first.  I haven't...

				TOM
			(stopping her)
		It would never occur to me to worry
		at all about you.

	Jennifer is touched...

				JENNIFER
		You know something?  I'm deeply
		complimented.   Isn't it strange to
		be deeply complimented because the
		man you're with doesn't think you
		have a venereal disease?...

	Tom slides out of bed naked -- she moves quickly across the bed
	one outstretched hand reaching for his ass, a free -- even lusty
	sort of motion punctuated by her comment:

				JENNIFER
		Give me some of that.

	He dances away -- out of range -- liking the action, a stupid
	grin on his face.

				TOM
		Where's the bathroom?

				JENNIFER
		Through the closet.

	He opens the door and turns on the light in the closet.

	INT. CLOSET - NIGHT

	It is a converted room -- given over the racks of clothes and
	shoes extraordinarily well organized.  Tom stands there agape.
	Various rain coats -- clothes for all climates -- lots of
	luggage.

	She joins him in the closet -- holding out a sheet in front of
	her.

				JENNIFER
		I converted a bedroom -- this
		stuff builds up.  Wait till
		you've been doing this sixteen
		years.

				TOM
		I'm not knocking it.  It's a
		great solution.  Not only the
		storage but you can see everything
		you have.

	Jennifer laughs -- he follows her gaze and sees himself in
	silhouette against the door -- his penis prominent in outline.

				JENNIFER
		Do you do bunny rabbits?

	Tom is enjoying himself immensely.

				TOM
		Isn't this a great date?

	We HEAR the SOUND OF SCRATCHING as we:

	INT. JANE'S EDITING CUBICLE - MORNING

	Jane feeds another tape in -- she is taking editing notes alone
	and SCRATCHING her arm.  She looks worn out -- STOCK FOOTAGE OF
	STATESMEN move across the small screen.  She sighs and, without
	realizing, implores the heavens to help cure a malady she's yet
	to recognize in herself.

				JANE
			(to herself)
		God help me.

	People have begun to filter into the newsroom in the b.g.

				AARON
		Jesus, Jane.  How long have you
		been here?

				JANE
		A long time.  I was restless.
		Will you crack my neck?

	He starts massaging her neck as the phone rings.  she lets it
	ring for a beat as Aaron works on her.  As she picks up the
	receiver we HEAR a CRACK.  She reacts to it at the same time
	she utters a greeting.

				JANE
		Aaah --
			(into phone)
		-- ello.  You sure they said the
		management meeting?
			(hangs up; then
			 to Aaron)
		They want me to be at the
		management meeting.

				AARON
		They're not that dumb, after all.

	He pats her on the back.

	INT. WALKWAY - DAY

				BLAIR
		Do you know you're the second woman
		in network news history to produce?

				JANE
			(though distracted)
		No, I'm not.  I'm the fourth.
		Joan Richmond.  Pauline Fredericks
		got that credit once on a U.N.
		special and there's Susan Zirinsky.

	INT. MANAGEMENT MEETING - DAY

	Paul is running the meeting from behind Ernie's desk.
	TWO OTHER NON-EDITORIAL MEN are in attendance.  As Paul
	discusses the more pressing problems of the network news
	division, Jane sits near the window strangely unmoved by
	her first moment at the seat of power.  She has the blues.

				PAUL
		Anyway, they seem to be very serious
		about making me out eight million from
		the budget and that means massive firings.
		I'm doing everything I can... It's too
		early to make up a 'death list' but I
		just wanted you to be aware of the
		situation... We're also going to cover
		the Alaskan serial killer trial on a
		continuing basis.  I'd like it done out
		of Washington which means we've got to
		get somebody on a plane for Anchorage.
		We can't fool around anymore...Jane...

	She looks up at him -- a bit sleepy-eyed.

				PAUL (cont'd)
		This is going to be high-profile on
		the Evening News -- who do you think?
		George Weln or Jennifer?

				JANE
			(much, much too quickly)
		Jennifer.

	The men look at her curiously.  She repeats herself more
	rationally.

				JANE (cont'd)
		Jennifer.

	INT. TOM'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

	He has been reading from a respectable stack of mail -- Jane
	appears in his doorway.  For the first time, we notice that
	she is woefully ba at at least one endeavor -- flirting.

				JANE
		Come on, I'll buy you a drink.
		There's a big thing over at the
		Italian embassy.

				TOM
		I'm not sure I'd be good
		company tonight.

				JANE
			(self-conscious joke)
		I'll be the judge of that.

	INT. ITALIAN EMBASSY - NIGHT

	As they walk in -- one MAN looks at Tom with a glint of
	recognition.  Then another -- a handshake -- A WOMAN introduces
	herself.  A small knot of people form.

				JANE
		It's much too soon for you to have
		this kind of buzz around you.

				TOM
		Do I have to stand here in the middle
		and meet them all?

				JANE
		I'll get you through.  Move and smile.
			(she pushes him
			 a little)
		And smile and move...

	They start crossing the room -- he is moving now, making progress.
	But an EGYPTIAN BUSINESSMAN stops him.

				EGYPTIAN BUSINESSMAN
		Is it safe for me to fly home?

				TOM
		Yes.  We're fine now.

				JANE
		AND SMILE.

	He smiles -- people smile back.

				JANE
		AND MOVE.

	ANGLE ON STAIR LANDING

	Where Aaron (Pimm's Cut in hand -- a cucumber sticking out)
	stands with Martin Klein.  Martin is eating from a huge platter
	of appetizers.

				MARTIN KLEIN
		The Italians serve the second best
		things right after the Chinese...I
		could do an article comparing Embassy
		food...Gourmet free-loading...sell it
		anyplace.  I'm sure not getting the
		assignments.

				AARON
		Who the heck could that be?

	AARON'S P.O.V.

	From the excited group of people blocking his view,
	it's clear there is some personage in attendance.

	ON AARON

	And now he sees that it's Tom.

				AARON
		Is God testing me or something?

				MARTIN KLEIN
		Paul loves him.  I heard him give
		him the most poetic compliment in
		his command.  'He's hot.'  Sometimes
		groups of executives get together just
		to say that work back and forth...'He's
		hot, oh, she's hot.  Oh, he's really
		hot.'  Hot-hot-hot-hot-hot-hot-hot...
			(looking at Aaron)
		And here we are.

				AARON
		Martin, you're not allowed to use the
		word 'we' or I'm moving.

				MARTIN KLEIN
			(sudden thought)
		Maybe Jane would like my food idea as
		a spot...Try the one in the middle.

	He moves off to intercept Jane -- as he stops her... Tom is
	stranded -- then sees Aaron and moves over to his side.

				TOM
		Hi, Aaron...What's doing?

				AARON
		Same old stuff.  I'm watching a man
		who won three Overseas Press Awards
		pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.

	A MAN stops and introduces himself to Tom -- shaking his hand:

				TOM
		You want to go out there --
			(indicating balcony)
		get out of this for a second?

				AARON
		Why don't you lead?  I'll just
		follow the flurry you cause.

	Tom turns -- the sharpness of the tone unsettles him.

				TOM
		What did I do to you?

				AARON
		You've made my dreams silly.

	Tom decides not to deal with the remark.  He's jolted by the
	hostility.  He leads the way out French Doors to a ground floor
	terrace, where Aaron joins him, closes the door and the two men
	stare at the party.

				TOM
			(gesturing at the
  			 party)
		Heavy hitters.

	Aaron nods.

	They look inside.

				AARON
			(several beats; then)
		How you doing?

				TOM
			(warming)
		Great.  Network news, Washington...
		I love it.  What do you do when your
		real life exceeds your dreams?

				AARON
		Keep it to yourself.

				TOM
		You know the other day I really wanted
		your reaction to how we did with the
		Libyan report -- I was going to ask but
		I guess I feel a little intimidated with
		you.

				AARON
		Oh, stop it.

	On Tom's reaction.

				AARON
		You can't talk about feeling
		intimidated when you're on top of
		the world.  It's unseemly.

				TOM
		I'm not buying into any of that.  I
		have a load to learn.  I'm not going
		to act as if...

				AARON
			(finishing for him)
		You have the job you have...

	The sudden debate is important to Tom -- but it's moving too
	fast for him.

				TOM
		Shut up a second...

				AARON
			(amiably)
		Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't
		it, pal?

				TOM
			(picking his words)
		I made one rule for myself when this
		started and I realized I was going
		to take a lot from you people because
		of being from sports...

				AARON
		And the rule was...

				TOM
		Never to pretend to know more than
		I did.

				AARON
		Can you name all the members of the
		Cabinet?

				TOM
			(flustered)
		Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean
		I'd take a test for you -- I mean if
		that came up in conversation I'd...

				AARON
		We're conversing...Oh my, the names
		of the entire Cabinet has slipped my
		mind.  What are they?

	Tom is getting pissed.

				AARON
			(compromising)
		Don't name them.  Just tell me if
		you know.

				TOM
		Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of
		the Cabinet.

				AARON
		Okay.

	A beat.

				AARON (cont'd)
		All twelve?

				TOM
		Yes.

				AARON
		There are only ten.

	Aaron's suddenly a good deal happier -- damned if it
	isn't a little infectious.

				TOM
		You're feeling good, aren't you?

				AARON
			(sincerely)
		I'm starting to... We may do
		the capitols of the states.

				TOM
			(dry)
		Fifty, right?

	Aaron almost smiles.

	Tom enters the party leaving the door open.

	LONG SHOT

	Aaron in the f.g. -- his BACK TO CAMERA... Beyond him
	Tom being approached... then joining Jane.

	EXT. JANE'S STREET - NIGHT

	As Tom's car comes to a stop.

	INT. TOM'S CAR - NIGHT

				TOM
		I'm so exhausted.  Punchy.  Sick
		tired.  I can't think and I can't move.
		I'm just a dead lump of poured out
		flesh.
			(then)
		Would you like to come up?

	Tom thinks -- then:

				TOM
		Maybe we could just sit here --
		talk a little?

				JANE
		Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?

				TOM
		Too many smart people in one room --
		it's not healthy...

	Jane's confused by this.  She looks at him.

				TOM
		I'm going to have to do a story
		from beginning to end on my own.

				JANE
		Eventually.  Does it have to be
		right now?

				TOM
			(nodding)
		Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this
		unless it was absolutely necessary.
		I have an idea for something.

				JANE
		What?

				TOM
		I just read about it in a magazine
		and it affected me.

				JANE
		Well, what is it?

				TOM
		If I tell you, can you manage not
		to put it down or tell me why it
		won't work or is in bad journalistic
		taste or anything like that?

				JANE
			(broadly)
		Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage.

	He turns towards her -- about to stick his chin out.  Hesitates.

				JANE (cont'd)
		I promise.

				TOM
		It's about women who are attacked
		by someone they know on a date...
		'Date-rape,' that's the piece...
		Well?

	Jane clamps a hand over her own mouth.

				TOM
		Okay -- good move.  Keep it there.

	She continues to clamp her mouth shut as he exits the car,
	opens her door and then begins to half carry, half pull her out.
	She keeps her hand clamped over her mouth.  Laughing from 
	behind her door and runs for it.

	ON TOM

	His spirits lifted.

	ON JANE

	Behind the door, trying to hide the glow in her eyes.

	INT. JANE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	The phone rings... Jane's hand bounces off her nightstand to
	turn on the light knocking over and breaking the clock radio
	instead.  Three alarm clocks stand next to the clock radio...
	Finally the light comes on.  Jane's voice is so thick with
	sleep the words she utters are just barely distinguishable.

				JANE
		Hello.

				TO
			(uncertain)
		Hello?

				JANE
		Hello...Who is it?

	INTERCUT:

	INT. TOM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

				TOM
		I'm not sure I dialed right --
		Jane?

				JANE
		Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you?
		Is this Tom?

				TOM
		Yes.

				JANE
		I had to sleep fast so I took two
		allergy pills to help me...I'm
		sorry...Hey, you called me.

				TOM
		It's not important.

				JANE
		Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha.
		I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't
		tell -- how embarrassing for me.
		Gosh.

				TOM
		What pills did you take?  You
		sound more like someone on a general
		anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak
		to you tomorrow.

				JANE
		Nooo.  Is it your story?

				TOM
		No.  Are you going to the
		Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?

				JANE
		Why, you need me for the story?

				TOM
		No.  Were you going to you?

				JANE
		Uh-huh.

				TOM
		Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like
		to go.

				JANE
		Oh, good.

				TOM
		We can go together.


				JANE
		So you like me, huh?

				TOM
		I like you as much as I can like
		anyone who thinks I'm an asshole.

	INT. JANE'S EDITING ROOM - DAY

	Tom editing a piece with Bobby -- He also has a little typewriter
	table set up.  He is reading from the page in the typewriter as
	he looks at the piece he has written.

				TOM
			(reading)
		But cops on the street continue to
		view it as...
		Shit -- too long.  But street cops
		say...that fits.  That last cut work
		for you, Bobbie?

				BOBBIE
		Yes, and thanks for asking.

	INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT

	As the regulars watch the Evening News, in particular the Date
	Rape piece which is now in progress.  Tom anxiously eyeing Jane
	out of the corner of his eye as she watches the monitor.  Her
	face impossible to read as she studies the screen.

	ON MONITOR

				UNIFORMED COP
		What can you do?  If a woman invites
		a man in and he says they uh, had
		sex and she says he raped her and
		then you find out they've been out
		together two, three times...how can
		you prove a crime?

	NEW SHOT ON MONITOR

	Tom and a woman of about thirty -- dignified but fragile -- she
	looks like someone who might be cast for a church production
	of "Glass Menagerie."

				YOUNG WOMAN
		It will be a year next month since it
		happened...I never thought I'd talk
		about it outside of counseling...

	ON NEWSROOM

	As Aaron enters the scene.

				AARON
		Hi.

	He is shushed by every woman in the room, accepts this and takes
	up a position near Tom and Jane to watch them.

	ON MONITOR

				YOUNG WOMAN
		We'd gone out twice and I hadn't
		enjoyed myself that much but it gets
		to a point -- I don't know if you can
		appreciate this but where you don't
		want to sit home or be with your
		girlfriends and people had always been
		telling me that I was 'too picky.'
		I'm not.  It's just you want to meet
		a nice guy...So anyways, it was that
		'give-him-a-chance' thing.  No, it
		wasn't.  I was lonely.  So we went
		to a movie and when he brought me home
		he said could he just come up and have
		one beer and then he'd go.  How do you
		say 'no', to that?  So first it was
		this wrestling match which was awful
		enough because it got to be really
		a fight...because I'm a modest person...
		then he ripped my clothes and he 
		forced me to...make love.  He stayed in
		my apartment and forced me more times
		-- he didn't leave until...
			(she has started to cry)
		I promised myself I wouldn't cry...
		It's just hard not to --
			(ruefully)
		You sure have a sympathetic face.
			(she cries a bit more)
		...I was so sure I wouldn't do this --
		but the whole thing messed me up --
		maybe more than it should...

	ON MONITOR

	As the news piece cut to:  Tom's face -- he turns clearing a tear
	from his eyes.

	ON NEWSROOM

	These watching struck -- perhaps embarrassed but riveted.  Aaron
	is aghast.  Aaron approaches the set.

				AARON
		Can I turn on the news for a second?
		...Oh, wait a minute.  Sex -- Tears --
		This must be the news.

	Tom stares daggers at him as a public official appears on the
	monitor.

	ON MONITOR

				PUBLIC OFFICIAL
		I don't think you can overestimate it --
		on any given Saturday night tens of
		thousands of women are being attacked
		and there isn't much they or we can do
		about it...

				TOM
			(on monitor)
		The victims often remain too terrified
		to talk -- the police powerless and all
		the social welfare groups can finally do
		is monitor this epidemic of crime without
		punishment.  This is Tom Grunick in
		Annandale, Virginia.

	As his piece concludes.

	NEWSROOM

	Tom continues to glare at Aaron.

				AARON
		I'm in a pissy mood.  I'm sorry.

				TOM
		What's wrong with it?

				AARON
		Nothing.  I think you really blew
		the lid off nookie.

	Blair moans with displeasure.  Aaron exits scene.  Others start
	to congratulate Tom on the piece -- in the b.g. on the:

	MONITOR

	We SEE frozen wilderness -- men digging in the ground -- clumps
	of people watching them work.

	ON JANE

	Probing her own ambivalence -- or, to be more accurate, working
	towards a positive stance.

				JANE
			(to Tom)
		Nice work...
			(checks watch)
		I've got to get a crew off the clock.

	She starts off -- Tom stopping her.

	ON TOM AND JANE

	Now off a bit by themselves.

				TOM
		So what did you think?

				JANE
		It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I
		really did.  It was unusual for you to
		cut to yourself when you tear up -- and
		that might not have been my choice...but
		it's real and it got me...and I think a
		lot of the time I'm too conservative about
		that kind of stuff.  Okay?

				TOM
			(enormously pleased)
		Yeah.

	He walks back towards the area of the monitor.

	ON MONITOR

				JENNIFER
		Tomorrow the jury returns to this
		site as each day brings more revelations
		of horror, four more bodies now taken
		from the frozen earth...This is Jennifer
		Mack in Wota Hamlet, Alaska.

	INT. NEWSROOM - TWO WEEKS LATER (SPRING) - DAY

				BLAIR
		Ernie's been looking for you.

	As Aaron walks to his office.

	INT. AARON'S OFFICE - DAY

	As he enters and finds Ernie bent over his desk.

				ERNIE
		Oh, I was just writing you a note.
		What do you say we take a walk?

				AARON
			(puzzled)
		Outside?

				ERNIE
		Yeah --

	EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - DAY

	Ernie is silent... He's having difficulty.  Aaron is feeling knots
	form.  Finally Ernie breaks his silence.

				ERNIE
		I don't know if we have any
		younger man more respected in our
		operation than you.

				AARON
		Just tell me what's really going
		on.  I think we know each other
		well enough for me to expect that.

				ERNIE
			(agitated)
		We know each other well enough
		for me to care how I put something
		to you which could wipe you out.
		So I will phrase things the way I
		think they should be phrased.  All
		right?

				AARON
		Wipe me out?

	Ernie sits on a bench.

				ERNIE
		Anyway.  I want you to think of this as...

				AARON
		Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really
		appreciate bluntness.

				ERNIE
		Upper management thinks you're dull.

	Aaron deflates.

				ERNIE
		Aaron, I've never seen them like
		this -- I think Paul's nervous
		about his own job and for some
		reason he thinks you only appeal to...

				AARON
		Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm
		beginning to appreciate it.

				ERNIE
		I'm no suggesting the worst will
		happen...but someone with your
		brilliance gets nibbles about other
		jobs and maybe, the next time that
		happens, down the road -- you should
		look into it.

				AARON
			(emotional)
		Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My,
		God.  They want to fire me.

				ERNIE
		All I know is that they've got to
		fire a large number of people...
		and they're not going by seniority.
		There's a recklessness in the air.  
		They...

				AARON
			(interrupting)
		Do one thing to me?  Get me one shot
		at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've
		never seen me do it.  I think it could
		turn them around.

				ERNIE
		I could do it this Saturday -- everyone
		wants off for the Correspondents' Dinner.

	Aaron turns -- his spirit lifted by the unexpected ray of hope.

				AARON
		Do it then.

				ERNIE
		Please prepare carefully.  This
		couldn't come at a better time.

				AARON
		Prepare what?  You have Saturday's
		news handy?

				ERNIE
		It's been a while since you read
		the news -- I'll have somebody work
		with you.  Just on superficial
		performance things.

	Several beats.

				ERNIE (cont'd)
		Please.

				AARON
		Okay.  I think I'd better be alone
		for a while.

				ERNIE
		I understand.  I'll go with you.

				AARON
		Thanks.

	INT. SMALL TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT

	Aaron is seated behind a desk -- some old news copy in
	his hand.  An unmanned camera is pointing at him.  Tom
	is standing a few feet further back studying him.

				AARON
		This is uncomfortable for me --
		because, well, I don't mean it as
		a knock, but we approach this
		differently.

				TOM
		We sure do.  I don't mean it as a
		knock either.
			(he smiles)
		Go ahead.  I'll just say what I think
		and you can disregard it if you want.

				AARON
		It just might not work for me because
		of our different approaches.

	Tom nods and gestures that he proceed.  Aaron begins reading
	the news.  Barely a sentence in, he is interrupted.

				TOM
		Wait.

				AARON
		What?

				TOM
		Your coat jacket is rising up in 
		back.

	Aaron ignores the tip.

				TOM
		When you sit down -- sit on your
		jacket a little -- that gives you
		a good line.  Look at yourself in
		the monitor.

	Aaron looks but is unimpressed and resumes reading the news.
	Tom, not about to be ignored when he knows it's important, moves
	behind Aaron and begins to force his jacket down.

				AARON
			(very uncomfortable)
		I don't like being handled.

				TOM
		Sit on it!  Now look.

				AARON
		Just don't physically...
			(he sees himself in the
			 monitor and is suddenly
 			 enthusiastic)
		Fantastic tip -- fantastic.

	He starts to read again.

				TOM
		No.  That's not going to tell us
		anything.  Let's get this prompter
		going.

				AARON
		It's not loaded.

				TOM
		I'll find some copy.  Be right back.

	Tom exits -- Aaron looking after him, clearly taken with the
	genuine camaraderie... the unmistakable joy Tom derives from 
	helping out.  Several beats and Tom comes back with a CAMERAMAN in 
	tow.

				TOM
		I got copy, I got Ellen to heat up
		the camera and I got Master Control
		taping so you can study it later.

	He puts the roll of copy in the prompter.

				AARON
		Hey, Tom...

	Tom turns.

				AARON
		I'm very appreciative.

	SAME SCENE - LATER

	Tom totally focused on him down one knee checking him from
	various angles.  He interrupts.  Aaron reading from the prompter.

				TOM
		No.  No.

				AARON
		No?

				TOM
		Don't let your eyes go from the
		beginning of the sentence to the end
		like that.  You don't want to look
		shifty, do you?

				AARON
		Oh, God, no!

				TOM
		And the left side of your face is the
		good one.  Go again.  And try to punch
		one word or phrase in every sentence --
		punch one idea a story.  Punch -- come
		on --

	Aaron does same with the story he is reading...

				TOM
		Good...very nice.

	Aaron acknowledges the compliment in news mode.  Punching the
	first words.

				AARON
		Thank you for the compliment, Tom.

	He draws a laugh from the Cameraman as he goes right into the
	next story.

				TOM
		Try not to move your head or wrinkle
		your forehead...this is good, very
		good...

	EXT. NEWS BUREAU - NIGHT

	Aaron, tape in head, is saying his farewell to Tom.  He is facing
	his left side as he will do for the rest of his life on earth.

				TOM
		You were smokin' toward the end there.

				AARON
		The pointers were great.  I'll study
		the tape.

	Tom is into helping Aaron he finds himself delivering a locker
	room pep talk:

				TOM
		And remember -- you're not just reading
		the news or narrating.  Everybody has to
		sell a little.  You're selling them this
		idea of you.  You know, what you're sort
		of saying is, 'trust me.  I'm, uh,
		credible.'  So whenever you catch yourself
		just reading...stop and start selling a
		little.  So long.

	He moves off -- Aaron watching him go, feeling decidedly
	uncomfortable by this last piece of advice and vaguely corrupted.

	INT. JANE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Jane FLIES INTO FRAME, carrying her dress, two large shoulder
	pads clipped to her bra-straps.  She is obviously running a little
	late.  Now she slips on the dress -- her pace so quickened that
	it momentarily dulls the effect of seeing her in a pretty formal
	gown; the kind good girls wear on special nights.  The DOORBELL
	RINGS... She opens the door while trying to put on her necklace...
	Aaron enters carrying four bulging garment bags and a fistful
	of neckties.

				AARON
		I spilled some rum on the outfit you
		picked out.  Let me show you the
		alternates.

	She eyes the amount of clothing, goes to the phone and dials.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Tom...why don't I meet you there?
		I've got some last minute stuff I've
		got to take care of...Hey, how did
		you resolve your dilemma -- did you
		rent the tux or buy it...I knew it.
		How much?  Wow...Okay...See you
		there...

				AARON
		I didn't know you were going with him.

				JANE
		Did you bring your grey suit?

				AARON
		Yes...I was thinking that way too...
		Which tie?

	She holds them in her hand -- indicates with the necklace that
	she wants him to help her... he fastens her necklace while looking
	over her bare right shoulder as she riffles through his tie
	collection.

				JANE
			(the clasp in place)
		Thanks.  Try this one.

	She hands him the tie and he extracts his grey jacket from a bag --
	puts it on and ties the tie... She reaches into a white paper bag
	full of fresh purchases and takes out a vial of perfume with a
	built-in atomizer and sprays the air in front of hr and walks into
	the mist.  ON Aaron's reaction:

				JANE
		I read about it -- that's how you can
		make sure you don't put on too much
		perfume...

				AARON
		Could you at least pretend that this
		is an awkward situation for you --
		me showing up while you're getting
		ready for a date.

				JANE
			(flaring)
		It's not a date.  It's co-workers going
		to a professional conclave.

	Jane, unnoticed, reaches into the paper bag, takes a small box
	of condoms and drops it into her evening bag.

	EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - NIGHT

	Jane on a public phone, Aaron standing nearby within sight
	of a taxi stand.

				JANE
			(on phone)
		How long will it tale you to send
		one?...

	She hangs up... paces... Then looks at Aaron, relaxes.

				JANE
		You look terrific.

	Aaron poses a question which he feels in his deepest core:

				AARON
		Really?

	Jane nods.

				AARON
		Because this is important -- so don't
		just be polite.  I'd really like to
		look...what's the word I'm looking for?...

				JANE
		As good as humanly possible.

				AARON
		Yes.

				JANE
		Well, the line of the jacket -- No
		really....just very nice...just right.
		I wish I could be there.

				AARON
		Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little
		before 11:00, drop by the studio.

				JANE
		I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...

				AARON
		If...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll
		wait for you at my apartment.

				JANE
		Okay, great -- good luck.

	Before she can deal with that, a cab arrives.

				AARON
		Thanks, Jane.  Have a good time tonight.

				JANE
		You too.

	Aaron takes her in -- she looks lovely.

				AARON
		I'd hug you, but why risk mussing
		either of us?

	She half-laughs... kisses him, wipes the slight lipstick mark
	from his cheek and, in a sudden decision, takes each of her
	shoulder pads from her jacket and puts them in his -- improving
	his look while diminishing her own.  She gets in the cab.

	AARON'S P.O.V.

	Jane, leaning all the way over the front seat, giving detailed
	instructions to the DRIVER as the cab pulls away... As Aaron
	turns and walks off.

	INT. CAB - NIGHT

	Jane, in her formal, sitting back -- anticipating her date.

	EXT. WASHINGTON HOTEL - NIGHT

	A hefty percentage of the Washington journalism industry's
	men and women dressed formally for one of those evenings where
	they can finally assert their own glamour.  Jane ENTERS THE SCENE.

	INT. WASHINGTON HOTEL - ATRIUM - NIGHT

	As Jane enters, lost momentarily in the lobby -- greenhouse,
	the majority of the throng passing through in formal clothes.
	A bit of DIALOGUE OVERHEAD from TWO MEN in dinner jackets.

				MAN ONE
		The L.A. times is a great outfit.  Best
		severance pay in the business.

	Jane keeps looking for Tom -- passing another MAN, talking to
	his SHARP-LOOKING DATE.

				MAN THREE
		He was lecturing me and finally
		I just said -- I'm sorry, I refuse
		to look at it as a negative that
		I'm young and my news appeals to
		people my age.

				WOMAN
		And it's not like he just didn't
		hire a twenty-six-year-old producer
		himself.

				MAN
		No kidding, twenty-six.

	Jane moves to the steps and starts up, greeting several
	people nervously.  More bits of DIALOGUE, leaking from
	conversations of both substance and expedience.

				ANONYMOUS OLDER MAN
		Remember Brinkley's great line
		-- "It's as irrevocable as a
		haircut."

	Now, on the second level, she scans the crowd.

	JANE'S P.O.V.

	The floor below.  Tom in the world's best-fitting tux... Clusters
	of people from around him but he works his way easily through them
	as he looks for Jane and grins his greetings, men are buoyed,
	women's pulses throb.

	ON JANE

	As she silently mouths the words -- "smile and move and smile
	and move."  Which is exactly what he's doing.  Then a contract
	with the gods.

				JANE
			(to herself)
		If he doesn't see me soon, we're not
		supposed to be together.

	ON TOM

	Seeing her.  -- He does a tap step -- a brief giddy burst, the
	meaning of which is not lost on Jane.  He is acting like her
	boyfriend.

	ON JANE

	Anxiety stripped away revealing a first glimpse of Jane as a
	joyous pretty young woman.

	ON TOM

	Moving quickly up the stairs -- as she walks toward him.

				TOM
			(excitedly)
		It's incredible who's here.

				JANE
		Who?

				TOM
		Me!

	She laughs.  Almost completes an affectionate gesture -- takes
	his arm instead.

	INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT

	Aaron seated in the main newsroom in shirt-sleeves, writing.  He
	takes the just-completed page out of the typewriter and walks over
	to the weekend news PRODUCER. (W.N.P.)

				AARON
		Want to look at this?

				W.N.P.
		Sure.

	George Weln appears...

				GEORGE
			(to Aaron)
		What are you doing here?

				AARON
			(feigning casualness)
		The weekend news...anchoring...
		anchoring the weekend news.

				GEORGE
		Way to go.

	Aaron nods, as the Producer finishes the copy.

				W.N.P.
		This is terrific news, Aaron.  It's
		a pleasure to read.

				AARON
		Thanks.  Oh, there's water on the set,
		isn't there, in case I get an attack
		of cotton mouth.

				W.N.P.
		Sure.  You'll be fine.

				AARON
			(feeling patronized
  			 and repelling)
		I'll be fine!  Yes!!  I know!!!

	INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

	Bomb sniffing dogs, SECRET SERVICE MEN and D.C. POLICE monitoring
	the members of Washington's most trustworthy elite as they pass
	through the metal detector.  The line moves slowly -- Jane and
	Tom several couples back.

				OFF-CAMERA VOICE
			(o.s.)
		Can I have your autograph for my wife?

	Tom and Jane turn to see a grinning Paul.

				TOM
		How you doing, Paul?

				PAUL
		So this is why you wouldn't do the
		Weekend New, you can't turn down
		a free meal.

				TOM
		Yes, born to party.

	Paul enjoys the riposte, looks at Jane who is shrinking within
	herself.

				PAUL
		I'll see you two inside -- I think
		we're all at the same table.
			(sotto to Jane)
		You're finally learning to be flexible.
		Glad you changed your mind about Tom.

	He passes through the detector... Tom starts to step through it --
	she pulls him back.

				JANE
		I'm sorry.  I don't want to go in
		there and sit with everybody.
			(imagining it)
		I can't...why don't you go?

	He considers this option as she waits.

				TOM
		Suppose I go in for a little while and
		you wait in the lobby-bar.  How's that?

				JANE
		Good.  That's it...See you.

	She walks off.  He runs a few steps to stop her.

				TOM
		Jane.

	She turns.

				TOM
		You're not going to take off on
		me, are you?

				JANE
		Uh-uh.

	She steps on the escalator... Riding upwards, concern deepens,
	anxiety flows.

	ON TOM

	Watching her to up the escalator, he finds himself doing
	simplest thing, stepping onto a moving step.

	FULL SHOT

	Jane four steps ahead of him -- not yet aware of him.  He moves
	past one other man until he is standing directly behind her.

				TOM
		I just want you to know that my
		giving up the Correspondents' Dinner
		puts tremendous pressure on you.

	Jane turns and is a bit blown away by his gesture -- life
	threatens to be good.  And now Jane bumps a bit at the top of
	the escalator, regaining her balance by grabbing Tom's offered
	hand.  As they walk they continue to deliberately hold hands.

	INT. NEWS STUDIO - NIGHT

	WE are on the studio floor, FOCUSING on the activity around
	the Anchor Desk and three cameras... The FLOOR MANAGER stands
	ready to cue Aaron, the script is ready to roll on the prompter
	machine.

				FLOOR MANAGER
		Twenty seconds.

	ON AARON

	Making sure he is seated on his jacket -- taking one last look
	at the hand mirror being held by the MAKEUP WOMAN.  She starts
	off -- but Aaron regrabs the mirror almost making her lose her
	footing -- a check -- then another check -- he points to a spot
	on his forehead which she dabs with the makeup sponge... Both of
	them fuss enormously with his hair -- four busy hands.

				FLOOR MANAGER
		Ten seconds.

				AARON
		How many?

				FLOOR MANAGER
		Ten.

				AARON
		Okay.

	He watches the Makeup Woman scurry underneath a camera lens,
	resits on his jacket and finally has the moment the system has
	been denying him for years.  We can HEAR the END OF HIS CUE
	in a barely AUDIBLE CRACKLE from the Floor Manager's earphones...
	"...with Aaron Altman."

				AARON
			(on TV)
		Good Evening...In mood and language
		better suited to an espionage novel
		than the delicate world of the Western
		Alliance, the British Foreign Secretary
		today pounced on what he termed, 'The
		nest of profession spies and amateur
		traitors who were turning NATO
		Headquarters into an instrument whose
		only true function is folly.'  We begin
		our coverage with Edward Towne in London.

	Aaron looks up -- takes a breath.  He's done well -- he's
	punched his words and his one thought for the story.  His gaze
	has been steady, his voice firm but he has begun to perspire.
	He dabs with his finger at the first trickles from his brow --
	brushes some more prominent sweat from his upper lip... He
	beckons nervously to the Makeup Woman -- who comes in and dabs --
	then dabs again as Aaron feels himself under his arms...

				MAKEUP WOMAN
		Gee whiz.

				FLOOR MANAGER
		Five seconds.

	She scurries away, Aaron reaching for another Kleenex from her
	box and missing it... A graphic illustrating his next scripted
	section appears behind him.

				AARON
		...the sub-bases referred to are
		located in five countries...

	And now the moisture on his face is clearly discernible -- the
	Floor Manager and Makeup Woman grimacing at the growing specter
	as they look at a large monitor.

				AARON
		France, Belgium, the Netherlands,
		Spain as...

	And now so much moisture sprouts from his upper lip that he
	pushes his lower lip out to slurp away the sweat... The Makeup
	Woman laughs briefly out loud before catching herself...
	Aaron's eyes dart angrily in her direction.

				AARON
		We well as Great Britain...Our own
		State Department was rocked not only
		by the revelation but from the highly
		unusual persistence from the State 
		Press Corps.  Martin Klein reports on 
		the ruckus at Foggy Bottom.

	Half-beat until he's sure that he's off -- his shirt now
	showing distinct sweat stains...

				AARON
		Help me.

	The Makeup Woman picks up her Kleenex box -- then thinks
	better of it...

				MAKEUP WOMAN
		Someone finds me some big towels.

	ON AARON

	He blots his face -- some makeup streaked -- by the towel.

				FLOOR MANAGER
		Five seconds.

	ON MAKEUP WOMAN

	As she scurries away, this time entering the control room
	trotting up one stair to look at the monitor... the Director
	talking to his Camera Operators.

				DIRECTOR
		I'd go looser but we wouldn't
		see the graphic.

				TECHNICIAN
			(to other Technician)
		No -- this is more than Nixon ever
		sweated.

	The Makeup Woman now looks at the bank of monitors.

				MAKEUP WOMAN
		Can't you just die for him?

	ON MONITOR

	Aaron's makeup-streaked face.

	EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - NIGHT

	Tom and Jane walking drinks in hand, her arm around his waist.
	They stop -- he rests a drink on a ledge and boosts her up
	and then sits next to her.

				TOM
		You okay?

				JANE
		Great.

	FULL SHOT

	REVEALING that they are sitting on an anti-terrorist concrete
	abutment protecting a major government building on a beautiful
	night in our capitol.  He is still holding her hand -- and
	now he notes this.

				TOM
			(loudly to himself)
		Why can't I let go of this woman?

				JANE
		Well...

	He interrupts her with the smallest of kisses -- so mall and
	swift a kiss that she is left doing her return kisses to mid-
	air.  And then he does something he's thought about many times
	before -- he briefly caresses her breasts -- while continuing
	to look at her.

				JANE
		At least kiss me when you do
		that.

				TOM
			(a grin)
		You just can't stop editing me.
		Huh?

				JANE
		This is hysterical.

	She laughs a little -- then kisses him.  They break --
	surprised and aroused and look at each other...

				JANE
		I was half hoping I wouldn't
		have a good time tonight.  You
		know why?

				TOM
		Because you're nuts.

				JANE
		Right, right -- Isn't she fun to
		tease?

	He leans forward and speaks softly and truly.

				TOM
		More and more lately when I've
		watched you in action -- seen all
		your energy -- I've been
		wondering what it would be like
		to be inside all that energy.

	She takes a gulp of her drink -- puts a hand to feel the heat
	on her own cheek.  Then turns to him.

				JANE
		Right back at you.

	Several beats.

				TOM
		I don't remember saying anything
		like that -- exactly...I don't
		know why I just did.

				JANE
			(immediately at work)
		Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well,
		I can think of two reasons.

				TOM
		What?

				JANE
		Three...I just thought of a third...
		If you talk about it, you don't have
		to do it.

				TOM
		That's not it.

				JANE
		Good...Another is you're trying to
		make it all about sex and heat and
		nothing else.

	She looks at him -- he's thinking.

				JANE
		Or it's that great feeling that you
		don't want to hold anything back.
		You know, intimacy.

	She elbows him.  Tom takes in the choices -- then:

				JANE
			(suddenly)
		Oh, shit.  I'm a creep.

	She moves off the concrete wall.

				JANE
		I forgot all about Aaron.  I
		promised to stop by and see
		how he did.

				TOM
		I'd like to know.  I'll go along.

				JANE
		No.  I'll see you at your apartment
		as soon as I can.

	She starts to flurry with activity -- moves to the curb when
	out of nowhere Tom barks a sharp command, the first time any
	of his actions has been tinged with fury.

				TOM
		JANE!

	Thrown, she stops and turns.  He walks to her.

				JANE
		What happened?

				TOM
		Don't run off --  like everything's
		settled the minute you make up your
		mind.

				JANE
		He might be weird -- he can talk more
		freely if I go alone -- why's that so
		hard to understand?

				TOM
		It's not that it's hard.  I just want you
		to give me a minute to catch up.

				JANE
		Okay.
			(she hugs him)
		Sorry.
			(another beat)
		Don't yell at me like that again,
		you scared the life out of me.

	EXT. AARON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	As Jane exits a cab and moves up the steps.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT

	It is at the top of a flight of steps.  She KNOCKS on the DOOR.
	RINGS.  KNOCKS.  Aaron opens it.  He is wearing a sweatshirt
	and cords.

				AARON
		I was in the shower.

	She enters.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

				JANE
		How'd it go?

				AARON
		You didn't see it or speak to
		anybody?

				JANE
		No.

				AARON
		Then it went well.

				JANE
		Did it really go well?

				AARON
		Define your terms.

				JANE
		Do you feel good about it?

				AARON
		No.

				JANE
		Do others feel that you did well?

				AARON
		No.

				JANE
		Then what was good about it?

				AARON
		I lost six pounds...

				JANE
		Aaron, will you tell me?

				AARON
		It was great...writing my little
		first rate copy, sitting on my
		jacket, punching my one thought.
		But I had this historic attack of
		flop sweat so they'll never let
		me another again.  Oh, I lost one
		of your shoulder pads -- how was
		your evening anyway?

				JANE
		What do you mean, flop sweat? --
		you're making too much out of
		it...I'll bet you were the only
		one aware of it...

				AARON
		People phoned in.

				JANE
		Stop kidding.  I want to know
		what happened.

				AARON
		I'm not kidding.

				JANE
		There were complaining phone calls
		because you were sweating?

				AARON
		No, nice ones worried that I was
		having a heart attack.

				JANE
		If all that happened, how come you're
		so chipper?

				AARON
		I don't know.  At a certain point
		it was so off the chart bad --
		it got funny.  My central nervous
		system was telling me something.
		Jane -- sweat running down my face --
		makeup falling into my eyes -- people
		turning this fusillade of blow dryers
		on me -- all so I could read
		introductions to other people who
		were covering stories which is
		what I like to do anyway.  And I'm
		chipper because you finally showed
		up.  I thought I'd cook for us.
		Tequila and eggs sound good?

				JANE
		I have to be somewhere.

	He looks at a clock reading 1:15 in the morning.

				JANE
		I told what's his name -- Tom --
		that I'd meet him.

				AARON
		Call him -- I mean it can wait, 
		right?

				JANE
			(now the plunge)
		I don't know.  I may be in love
		with him.

				AARON
			(as if he just burned
			 his hand)
		No!!!!!

	She starts for the door.

				AARON
		Don't go.

				JANE
		This is important to me.

				AARON
		Yeah.  Well...I think it is
		important for you too.  Sit down.

	She sits.  He walks to a desk and looks at her briefly... Silence.

				JANE
		What?

				AARON
			(looking at her)
		Let me think a second.  It's
		tough.

	A remarkably long silence -- her mind wanders, she takes stock...
	it is evident that he is straining to get it right, reaching
	into himself.

				AARON
		Aaach...Jane...
			(glancing at note)
		Let's take the part that has
		nothing to do with me.  Let's let
		me be your most trusted friend,
		the one that gets to say awful
		things to you.  You know?

				JANE
			(testy and wary
			 but fair)
		Yes, I guess.  Yes.

				AARON
		You can't end up with Tom because
		it goes totally against everything
		you're about.

				JANE
		Yeah -- being a basket case.

				AARON
		I know you care about him.  I've
		never seen you like this about
		anyone, so please don't take it
		wrong when I tell you that I believe
		that Tom, while a very nice guy, is
		the Devil.

				JANE
			(quickly)
		This isn't friendship.

				AARON
		What do you think the Devil is going
		to look like if he's around?  Nobody
		is going to be taken in if he has a
		long, red, pointy tail.  No.  I'm
		semi-serious here.  He will look
		attractive and he will be nice and
		helpful and he will get a job where
		he influences a great God-fearing
		nation and he will never do an evil
		thing...he will just bit by little bit
		lower standards where they are important.
		Just coax along flash over substance...
		Just a tiny bit.  And he will talk about
		all of us really being salesmen.
			(seeing he's not
			 reaching her)
		And he'll get all the great women.

	She is getting pissed.

				JANE
		I think you're the Devil.

				AARON
		No.  You know that I'm not.

				JANE
		How?

				AARON
		Because we have the kind of
		relationship where if I were the
		Devil, you'd be the only one I
		told.

	She's briefly impressed.  He has a point.

				JANE
		You were quick enough to get
		Tom's help when...

				AARON
		Yes, yes.  I know.  Right.  And
		if it had gone well for me tonight,
		maybe I'd be keeping quiet about all
		this...I grant you everything but
		give me this...he does personify
		everything you've been fighting
		against...And I'm in love with you.
			(realizing)
		How do you like that? -- I buried
		the lead.

	He pauses to catch his breath -- breathing deeply through his
	nose.

				AARON
			(an aside)
		I've got to not say that aloud;
		it takes too much out of me.

				JANE
			(thawing)
		Sit down, stop.

	Aaron slumps down -- it's been a long round.

				AARON
		I've never fought for anyone before.
		Does anybody win one of these things?

	INT. TOM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	A CAR DOOR SLAMS in the street below -- he goes towards the
	window which is blocked by his sofa -- puts his knees in and
	looks out.

	TOM'S P.O.V.

	A woman walking from a car.

	ON TOM

	Momentarily thinking it's Jane.  Elated.

	TOM'S P.O.V.

	It is not Jane.  The PHONE RINGS.

	INTERCUT:

	BACK TO SCENE

	As he answers and we have the following conversation between
	Jane, who is using the phone, with Aaron seen just a few feet
	away.  Tom in his apartment.

				JANE
		Hi.  It's me.

				TOM
		Where are you?

				JANE
		I can't get away just yet.  I'm 
		at Aaron's.

				TOM
		Well, when?

				JANE
		I'm not sure.  It seems like he
		had sort of a mishap on the news.

				TOM
		I know.  I taped it.

				JANE
		It wasn't as bad as he think, was
		it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or
		anything?

				TOM
		Not if you count 'Singing in the
		Rain.'  Do him a favor and don't
		treat it like a tragedy.  You want
		me to talk to him?

	Her eyes meet Aaron's.

				JANE
		Uh-uh.
			(to Aaron)
		He says you could hardly notice it.

	Aaron beckons for the phone.  Jane hands it to him, as she does
	so:

				JANE
		Don't say anything about anything.

				AARON
		Hi.  Will I ever sing again?

				TOM
		Everybody has one like that.  I
		thought it was great when you
		started to laugh at the end.

				AARON
		Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying
		up Jane, I didn't realize you two
		would be going this late.  Sorry.

				TOM
		No.  Don't worry about it.

				AARON
		I'll put her on.

	She takes the phone.

				JANE
		Hi, again.  Sorry about...

				TOM
		No.  That sounds more important.
		Let's forget about tonight.

				JANE
		I don't know if that's absolutely
		necessary.

				TOM
		I've got my father coming through
		tomorrow anyway.  I should get
		some sleep.

				JANE
			(hampered by Aaron's
			 presence)
		Uh-huh.

				TOM
		I'll see you at the office.  Good night.

	Several beats of silence.  Finally:

				TOM
			(finally)
		Hello?

				JANE
		Yes.

				TOM
		Okay.  Good night.

				JANE
			(aghast)
		Good night??!

				TOM
		Jane, I'm not some chore you have
		to finish so you can stay on schedule.

				JANE
		Okay, great, Grunick -- Easy shots
		now -- huh?  Good night.

 	She puts the phone down.  A beat -- she looks stricken.  Aaron
	looks at her.

				JANE
		He just cancelled.  He had a
		chance to think and he
		cancelled.

	She bows her head.

				JANE
		I can't breathe.
			(aghast)
		Over a guy?!?
			(then)
		But I can't -- I can't breathe.
		Damn it!

	She gulps a breath.  Her hands on her knees, leaning over --
	another deep breath.  Aaron takes in the specter.

				AARON
		Well, Jane, it was nice of you
		to drop by.

	INT. JANE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	As she enters -- goes immediately to the phone.

	ON PHONE...

	Cradled in an answering machine -- indexes for sixteen
	one-button calls, mostly people from work -- "Parents" etc.
	Jane plays her answering tape.  It is silent -- no messages...
	She fast forwards to double-check.  Just the SOUND of blank
	tape.  She pushes the button next to the "Tom Grunick."  We
	HEAR a busy signal.

	ON JANE

	She hangs up the phone.  Then compulsively hits the "Tom"
	button again.  Busy.  And again.  Busy.  She considers for
	a moment hitting the button next to Aaron's name.

				JANE
			(stopping herself)
		Be fair.

	She presses the button next to Tom's name.  Busy.  And again.
	Busy.

	EXT. ERNIE MERRIMAN'S HOUSE - MONDAY MORNING

	As he picks up for newspapers dotting his lawn and opens the
	door of his car -- just as his wife calls from the door.

				WIFE
		Ernie, they're calling from work.

				ERNIE
		Tell me I'm on the way in.

				WIFE
		It's Paul.

	Ernie, just a bit concerned, walks back to his house -- the
	four newspapers thick enough to be an awkward carry.

	INT. ERNIE'S HOUSE

	A phone in the immaculate living room.

				ERNIE
			(into phone)
		Hello.  Yes...

	He holds the phone down at his side for a beat, composing
	himself in the face of a sudden and horrible turn of events.

				ERNIE
		Would there be any point to my going	
		to New York and talking to them?  Would
		there be any point in going over it with
		you?  No, I'm still coming in.

	He hangs up.

				WIFE
		What?

				ERNIE
		They fired me.

	She takes his hand and kisses it -- then hugs him.

				WIFE
			(weeping)
		How horrible.  We'll be fine.  You'll
		be fine.  Stay here with me -- we'll
		go for a drive, have some drinks, make
		happy plans.

				ERNIE
		No.  They're firing even more people
		than they said.  Some will want to
		talk.  It could help.

				WIFE
			(timidly)
		I could use somebody to talk to on
		a day like this.
			(on his reaction)
		Sorry. Go ahead.

	He kisses her sad face.

				ERNIE
		Bye, sweetie.

				WIFE
		Okay, sweetie.

	He walks towards the door -- picks up his newspapers on the
	tray beneath the hall mirror and does a start.

	HIS P.O.V.

	In the mirror he SEES his wife making faces at him behind his
	back.  He EXITS his home without comment.

	INT. EDITING ROOM - DAY

	Jane is sitting in her editing cubby -- it is past noon.  She
	rises and stands in her doorway looking toward Tom's office --
	the door is open, the room is empty.  Blair ENTERS carrying
	an armload of tapes.  She looks extraordinary.

				BLAIR
		I've got four hours of French
		demonstrations --

	Jane waves it off.

				BLAIR
		Some of it they use water cannons.

	Jane takes the tape.

				JANE
		What are you dressed up for?  Oh,
		that's right -- because the Evening
		News is here this week.

				BLAIR
		I spent a fortune on this.

	Blair EXITS... Jane pops the tape in, automatically making
	timing notes, then standing -- looking again towards Tom's
	door.

	JANE'S P.O.V.

	The door now closed.

	JANE

	She stops the tape -- summons herself.  She walks towards Tom's

	office and opens the door.  Tom is seated behind his desk.

				JANE
			(without passion)
		I kept trying to call you -- you
		never called me.  Were you just
		diddling me?  Is that it--?  I'm
		great if I'm helping your career.
			(mimicking)
		But when I'm a woman for a second, I
		get immediately fucked around by
		you.

	She is obviously in pain but still alert enough to catch Tom's
	answer.

	INT. TOM'S OFFICE - DAY

				TOM
		Jane, this is my Dad.

	And, now OPENING the door a bit more -- Tom's father is REVEALED
	seated across from him.

				JANE
			(that quickly)
		Please forgive what I said.
			(to Tom)
		Sorry.

	As she retreats:

				TOM
		You just light up a room and leave,
		huh?

	She laughs nervously as she exits.

	TOM AND HIS DAD

				DAD
		You want my opinion?

				TOM
		The thing that's easy to miss about
		Jane is...

				DAD
		You want my opinion?  And it's okay
		if you don't.

	Tom thinks a beat.

				TOM
		Yes, I would.

				DAD
		The way she just acted is not the
		way an affectionate person acts.

	Tom finds the comment off-the-wall enough to be thought
	provoking.

	INT. NEWSROOM - DAY

	Paul arriving with Bill Rorish.  The first time we have seen
	the multi-millionaire anchorman in the flesh.  He has the grace
	and dignity of a man who spends every waking moment working on
	grace and dignity,

	He and Paul are in the midst of an important conversation --
	muted and ominous.

				BILL
		Just when do you start, telling people?

				PAUL
		Almost immediately.

				BILL
		I'd like to take everyone out after
		the show.

				PAUL
		Bill...This is hard on all of us
		and it's no time for compliments.
		But I think it's extraordinary of
		you to come down here for this.

				BILL
		If we're not here for each other
		during the tough time, we're not a
		news organization.

	Blair ENTERS scene.  The smallest flicker of interest from Bill,
	but more than enough to justify her going into hock for the
	outfit.

				BLAIR
		Welcome back to Washington.

				BILL
		Thanks.

	A self-conscious look of greeting to Paul and she's gone.

				BILL
		I've forgotten.  Was she on the list?

	Paul nods "yes."

				BILL
		This is a brutal layoff...And all
		because they couldn't program Wednesdays.

				PAUL
			(can't resist)
		You can make it a little less brutal
		by knocking a million dollars or so off
		your salary.

	AS Bill turns:

				PAUL
		Just a bad joke.  I'm sorry.  Awful.
		It's a miserable day and that was
		some kind of totally sick-joke
		defense mechanism which does not
		indicate any of my feelings -- not
		one -- but just shows the kind of
		stress this represents for all of us.

	Tom and his Father ENTER the scene from Tom's office.  Bill
	walks to Tom.

				BILL
		Hi.  It's about time.

				TOM
		Good to see you, Bill.

	AS they shake:

	INSERT

	A great handshake.

	ON MR. GRUNICK'S FACE

	touched, as he watches the networks' most prominent journalist
	greet his son.

				TOM
		This is my father.

				BILL
		Good to meet you, sir.

	ON TOM

	Equally touched as he watches the world's most prominent
	journalist greet his Dad, who turns goofy with excitement.

				MR. GRUNICK
		Good-bye, Tom.

	He puts a big hand on his son's cheek -- a farewell pat.  Then
	whispers in his ear.

				MR. GRUNICK
		I'm going to go back home and tell
		all your old teachers.

	Tom watches his father walk off and moves immediately to Jane's
	editing room.

	INT. JANE'S EDITING ROOM - DAY

	AS Tom enters...

				JANE
		I feel terrible about what happened.
		What did he say?

				TOM
		He -- uh -- said he liked you because
		you looked like you had -- fire and
		honesty.

				JANE
			(enormously pleased)
		No.  Did he really?

				TOM
		Yes.  Then he said a really weird
		thing...

				JANE
			(so softly)
		What?

				TOM
			(he means this)
		That it would be a treat to make
		someone like you feel better...
		He gets like that sometimes.

				JANE
		That's so perfectly...It really
		makes me feel a little faint...
			(actually woozy)
		Whooo.

	Blair enters wildly into the scene.

				BLAIR
		They canned me.  Well, my brother
		will feel great -- now he's not the
		only screw-up.

				JANE
		It's started.

	Bobbie sticks his head out of his office...

				BOBBIE
		Tom -- Paul wants to see you.

	AS Tom focuses and moves off:

	INT. NEWSROOM AND HALLWAYS - DAY

	Moving with Tom.  Nervousness growing, confidence gone, he
	proceeds down the hallway.

	INT. ERNIE'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY

				SECRETARY
		He'll just be a minute.

	Tom sits down -- pats his tie in place... A beat and the door
	opens.  Paul leads out Martin Klein.  They shake hands.

				MARTIN KLEIN
		You know I'm just old enough to be
		flattered by the term, 'early retirement.'

				PAUL
		That's wonderful...what a lovely line.
		If there's anything I can do.

	They shake.

				MARTIN KLEIN
			(evenly)
		I certainly hope you die soon.

	A little smile to Tom and he's off.

				PAUL
		Tom.

	Tom enters the room.  A nervous cough in evidence as he
	crosses to a seat.

				PAUL
		We're having a severe cutback, Tom --
		17 people in this bureau including
		technical personnel and we're going
		to reorganize at the same time.
		We're going to take you out of Washington
		for a while and assign you to London.

	INT. NEWSROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

	Aaron and Ernie are off to the side in the newsroom -- People
	are packing their belongings -- as secretaries cry and embrace --
	from an office rumbles a shouted denunciation:

				ANONYMOUS VOICE
		No.  I won't keep my voice down.
		Those sons-of-bitches...They are
		worse than accountants -- they
		are bad accountants.

	Tom enters scene.

				TOM
		Have you guys seen Jane?

				ERNIE
		She's in there becoming the first
		woman bureau chief we've had here.

	Tom takes this in.

				AARON
		What did they do with you?

				TOM
		They booted me out of Washington.

				AARON
		Impossible.  There's no system that
		wouldn't value one of us.

				TOM
		Why?  What did they do to you?

				ERNIE
			(pointing at Aaron)
		It's what he did.  I'm proud of
		him.

				AARON
		They told me they'd keep me because
		they could plug me into any story
		and my salary was in line.

				ERNIE
		The cost-efficient reporter.

				AARON
		So I quit.

	A weeping woman bursts into their circle and sweeps Ernie away.
	Tom and Aaron stand there -- comrades at last -- victims of
	the same sword.

				TOM
		You packing up tonight?

				AARON
		Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're
		sending you down for a while, but
		you'll make it back...Where they
		sending you?

				TOM
		London.

				AARON
			(incensed)
		London.  That's a promotion!

				TOM
			(defensively)
		I don't think so.

				AARON
		It is.  Yes -- that's where they
		had Rorish, for God's sake, before
		they made him anchor.  I can't stand
		it -- they're grooming you for it
		all and you don't even know it.

				TOM
		Hold it down, okay?

				AARON
		Can I ask you something?  You only
		had one crew on the date rape piece,
		right?

	He extends his hand.

				TOM
		Yes.  You're not going to stick
		around for the farewell party?

				AARON
		No.  I don't know how much fun it
		will be when Martin Klein and Ernie
		have to drop off their credentials
		with the security guard.

	Aaron looks at people packing their belongings in boxes -- a
	few pockets of conversation... Ernie reading some copy.

				AARON
		This story they won't cover.  And if
		the network doesn't cover it -- it
		must not be important so why worry.

				TOM
			(eyeing him)
		I'm going to miss you -- you're a
		prick in a great way...

	Aaron taken by surprise -- laughs.

				TOM
		You know what I...

				AARON
		No, I liked the way it made me sound.
		Okay.  Be good.  So long.

	He exits.

	INT. TOM'S OFFICE - DAY

	AS he picks up a clean wastebasket and deposits his belongings.
	A scheduled book, clean shirt, two ties, cuff-links, a travel
	mirror, cassettes of his Washington reporting.  His desk clear --
	he writes on a clean piece of copy paper.  He centers it on his
	desk.

	INSERT - PAPER

	"Good luck, you'll love the bureau chief... Previous Occupants."

	INT. NEWSROOM - DAY

	AS Tom enters from his office, a wake is slowly igniting.  Tom
	moves along the edge of the room, carrying his wastebasket full
	of belongings, not really a part of the mournful festivities.

	TOM'S P.O.V.

	Jane across the room hugging one person after another.

	ON JANE

	AS she embraces an older secretary.

				OLDER SECRETARY
		You know what I always wanted to
		tell you -- that...

				JANE
		Shhh.  This isn't the last time
		we'll see each other.  It's not.

	A two-armed tight embrace of Martin Klein.

				JANE
		We'll get them back -- it's going
		to change.

	Blair is at hand as they embrace.

				BLAIR
		Except for socially, you're my role
		model.

	And now she sees Tom -- he mouths one word at her -- "London."
	She nods that she already knows and then lets her body sag a
	little.  He gestures her towards her editing room, so they can
	rendezvous.

	INT. EDITING ROOM - DAY

	AS Tom enters and waits for Jane.  When she enters he closes
	the door.

				JANE
		These people -- it's all so awful.
		It just hurts physically, doesn't
		it?  Like something's wrong with
		your bones, like your organs are
		shifting inside your body.

	She looks at him expectantly.  It's not what he's feeling.

				TOM
		Maybe I haven't been here long
		enough.
			(great)
		But, hey, congratulations on the
		promotion.

				JANE
		How can you say that to me?

				TOM
		Sorry.
			(a beat)
		I can't stand here feeing bad that
		I don't feel worse.  This has happened
		at every station I ever worked for.
		Look, I think it's crazy for you to
		come in here tomorrow and start a
		new job.  I have a week to get to
		my job.  Let's get the hell away to some
		island fast and find out how we are
		together away from this.

	A beat -- Jane takes it in.

				JANE
		Well, I just think that' an extraordinary 
		proposal.

				TOM
		That's yes?

				JANE
		That's more than 'yes' -- that's
		'you bet.'

	They kiss.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	The phone rings.  He answers.

				AARON
		Hello.

	INT. JANE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	Jane -- still at the office -- it is quite late.

				JANE
		Bastard, sneak, quitter.

				AARON
		Speaking.

				JANE
		I just found out.  You didn't say
		anything to me?  You just resign?
		Will you meet me now? -- No, now!
		I'm going away tomorrow.  Please.

	INT. SIDEWALK - RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	Across the street from the bureau's building.  Aaron and Jane
	are having a beer.  They are in mid-conversation.

				JANE
		Why not try it for a few weeks?

				AARON
		Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too --
		he couldn't help.  My agent has a
		hot prospect -- the number two station
		in Portland.  The general manager says
		he wants to be every bit as good as the
		networks.  Personally, I think he should
		aim higher.

				JANE
		Tell me the God's honest truth --
		are you leaving because of me?
		Because if you are...

				AARON
		Ernie told this story.  How he used
		to write obits and when the people
		in town called him up with death
		notices, he cried.  He was till
		that way when they promoted him
		out of obits.  He says you're lucky
		if you can get out while you could
		still cry.
			(a beat)
		I should have quit this place  three
		years ago.

				JANE
		You're just trying to say all great
		stuff so I'll feel even worse that
		you're not around.

	He laughs.

				AARON
		Let's go...

				JANE
		I just want to sit here longer, I mean
		the feeling is powerful -- why's that?

				AARON
		Maybe the best part of your life is over
		and you don't want to get up and start
		the bad part.

	Jane looks at him levelly.

				JANE
		You are now required to sit here with
		me.
			(a beat; then)
		Come on...be smart for a second --
		what do you think will happen to us?

				AARON
		Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six
		years from now I'll be in town to
		collect an award representing the surge
		in foreign coverage by local stations.

				JANE
			(smile, it's like 
			 old times)
		Yes.

				AARON
		I'll be walking with my wife and two
		children -- we'll bump into you on
		the street, my youngest son will say
		something and I'll tell him...
			(deliberately)
		...it's not nice to make fun of single,
		fat ladies.

				JANE
		You won't be able to stay mad at me,
		right?

				AARON
		I hope so...
			(on her look he relents)
		No.  I'm not really mad.
			(nodding head as if
			 reciting a catechism)
		I'll miss you, we'll talk, we'll always
		be friends...we'll get hot for each other
		every few years at dinner and never act
		on it, okay?

	Jane smiles -- Aaron has grown suddenly angry.  He rises,
	walks away, then turns.

				AARON
		Jane, you know how Tom had tears in
		the piece the other night?  Ask
		yourself how we were able to see
		them when he only had one camera
		and that was pointing at the girl
		during the interview.
			(on her reaction)
		I'm fairly sure I was right to tell 
		you.

	EXT. OFFICE - NIGHT

	We LOOK THROUGH THE WINDOW as Jane enters -- in a frenzy --
	searching the stacks.

	INT. TAPE LIBRARY - NIGHT

	As she locates the cassette labelled "DATE-RAPE - 9/26 -
	EVENING NEWS - OUTTAKES."

	INT. TAPE CUBBY - NIGHT

	As she inserts the tape into the player.

	ANGLE ON JANE... AND MONITOR

	As she watches... this is what she sees...

				YOUNG WOMAN
		...but the whole thing messed me
		up more than it should.

	She cries.  We HEAR Tom.

				TOM'S VOICE
		Okay, that will do it.  You okay?

	The tape is rocky now -- the Sound Woman and Cameraman
	continue to roll as they move towards their next shot --
	at times the camera pointing towards the carpet -- but
	the sound continues.  The crew chatting -- mentioning
	that the tape is still rolling.

				TOM
		That's enough.  That's enough.

				YOUNG WOMAN
		I'm sorry.

				TOM
		Are you okay?

				YOUNG WOMAN
		Yes, I'm sorry.

				TOM
		Don't be silly.  What are you sorry 
		about?

				YOUNG WOMAN
		The way you were looking at me, I just went.

	Tom moves through the SHOT.

				TOM
		I just need you for another minute now,
		so we can shoot from behind towards me,
		and, um...

				YOUNG WOMAN
		Uh-huh.

				TOM
		...that way we have someplace to go when 
		we cut.  And I just sit here, I nod my 
		head and look nerdy.

	Young Woman chuckles.

	Jane chuckles.

				SOUNDWOMAN'S VOICE
		Tom

				TOM
		Yeah.

				SOUNDWOMAN'S VOICE
		It kills me we didn't have a second camera.  
		It was so powerful seeing your reaction.

				TOM
		Really?

				YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE
		Yes, it is.

				SOUND WOMAN'S VOICE
		For a second there, I thought you were 
		gonna cry yourself.  That would have 
		been something.

				TOM
			(considering, then)
		Then give me a minute...

				JANE
			(fully realizing)
		You fucking...

	As Jane watches we SEE Tom work up the tears we saw in the
	Evening News piece -- as he does so:

				YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE
		Oh, that's amazing.

	ON Jane's shocked reaction:

	EXT. BWI AIRPORT - DAY

	Jane's cab pulls up to the curb.  She gets out -- she is
	carrying no luggage.  She sees Tom who hurriedly walks up
	to her.  Jane is fighting to maintain a calm.

				TOM
		Look who's the organized one.
		I've got everything.

	He briefly opens a paper gift shop bag he is holding and shows
	her he has bought them each a bathing suit.

				JANE
		I'm not going.

	He looks at her with anticipatory distaste evident on his face.

				TOM
		Why?

				JANE
		I saw the taped outtakes of the
		interview with the girl.  I know
		you 'acted' your reaction after
		the interview.

	Tom half turns from her and moves back toward the bench.  Jane close 
	behind, stalking him.

				TOM
		I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's
		verboten, huh?  I thought since I did
		it for real the first time -- but I get
		you.  That's not the reason you're not
		coming?

				JANE
			(raising her voice)
		Of course it's the reason.  It's
		terrible what you did.

				TOM
		We disagree on how God-awful it
		was.  Why don't you come with me
		and we can disagree and get a tan
		at the same time?

				JANE
			(livid)
		Jesus, if you're glib about this
		I'm going to lose it.  I was up
		all night and...

				TOM
			(calmly)
		Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...

				JANE
		It made me ill.  You could get
		fired for things like that.

				TOM
		I got promoted for things like that.

				JANE
		Working up tears for a new piece
		cutaway...You totally crossed the
		line between...

				TOM
		It's hard not to cross it; they keep
		moving the little sucker, don't they?

				JANE
			(distaste)
		It just proves that the difference we 
		have are...

				TOM
		This is a one-way argument.  We've got
		six days; if you go and we fight and
		we hate it -- we'll come home.  If you
		don't go?  Well, that's a much bigger
		deal.  I go to London right after that.
		So, it'd be very big deal if you stay
		here.  The plane's boarding.  You're
		good at deadline.  Here's your ticket.

				JANE
			(taking ticket)
		It's amazing.  You commit this
		incredible breach of ethics and
		you act as if I'm nitpicking.  Try
		and get this.  When you edited that...

				TOM
			(deliberately)
		I'm leaving now.  Gate 43.

	He simply turns and walks away -- looking back once as Jane
	stands there mucked up by his sudden departure -- the lack
	of resolution to their confrontation is palpable.

	INT. TERMINAL - DAY

	On Tom moving past the metal detector.  He too is frustrated
	-- pissed off at her.

	INT. OTHER TERMINAL AREA

	Jane moving quickly along towards the metal detectors.

	INT. METAL DETECTOR

	As Jane passes through and sets off the buzzer.  She stands
	there -- the heel of her hand pressed to her brow trying to
	stem the tears.  As others look on, she takes a huge key ring
	from her pocket -- deposits it in the box -- walks through
	without a buzzer and moves on.

	INT. BOARDING RAMP - DAY

	Tom waiting while in the b.g.  "People Eater" busses ferry
	passengers to the plane.

	As one full "People Eater" pulls away and another empty one arrives.

				TICKET AGENT
			(to Tom)
		This is the last one.

	Others start to board.  He sees Jane moving towards him.
	He walks to her, she gestures back towards the street.

				JANE
		That's not going to be the way
		we say good-bye.  Even though I
		think what you did was rotten --
		it's not all impersonal.  You mean
		something to me.

				TOM
			(interrupting)
		You keep coming after me and
		looking down on me.  It's starting
		to make me batty.

	She looks at him.

				TOM (cont'd)
		I can't help it that they like me.
		And I like that they like me.  And
		I think there's a lot of this job that
		I do well.  What do you think it takes
		to do this job -- the way they have
		it now?

				JANE
		I don't wan to discuss work.

				TOM
		Well, let's do a special report on
		that...I mean that's news.

				JANE
		I knew what you meant.

				TOM
		What I don't know, I can learn and
		what I know, nobody can teach.
		Excuse me for saying it about myself,
		but I think it's true.
			(old habit)
		What do you think?
			(catching himself)
		Never mind what you think.

	They look at each other.

				JANE
		You're lucky I came after you so
		you got that off your...

				TOM
		Yes, I am.  Thanks.  I mean it.

				JANE
		It's okay.

				TICKET AGENT
		Sir?

	The pressure begins to bend Jane's resolve.

				JANE
		So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?

				TOM
			(wary but hopeful)
		You want to come?

				JANE
			(totally open)
		It's just that one of the few things
		I'm not confused about is what I
		was saying downstairs, that...

				TOM
			(giving up -- sadly,
			 finally)
		Then you should stay here.

				JANE
			(softly)
		It's better when you let me say it.

	He hugs her.  Now that it's over, they can each openly care
	for each other.  While in the embrace:

				TOM
		Take it easy.

				JANE
		Why did I have to do this to
		myself?  Watch you take off.
			(then)
		Call me if you need anything.

	He kisses her lightly -- looking at her... Then heartfelt:

				TOM
		Oh, honey.

	He walks to the People Eater and gets on, still holding his
	paper bags of bathing suits.  The bus pulls away.

	ON JANE

	Watching him go.

	JANE'S P.O.V.

	Tom standing at the front window of the bus -- framed very
	much as he is when on television.

	INT. AIRPORT TAXICAB - DAY

	Jane gets quickly into cab.

				CABBIE
		Good morning.

				JANE
		Good morning.
			(after collecting herself)
		Dupont Circle, please.

	The cab pulls away.

				JANE
		Don't take the beltway, because at this
		time of day there's gonna be a lot...
			(stops herself, then)
		...Go any way you want.

	She sits back in the seat (containing herself) before finally and 
	quietly adding what she knows to be true:

				JANE
		But New York Avenue's faster.

							FADE OUT:

	FADE IN:

	EXT. CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

	Much the same place where Jane and Tom first met.  The
	words "SEVEN YEAS LATER" appears on the screen.

	A sign off to one side tells us it's the annual meeting of the
	Local Television Broadcasters... and that at 2 P.M.  Tom Grunick
	will be speaking on "Responsibilities of Broadcast Journalism
	for the '90s."

	INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

	Much the same audience, though two members of the audience
	may strike particular interest -- curly haired man seen
	from behind holding a similarly curly haired five-year-old.
	Tom is in mid-speech.

				TOM
		... when they told me Bill had decided
		to retire and offered me the Evening
		News, I thought it was the same kind
		of joke we used to pull back at the
		station -- turning off somebody's
		prompter in the middle of a show.

	Some good-natured laughter.

				TOM (cont'd)
		And then when they heard my reaction --
		they thought I was kidding.  I told them
		I'd be their anchor but I didn't want
		to be the Managing Editor -- that there
		were people better qualified than I to 
		control the content and if there 
		weren't we were all in trouble.

	The audience really enjoys this:

	SAME SCENE -- SOME MINUTES LATER

	MOVING SHOT...

	The anchor teams -- leaning forward.  They love this man,
	a humble specialist refusing the generalist trap.  Imagine
	the feeling -- you see, on the top of the mountain, a man
	not unlike yourself.

				TOM
		And now to something more
		important... I'd like to introduce
		my bride.
			(gestures to a woman in
			 the front row)
		Lila?

	A svelte, classic, warm beauty gets to her feet.

	ON CURLY HAIRED MAN AND BOY...

	Aaron and his son as Aaron cranes for a look at Mrs. Grunick.

	INT. AUDITORIUM - STAGE AREA - MOMENTS LATER

	Tom and Lila shaking hand.  Aaron, his son in his arms, wait.

	ON TOM

	As he sees Aaron... he is clearly delighted.

				TOM
		Holy shit, Aaron.

	He claps him on the back... Aaron is as pleased as he is
	uncomfortable with the attention.

				TOM
		Lila -- this is Aaron Altman.

				LILA
			(high British accent)
		Oh, yes -- you're one of Tom's
		50 or so role models.

				AARON
		Hi.

				TOM
		Well, this kid couldn't possibly
		belong to anyone else.  What's
		your name?

				BOY
		Clifford...

				AARON
			(indicating Tom)
		Do you know who this is, Cliff?

				BOY
		The big joke?

	Tom looks at him -- Aaron gives his son a disciplinary nudge.

				AARON
		I'm just bringing him over to give
		Jane a look at him --

				TOM
		I thought she'd be here.  I'll
		go with you.

				AARON
		Okay.

				TOM
			(to Lila)
		I'll see you back at the hotel.

				LILA
			(cool)
		All right.

	He starts off.  She pulls him back for an urgent communication.

				LILA
		Tom, the speech was magnificent.

				AARON
		Oh, I didn't say anything about
		your speech.

				TOM
		I appreciate it.

	INT. WALKWAY - DAY

	Tom, Aaron and the boy walking along.  Tom plays with Cliff
	as they move.  The boy is delighted.  Jane is in a park -- a
	blanket spread out -- she is wearing shorts and a top -- she
	has some wine and a small picnic -- a toy for Clifford.

	She HEARS her name being called.

	ON JANE

	Shielding her eyes from the sun -- now making out Tom.  As 
	they reach her.

				JANE
			(to herself)
		Well, why not?
			(as they arrive)
		Hey, what is this?  My life's
		rushing in front of my eyes.

				TOM
		A picnic?

				JANE
		I thought for ol' Cliff here --
		Look at you?  You're more adorable
		than your pictures.  Look what I
		got for you.

	She hands him a toy.

				AARON
		What do you say, Cliff?

	The boy kisses Jane's hand.

				AARON
		He excels at gratitude.

				TOM
			(to Jane)
		Are you any closer to a decision?

				JANE
		I think so...They've been talking
		to me about being Tom's Managing
		Editor.

				AARON
		Really?

				JANE
			(to Tom)
		I'm going to take it.

				TOM
		What a great surprise.  I didn't
		think we had a chance.  I heard
		you wanted to stay in Washington.

				JANE
		Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll
		fly up a lot.

				TOM
		Well, we should talk.  You going to
		have time for  dinner?  I'd like
		you to meet Lila.

		I'm sorry because I was looking

		back in a few hours.

				TOM
		Okay...It's so good to see you.

	She gives him a quick kiss.  He shakes hands with Aaron.

				TOM
			(to Aaron)
		It's nice to see you.

				AARON
		Congratulations on history's longest
		winning streak.

				TOM
		If you ever get restless in Portland,
		let me know.

				AARON
		Why?

	Tom shuffles uncomfortably.

	ON JANE

	Smiling, appreciating Aaron's attitude toward a blandishment of the
	powerful.

				TOM
			(to Jane as he leaves)
		Bye...boss.

	Tom walks away.  He's a good twenty yards away when Aaron looks up
	to see his son running after Tom.

				AARON
			(calling)
		Hey!  Cliff!  Cliff!

	Tom now notices the boy, leans down and pats him.

				TOM
			(to Clifford)
		Go back to your daddy.

	The boy starts back.

				AARON
		Come on, Cliff.  Come on.

	As Clifford runs back to his father, Aaron sits next to Jane.

				AARON
			(to Jane)
		So who's the guy?

				JANE
		Well, we met about three months ago.
		He works at the surgeon general office.
		He loves boating.  So, he's been

	Aaron laughs at the very notion of Jane finding water sports a lure.
	Jane deliberately moves past this moment.

				JANE
		I like it!  So, doll, what about you

				AARON
		Well -- my wife got this new job...

	He continues to talk.  As the two former colleagues catch up,

          DUSK, OR NIGHT HAS ONLY BARELY FALLEN.

          

          

          

          
          A huge clock marks 7:55 p.m. (The clock belongs to some landmark
          building, to be determined). Immediately following, the building goes
          dark.

          Establishing shot of the Eiffel Tower, lit. Suddenly, all the lights
          go out.

          The same thing happens with the Granada's Alhambra, Seville's Giralda
          Tower, the Guggenheim at Bilbao, the Gate of Alcala. All these well-
          known architectonic wonders turn dark, abruptly. (Beauty that
          disappears suddenly, beauty that's extinguished and envelops us in
          darkness.)

          

          

          

          

          1. HARRY CAINE'S HOME. INT. NIGHT.


          

          
          Harry (fifty years old) sits, as if he were waiting, without hurry,
          immobile and patient in his study next to his desk, as if it were the
          thing keeping him company. He isn't doing anything. He lets time
          take its course. His silence is broken by the sound of footsteps that
          come and go. At first we can't see who the footsteps belong to, until
          they stop.

          In the living room, a few meters from Harry, Judit stops. She, too,
          is shrouded in darkness. She looks at her wristwatch, the second hand
          moves from left to right on the watch face. Judit (forty-eight, looks
          younger) breathes, impatient. (She is dressed soberly, in a dignified
          and practical manner).

          

          
          She approaches a window that looks out onto the street. Everything
          outside is also in darkness. The building in front is just a dark
          mass. She looks to the end of the street. Almost all the buildings
          visible from the window are dark, the Gate of Alcala in the background
          is also not lit. Without turning, she says to Harry:

          

          

           JUDIT
           The Door of Alcala has also darkened.

          

          
          Harry is still sitting, inert, absorbed by his thoughts. The whole
          house is in darkness, only the ambient clarity of the night comes
          through the windows, curtains drawn back.

          

          

          

          

           3

          
          Judit heads slowly toward the kitchen. On the wall there is a Vitra
          clock, to which she gives a cursory glance.
          She turns on the faucet and fills a glass of water. From her pocket,
          she removes a tiny heart made of black nacar shell and rimmed in
          silver. She opens it. She grabs a small pink pill. She takes it.
          She glances once more at the stylized design of the Vitra clock. The
          minute hand nears 8 p.m.
          On a windowsill (or on the kitchen table) there is an open newspaper.
          The exposed page displays an article about the dangers of global
          warming. An international date has been convened for a five minute
          blackout at 8 p.m.

          

          
          Standing in the kitchen, Judit, poised and tense, looks up at the spot
          where the clock is. The stillness of all the elements comprising the
          frame make it seem like a painting. She waits until the seconds hand
          completes its cycle and it's 8 o'clock sharp.
          Swiftly, Judit powers the central electrical switchboard, which is in
          the kitchen. The kitchen lights up, the refrigerator emits its
          characteristic sound. The lamps in the living room also light up.
          (Low-hanging lamps that make the light bounce. The house is awash in
          a special luminous atmosphere ­ dense, translucent, with darkened
          zones). All the furniture is flush with the walls. There are some
          paintings hanging and a rug on the ground, everything is of the kind
          of quality that denotes good personal taste.

          

          
          Upon the light's return, Judit exhales a profound sigh of relief.
          She moves toward the window where she was standing earlier and
          contemplates how, in the building across the way, the windows begin to
          blink, in square patterns of light.

          

          

          

          

          2. FLASHBACK. 1994. LANZAROTE HOSPITAL. INT. DAY.


           4

          
          The light's return is contagious, a true spectacle, which ends with a
          blinding light that floods the screen.
          It will probably be a close-up of the sun.

          

          
          That very sun enters through another window, which is not that of
          Harry's house, nor that of the building across the way. It is the
          window of a hospital room (perhaps a sign should specify that the
          following scene occurs "Fourteen years earlier")

          

          
          The hospital is on Lanzarote Island, in the Canary Islands. The scene
          occurs fourteen years earlier. The characters are the same. Harry
          and Judit.
          Harry lies in bed, his head completely bandaged. Sunlight enters
          through the window.
          Judit is seated on the bed. She holds his hand and pleads, worried
          and loving:

          

          

           JUDIT
           Mateo, say something!

           MATEO-HARRY
           Mateo is dead.

           JUDIT
           (Sweet and devastated) Don't say that!

          

          
          The character to whom Judit refers as Mateo, (the same one that in the
          previous scene we have called Harry), has a recent wound, either on
          his arm or on his hands, along with his head, which is completely
          covered by bandages.

          

          
          Mateo and Harry are the same person, the difference is the fourteen
          years that separate them. Harry, in the present (2008), is fifty

           5

          
          years old. In `94, the time period when the flashback takes place, he
          was thirty-six. Let's say that when he was thirty-six, Harry was
          called Mateo. The character has two names, which his own voice-off
          explains, while we observe what his day-to-day consists of in 2008.

          

          

           OFF HARRY
           I always wanted to be another person, to be someone
           beside myself. To dispose of a single identity didn't
           seem enough. Living a single life wasn't enough for
           me. And half-joking, I came up with a pseudonym for
           myself, Harry Caine, an adventurer who, as fate would
           have it, became a writer. At that time, I had him
           author all the scripts and stories that I wrote. I
           came up with a standard biography to fill the back
           flap of his books. He had been a sailor, an
           industrial spy, the doorman at a Parisian cabaret, a
           boxer, a waiter and an advertisement hand-double. A
           self-made man, active and attractive like an English
           spy, vital, skeptical and sarcastic. For many years,
           Mateo Blanco and Harry Caine shared the same person,
           me, but a time came when, all of a sudden, I couldn't
           be anyone other than Harry Caine. I became my
           pseudonym. (He applies lotion in front of the mirror,
           we first see him in front of it, and then, doubled,
           reflected in it. Then, suddenly, the mirror does not
           reflect him. Of his two identities he only has one
           left). Just as I had planned, a heterodox writer and,
           never better stated, a self-made man, one might even
           say, "self-written man". There was only one detail I
           had not foreseen, Harry would be a blind writer.

          3. IMAGES THAT ACCOMPANY THE VOICE -OFF. HARRY CAINE'S DAILY

          RITUALS.

          

          
          Despite his fifty years and his blindness, Harry is a man that keeps
          himself in great physical shape.

          

          
          Harry's Home. Interior. Day.

          

          
          In the morning: he places a CD in a player. By himself, he selects
          and starts the program on a treadmill. He steps on and begins
          exercising.
          He takes a shower ("Mateo Blanco and Harry Caine shared the same
          person, me, but a time came when, all of a sudden..."), the camera
          pans over various parts of his body under the running water, dense
          waves of white foam slide down his skin, as if it was a landscape.
          The hangers have Braille-stickers that indicate the characteristic of
          the clothing they hold. (All the closets have sliding doors)
          In his bedroom, he opens the closet and looks for the clothes he will
          wear. Despite the fact that he cannot see himself, he stands in front
          of a mirror. He smiles, pleased with his appearance .
          Everything in the house is rigorously ordered. All that Harry needs
          to ascertain the identity of the things around him is his touch.
          He exits onto the street.

          

          

          

          

          4. HARRY'S STREET. EXT. DAY. PEDESTRIAN CROSSING.


          

          
          Harry traverses (aided by an umbrella?) the pedestrian crossing. When
          he reaches the opposite sidewalk, the credits appear on the black and
          white stripes that mark the crossing. The crossway is clear of
          pedestrians so that only cars pass through (not many) and as they do,

          

          

           7

          
          they run over the letters of the credits, making them disappear, in
          pieces. On a different stripe, a new title appears and as it does, it
          is run over and destroyed by another car. Like this, successively.

          

          

          

          

          5. SIDEWALK ACROSS FROM HARRY'S BUILDING. EXT. DAY.


          

          
          Just on the sidewalk across from where Harry lives, there is a news-
          stand, and next to it, perhaps on the nearest corner, a bar.
          Harry buys the newspaper at the news-stand. This is part of his daily
          routine. He greets the attendant familiarly. He has the kind of face
          that provokes pity. He grabs the newspaper, folds it, and places it
          under his arm.
          Cut to.

          

          

          

          

          6. BAR ACROSS THE WAY. INT. DAY.


          

          
          He enters the bar. He leans down somewhere on the bar table. Just as
          soon as he sees him, he is approached by his Waiter Friend, an
          approachable guy, somewhere in his forties, who is helped by a South
          American waitress, wearing her makeup since the early part of the
          morning, whom he is obviously screwing. He brings him a coffee. All
          of these actions are part of a daily ritual.

          

          

           WAITER FRIEND
           Do you want me to read you something from the
           newspaper?

           HARRY
           No, thanks. I am off on a stroll.

          

          

          

          

           8

          

          RETURN TO SEC. 5

          

          
          Harry exits the bar and becomes immersed in the different noises of
          the street, the passersby, their different sounds and corporeal odors.
          Auditory life. The camera swirls around his head. At first he hears
          all the noises, indistinctly mixed, and then he begins to separate
          them. He selects one he likes, the rest of the sounds of the street
          disappear or their volume is lowered. Girls, cars, high heels, the
          smells of different ethnicities. A multi-racial street. Harry
          selects an odor (the body of a woman, whose aroma appears and
          disappears), Harry follows it, having also singled out the sound of
          her heels. He loses them. He finds them again.

          

          
          He walks self-assuredly, without tripping either on the urban
          furniture or the people. He leans, lightly, on his umbrella, which he
          uses as a cane. At first glance he doesn't appear blind ...

          

          
          He reaches a pedestrian crossing. Nearby, he recognizes the odor
          which had attracted him, he follows its trace until he reaches the
          sidewalk. The odor emanates from a young Girl, just next to him,
          waiting before the crosswalk. Harry searches with the tip of the
          umbrella, until he brushes her shoe. He excuses himself, as if the
          contact had been inadvertent. The girl regards him. Harry then takes
          one step forward, intent on crossing the street, the cars come very
          close to him, almost running him over. (A real sense of danger). The
          light is red for pedestrians. The Girl takes him by the arm, pulling
          him toward her, frightened.

          

          

           GIRL
           (Alarmed) Watch out! You can't cross!

          

          

           9

          

           HARRY
           Sorry . . .

           GIRL
           I'll tell you when!

           HARRY
           Thank you very much.

          

          

          

          

          7. MATEO-HARRY'S STREET. EXT. DAY. PEDESTRIAN CROSSING.


          

          
          They make it through the crosswalk. She is not holding his arm (but
          almost), Harry doesn't need it. He knows the surroundings well.
          They reach the other sidewalk.
          Harry thanks her for her help, the Girl observes him the entire time,
          intrigued and curious.

          

          

           HARRY
           I live nearby, two blocks up, would you mind coming along
           with me?

          

          
          The Girl accepts, delighted. Tall, thin, attractive, modern, and
          inexpressive like a model, this is what the Girl is like.

          

          

          

          

          8. CONTINUED. BUILDING'S ENTRANCE. EXT. DAY.


          

          
          Once at the entrance, Harry invites her to come up so that she can
          read aloud the newspaper to him. The Girl checks her watch, and ends
          up accepting.

          

          

           GIRL

          

          

           10

          
           But I warn you, I've never read out-loud, you may not
           like it!

           HARRY
           You will only have to browse.

          

          

          

          

          9. LIVING ROOM, MATEO'S HOME. INT. DAY.


          

          
          The same living room we've seen in Sequence 1. There is very little
          light.

          

          

           GIRL
           Do you mind if I turn on the light? So that I can
           read... It's too dark in here.

           HARRY
           Oh, yes... Turn the light on...

          

          
          The Girl turns on a table lamp.
          Cut to.

          

          
          Harry is sitting on a sofa and she is in front of him, on an armchair.
          She opens the newspaper down the middle, before she reads anything she
          directs a brief but intense glance at Harry.
          She reads about the percentage of those in Madrid who abided by the
          blackout that was organized in the name of global change. She turns a
          few pages and stops. Reads as if for herself:

          

          

           GIRL
           Ernesto Martel is dead!

           HARRY
           Who?

          

          

           11

          

           GIRL
           Ernesto Martel. I know one of his granddaughters...

           HARRY
           So he's dead.

           GIRL
           You knew him?

           HARRY
           No...

          

          
          Turns more pages.

          

          

           GIRL
           What are you interested in, politics, economy... culture?

           HARRY
           I am interested in you. What are you like? Do you
           mind describing yourself?

          

          
          The girl begins to describe herself, at first a little tentative.
          (Her measurements? She smiles. She knows them by heart.)
          She describes herself. The color of her eyes. Her hair. Her skin.
          How she's dressed, while she traces over him with her glance (When she
          speaks of her eyes, we see his eyes; when she speaks of her mouth, we
          see his, etc). Her gaze stops at Harry's crotch. Harry can feel her
          watching him. The situation seems perfectly natural.

          

          
          Harry approaches her (he knows she's right in front of him). With his
          hands, he places a brief caress on each of the parts the Girl has just
          described. The eyes, the hair, the mouth. He lowers his hands until
          they fall, spread, on her breasts. It is as though the blind man
          could gaze at her with his fingers and palms. He rests his head on
          the Girl's breast, pulls down her bra straps and he begins to savor

          

          

           12

          
          her breasts, delicately. Harry's cell phone rings, but he ignores it,
          doesn't pick up.

          

          
          Cut to.

          

          

          

          

          10. CONTINUED. HARRY'S HOME. INT. DAY.


          

          
          They make love on the sofa.
          Cut to.

          

          
          The Girl asks for the bathroom, Harry gestures with his hand in its
          direction. Half-naked, with some of her clothes in her hand, the Girl
          heads for the bathroom. Harry, still sitting on the same sofa, begins
          to dress and to smooth down his clothes, without hurry.

          

          

          

          

          11. CONTINUED. HARRY'S HOME. INT. DAY.


          

          
          The doorbell rings. Twice in a row. Immediately following, the key
          is inserted into the keyhole, from the outside.
          Someone is opening it.
          Harry rises. Before he arrives to the foyer, the door is already
          open. In the middle of the doorway, a woman, Judit (the same one who
          had been with him during the blackout of the opening sequence).
          Harry finishes tucking his shirt, barefoot. Judit closes the door
          slowly and surveys him up and down with inquisitive eyes, which he
          cannot see but one could say that he can guess. He smiles.

          

          

           JUDIT
           What are you laughing at?

          

          

           13

          

           HARRY
           I am only smiling, because of the way you're looking
           at me.

          

          
          The sound of a running faucet emerging from the bathroom distracts
          Judit; first the sound, then the immediate appearance of the Girl.
          Both women look at each other and are surprised, despite their attempt
          to hide it. Judit appears more annoyed than surprised. After a very
          brief silence:

          

          

           GIRL
           (To Harry) I must go.

           HARRY
           Thanks for helping me cross.

          

          
          Judit (forty-eight years old, seems younger, is dressed in an informal
          and sober manner, little color, etc., her hair is pulled back, parted
          in the middle, her attitude is that of a guardian), she puts away the
          key to the door while she gazes sternly at the young woman.
          The Girl, very uncomfortable, quickly vanishes.

          

          

          

          

          12. CONTINUED. HARRY'S HOME. INT. DAY.


          

          
          Once alone:

           JUDIT
           (Annoyed and without apologizing, even if it seems
           she's trying) I'm sorry, I thought you were alone.

           HARRY
           She helped me cross the street and I invited her in to
           read me the newspaper . . .

          

          

           14

          

           JUDIT
           Harry, you can't bring into your house the first
           person who helps you across the street. One of these
           days something awful will happen to you!

           HARRY
           (Sullen and ironic) Everything awful that's had to
           happen to me has. Now, all that's left is for me to
           enjoy life . . .

          

          
          Judit changes the topic so that Harry may also change his tone. She
          turns off the table lamp and she opens the window drapes that lead to
          the terrace.

          

          

           JUDIT
           Diego told me yesterday that you finished the script.

           HARRY
           I would like to add a final epilogue. It may not be
           necessary, but I'd like to write it.

           JUDIT
           I agreed to deliver the definitive version to the
           producer and director today.

           HARRY
           You will have it by tomorrow, don't worry.

          

          
          As he speaks, Harry has made his way back to the sofa, without the use
          of a cane, he knows by heart the landscape of the house, which he
          walks through as if he could see. If anything, he touches any given
          piece of furniture with the tip of his fingers, as if to ascertain
          whether it's still there. He walks both with ease, and with the
          characteristic rigidity of blind people.

          

          

          

          

           15

          
          He picks up the socks from the floor and slips them on (the newspaper
          is open on the floor). He puts his shoes on. Judit watches him for a
          moment, and then turns toward the window.

          

          

          

          

          13. JUDIT'S POINT OF VIEW. THE SIDEWALK ACROSS THE WAY. HARRY'S

          STREET. EXT. DAY.


          

          
          She observes how, on the sidewalk across the way, the Girl enters the
          main door of the building just next to the news-stand where Harry buys
          his newspaper. From the window she can make out that it's an
          important Modeling Agency.

          

          

          RETURN TO SEQ. 12

          

          
          Judit is still looking out the window, her back to Harry, when she
          hears him say:

          

          

           HARRY
           Ernesto Martel has died.

          

          
          Judit turns to Harry, surprised but masking it with her voice.

          

          

           JUDIT
           I think he was very ill...

           HARRY
           It's been so long since we've spoken of him!

          

          
          Judit nods plainly with her head. Silence. Ernesto Martel's death
          doesn't bring good memories to either of them.

          

          

          

          

           16

          

          14. HARRY'S HOME. INT. DAY. CONTINUED.


          

          
          The doorbell rings. It's Diego, Judit's son, who doubles as Harry's
          typist and co-scriptwriter. He is a special kid, twenty-five years
          old. Baggy-eyed, a weary aspect, but he overflows with charm.
          Dresses as a modern kid, but not obnoxiously so. He speaks
          delicately, an attitude uncommon for someone his age.
          He greets his mother.

          

          

           JUDIT
           You look awful ...!

           DIEGO
           I ran here.

           HARRY
           And it's Monday! Diego, you don't have to run for me.
           We are not in a hurry.

           JUDIT
           I am, I've committed ...

           HARRY
           You'll have it by tonight, don't worry.

           JUDIT
           Start thinking of the next script. Some kind of
           horror or fantasy story for bratty teenagers. It's
           what sells best ...

           HARRY
           I don't know if I'll know how to. I was thinking of
           developing a story inspired by Arthur Miller's son...

           JUDIT
           (Perplexed) The writer who married Marilyn?

           HARRY

          

          

           17

          
           Yes... After Marilyn he married the photographer Inge
           Morat and they had a son. He was born mentally
           handicapped and Arthur Miller hid him; he doesn't even
           mention him in his memoirs. He never recognized him
           publicly. From the moment he was born, he had him
           placed in an institution and wanted to hear nothing of
           him. Despite his condition, the boy was able to learn
           and to make an almost normal life for himself. He
           lived in an apartment with other friends and he found
           a job as a clerk in a supermarket...

          

          
          Judit looks at him perplexed. For some reason, Harry has his back
          turned. This happens many times.

          

          

           JUDIT
           And Miller never saw him? ...

           HARRY
           (Continues, his back turned) One day, Miller was
           giving a conference in defense of a mentally retarded
           man, who had been condemned to death, after what was
           believed to be a forced confession. Among those
           present was his mentally handicapped son, who was
           integrally involved with organizations that aided all
           sorts of disabled people. The son was very proud to
           finally be sharing something with his father. At the
           end of the conference, he approached the stage and
           held him in an embrace that must have seemed endless
           to Arthur Miller, who did not know how to extract
           himself from this mentally handicapped man; imagine,
           it would not have been politically correct, least of
           all given the situation in which Miller found himself.
           Then the stranger let go of him and told him: "I am

           18

          
           your son, Daniel, and I am very proud of you, Father!"
           This was the only time father and son saw each other.

          

          
          Judith listens, affected and disoriented. She looks at her son as if
          she were looking for help. Diego stops thumbing through a magazine in
          order to listen to Harry and to witness his mother's reaction. She
          wasn't ready for Harry to counter with such a shocking narrative.

          

          

           JUDIT
           (Somewhat tense) It's very moving, but I don't think
           we can write a script about Arthur Miller without
           procuring rights from the family.

           HARRY
           We change the names, the story is not about the
           writer's miserliness, but about the strength of the
           son who survives without the least bit of rancor
           toward the father who has ignored him his entire life.
           It is a story of troubles overcome and of inherent
           goodness. There aren't those many good men that one
           can write about.

          

          
          Judit would like to say that when she spoke of a commercial script
          this is not what she had in mind, but she doesn't want to come off
          rude. Diego keeps watching them. Her mother appears oddly cornered,
          until she remembers a past comment of Harry's, that suits her just

          RIGHT:

          

          

           JUDIT
           It's a beautiful story. But years ago, when you began
           writing again and I began selling your scripts, you
           told me you'd never write remakes, sequels, nor
           biopics. Nor stories whose protagonists were film

           19

          
           directors, handicapped or blind. I remember clearly
           because the part of the biopics surprised me.

           (SMILES)

           HARRY
           I can't bear them... (As if he had at that very moment
           remembered) It's true, it's true I said all that, but
           this wouldn't exactly be a biopic...

          

          
          They hear the doorbell ring, two or three times. For Judit, it's the
          best way to escape the conversation.

          

          

           JUDIT
           I'll get it.

          

          
          Diego settles on the armchair, in front of his laptop. On the other
          side of the table sits the computer that is specially programmed for
          Harry. Diego powers his laptop. Harry heads for the work table. And
          he sits in front of Diego.

          

          

           HARRY
           Diego, go to the end of the document.

          

          
          Diego obeys while we hear Judit approaching the door and, before she
          opens it, someone opens it from the other side. We see the document's
          text (a script) scrolling, fleetingly, over Diego's computer screen.

          

          
          At the door, Judit finds Mariacruz, the Latin American maid, who also
          has her own key to the house. She is carrying two shopping bags.
          Judit gives her some directive (about the windows, the curtains, the
          kitchen furniture, the food, the floors, things to be dry cleaned ,
          etc.) and she leaves, saying goodbye to Harry and Diego with a simple
          "Boys, I'm leaving. Goodbye!"

           20

          

          15. NIGHT. BAR WITH MUSIC. INT. BOOTH.


          

          
          Diego chooses a track that functions as background music to the three
          night sequences that follow, although it's not absolutely necessary.
          He works at a modern bar (not very large), as a D.J. He spends most
          of the time inside a small booth, which only a few friends access.
          Alex, his same age, enters.

          

          

           DIEGO
           Did you bring me the session?

          

          
          Alex takes three CDs out of his jacket.

          

          

           ALEX
           It's still warm. Just downloaded from the eMule.

           DIEGO
           Dude. I'll throw it in now. You want something to
           drink?

           ALEX
           Yes. And you, would you like a tip of "crystal"?

           DIEGO
           I pass. I do need to sleep once in a while.

          

          

          

          

          16. HARRY-MATEO HOME. DEN. NIGHT

          

          
          At that moment, Harry is in front the computer (a special computer,
          sonorous, set up for Harry, with Braille signs jutting from the
          keyboard). He attempts to "read" some digital newspaper, its contents

          

          

           21

          
          can be heard spoken by a very unpleasant synthetic voice. His search
          produces annoying and strange sounds. Harry continously makes
          mistakes, but that's the way to do it.
          He manages to get into El Pais, the obituary section. He listens to a
          list. He finally finds the news of Ernesto Martel's death. He listens
          to the headline.

          

          
          The sound of a mobile phone ringing interrupts him.

          

          

          

          

          17. JUDIT'S OFFICE. INT. NIGHT.


          

          
          It's Judit, from her office.
          In front of Judit, on the other side of the table, full of papers, is
          the head of production and someone from the American production. They
          are trying to decide on the budget.
          From the ashtrays full of cigarettes, the bottles of water and the
          cups of coffee, one assumes that they must have been at this task for
          many hours. (One should be able to see the layout of the shooting
          schedule, something visual). The American production can be heard in
          the background.
          (Seq. 16 and 17 run in parallel)
          She greets Harry.

          

          

           JUDIT
           You need anything?

           MATEO
           No, thanks.

           JUDIT
           What are you up to?

          

          

          

          

           22

          
          Harry touches the small MP3, much easier than to listen to the digital
          newspaper. He doesn't want to tell her that he is attempting to
          listen to Ernesto Martel's obituary, so he tells her what he will be
          doing next.

          

          

           HARRY
           I was going to read an Alice Munro story on the MP3.

           JUDIT
           Then I'll leave you. I'll stop by tomorrow, when I
           can. I have to finish the budget for the Americans as
           soon as possible, so that I can decide what to do ...
           (Hangs up) (To the Americans, in English). Ok, we can
           continue tommorow...

          

          
          Once he hangs up his mobile, Harry returns to his computer, this is
          when we actually hear the biographical sketch of the deceased
          financier.
          Fade to black.
          During the fade to black, we continue to hear the biography. In
          voice-off.

          

          

           OFF
           Ernesto Martel has passed away at his residence in the
           countryside, "La Berzosa." Financier, of Chilean
           origin, who achieved great success and notoriety due
           to his involvement in the financing of crucial public
           infrastructures in different Latin American countries.

          himself, alive, attending to a phone call, while we hear the last
          words of his obituary, in off.

          

          

           OFF
           Recently he had been involved in various financial
           scandals. He was implicated for fraud in the infamous
           "case of Bank Banelco". He was married three times,
           and had two children...

          

          
          The interior of Ernesto Martel's office: elegant, ostentatious, and
          decorated without concern for cost. Through the windows one can
          witness a cosmopolitan Madrid, from whose soil skyscrapers begin to
          bud.
          Ernesto Martel, almost sixty, impeccable suit, settles a conversation
          with the Transportation Minister.
          Framed photographs sit on a piece of accessory furniture, one of him
          with his two children, a boy and a girl, who do not resemble one
          another. They have different mothers.
          The walls are decorated by an abstract painting belonging to the
          avant-garde group El Paso.

          

          

           ERNESTO
           ... I just spoke to the Transportation Minister. Things
           are in full swing. Yes, we are doing the Caracas

           metro ... there's a lot of money ... at least five years.
           I am looking for a qualified company and had you in
           mind ... of course, I will serve as intermediary, I have
           been told so by the President himself.

          

          
          Cut to.

          

          

          

          20. ERNESTO MARTEL'S OFFICE BUILDING. ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES.

          INT. DAY. 1990.


          

          
          On the same floor. Fairly close to the boss' office, divided by
          modern and ample cubicles, we find some of the company's employees.
          His secretary, Magdalena (her diminutive is Lena), is speaking on the
          phone with a look of contained alarm. Personal problems.
          In her early thirties, Lena is dressed soberly, almost excessively so
          (as if she were attempting to project a maturity, effectiveness and
          responsibility that she not yet possesses). She is a very beautiful
          woman, on whose countenance the passing of time has begun to leave its
          mark. She has a small mole, slightly raised, next to the seam of the
          lips, and another one on the top edge of the nose. She could do more
          with her physique, modernize it, but this is not what she aims for.
          Her face reminds us of one of the heroines of the American film noir,
          brought up to date. She possesses the turbulent and at once
          translucent beauty of Gene Tierney and the bored disdain of Linda
          Darnell (in "Fallen Angels"). Lena is a splendid fallen angel.
          We can't hear what she says, but judging from her reaction, the
          content of her conversation is dramatic. Her eyes flash with
          indignation and anger.

          

          

          RETURN TO 19.

          

          

          

           25

          
          Ernesto Martel calls Lena, his personal secretary, by way of an
          internal line.

          

          

          RETURN TO 20.

          

          
          Magdalena interrupts her conversation with "I'll call you later", as
          the indicator lights up, announcing another call on the line. She
          pushes on the button corresponding to that phone call and she hears
          her boss' voice summoning her. "Yes, sir", she responds, promptly.
          She gets up from the table. She dries her eyes and nose with a
          Kleenex, grabs a pen and a rectangular writing block and heads to
          Ernesto Martel's office.

          

          

          

          

          21. ERNESTO MARTEL'S OFFICE. INT. DAY. 1990


          

          
          Despite the fact that he's dealing in grand-scale business, there are
          few documents for him to consult on his desk. It gives the sense that
          for the most important part of his job (grand scale speculation),
          Ernesto deals directly. He is the great intermediary without
          intermediaries.

          

          
          Magdalena enters. He invites her to take a seat. She complies
          without altogether controlling her nervousness; professionally
          detached, she attempts to hide the tension that the recent, and
          truncated, telephone conversation has caused her.

          

          

           ERNESTO
           I will dictate a letter for the Minister of Industry...

          

          

          

          

           26

          
          Magdalena opens her writing pad, ready to write, looking serious. Her
          pen drops to the floor. Ernesto M. observes her.

          

          

           ERNESTO
           Are you alright?

           MAGDALENA
           (As she picks it up) Yes, thank you.

          

          
          But it's not true. Lena looks agitated, despite her efforts to hide
          it.

          

          

           ERNESTO
           Why don't you tell me what's wrong? I'm sure I could
           help you.

          

          
          Lena looks at him, serious and hurt:

          

          

           MAGDALENA
           My father is very ill. This afternoon they are
           releasing him and I wanted to ask you if I could leave
           an hour early to go pick him and my mother up.

           ERNESTO
           Of course. What's wrong with him?

           MAGDALENA
           Stomach cancer, metastasized.

           ERNESTO
           I am really sorry.

          

          

          

          

          22. SURROUNDINGS AND ENTRANCE, PUERTA DE HIERRO HOSPITAL. EXT.


          DAY. 1990

          

           27

          
          It's a hot and sunny afternoon at the end of July. Lena arrives
          inside a taxi to the entrance of Puerta de Hierro Hospital. On the
          sidewalk, next to the entryway, her mother awaits, (chubby, tired,
          defenseless and impatient, she's around sixty) next to her, a suitcase
          and a huge plastic bag full of clothes. The mother is a small-town
          woman, dignified and beaten. The shock provoked by the situation has
          liberated her, if only momentarily, from falling into desperation.

          

          
          Through the car's window, Lena can see her mother on the sidewalk, and
          her ailing Father (a man in his sixties, very debilitated and aged),
          sitting on a sofa in the foyer.

          

          
          Lena tells the cab-driver to wait, and runs toward her mother. They
          kiss.

          

          

           LENA
           I can't believe they have thrown you out of the
           hospital, like dogs...

           MOTHER
           (Humiliated, hurt) Yes, honey, yes...

           LENA
           (Indignant) Does Dr. Alvaro de la Torre know this?

          

          
          The mother gestures for them to get away from the door, that way the
          Father cannot see them.

          

          

           MOTHER
           He's been the one...

           LENA
           But how? If he was going to operate him this week,
           and last week, and the other week...

           MOTHER

          

          

           28

          
           I couldn't explain on the phone. (She recounts) Dr.
           De la Torre called us for an appointment. I though it
           would be to tells us that they were finally going to
           operate on your father... but instead he tells us they
           are releasing him. (In disbelief) I asked him what
           he meant and he replied: "quite simple, it's July and
           I am leaving for my vacation" (as her story moves
           forward the mother relives the same states of mind
           that she went through in her conversation with the
           doctor) And I told him, "you are throwing us out onto
           the street?" and he insisted, without the least bit
           of compassion, "I am releasing him so that you can go
           home", but "what can I do with him at home in his
           condition?". "That's your problem" he told me (she
           cries), "do whatever you like, I am leaving on
           vacation". "He is dying!" I begged. "Well, let him
           die in peace, at home", he said to me.

          

          

           LENA
           (Powerless, furious) It cannot be! They can't keep
           him for twenty days, torturing him with tests in
           preparation for an operation and now leave him like
           this, just because the doctor is leaving on vacation!

          

          
          The Mother looks at her without knowing what to say. She takes a
          small handkerchief to her nose.

          

          

           LENA
           Have you protested?...

           MOTHER
           To who? Dr. De la Torre is the head surgeon. There
           is no one over him.

           29

          
          Lena refuses to accept the situation.
          The father appears through the doors of the hospital entrance,
          exhausted. He leans down to catch his breath. With a weak voice,
          almost inaudible, he says to them:

          

          

           FATHER
           Did you forget about me?

          

          
          Lena and the mother approach him, almost jubilant, hiding their sense
          of helplessness and frustration.

          

          

           LENA
           (Her eyes welled up with tears, she gathers her last
           bit of strength) How could you think that Dad!

          

          
          Between the two women they help the father to the taxi that is waiting
          for them nearby. They put him in the car. The man can hardly walk.
          He is very thin, his bones jut out from under his ashen skin. He
          walks crouched over.
          The taxi pulls off.

           FATHER
           You know what Dr. De la Torre told me before he broke
           the news?

          

          
          He falters. He is too exhausted to speak.

          

          

          

          

           30

          

           FATHER
           (To the Mother) You tell her, Paca.

           MOTHER
           He said: I am glad you are not still in the service,
           Emilio.

           LENA
           (Not understanding)Why?

           MOTHER
           "Because if you were still in the service, after what
           I am going to tell you, you'd shoot me..."

          

          
          Lena stares, completely wide-eyed with amazement.

          

          

           LENA
           He really said that?

           FATHER
           Yes... and he was smiling, he thought it was funny...

          

          

          24. PERIPHERAL NEIGHBORHOOD. EXT. DAY. 1990.


          

          
          The taxi parks in front of a humble building, in one of those outlying
          neighborhoods in the periphery of Madrid, a commuter town. Children,
          women, street ambience. It's like a provincial town, transported to a
          huge city that is in the midst of merciless development. At that hour
          there are few people on the street.

          

          
          The passage between this sequence and the next happens through the
          doors of the car and the apartment, respectively.
          The Father exits, aided by Lena and the Mother, when the door to the
          taxi closes it's the door to the apartment that shuts, with all three
          characters inside the entry hall.

          25. LENA'S PARENTS' HOME. INT. DAY. 1990.


          

          
          Lena locks the door from inside. It's a humble and small apartment,
          Magdalena and her mother situate the man on the bed in the master
          bedroom, in the most comfortable way possible.

          

          
          The décor reflects the bad taste of the era, especially of that social
          class, here and there a certain rural detail stands out. Antique
          photographs of the grandparents. Photographs of the Father in his
          policeman uniform, next to the Mother.
          Over the headboard, there is a crucifix on the wall and perhaps a
          thick, wooden rosary. Religious images on the nighstands. Attention
          placed on the bedspread, the curtains, the dresser, the closet and the
          walls. Everything is new, ugly period furniture. The effect
          generated is of a somber kitsch.

          

          
          Lena opens a dresser drawer, on top of it sits the picture of the
          father in his policeman uniform, with the Mother. She finds a Star
          9mm pistol. She grabs it and tries its weight, the mother sees her
          and tells her to leave the weapon in its place. (Perhaps at that very
          moment the mother is injecting the Father with morphine).
          Cut to.
          In the dinning hall, Lena hands her mother money so that she can buy
          food and her father's medications.

          

          

           LENA
           Call me any time, no matter what it is!

          

          

          

          

           32

          
          The light that shines through the windows, covered with curtains of an
          indefinite but slightly brilliant pattern, begins to fade.
          Mother and daughter kiss.

          While Lena was at her parent's apartment, night fell.
          Lena departs lost in her thoughts, she can't shake off her parents'
          situation. She shifts her eyes. She must find a solution, urgently.
          She lights a cigarette. She looks at her wristwatch. She seems to
          have made a decision. She looks out the window. She finds the inter-
          urban landscape desolating.

          The taxi stops in front of the building where Lena lives. She exits
          the taxi and opens the door.

          Lena enters her apartment. A tiny studio, but charming. No sooner
          has she dropped all that she is carrying, than she heads to the phone
          and makes a call. The décor is agreeable. Little money, but well
          spent. A poster of Hitchcock's "Vertigo" dominates one of the walls,
          or a framed photochrom of Kim Novak in the film. There may be another

          

          

          

           33

          
          film reference (Jean Seberg and Romy Schneider). Lena, secretly, is a
          cinephile.

          

          

          

          

          27. MADAME MYLENE'S DEN. 1990. INT. NIGHT.


          27. A. LENA'S HOME. INT. NIGHT.


          

          
          (Alternating between both spaces)
          Madame Mylene is a blonde woman, very dressed up, older (between fifty
          and seventy), has had plastic surgery, and has not renounced her
          womanhood. Despite the quality of her attire, her makeup and her
          jewels, there is something about her appearance that is unequivocally
          sinister and heartless. While she speaks she has a drink and smokes a
          cigar. A man of "professional" appearance keeps her company. It's
          the den of a high-class Madame. The den seems more practical than
          feminine.

          

          

           LENA
           Madame Mylene? Hello, it's Severine.

           MADAME MYLENE
           Severine! It's been so long! I'm so happy to hear from
           you.

           LENA
           I need money.

           MADAME SEVERINE
           How soon?

           LENA
           Now! My weekend's free. I am busy during the week.

           MADAME MYLENE
           I'll see what I can do. May I call tonight if I find
           something?

          

          

           34

          
          Her tone gives it away that she won't have the slightest problem
          "finding something" for Lena.

          

          

           LENA
           Yes. I'll wait for your call.

          

          
          Cut to.

          

          

          

          

          28. LENA'S HOME. INT. NIGHT. 1990.


          

          
          The telephone rings. Lena has her hair down, she has put makeup on
          (in excess). She looks more attractive, but the makeup also gives her
          a harder edge. She covers herself with a robe. She immediately grabs
          the phone. She seems like a different woman, worldly and nocturnal.

          

          

           LENA
           Yes?

           OFF ERNESTO MARTEL
           Severine?

          29. LIVING ROOM, ERNESTO M.'S MANSION. INT. NIGHT.


          

          
          We see Ernesto Martel, speaking on the phone, in one of the living
          rooms of his mansion. He is dressed to go out, a drink in his hand.
          He is alone, his tone is that of a man courting a woman.

           ERNESTO MARTEL
           I am calling on Madame Mylene's behalf.

          

          
          Lena recognizes the voice, there is no doubt it's his. Despite the
          shock she manages to bluff, categorical and quick:

          

          

           LENA
           (Slightly altering her voice) You've made a mistake,
           sir. No Severine lives here.

          

          
          Ernesto Martel doesn't believe her, but he plays along.

          

          

           ERNESTO MARTEL
           I must have dialed wrong. Excuse me.

          

          
          Lena hangs up, confused and irritated.
          Calls again.

          31. MADAME MYLENE'S DEN. INT. NIGHT. 1990


          

          
          Lena dials Madame Mylene's number

          

          

           MADAME
           Hi! Has he already called?

           LENA
           Who?

           MADAME
           The client! You will not complain about my speediness!

           LENA

          

          

           36

          
           (Furious) But... how have you given him my number?!

           MADAME
           I couldn't say no.

           LENA
           Things aren't done like that! Have you gone mad!?

           MADAME
           He knows everything. And I haven't been the one to
           tell him, he found out on his own account, he knows
           about your foray into acting, and that you sometimes
           "acted" for me...

          

          
          Lena listens, furious and impotent.

          

          

           MADAME
           Months ago he made me promise him that if you got back
           in contact with me I would call him. I couldn't say
           no, he is one of my best clients.

           LENA
           You bitch!

           MADAME
           (Unmoved) Look on the bright side. He must really
           like you to go to the lengths he has... Perhaps you've
           found your Sugar Daddy.

          

          
          Lena remains in silence, humiliated, cornered.

          

          

           MADAME
           What have you agreed on? Remember I am part of the
           business.

          

          
          Lena doesn't respond. She hangs up the telephone.

          32. LENA'S HOME. INT. DAY. 1990.


          

          

          IN THE MORNING.

          

          
          Magdalena is sleeping in her bed. The phone wakes her. It's her
          mother, in the middle of a crying fit and panic attack.

          

          

           LENA
           (Wakes up, suddenly, frightened) How is Dad?

           MOTHER
           (Crying) Not well at all, my dear. We've been through
           a hellish night. He has not eaten anything. But he
           won't stop bleeding... and everything is coming up...
           it's as if he has burst inside.

          

          
          The mother speech falters, she is very scared...

          

          

           LENA
           I will be there with an ambulance immediately. Be
           ready to leave!

          

          
          Before she calls an ambulance, Lena calls Ernesto Martel. They greet
          each other. Ernesto does not pretend to be surprised, he comes across
          cordially. He thinks this may be the continuation of their phone call
          from the previous night.

          

          

           LENA
           Mr. Martel? It's Lena.

           ERNESTO
           (Delighted) Good morning, Lena.

          

          

           38

          

           LENA
           I am sorry to bother you...

           ERNESTO
           (Gallantly) You are never a bother.

           LENA
           My father is dying. We must admit him urgently, but I
           don't know where. As I told you, they released him
           from Puerta de Hierro yesterday.

          

          
          Ernesto changes his tone. Now he is an all-powerful man, generous and
          with every recourse at his fingertips.

          

          

           ERNESTO
           Don't worry. We will take him to the Emergency Room
           at a private clinic. (Wanting to confirm) You told
           me that he has stomach cancer...

           LENA
           Yes.

           ERNESTO
           (Thinking) The best digestive surgeon in Europe is at
           the Clinica de la Luz. I will take care of the
           admittance issue. Call an ambulance and tell them to
           pick up your parents. I'll meet you at the Clinica de
           la Luz in an hour...

           LENA
           (Plainly, but grateful) Thank you very much.

          

          
          Even though neither one of them mentions the phone conversation of the
          night before, it is present on both of their minds.

          It arrives to the Emergency ward at the Clinica de la Luz. They carry
          Lena's father in a stretcher, her mother alongside him.

          

          

          

          

          35. CLINICA DE LA LUZ. HALLWAYS. INT. DAY. 1990


          

          
          One of the hospital's hallways.
          The Mother, Lena and Ernesto are waiting together on a row of chairs
          next to a door. Dr. Blasco emerges, an eminent Surgeon Specialist.
          An impenetrable man, he doesn't mince words. Getting information from
          him is like pulling teeth. He is polite, but not accommodating in the
          slightest.

          

          

           ERNESTO
           How's the patient?

           SURGEON
           You have brought him in terrible conditions... Which I
           suppose you know.

          

          
          The mother affirms with a gesture.

          

          

           ERNESTO
           (With good manners, but authoritarian) Will you be
           able to save him?

          

          

           40

          

           SURGEON
           We will do everything possible... at this very moment
           it is impossible to operate...

          

          
          Lena and the Mother look at both men, anxiously.

          

          

           SURGEON
           Perhaps tomorrow. We are providing parenteral
           nutrition... He will need a blood transfusion...
           (Looks at both women) Do you have any relatives who
           can donate?

           LENA
           Well, here... I don't know...

          

          
          The Mother also doesn't know what to say.

          

          

           ERNESTO
           Give him the best blood you've got!

           SURGEON
           I will keep you updated on his condition in the next
           hours... (He says goodbye to them)

           MOTHER
           May I stay?

           SURGEON
           Yes, of course. You can stay in his room as long as
           you wish.

          

          
          The Mother is not accustomed to so many privileges.
          The doctor says goodbye to Ernesto Martel and the women, mechanically.

          

          

          

          

          36. HALLWAYS CLINICA DE LA LUZ. INT. DAY. 1990


           41

          
          When the three are alone the Mother thanks Ernesto Martel for what he
          has done for them. She looks at her daughter, in a knowing way, as if
          she understands (and accepts, what else can she do!) the situation.

          

          

           LENA
           I'll stay here, Mom. You have to rest...

           MOTHER
           (With strength, but beaten) No, you rest... You've
           already done enough... Thank you very much, Mr. Ernesto.
           If my husband survives, it will be thanks to you.

           ERNESTO
           He will survive, ma'am.

           LENA
           Really, you don't want me to stay? Or that I bring you
           something?

           MOTHER
           No, go. You both must have things to do...

          

          
          Lena complies. In effect, there is something urgent she must do: pay
          the price for all those privileges. To pay the cost of her father's
          life.
          Ernesto and Lena walk to the other end of the hallway. Before she
          enters the room, the Mother bids farewell to them with a look that's
          sad, tired, but of fortitude.
          The two figures slowly recede down the hallway, until they disappear
          in a
          Fade to black.

           42

          
          From black.
          The door to Harry's apartment. The doorbell rings. The house is
          completely dark. Harry moves with his characteristic naturalness.
          He is coming from the bathroom, his hair wet and wearing a robe.
          He feels around until he finds the peephole. He opens it and reaches
          his eye toward it, as if he could really see the person on the other
          side. He is not waiting for anyone, so he hopes the visitor will
          think he is watching, even if he can't see a thing.

          

          

           HARRY
           (From inside) Who is it?

          

          
          A voice on the other side of the door responds:

          

          

           RAY X
           I'm Ray X ...

           HARRY
           Ray X? There's no such a name.

           RAY X
           It's a nickname, at one time I took a lot of ecstasy.

           HARRY
           What do you want?

           RAY X
           To write a script with you, so that I can direct it.

           HARRY
           It's your first film?

           RAY X
           I made a documentary (naïve) ... a very good one,
           eighteen years ago, this would be my first fiction
           film.

           HARRY

           43

          
           OK. Call Judit Garcia, my agent, and explain
           everything. If she finds it suitable, she will set up
           a date for us. And now, I'd like to go dry myself, you
           pulled me out of the shower and I am dripping wet.

           RAY X
           (The words escape) You are naked?

           HARRY
           It's none of your business.

          

          
          Ray does not move. Neither does Harry. They both remain still and
          mute on their respective sides of the door, waiting for the other to
          do something. Ray is mortified about having asked the last question.

          

          

           HARRY
           Will you stand there all day?

           RAY X
           You haven't given me Judit Garcia's phone number.

           HARRY
           Find it out. She is a well-known Production Director.

          

          
          This time Ray steps away from the door and walks toward the elevator.
          Cut to.

          

          

          

          

          38. HARRY'S HOME. 2008. INT. DAY


          

          
          At another point in the day.

          

          
          Harry plays music (a CD with songs that Diego has selected for him,
          expressly), he looks after the bonsai, or he waters the plants while

          

          

          

          

           44

          
          he listens to the radio. Harry touches the plants as well as the
          bonsai delicately, with the tip of his fingers.
          The phone rings.

          

          

           OFF JUDIT
           Hi Harry. It's me.

           HARRY
           Tell me.

           OFF JUDIT
           A young director has been in contact with me. His
           name is Ray X and he wants to write a script with you...
           Does this ring a bell?

           HARRY
           Yes... (He is about to tell her he showed up without
           notice, but Judit doesn't give him time to).

           JUDIT
           (Since she is always busy and in a hurry) Well, he
           wants to see you this afternoon, or tomorrow, if you
           can. I have asked him for an advance and he has
           accepted, but I cannot accompany you either today or
           tomorrow...

           HARRY
           I will speak to him... and let you know.

           JUDIT
           Good, I hope you like him, he seems to be loaded.

           HARRY
           Have you seen him?

           JUDIT
           No, just judging from his voice. And from the check I
           am about to ask him for. I will send Diego over so
           that you're not alone.

          

          

           45

          
          Cut to.

          

          

          

          

          39. HARRY-MATEO HOME. DEN. INT. DAY. 2008


          

          
          (The next morning, Harry wears different clothes than in the previous
          sequence and Ray X as well.)

          

          
          The doorbell rings. It's Ray X. Mariacruz opens the door. Harry
          waits for him while seated at his desk, one can hear the noises his
          computer generates.
          Ray X heads toward the den and introduces himself.
          Harry stretches his hand and waits for the other man to find it and
          shake it.

          

          

           RAY X
           Hi, I'm Ray X.

          

          
          They shake hands.

          

          

           HARRY
           Hello Mr. X. Please, have a seat...

           RAY X
           Please, don't address me formally.

          

          
          (Perhaps the kitchen is lit and only the light from the window enters
          the area where the conversation is taking place).
          Ray watches Harry inquisitively. He observes everything, the
          furniture, the wall-hangings and Harry's own body, shamelessly, taking
          advantage of the fact that Harry cannot see him.
          Mateo senses the heat of his visitor's gaze over his body.

          

          

           46

          
          Ray is thirty-five years old and his physique is somewhere between
          freakish and bohemian but expensively dressed, hard to classify, thin,
          with a beard. Only when he speaks he reveals his well-bred origin
          (not excessively, nor parodically, just sufficiently evocative). He
          is excited by the very fact of being there, it seems it is something
          he has been desiring for some time.
          He takes advantage of the fact that Harry cannot see him in order to
          observe him without reserve.
          During the conversation, Harry is not always sitting. At some point
          he moves (to look for cigarettes, perhaps) and remains standing.

          

          

           RAY
           I love your work, I know it from the start.

           HARRY
           Thank you.

           RAY
           I have seen all of Mateo Blanco's films, including the
           last one, "Girls and Suitcases".

           HARRY
           Is that so? You must be the only one.

          

          

          

          

          40. HARRY'S HOME. VESTIBULE AND KITCHEN. INT. DAY. 2008.


          

          
          At this exact moment, Diego enters. Mariacruz opens the door for him.
          Just in time to hear Ray's question.

          

          

           RAY
           What happened to Mateo Blanco?

           HARRY

          

          

           47

          
           Why do you ask?

          

          

          

          

          40 A.

          

          
          Diego goes to the kitchen. Harry has heard him, he knows he's there,
          if he hasn't called him it's because he doesn't need him.

          

          

           RAY
           Because he vanished from public life...

           HARRY
           It would seem that way.

           RAY
           Almost as if he'd died.

           HARRY
           Yes . . . (Ironically) I lost track of him some time ago.

           RAY
           I've always been intrigued by the case of his last film.

           HARRY
           Whose?

           RAY
           Mateo Blanco's. The first five are stupendous. You
           were the screenwriter for all of them, how do you
           explain that the last one was a disaster?

           HARRY
           (Made uncomfortable by the topic) Films turn out well
           or badly. The reason is always a mystery. (Mateo
           switched genres, perhaps he wasn't skilled for
           comedy). But tell me about the story you want to
           write.

          

          

          

          

           48

          
          Ray X measures his words, it's very important to him and he doesn't
          want to do so hastily.

          

          

           RAY
           ... I would like to write a story about a son's revenge,
           one against the memory of his father.

           HARRY
           Why does the son desire revenge?

           RAY
           (Speaking personally) Because the father ruined his
           life, practically nullifying him while he lived. The
           father is a successful financier, violent, homophobic,
           very powerful and unscrupulous. He thinks everyone
           has a price and that's how he behaves with people. I
           don't know if you've had the misfortune of meeting
           someone like this...

          

          
          Harry does not allay his doubt.

          

          

           HARRY
           When you say he is powerful, what kind of power are
           you referring to?

           RAY X
           Economic, with everything that entails. He is a
           broker, of the generation of speculators that made
           quick, high-profit gains in the 80s; he amassed a
           great fortune during the oil crisis. The son is
           sensitive, with complexes and artistic preoccupations,
           and lives under his shadow, trying to please the
           father in everything. Despite being a bit...
           homosexual, the son marries twice, just like the
           father, and, just like him, he separates. He has a

           49

          
           son that hates him just as much as he hates his own
           father. When the father dies, the son is finally able
           to rebuild his life. That is his salvation and his
           revenge.

          

          

           HARRY
           I get it. I am afraid I am not the writer you are
           looking for.

           RAY X
           You are, you don't know how much!

          

          
          Harry registers what he has just heard.

          

          

           RAY X
           I will pay whatever you ask.

           HARRY
           It's too personal.

           RAY X
           Make it yours. I am not aiming for a biopic, rather,
           I think of it as a base from which to develop a
           fiction.

           HARRY
           Thanks, but no. (He rises) And now, if you don't mind...

          

          

          

          

          41. CONTINUED.

          

          
          He calls Diego. The boy responds in that instant, he was in the
          kitchen, waiting for Harry to call him.
          Ray X will not give up, so he writes his telephone number on a piece
          of paper and places it in his hand.

          

          

           50

          

           RAY X
           There you have my phone number, if you change your mind.

          

          
          Harry is still standing, with the piece of paper in his hand. Diego
          observes both men.
          Ray gets up.

          

          

           RAY X
           I am sure we will see each other again.

           HARRY
           In my case, that would be a miracle.

          

          
          Diego accompanies him to the door. And closes it behind him.
          Harry opens his desk's drawer and places the piece of paper with Ray's
          telephone number inside. He rummages through the drawer's interior
          until he finds a key. He grabs it.

          

          

          

          

          42. CONTINUED.

          

          
          Harry and Diego are now alone, in the den. Ruminating over Ray X's
          visit and the story he was proposing Harry.

          

          

           HARRY
           Did you overhear that?

           DIEGO
           Yes... I'm flipping out! Why did he ask you if Mateo
           had died?

           HARRY

          

          

          

          

           51

          
           To provoke me... I don't know... Help me find
           something... (he points toward the drawers at the
           bottom of the bookcase and he hands him the key to
           open one of them) Look inside that drawer.

          

          
          Diego opens the drawer with the key Harry has given him. The drawer
          is full of different groups of photographs and various objects mixed
          in a certain order. There is a black notebook. A box with Mexican
          handicrafts. Some 1980s postcards as well some from other decades,
          some movie postcards, some others of exotic landscapes... Some of the
          groups of photographs are sorted into envelopes, boxes or transparent
          binders. For Diego it's like looking into a treasure chest. It has
          been many years since that drawer has been opened. This was out of
          respect, not from lack of curiosity, Diego would never do so behind
          Harry's back.

          

          

           HARRY
           Look through the pictures of the `94 shoot. Some of
           the photographs must have the date on it.

          

          
          After tossing aside various envelopes, Diego finds a lot of
          photographs of the shooting, dated `94. He takes them out of their
          envelope.
          He shuffles through them, until he pauses at one.

          

          

           DIEGO
           I think this is him...

           HARRY
           Who?

           DIEGO
           The man who just left.

           HARRY

           52

          
           (Rising) Describe the picture to me.

           DIEGO
           It's from the shoot. (He looks at the box from where
           he's taken it). He is carrying a small camera, like a
           Super 8.

           HARRY
           It's a 16mm. Are you sure it's him?

           DIEGO
           He is now thinner and wears a beard, but it's him. He
           is talking to you.

           HARRY
           What am I saying?

           DIEGO
           I don't know. He is handing you something, it looks
           like a pack of cigarettes.

           HARRY
           It's a radio microphone. He is asking me to wear it
           and I am refusing it.

           DIEGO
           Who is he?

           HARRY
           Ernesto Martel's son.

          

          
          Harry is perturbed by the confirmation of his doubts. He would have
          preferred to be mistaken.

          

          

           HARRY
           (Serious and pensive) You can put them away now...

          

          
          Diego returns the different sets of photographs to their place, inside
          the drawer a photo appears of Lena's face, in close-up. It's the same
          woman who appears in sequences 20 through 36.

           53

          
          The drawer closes, darkness engulfs its interior, drowning Lena's
          image, soon reborn in the next sequence.

          

          

          

          

          43. HOME, ERNESTO MARTEL SENIOR. (1992)

          

          
          Out of the darkness, Lena's image emerges, the year is `92: A close-
          up of the woman, looking at herself in the mirror, touching up her
          makeup. She grabs a dress by a famous designer of the time and puts
          it on.

          

          
          A few meters away, in the bedroom, Ernesto buttons up his fly, after
          tucking in his shirt tail. The scene is that of a wealthy couple, who
          get along.
          They are preparing to attend a concert. Ernesto is a big fan of
          classical music.

          

          
          Lena looks rejuvenated and more refined. Her life and her facial skin
          have both improved since the first time we see her in Martel's office.
          The moles have disappeared from her face. Her demeanor is still adult,
          that of a young woman who has experienced life.

          

          
          Ernesto Martel frequently rests his gaze on her, fascinated, it's hard
          for him to believe that "such beauty" belongs to him.

          

          

          

          

          44. CONTINUED.

          

          
          The phone rings. Ernesto Senior picks up the handset. His relaxed
          countenance changes the second he hears the voice on the other end.

          

          

          

          

           54

          
          It's his second wife, whom he divorced years ago. He treats her with
          disregard.

          

          

           ERNESTO S.
           I can't talk now, Rosanna.

           OFF
           It's about your son. I have caught him trying on my
           dresses. And it's not the first time...

           ERNESTO S.
           It's your fault, you made him effeminate to humiliate me!

           OFF
           That's not the problem, the boy is very depressed,
           I've had to take him to a psychiatrist.

           ERNESTO S.
           Don't call him "boy". He is already seventeen.

           OFF
           The doctor has told me he is in need of a father
           figure... I think I am going to send him your way so
           that he can spend some time with you, after all you
           are his father.

           ERNESTO
           If I haven't been a good father in eighteen years, I
           don't think I can learn to be one precisely now.

           OFF
           How can you speak like that! Have you no feelings?

           ERNESTO
           (Looks at Lena, intently) I have them. Very deep
           feelings, they just don't include either of you.

          

          
          While he speaks, Lena consults him about the jewelry she is about to
          put on, she tries on different pairs of earrings for his approval,
          something he gives without pausing his phone conversation.

           55

          
          Lena makes a gesture of reproach. Ernesto should not speak to his ex-
          wife in that tone.

          

          

           OFF
           If anything happens to him, you'll know who's at fault.

           ERNESTO
           Stop blackmailing me, Rosanna. Tell Ernesto that if
           he wants to talk to me he should call me himself.

          

          
          Ernesto Martel Senior hangs up, bewildered.

           (In reprimand) Don't be so harsh with them, Ernesto!

          

          
          He sips from his drink, or he serves himself another one if he has
          already finished the first.

          

          

           ERNESTO
           Blackmailers!

           LENA
           Why don't you invite your son to spend a few days here?

           ERNESTO
           It'd be better if you didn't get involved with them,
           Lena.

          

          
           Ernesto takes a sip from his drink.

          Ernesto Senior casts her a sideways glance.

          

          

           ERNESTO
           I don't know. But the mother has told me he is a bit
           faggot. If I ask him to come I would like for you to
           tell me if that's true... and whether you think there's
           any remedy...

           LENA
           And how would I know?! What an idea!

           ERNESTO
           I am not asking you to fuck him, but you good-looking
           girls can tell these things.

           LENA
           Call him, but you can't count on me for the rest.

          

          
          Ernesto approaches the telephone and dials a number.

          

          

          

          

          46. ERNESTO MARTEL'S MANSION. (2008). INT. NIGHT.


          

          
          Fourteen years later ­ in the same room, decorated differently, (more
          modern, more colorful), although it still retains some noble and
          timeless furniture pieces and the same layout ­ Ernesto Junior (we in
          effect confirm that this is Ray X) speaks on the telephone while
          getting dressed to leave for a party. In that very room, another man
          (young, handsome and ambitious) is getting dressed in front of a piece
          of furniture equipped with a mirror, at the very spot Lena had been

          

          

           57

          
          earlier. (This piece of furniture is not the same one as the one
          fourteen years earlier, this is a more masculine piece, the other one
          was a type of boudoir).

          

          

           OFF EX-WIFE
           I am not reproaching you for our separation but that
           you live with a man... What will your children think!

           ERNESTO JUNIOR
           (On the phone) That their father is a homosexual (he
           gazes at his handsome boyfriend) and that he has very
           good taste. If they love me and you don't set them
           against me, they will accept it.

           OFF EX-WIFE
           You should have told me before we married!

           ERNESTO JUNIOR
           If you hadn't been so exclusively concerned with my
           father's fortune you might have noticed it yourself.

          

          
          The ex-wife grumbles furiously. The beautiful boyfriend continues to
          dress and smiles at Ernesto.
          Another telephone rings.

          

          

           ERNESTO JUNIOR
           I have to go, I have another call.

           Oh, hello, Judit. (In an amiable tone) Did you get the
           money?

           JUDIT
           I don't want it! I just sent it back, Ernesto!

          

          
          She emphasizes his name.

           ERNESTO JUNIOR
           You won't call me Ray? It's my artistic name...

           JUDIT
           Artistic? What are you up to?

           ERNESTO JUNIOR
           Hoping to erase my father's name.

           JUDIT
           And what does that have to do with Harry?

           ERNESTO JUNIOR
           I've been wanting to see him for a long time. And
           it's true that I want to shoot a movie and that I want
           him to write the script. (Looks at the boyfriend) I've
           got the protagonist.

          

          
          The boyfriend catches the allusion.

          

          

           JUDIT
           You are not a director!

           ERNESTO JUNIOR
           You should take a look at my documentary, you'd change
           your mind.

           59

          

           JUDIT
           Ernesto, forget about us!

           ERNESTO JUNIOR
           Don't be afraid of me. I am not my father.

           JUDIT
           Do not come near Harry again. If you ever stop by his
           house again I will report you for harassment.

          

          
          And she hangs up the phone. At that very moment Judit is in her office
          with the American production team. She apologizes and attempts to
          recover her calm before undertaking the subject of the meeting at
          hand.

          

          

          

          

          48. JUDIT'S HOME. JUDIT'S BEDROOM. INT. NIGHT. 2008


          

          
          The house is not very big, but it is large enough for two people.
          It's discretely feminine and very practical. The details indicate
          that an independent woman lives there, as well as a young-man, twenty-
          five years old. There is some detail of the décor (the curtains, for
          example) that is replicated in Harry's home. It is clear that Judit
          has had a hand in setting up the writer's home.

          

          
          Judit is packing her bags, she paces back and forth. She is a bit
          overwhelmed, with multiple thoughts crossing her mind. At times, she
          asks for Diego's help.

          

          

           JUDIT
           I am not at all pleased with having to scout outside
           Madrid, but the Americans pay a bundle and we need
           money.

          

          

           60

          

           DIEGO
           You can leave without concerns. Don't worry about me.

           JUDIT
           I am also worried for Harry. (Sounds more like an
           order than a request) Please, look after him during
           my absence...

           DIEGO
           (Protests) I have things to do, mom. I can't look
           after him all day.

           JUDIT
           It's only two weeks!

           DIEGO
           Harry manages perfectly on his own and right now we
           are not writing anything.

          

          
          Acknowledges the reason for her worry.

          

          

           JUDIT
           I am worried about Ernesto Junior's visit. I would
           like for you to be on guard in case he appears or
           calls and then let me know immediately!

           DIEGO
           Why are you so worried?

          

          
          Judit stops what she's doing, and takes a moment to take a deep
          breath.

          

          

           JUDIT
           He's crazy. I don't trust him.

           DIEGO
           Why?

           JUDIT

           61

          
           (Evasive) It's a long story.

           DIEGO
           (Persistent) Summarize it!

           JUDIT
           Diego, please, this is not the moment.

           DIEGO
           It never is for you!

           JUDIT
           (Exasperated) Hey, if it bothers you so much to look
           after Harry, I'll quit the job and stay in Madrid! Or
           I'll hire someone.

           DIEGO
           It doesn't bother me to look after Harry! But I am
           tired of so much secrecy!

          

          
          (It's a civilized encounter, no screaming. There is tension, but it
          is kept under control by both of them)

          

          

          

          

          49. IN A PUBLIC PARK AND ON THE STREET. EXT. DAY. 2008


          

          
          A public park. Diego and Harry are walking along a straight pathway.
          Kids, dogs, people jogging. It is a tranquil and pleasant place.
          Diego is in front, Harry is behind him, holding on to his elbow, (as
          reference), but it's Harry who is moving faster, pushing Diego from
          his elbow. The boy shows signs of exhaustion, he is wearing black
          sunglasses.

          

          

           DIEGO
           Don't go so fast!

           HARRY

          

          

           62

          
           We are exercising...

           DIEGO
           I'm not. I'm just keeping you company. How can you
           walk so fast?

           HARRY
           I am training and I don't work at night, nor do I drug
           myself.

           DIEGO
           (On guard) What do you mean by that?

           HARRY
           That I take care of myself, with the fanaticism of an
           older, handicapped person.

           DIEGO
           You are no fanatic.

           HARRY
           Yes, I am. All of us who survive a critical physical
           injury are. There is no other way.

          

          
          Cut to.

          

          

          

          

          50. CONTINUED. EXT. DAY.


          

          
          They exit the park. While they wait at a stop sign, a billboard
          catches Diego's attention. Half of the billboard is taken up by the
          motto: DONATE BLOOD. The names of participating ambulatory hospitals
          and their hours appear below.

          

          
          Harry can tell his company is distracted, so he asks him:

          

          

           HARRY

          

          

           63

          
           What are you looking at?

           DIEGO
           A billboard.

           HARRY
           Why so?

           DIEGO
           In huge letters it says "Donate Blood", it includes
           where one has to go.

           HARRY
           You want to donate blood?

           DIEGO
           No, no... I was thinking that "Donate Blood" is a good
           title for a movie...

           HARRY
           Yes. It has a good ring.

           DIEGO
           For a vampire flick.

          

          
          Harry finds it amusing. They walk toward home.

          

          

           HARRY
           It's true.

           DIEGO
           (Ironizing, kidding, improvising) Imagine that behind
           the billboard a whole group of vampires that work in
           ambulatory care are hiding... and they actually keep the
           blood they get from donors for their own consumption,
           of course...

           HARRY
           Your mother would like that story.

          

          
          Cut to.

           64

          

          51. HARRY'S HOME. INT. DAY. 2008


          

          
          Mariacruz, the Latin American maid, is preparing something in the
          kitchen. Meanwhile, Diego and Mateo gather around the table. Diego
          sits in front of his laptop.

          

          
          Both of the characters are improvising, rapidly, and become
          increasingly excited, completing each other's sentences. They are
          having fun, as if playing a game. The sequence becomes a
          demonstration of the process of creating fiction, based on an trivial,
          real anecdote. (They will begin the sequence by opening a document.
          Diego writes the title in caps: DONATE BLOOD.)

          

          

           DIEGO
           The vampires would be like a type of ethnic group,
           completely assimilated into Spanish society, they
           don't stand out. There are vampires who occupy
           important positions, keeping it a secret (like the
           Opus Dei). But even though they live in the shadows,
           they have amassed great social and economic power...

           HARRY
           They control various industries. For example, the one
           responsible for dark sunglasses...

           DIEGO
           (Smiles) And those that provide nightly entertainment:
           bars, discos, after-hours... Since they don't need drugs
           to stay awake, they are the most apt for working at
           night. They don't burn out...

           HARRY

          

          

           65

          
           And for the sunscreen business. The poor things are
           very sensitive to climate change and to the holes in
           the ozone layer. Their sunscreens are some of the
           best on the market.

           DIEGO
           (Laughs) And those which sell best... This is all great...

          

          
          Diego talks and takes notes on his laptop. Harry paces back and
          forth, in front of the table, like a caged animal.

          

          

           HARRY
           Protected by the sunscreen, they can function all day...
           The lotion must be as dense as armour.

           DIEGO
           (More inspired) This is how the story could begin:
           (describes) A gorgeous woman, totally naked, rubbing
           her body with a super-dense lotion, before heading to
           work at an ambulatory hospital. Her body is a velvety
           pale, beautiful...

           HARRY
           (Continues) What a great opening! We also need a love
           story...

           DIEGO
           A hybrid love story, between the female vampire and a
           normal guy.

           HARRY
           Like in "Cat People", a love story between beings of
           different species...

           DIEGO
           She works at one of those labs where blood is donated
           and where they snatch it for themselves. The guy has
           gone to donate his, or to get some tests. They like

           66

          
          each other immediately. After the first needle prick
          into his vein, she gets completely excited. So, they
          start to date. But she doesn't want to turn him into
          a vampire... these aren't proselytizing vampires, they
          are above biting people... unless they truly need it to
          survive...

           HARRY
          But they must like sex, right?

           DIEGO
          Of course. That's one of the problems, the couple
          desire each other desperately. But when it comes to
          fucking, she becomes prudish...

           HARRY
          Why?

           DIEGO
          Because she is afraid of losing control in her
          excitement and taking a bite into his jugular...

           HARRY
          Aha.

           DIEGO
          When they're horny, she lets him do everything, front,
          back, whatever he wants, except ravaging her mouth.

           HARRY
          And her breasts?

           DIEGO
          Also... But that gets into high-risk territory. When
          he sucks on her breasts, she has to cover her mouth
          with a pillow, which she ends up shredding with her
          fangs...

           HARRY
          And when she sucks his dick?

           DIEGO

           67

          
           No, no sucking. She would tear it on the first bite.

           HARRY
           And how does he react? A man may do without kissing,
           but it's very rough not to have your cock sucked.

           DIEGO
           Since he is deeply in love, he accepts the situation
           (or gives up to it). Once they are more comfortable
           with each other, she wears a muzzle, as security for
           both. Because when she's turned on, she has a type of
           dental erection, her face grows into something like
           that of a she-wolf...

          

          
          Diego writes furiously, while cracking up.

          

          

           HARRY
           I like your story very much, Diego.

           DIEGO
           Our story.

           HARRY
           No. This one was your idea, and you'll author it.
           I'll be your sparring partner, for all the times
           you've done the same for me...

          

          
          Harry is welcoming him as a writer. This fact doesn't escape the boy,
          he feels an unexpected pride.

          

          

          

          

          52. MODERN AND MODEST BAR WHERE DIEGO WORKS. NIGHT. INT. 2008


          

          
          At nights, Diego D.J.'s inside a small booth. Two of his friends, or
          just acquaintances of the club scene, one of them we've already seen

          

          

           68

          
          earlier, keep him company. The one we don't know, Friend A, looks
          pretty loaded. He is very "friendly" with the other two.

          

          

           DIEGO
           (Without acrimony) Stop fondling me... damn it!

           ALEX
           It's the GHB. It kicks your ass.

          

          
          Diego takes a sip of Coke and whisky and sets it down somewhere inside
          the booth.

          

          

           ALEX
           Do you want a little bit of "X"? (referring to
           "MDMA", aka Ecstasy)

           DIEGO
           Just a tip. (He licks his finger and sticks its moist
           tip into the bag that Alex offers him, he takes his
           finger to his mouth) Tomorrow I have to work, we are
           writing a vampire script that's going to be the shit!

          

          

          AT THE BAR .

          

          
          The Friend, high on GHB, grabs a glass of Coca-cola from the
          bartender's hands, at the bar. He takes out a small container and
          adds a few drops of liquid ecstasy into the drink.

          

          
          He takes a sip and enters the booth where the other two are. He sets
          the glass down and begins to jump, euphorically.

          

          

           DIEGO
           Stop already, you are going to go through the roof.

          

          

           69

          
          In between songs, (he is changing the tune) Diego grabs Friend A's
          drink. They are both drinking Coca-Cola, Diego's has whisky and Friend
          A's has liquid ecstasy. Distracted by changing tunes, Diego does not
          realize that he has grabbed the drink with GHB. He takes a long sip.
          And he falls flat to the floor.
          The two friends, bewildered and scared, attempt to revive him, but to
          no avail. Perhaps Alex will exclaim:

          

          

           ALEX
           Holy shit, he's taken a drink from your glass! Why in
           the world did you get Coca-cola! Didn't you notice he
           was drinking a jack and coke?

           FRIEND A
           I didn't realize!

           ALEX
           (Very alarmed) He's unconscious!

          

          

          

          

          53. BAR EXTERIOR. NIGHT. 2008 (OPTIONAL)

          

          
          An ambulance arrives.
          They carry Diego out, unconscious, from the bar on a stretcher. Alex
          goes with him, very scared. Before they go into the vehicle, Diego's
          mobile phone rings. Alex takes it from Diego's pocket, he doesn't
          know why he is doing so, it is a hysterical reaction. On the other
          side of the line, he hears Harry's voice.

          

          

           ALEX
           No. I'm a friend. Diego just... he's not well. We
           are taking him into the emergency room...

           HARRY

          

          

           70

          
           Emergency? Can I talk to him?

           ALEX
           No... because...

           HARRY
           What hospital are you taking him to?

          

          
          The friend asks one of the ambulance employees who tells him the
          name of the hospital. Alex repeats it for Harry.

          

          

           ALEX
           Who are you?

           HARRY
           (Improvising) ...His uncle. I am on my way.

          

          

          

          

          54. ENRACE TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM OF A HOSPITAL. EXT. NIGHT. 2008


          

          
          Harry gets out of a taxi. He aids himself with the typical blind
          man's cane. He can't find the entryway. He bumps into something. We
          have not yet seen him this clumsy. Someone helps him enter. The same
          person accompanies him to the reception desk in the waiting-room area.
          He is no longer the blind man who was walking euphorically along his
          street's sidewalk, umbrella in hand.

          

          

           HARRY
           (Anxious) I am here to see Diego Garcia. He's just been
           admitted.

          

          
          The "receptionist" looks through the admittances. Taking into account
          that Harry is blind, she decides to call the Doctor who has attended
          Diego.

          

          

           71

          

          54 A.

          

          
          Shortly thereafter, the Doctor appears. He heads directly for Harry.

          

          

           HARRY
           I am here to see Diego Garcia.

           DOCTOR
           Are you immediate family?

           HARRY
           (Improvises) Yes... I'm his uncle, and his godfather.

           DOCTOR
           Your nephew is at the ICU, he arrived in a coma...

          

          
          Harry reacts to the news.

          

          

           HARRY
           In a coma?

           DOCTOR
           Yes...

           HARRY
           But, what has happened?!

           DOCTOR
           He ingested liquid ecstasy and alcohol... it is a lethal
           combination. His friend informed us it was a mistake...
           (It happens sometimes, kids grab the wrong glass...)

           HARRY
           My God! But Diego is a very healthy boy...

          

          
          The doctor makes a neutral gesture of acknowledgement...

          

          

          

          

           72

          

           DOCTOR
           Barring any complications, he will recover in six to
           twelve hours.

           HARRY
           If that's the case, I'll wait...

           DOCTOR
           Go home, we will call you...

           HARRY
           I'd rather wait.

           DOCTOR
           Are you certain?

           HARRY
           Yes. Guide me to a place where I can sit, please...

          

          
          The Doctor directs him toward an area with sofas.

          

          

           DOCTOR
           Would you mind providing us with his parents' phone
           number?

           HARRY
           He only has a mother and, at the moment, she is
           working outside Madrid... I would prefer to call her
           myself... I don't want to alarm her, unless he is truly
           in a grave condition...

           DOCTOR
           Normally, he should recuperate in a few hours... but,
           in any case, you should have a talk with him, once
           he's better...

           HARRY
           Yes, of course...

          

          

          

          

           73

          
          They arrive at a couch set, ugly and lacking style, Harry collapses on
          one of the armchairs, demolished.
          The Doctor returns to work.
          The girl at the reception desk stares at Harry, who is immobile,
          readied for a long wait.
          A slow fade to black.

          

          

          

          

          55. HARRY'S HOME. HARRY'S BEDROOM. INT. DAWN. 2008


          

          
          From black.
          Harry is still waiting, this time at home, sitting on a wingback chair
          close to the bed where Diego sleeps.
          On the nightstand, there are some medications and a glass of water,
          next to a plastic bottle, an alarm-clock. And perhaps a book.
          Through the window you can see the day beginning to break, Diego
          awakens. At first he doesn't know where he is. In the darkness of
          the room he discovers Harry's figure, sitting on the wingback chair.
          He can't tell if he's awake or asleep, but it soothes him to know he's
          not alone. Diego stares at him, he doesn't say anything. Just
          stares.
          To his surprise, Harry asks him:

          

          

           HARRY
           How are you?

          

          
          Diego makes a listless gesture.

          

          

           DIEGO
           I don't know... dazed. Did you speak with my mother?

           HARRY

          

          

           74

          
           Yes, I told her it was something you ate...

           DIEGO
           And she believed it?

           HARRY
           I don't know. She wanted to hurry back, but I
           convinced her to continue with the location scouting.
           At some point you'll have to call her.

          

          
          Silence. Diego thinks about everything's that's happened.
          After a few seconds:

          

          

           HARRY
           Are you asleep?

           DIEGO
           I'm not sleepy anymore.

           HARRY
           Do you want to talk?

           DIEGO
           No...

           HARRY
           Would you like me to speak?

           DIEGO
           I don't know. If you'd like...

           HARRY
           I say so in order to distract you. When I was young,
           before I got into making movies, I was very good at
           telling stories.

           DIEGO
           (Not sure) Well, then... would you mind telling me why
           my mother is so afraid of Ernesto Junior?

           HARRY
           She's afraid of him?

           75

          

           DIEGO
           Before she left, she made me promise that I would
           remain alert, in case he reappeared...

           HARRY
           She didn't explain why?

           DIEGO
           She never explains anything.

          

          
          Harry remains pensive for a moment, Diego's request has taken him by
          surprise.

          

          

           HARRY
           It's a long story...

           DIEGO
           Judit says the same thing. How did you meet him?

          

          
          It is not easy to talk about. In some way it must be obvious that
          Harry has spent many years (fourteen) avoiding this topic, but he is
          determined to do anything necessary to entertain Diego.
          Diego serves himself some water and prepares to listen.

          

          

           HARRY
           We met him... In an office we had rented in preparation
           for my new film, about fourteen years ago.

          

          

          

          

          56. MATEO'S OFFICE. INT. DAY. 1994


          

          
          The images that correspond to the past are edited more freely than the
          rest of the narrative. Summarized and sped-up by Harry's voice-off,
          mixing media from diverse sources.

          

          

           76

          

           OFF HARRY
           ...After having written five dramas, I had finally
           managed to write a script for a comedy, or that's what
           I thought. I wanted to change genres... to take a risk
           (ironic-destructive) And I swear I accomplished that,
           the part about taking a risk.

          

          
          In 1994, everyone calls Harry "Mateo". He is sitting behind a table
          filled with papers, photographs, books, magazines, an ashtray, pencil
          and pen holders, etc. At its center, a script lies open, with tons of
          notes scribbled on the margins of its pages. He is finishing the
          definitive version of "Girls and Suitcases".

          

          
          The casual messiness of the place produces its own aesthetic. The
          only decorations on the walls, here and there, not following any
          particular symmetrical rule, are postcards of painters, actors or
          landscapes, held in place by tacks. There is also a newspaper page
          that has caught Mateo's attention. Or some astonishing photograph,
          taken from a magazine. The cover of some magazine. Everything without
          framing, tacked directly onto the wall.
          The furniture is pastel, medium-shade green or red, with velvet
          tapestry, worn and outmoded. The pieces don't match, but they look
          good together.

          

          
          Judit enters (also fourteen years younger, but this is less obvious.
          She is a woman unmarked by the march of time.)
          Mateo is focused on the script's pages. Judit is Mateo's right-hand
          man, they are accomplices in everything, both professionally and
          emotionally.

          

          

           JUDIT

           77

          
           A girl has stopped by. She doesn't have an appointment,
           so there is no reason for you to see her...

           MATEO
           (Without much interest) What's she like?

           JUDIT
           Too beautiful to be funny.

           MATEO
           (Smiles) Really?

           JUDIT
           She is Ernesto Martel's lover, the tycoon. She is
           here with his son.

           MATEO
           And she's an actress?

           JUDIT
           (Ironic) Her? If she's been with him for three years,
           she must be. In any case, go out and say hello, to be
           polite. One must get along well with important men.
           You never know.

          

          

          

          

          57. CONTINUED. WAITING AREA. 1994.

          

          
          Mateo exits his office. In the improvised waiting area (it is not a
          proper waiting room but a transient-space turned waiting area by a
          couch left over from the furnishings of some previous film). He finds
          Ernesto Junior (in other words, the character who had introduced
          himself as Ray X fourteen years ago; in his case, the age-difference
          is noticeable, he's just a kid). He is a little heavier, his hair
          longer, he reminds us of the love-struck big-kid that Phyllip Seymour
          Hoffman played in "Boogie Nights".

          

          

          

          

           78

          
          Mateo's gaze rests only for an instant on the young man, even though
          the boy does not take his stupefied eyes away from Mateo throughout
          the entire sequence.

          

          
          Ernesto Junior has accompanied Lena. When he sees her, Mateo freezes,
          at the door to his office.
          Lena's back is turned, or her head is tilted as she reads a magazine.
          Ernesto elbows her, Lena raises her head and discovers Mateo, watching
          her from the door to his office.
          Mateo's heart churns, it's a cinematographic churn, he feels like
          James Stewart in "Vertigo", when he first sees Kim Novak at the
          restaurant, with her famous green dress. Time stops for an instant so
          that Mateo may contemplate this woman's apparition.

          

          
          After this brief hypnotic moment, they introduce themselves,
          forgetting Ernesto's presence, who then, since no one pays attention
          to him, introduces himself.
          Even though she's a bit nervous, one can tell that Lena is a strong
          and decisive woman. Brunette. Mysterious. Made-up in dark tones that
          stand out on her pale skin. Refined. She doesn't have the aspect of a
          comedienne, her presence is too intense, she seems better suited to be
          the heroine of a film noir (as we've said).
          Genres and their iconographies pose no limit on Mateo's capacity to be
          attracted to her, from the first instant.

          

          

           LENA
           I am sorry we showed up like this, but I've heard you
           are running auditions... and I would like for you to
           give me a try out.

          

          
          Mateo observes her intently. She does not resemble any of the
          characters in the script, but he no longer cares about that. At some

           79

          
          point, Judit makes her appearance and gets to contemplate this scene
          herself, displeased.

          

          

           LENA
           I can come whatever day is convenient.

          

          

          

          

           MATEO
           You're already here. Let's read something.

          

          
          It doesn't sound like "let's read something" but more like "let's have
          a drink."
          They disappear through Mateo's office door.
          Fade to black.

          

          

          

          

          58. ERNESTO SENIOR'S MANSION. (IN PUERTA DE HIERRO OR

          SOMETHING LIKE IT). EXT. NIGHT. 1994.


          

          
          From black.
          (Over an establishing shot of the mansion, one hears Harry's voice-off
          as he speaks to Diego)

          

          

           OFF HARRY
           The reading didn't work out. We were both too nervous.
           The first meeting and the reading we did only served
           to make me realize that woman's very presence
           perturbed me.

          

          
          Great mansion, with a huge green parcel of land with various trees,
          bushes, flowers... Two or three dogs are running across the lawn. The

          

          

           80

          
          plot of land must span about 6,000 square meters or more. (The dogs
          approach the camera, as if it were a trespasser).
          Alarm system, etc. The main building has two levels, joined by a grand
          staircase. All decorated by wives with the wish to be decorators,
          aided by hired decorators. Brand-name furniture, two or three
          paintings worth millions. A piano and a certain desolateness. One can
          tell that his previous wives have left along with a part of the
          furnishings.

          

          

          

          

          59. LIVING ROOM ON THE TOP LEVEL. LENA AND ERNESTO SENIOR

          DINE. INT. NIGHT. 1994


          

          
          The Father already knows he is missing information about something
          unexpected that has gone on that morning. They are at dessert.

          

          

           ERNESTO SENIOR
           Where have you been this morning?

           LENA
           Ernesto hasn't told you?

           ERNESTO SENIOR
           I haven't asked him.

           LENA
           (She hates having to account for herself.) I went to
           see a film director.

           ERNESTO S.
           What for!

           LENA
           (Dryly) For an audition.

          

          
          Ernesto looks at her with surprise, he doesn't approve of it.

          

          

           81

          

           ERNESTO S.
           An audition? How so?

           LENA
           (With less determination than she would like, but
           enough to alarm Ernesto Senior) I want to work.

           ERNESTO S.
           Weren't you going to study interior design? Weren't
           you going to redecorate the house? I thought we
           agreed that you would transform what's left of my two
           shipwrecked marriages into something more our own...

           LENA
           Call a decorator... I want to be an actress. I've
           always wanted to.

          

          
          (Brief pause)

          

          

           ERNESTO S.
           You've already attempted it once... and look how you've
           ended up.

          

          
          Lena shoots him a fulminating glance.

          

          

           LENA
           (Affected) That's a cheap shot.

           ERNESTO S.
           (First, he attacks. Then, he is sorry. Lºike any
           violent lover) I am sorry, forgive me.

          

          
          Lena is frustrated and restless. She rises.

          

          

           LENA

           82

          
           Excuse me, I am retiring to my room.

          

          
          Ernesto grabs her and then embraces her. Lena remains still within his
          arms, imprisoned and elusive, the two locked in a strange posture.

          

          

           LENA
           In any case, don't worry. It didn't turn out well. I
           was too nervous.

          Someone calls at the door. "There's a call". It's the voice of one
          of the hired help, behind the door. "it's Mr. Mateo Blanco, and he
          says it's important".

          

          

           LENA
           (Yells) Come in!

          

          
          She breaks free from Ernesto's embrace and runs toward the door where
          the maid is holding the supplementary handset. Avidly, she grabs it
          from her. She listens, excited. She responds only in monosyllables,
          affirmatively. She hangs up the phone. Her eyes glitter with intense
          happiness, a feeling from which Ernesto feels excluded.

          

          

           LENA
           (Enthusiastically) That's the film director. He says
           the reading was not sufficient and he wants to see me
           once more!

          

          
          Lena looks imploringly at Ernesto Senior.

           What are you going to do?

           LENA
           Go see him, no?!

          

          
          Ernesto makes a gesture that betrays his anger and displeasure.

          

          

           LENA
           Please, Ernesto. I need to do something! And I've
           always wanted to be an actress!

           ERNESTO S.
           And what will become of me?

           LENA
           They have not given me the role yet.

           ERNESTO S.
           They will...!

           LENA
           Well, if I were to get it, we would still see each
           other every day, as it has been, in the mornings and
           evenings. Nothing will change, except that during the
           day I would work, just like you.

           ERNESTO S.
           Why don't we get married?

           LENA
           (Taken by surprise) What?

           ERNESTO S.
           I am asking you to marry me...

           LENA
           Don't you think you've married and divorced enough
           times already?

           ERNESTO S.

           84

          
           With you it'd be the first.

           LENA
           We've been living together for three years, aren't we
           fine like this?

           ERNESTO S.
           (Somber) It doesn't seem you are.

           Ernesto Martel offered to produce the movie. Your
           mother didn't want him to. She was waiting for a
           subsidy from the Ministry and an advance sale to
           television, but that would take months and I was
           suddenly in a great hurry to begin shooting.

          Part of the voice-off is edited over these images.
          Lena is in the process of being made-up, coifed and dressed. This,
          under the control of Mateo Blanco, who does not stop speaking,
          offering references, making ironic remarks, etc. All of this is seen
          through the lens of a 16mm camera. (Images of contrasting colors).
          The editing is vertiginous and doesn't at all respect continuity

          

          

           85

          
          rules. The young Ernesto Junior is carrying the camera. We also see
          this scene from the other side of the 16mm frame, from the point of
          view of the main narration, which includes images of Ernesto Junior
          filming with the 16mm camera.

          

          
          On the inside frame of the dressing room mirror, there are photographs
          of a young Shirley MacLaine, Kate Hepburn (young), Judy Holliday,
          Audrey Hepburn, Goldie Hawn (in "Butterflies Are Free" or any other
          film where she wears her hair long with a fringe). Icons of the
          romantic comedy of today and yesteryear.
          Over the voices of the characters that appear on frame, one hears
          Harry's voice-off.

          

          

           OFF HARRY
           I enjoyed making her up, styling her and dressing
           her. Lena could be the Shirley McLaine of "The
           Apartment" and the Audrey Hepburn of "Breakfast at
           Tiffany's", or even Goldie Hawn...

          

          
          Through the 16mm camera we can see the details of Lena's mutating
          image, how it gets constructed. It is true that she reminds us of the
          three actresses that Harry mentions in his voice-off. The members of
          the team assisting her (hair-stylist, makeup artist, costume designer,
          etc. and Lena herself) laugh heartily when they finish setting her up
          with Goldie's blonde long-hair wig with a fringe. And they stare,
          dumbfounded, when she is made-up as Audrey Hepburn in "Breakfast at
          Tiffany's" or "Sabrina". It's a style that fits Lena like a glove.
          They are all fascinated by the change, except Judit, estranged and
          angered by their playfulness.
          (For Judit, Mateo is constructing his ideal woman. She finds all that
          playing around obscene and dangerous).

          

          

           86

          

           OFF HARRY
           Your mother didn't like Lena.

          

          
          Judit watches Lena-Audrey with a fatalistic stare.

          

          

           OFF HARRY
           I, on the other hand, liked her a lot, and she liked
           me.

          

          
          Mateo manifests his enthusiasm over the changes and Lena looks at him
          with excitement. She also feels transformed on the inside and that's
          thanks to Mateo.

          

          

           OFF HARRY
           Ernesto Junior also liked me...

          

          
          Ernesto Junior directs his camera lens toward Harry's face, not hiding
          his admiration.

          

          

           OFF HARRY
           I was hoping to use him for my own ends. His father
           had asked him to make a documentary about the
           shooting...

          Ernesto Senior is watching the make-up test, the hair-styling test,
          etc., part of what we have already seen through the 16mm lens. The
          sound is chaotic, many people are always speaking at once.

          

          

           87

          

           CONTINUED OFF HARRY
           As far as Ernesto Senior was concerned, (we observe
           him watching the projection uncomfortably) I've never
           known a man more obsessed with a woman, except myself.
           He was producing the film out of a desperate attempt
           to not lose Lena. In the middle of this emotional
           quagmire, we began shooting... Your mother was present
           at every instant, her face like a sergeant's.

          64. SHOOTING. THE SET OF "GIRLS AND SUITCASES". INT. EFFECT


          TO BE DETERMINED. 1994

          

          
          Images from "the making of" shot by Ernesto Junior on 16mm, with high
          grain and contrast, mixed with direct images from the establishing
          shot of what is occurring.
          The look of Lena's character is openly inspired by the Audrey Hepburn
          of "Breakfast at Tiffany's", with Sabrina's hair style and loop
          earrings (fringe and ponytail). She has also adopted the style of
          Holy Golithly, her kind heart and that urbane sophistication that
          characterizes modern girls from rural origins. The only difference is
          a more visceral quality, Pina (Lena's character) is exalted and
          Mediterranean, nothing like Hepburn. Her wardrobe is that of a modern
          girl in `94, she is a professional model for cosmetic products. One
          of her advertising photographs is framed and hangs on one of the walls
          of the loft where she lives.

          IN STUDIO-MADE KITCHEN, INSIDE THE COMPLEX "PINA'S LOFT".

          

          
          Pina, Lena's character, is cutting tomatoes for a gazpacho, inside a
          beautiful and shiny kitchen.
          Pina is sad, probably thinking about "all the times she has had
          gazpacho with Ivan, the absent lover". A tear drops from her face onto
          the knife with which she's cutting the tomatoes. (In slow motion, one
          sees the collision of the tear with the knife, in a cut-in). Hers is a
          subtly comic sadness.

          

          
          When she is done grinding up the tomatoes she takes a box of
          sedatives, which she is carrying in her apron's pocket. She throws
          all the pills into the gazpacho. She keeps two or three for herself.
          (She may even say out loud, "These are for me".) With a wooden spoon,
          she mixes the orange liquid, even though it only contains red
          tomatoes.

          

          
          The cut-ins are to be alternated with the "making of" of the cut-ins.
          As well as Mateo's comments over the action, which instruct Lena how
          to react.
          The clap-board marks the end. It's the fifth take. Mateo says
          "Great". Lena almost screams with joy.

          (Maybe on two random chairs from THE LOFT TERRACE, which are piled up
          with objects from the set, given that this is not where they will be
          shooting; the chairs are next to the corral with the chickens and

          rabbits.) Seen through the 16mm camera: In the foreground, the team
          that's preparing the next shot for the next sequence; in the
          background, without being able to hear what they are saying, Mateo
          speaking to Lena. They are both holding a script in their hands.
          Mateo is giving her directions. Everything is very professional, but
          their demeanor radiates understanding, complicity and... a latent
          desire. They are not talking about anything personal.

          

          
          "Now we will do the part where you return home, frustrated, after
          having left Ivan a note on his door. When you bump into Julieta.
          You just open this door, you look at the answering machine from afar.
          The machine has become some kind of monster to you. You are terrified
          of it."
          "A Monster?"
          "Yes... Your sanity depends on it. If the light blinks, it means there
          may have been a call. And if it doesn't blink... you can't do anything
          but wait... and you lost your patience some time ago."

          What Lena and Mateo are saying on the terrace, as captured by the
          "making of" by Ernesto Junior, is being seen and listened to by
          Ernesto Senior, in the screening room that he's had installed in his
          own home. Next to him, a young female lip-reader (A girl of neutral
          aspect, but interesting, dressed as a glamour-less Russian.) is
          translating for Ernesto Senior what Lena and Mateo are saying, as if
          she were dubbing them. (The tone of her voice does not betray anything
          suspicious. Everything sounds strictly professional, a director and an
          actress who speak, in complicity, about their work.) They both appear

          contained, their attraction made more evident by what they hide than
          by what they show.
          Judit is present in all the shots of the setting up, including the
          ones where Mateo and Lena are in the background, as Mateo makes
          suggestions on how to add nuance to Lena's performance. Judit appears
          solemn and always with an annoyed expression. Ernesto Senior feels
          sympathy for this woman.

          The team has just finished shooting a shot with Pina on the terrace,
          leaning over a railing, her back turned, waiting for Ivan. Mateo
          yells "cut". And the Assistant sends the team away, until the next
          day.
          The Production team hands out the order for the next day, as if
          handing out the last edition of a newspaper with breaking news.
          Dispersal.
          The different teams disband and head toward the exit doors.
          Mateo crosses paths with Ernesto Junior.

          

          

           ERNESTO JUNIOR
           Are you going to work on something?

           MATEO
           No. You may go.

           ERNESTO J.
           I don't mind staying.

           MATEO
           It's best if you leave. I am going to try out some wigs.

           ERNESTO J.

          

          

           91

          
           Wigs? I love wigs!

           MATEO
           (Categorically) No! You don't love them! You already
           have many hours shot of wigs. This is more of the
           same.

          

          
          Disappointed, Ernesto Junior says goodbye.

          

          

           ERNESTO J.
           And Lena?

           MATEO
           After she tries on the new wigs, she's asked for a
           massage therapist, she has a spasm...

           ERNESTO J.
           Spasms... I don't have footage of spasms... Couldn't I
           shoot that?

           MATEO
           Ernesto, stop being a pest and leave already! See you
           tomorrow!

          

          
          Mateo speaks to him in a friendly tone, as if there were a warm
          rapport between them. He does so strategically, given that he thinks
          the boy is the plague.
          Ernesto Junior finally understands that there is nothing for him to do
          and disappears.
          And Mateo breathes.

          Mateo accompanies Edurne, (the make-up artist and old flame,
          collaborator and accomplice in other films), to discuss some detail of
          Lena's hairstyle and makeup. They end up at the make-up and hair
          dressing room. Lena's dressing room is just next door. She is there
          with one or two actors who are still hanging around. The rest have
          left. (The reason of the previous scene has been a pretext. They both
          know it)

          

          

           MATEO
           (To Edurne) I am going to speak to Magdalena... Do you
           mind being on the lookout? Don't let anyone interrupt
           us.

          

          
          The hairdresser gestures in accord.

          Lena sees him enter, she glances at him ardently, not surprised to
          have him in her dressing room.

          

          

           LENA
           Is Junior around?

           MATEO
           No. I sent him home. There's only Edurne, on watch...

          

          
          Mateo approaches Lena and, without the slightest preamble, launches
          himself at her mouth, kissing her fervently. The impression is that
          they are about to devour each other. They separate as if to catch
          their breath, looking intensely into each other's eyes.
          They tear each other's clothes off (she's in a robe).

          

          

           93

          

           LENA
           This is madness, Mateo. I am no good for you.

           MATEO
           You should have warned me sooner.

          

          
          There are no overtures. They devour each other, hungry. They make
          love on a small bed, as if they were on the edge of a precipice.
          Desire, contained by both during the past weeks, explodes and levels
          them. Neither one does anything to stop it. (A train passes by at
          high-speed, both images fuse, the lovers and the train across their
          bodies.)
          Fade to black.
          Ellipsis.

          

          

          

          

          70. ERNESTO SENIOR'S HOME. INT. NIGHT. 1994.


          

          
          Lena arrives late from the shooting, tired and satisfied. This is
          supposed to be another day, not the same day of the "scene" in the
          dressing room.
          Ernesto Senior awaits for her in the living room, in front of a muted
          television, with a drink in hand. (Perhaps the train will still be
          present, on the television screen.)
          Lena approaches him and kisses him.

          

          

           ERNESTO S.
           (Ironic) I didn't know one worked so hard in the movies.

           LENA
           (Smiles) Well, yes, especially if you're a girl.

           ERNESTO S.

          

          

           94

          
           Why if you're a girl?

          

          
          Lena sits and takes a sip from his drink.

          

          

           LENA
           Because you must put on makeup (and then remove it),
           dress up, do your hair. Get dressed again, do your
           hair again. And that takes hours.

           ERNESTO S.
           And you're not tired?

           LENA
           At the end of the week, sure, but I'm happy...

           ERNESTO S.
           I was thinking we should take a break, a weekend.
           Just the two of us, alone. At the house in Ibiza, or
           in Paris... wherever you want... you and I.

           LENA
           I can't travel until the shoot is over...

           ERNESTO S.
           I am talking about just a weekend.

           LENA
           We rehearse on weekends.

           ERNESTO S.
           Don't you also rehearse during the shooting?

           LENA
           Yes.

           ERNESTO S.
           What's going on, you spend all day rehearsing!

           LENA
           (Without losing her cool) That's how one makes a
           movie! (thinking, "you moron!", but she doesn't say
           it).

           95

          

           ERNESTO S.
           And everyone else's life? It can't be set aside for
           months!

           LENA
           The movie is boss.

           ERNESTO S.
           Excuse me, I'm the producer, so I'm the boss.

          

          
          Cut to.

          

          

          

          

          71. ON A SET IN MID-CONSTRUCTION, WITH CARPENTERS, PAINTERS,

          ETC. INT. DAY. 1994


          

          
          Mateo argues with the set designer over one of the sets.
          Distractedly, Judit waters the plants, real ones, of Pina's fake
          terrace, some of them somewhat shriveled from being away from the sun
          for so long.
          Mateo is going to go complain to her about the set, but he notices
          that she is so worried and tired that he doesn't say anything.

          

          

           MATEO
           You look awful...

           JUDIT
           Little Diego... he could hardly breathe all night...
           neither of us has slept a wink.

           MATEO
           (Worried) You still don't know what it is?

           JUDIT

          

          

          

          

           96

          
           Some doctors say it's asthma, others that it's
           allergies, but we don't know to what... They are still
           running tests, but it's driving me to the brink...

           MATEO
           Take all the time you need... Even if we're shooting,
           your son is more important.

           JUDIT
           Thanks. (Changing subjects) One more thing, I've
           talked to the producer.

           MATEO
           And?

           JUDIT
           He complains that the shooting is monopolizing Lena.

           MATEO
           (Exasperated and condescending) And how does he think
           one makes movies?

           JUDIT
           Ernesto is a businessman, not an artist.

           MATEO
           Then he shouldn't have signed up as a producer, no one
           asked him...

           JUDIT
           I warned you! Ernesto Martel doesn't give a crap
           about this movie and those of us making it, except for
           one person! This weekend he is taking her to Ibiza
           with him, so you won't be able to rehearse.

          

          
          Mateo looks at her as if she had just slapped him. Mumbles:

          

          

           MATEO
           Son of a bitch!

          

          

           97

          

          72. LUXURIOUS IBIZAN HOUSE. EXT AND INT. DAY. 1994


          

          
          Lena and Ernesto spend the weekend together, at an Ibizan house
          minutely decorated with ethnic details. The decoration, super-
          luxurious hippie, does not ring untrue to the Island's aesthetic.
          Consider that Ernesto Senior and Lena are in the bedroom, on the bed,
          making love luxuriously. There's no hurry, they pay careful attention
          to all the details.
          After the final sprint, they both come, satisfied. Or so it seems.
          Ernesto remains spent on the bed, motionless. Lena gets up and goes
          to the bathroom.
          She opens the faucet and lets the water run.
          Immediately, she is overtaken by vicious retching. On her knees, she
          vomits into the toilet.
          After she's done vomiting she gets up and looks at herself in the
          mirror. She wipes off her mouth and closes the faucet. She looks
          very pale, the exertion from the vomiting is written on her face.
          Quickly, she puts some makeup on. Enough to bring some color back to
          her cheeks and to get rid of the bags under her eyes. Her eyes still
          glimmer from the tears she's shed. More than in any other sequence,
          it is here that Lena reveals her talent as an actress.
          She exits the bathroom, wrapped in an elegant robe, a bit divine-
          hippie.

          

          

          

          

          73. BEDROOM IBIZAN HOUSE. INT. DAY. 1994


          

          
          Ernesto Senior is still lying in bed, recuperating.
          He gazes at her, love-struck.

          

          

          

          

           98

          

           ERNESTO S.
           Have you put on makeup?

           LENA
           (Animated, without exaggeration. A well-faked
           serenity) I want you to find me pretty.

           ERNESTO S.
           To me, you always are! It's impossible that you
           wouldn't be pretty.

          

          
          Lena sits on the bed, her back to Ernesto. He wraps his arm around
          her waist while she makes some typical girl-gesture: looks at her
          nails thinking of how she'll fix them, looks into her pocket mirror
          and ponders the color of her hair, grabs a magazine on the nightstand
          and thumbs through it, calls her mother to see how she's doing... Or,
          simplest of all, takes a cigarette out of its box, looks for the
          lighter, finds it and lights it. Everything is done sluggishly, she's
          trying to take up as much time as possible.

          

          

           LENA
           Would you like a cigarette?

           ERNESTO S.
           No... thanks.

           LENA
           Do you know how many fucks we've had since we arrived
           yesterday?

           ERNESTO S.
           (Smiles, like a champ) Six?

           LENA
           (Also smiles) Ten.

           ERNESTO S.
           With honours, yes?

          

          

           99

          
          Lena forces a smile, with her back to Ernesto.

          

          

           LENA
           Yes, I suppose so.

          

          
          Ernesto Senior embraces her from behind and brings her toward him. He
          mumbles, affectionately:

          

          

           ERNESTO S.
           We have to take advantage of our time. We only have
           one more day left.

          

          

          

          

          74. ENTRANCE HALL, PINA'S LOFT. INT. DAY. 1994


          

          

          SHOOT. THE FOLLOWING MONDAY.

          

          
          Only the indispensable members of the team and the actors are
          clustered around the entrance hall and the elevator:
          A scene is being shot where Pina exits the elevator and walks through
          the entrance hall, in a hurry, toward the street. She bumps into
          Chus, the porter, who is holding two metal objects (A Robert Indiana
          "LOVE", impressive and metallic, and a Gucci alarm clock in the shape
          of a G, the G is also metallic.)
          Chus stops her, almost by force. She is a very "communicative" woman
          and Pina attempts to get her off her back, as quickly as possible,
          without being rude to her.
          Chus shows her both objects, with a questioning look on her face.

          

          

           CHUS

          

          

          

          

           100

          
           Look at what I've found on the sidewalk, they fell
           from your terrace.

           PINA
           They are gifts from Mr. Ivan and I tossed them out.
           He told me to keep them, but I don't want them!

           CHUS
           But you can't do that, Ms. Pina. You could have
           killed somebody... You can't just throw things off the
           terrace, much less if they are metal...

           PINA
           In Naples, on New Year's Eve, they even throw out
           furniture, my grandfather was Neapolitan... I carry it
           in my blood.

           CHUS
           But this is not Naples, nor is today New Year's Eve...

           PINA
           I was anxious and throwing things relaxes me... Keep
           them if you like.

           CHUS
           Thanks so much, Ms. Pina. But that's not right...

          

          
          Pina exits the entrance hall, leaving the porter mid-sentence, while
          the porter repeats, still, two more times.

          

          

           CHUS
           It's not alright, Ms. Pina.

          

          
          The scene is very simple, but it must exude charm. Chus is a natural
          comic talent and Pina's character must act with a flippancy that plays
          comically. At the same time, Lena is noticeably exhausted, both
          physically and emotionally. Instead of lending the text lightness, she
          brings it down. And she's aware of it.

           101

          
          For the first time, Mateo does not hide his annoyance as a director
          because the scene turns out badly, and as a lover because he is
          jealous of her weekend with Ernesto Senior. Lena cannot stand to look
          at him, she can't bare his angered expression.
          Mateo takes her aside to a secluded corner of the set and away from
          the team.

          

          

           MATEO
           (Serious) Your tone is off, Magdalena.

           LENA
           (Very depressed) I know.

           MATEO
           (In a very low voice) What's wrong?

           LENA
           (Whispers, on the brink of tears) I'll tell you later.

          

          
          Mateo gestures for the Assistant to come over. Lena still has her
          back toward the team. Mateo says something to the Assistant, who then
          says out loud for all to hear:

          

          

           ASSISTANT
           We break for thirty minutes, it's snack time!

          

          
          Mateo meets with Lena in the darkest corner of the entrance hall.

          

          

          

          

          75. ERNESTO SENIOR'S HOME. SCREENING ROOM. INT. 1994


          

          
          Ernesto Senior must be intercut, watching in his screening room all
          that occurs at the shoot. Next to him, the lip-reader.

          

          

           102

          

          76. CONTINUED. ENTRANCE HALL.

          

          
          The members of the team slowly depart from the entrance hall. They
          take the opportunity to grab a bite or get some air, they gather close
          to the trucks or next to the catering. All except Ernesto Junior who
          remains inside and hides furtively behind a styrofoam panel, somewhat
          removed from the couple, who cannot see him.
          Mateo looks all around to ensure that they are alone.

          

          

           MATEO
           (With urgency) What's happened?

           LENA
           I've had a horrible weekend...

           MATEO
           But... we haven't rehearsed, so that you could rest!

           LENA
           Rest? I haven't slept a wink all weekend... (Sighs, on
           the brink of tears) It's been a nightmare!

          

          
          Mateo once again ascertains that there is no one in the entrance hall.
          He hands her a Kleenex so that she may wipe her tears.

          

          

           LENA
           I have literally had Ernesto on top of me, all those
           forty-eight hours, like a leech! (repulsed
           expression) He has not given me a second to breathe,
           the asshole!

          

          

          

          

           103

          
          Mateo grabs her by the arm and takes her up the stairs to an apartment
          that the production company has rented in the same building.

          

          

          

          

          77. ERNESTO SENIOR'S SCREENING ROOM. INT. 1994


          

          
          Ernesto Senior hears the entire conversation from the lips of the lip-
          reader. A stony expression on his face. The "reader" repeats the
          dialogues in an unexpressive tone, which makes them sound even more
          dramatic and painful.
          Cut to.
          Fade to black.

          

          

          

          

          78. ON THE SET OF PINA'S LOFT. FLASHBACK. INT. 1994


          

          

          A DIFFERENT DAY.

          

          
          Returning from black.
          Various shots of Pina's loft. Everything seems chaotic, typical of
          the end of the work day. The furniture is out of place, silverware
          and plastic is all mixed together with electrical material and stage
          equipment. The warehouse lights begin to shut off.
          The team disbands.

          

          
          On her way to the dressing room, Lena tells Ernesto Junior that she is
          headed to her yoga class, as she does every day. And that she wants
          to go alone.

          

          

           ERNESTO JUNIOR

          

          

          

          

           104

          
           My father asks me why it is that I don't go with you
           to yoga, he asks me all the time.

           LENA
           Well, you tell him that I am a grown-up now, and free,
           and that I've forbidden you to follow me.

           ERNESTO JUNIOR
           You know I can't tell him that.

           LENA
           Try it. It would do you good.

           ERNESTO JUNIOR
           I can't.

           LENA
           Do as you wish, but you're not coming with me.

          

          
          And she leaves him behind. Ernesto Junior watches her walk away,
          disoriented. He always has a tripod attached to his camera, as in
          "Peeping Tom".

          

          

          

          

          79. STREET, MATEO'S HOME. EXT. NIGHT.1994.


          

          
          It's the fist time we see this setting: the entrance of the building
          where Mateo lives. Almost all the windows are darkened. It's
          midnight. We watch this sequence through the 16mm camera, situated
          just in front of the building's doorway.
          We watch as Mateo appears on the sidewalk, walking toward the
          building's doorway.
          In front of the building, in the main narrative, we see Ernesto Junior
          filming with his 16mm camera. He is hiding behind a bush, or cloaked
          by a tree's shade. Either way, Mateo does not discover him.

          80. ERNESTO MARTEL'S MANSION. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT. 1994.

          

          

          LOWER LEVEL
          At the same time that the former is taking place, Lena arrives to
          Martel's mansion. She finds Ernesto Senior with a drink in his hand,
          in one of the living areas (or playing the piano), she approaches him
          and gives him a slight kiss on the lips, in a gesture of hello.

          

          

           ERNESTO SENIOR
           (Quotidian and tranquil, an unexpected demeanor for a
           character of his temperament) How are you?

           LENA
           Good, tired.

           ERNESTO SENIOR
           And relaxed.

           LENA
           (On guard) Yes...

           ERNESTO SENIOR
           The yoga is doing you good, isn't it?

          

          
          Lena catches Ernesto's allusion, but she pretends she hasn't. She
          demonstrates her control over herself and her cold determination.

          

          

           LENA
           Yes, especially after work...

           ERNESTO SENIOR
           I am going to snack on something. Will you join me?

           LENA
           I am not hungry, I'd rather go to bed right now. I'll
           only have a yogurt.

          

          

           106

          
          Lena climbs up the long staircase, heads directly for her room.
          Ernesto listens to her steps as they recede. His ironic tranquility
          disappears and gives way to a furious expression.
          Fade to black.

          

          

          

          

          81. FRONT ENTRANCE, MATEO'S HOME. EXT. NIGHT. 1994.


          

          
          From black. (A different day.)

          

          
          Framed by the window to Mateo's living room seen from the street, one
          observes the bottom halves of Mateo's and Lena's bodies, as they move
          around the apartment. Only half of their body is visible because the
          roman shades are halfway drawn. (One gets the impression that Mateo
          is showing her around the house).
          They say goodbye.
          We see all this through a 16mm camera. Without a pause in the
          shooting we realize that the person carrying the camera crosses the
          street and waits outside of the front door to Mateo's building.

          

          

          

          

          82. FRONT DOOR TO MATEO'S BUILDING. NIGHT. EXT. 1994


          

          
          Lena exits through the door. The second she discovers the camera, she
          confronts it.

          

          

           LENA
           Ernesto, what are you doing here?

           ERNESTO JUNIOR
           Working.

          

          

           107

          

           LENA
           Turn that off, you idiot! Hasn't Mateo forbidden you
           to tape us outside the shooting?

          

          
          Not far from them there is a garbage truck that is making horrendous
          noises and makes it difficult to hear what they are saying. The truck
          gets closer and the noises louder so that Ernesto Junior and Lena must
          scream back and forth at each other.

          

          

           ERNESTO JUNIOR
           My father has told me not to listen to him... he wants
           to see everything.

           LENA
           You both have no scruples!

           ERNESTO JUNIOR
           Remember I am taping you.

          

          
          Lena throws herself at Ernesto Junior and attempts to take the camera
          from him. They struggle (the camera continues shooting, the images
          move around, dizzyingly). Ernesto Junior manages to break free from
          Lena. They are both out of breath. Ernesto backs up a few steps in
          order to frame Lena again and so that he can focus her image. Lena
          could take off running, but instead she stays right where she is; she
          lets Ernesto bring her into focus and frame her correctly, while she
          fixes her hair. She looks straight at the camera:

          

          

           LENA
           (In a barrage) Listen carefully, Ernesto. Yes, I am
           talking to you. (She points toward Mateo's house) I
           was just with the man I love and I am the happiest
           I've been all my life because he loves me too!
           (screams) And listen carefully, Ernesto! I will let

           108

          
           you be very soon! There is no need to spy on me.
           There is nothing left to hide!

          

          

          

          

          83. PRIVATE SCREENING ROOM, ERNESTO SENIOR'S MANSION. INT. DAY.


          1994

          

          
          (We see this at the same moment it's happening.)
          The next day, Ernesto Senior is watching the previous night's scene on
          the screen of his private projection room. We discover this when he
          is halfway into it; the images pick the action up at the point when
          Lena exits Mateo's house and confronts the camera, right after she has
          attempted to grab the camera away from Ernesto Junior.
          The shots in 16mm alternate with the shots in 35mm that belong to the
          main narrative. The sound is uproarious, we can hear what they say in
          a low volume, just as reference. Ernesto asks for the sound to be
          muted so that the "translator" can do her job.
          The "lip reader" tries, as usual, to be "neutral and inexpressive",
          but on this occasion she cannot help but have the violence of the
          scene affect her. She acts as a mere vehicle, not part of the
          conflict; nonetheless, she gets a little nervous. She is seated next
          to the volcano: Ernesto Senior, stony, frozen, silent, and about to
          explode.

          

          

          

          

          84. CONTINUED. SAME LOCATION.

          

          
          Just a little earlier, right before the dizzying images appear on
          screen, those caused by Lena's attempt to remove the camera from
          Ernesto Junior's hands:

          

          

          

          

           109

          
          On the opposite end of where the screen is, behind the back of both
          Ernesto and the translator, a door opens. Lena appears.
          She watches the scene that is unfolding on screen as she lets her
          voice rise to her mouth. (The entire dialogue in which she has
          addressed Ernesto Senior directly is seen during the action taking
          place in the projection room, not on the street.) At first, her voice
          overlaps with that of the translator, who becomes instantly silent and
          turns her head toward the door where Lena is standing. Lena is
          dubbing herself.

          

          

           LENA
           I was just with the man I love and I am the happiest
           that I've been all my life because he loves me too!
           And listen carefully, Ernesto! I will let you be very
           soon! There is no need to spy on me. I don't have
           anything left to hide!

          

          
          The translator watches Lena and Ernesto Senior, who is still
          motionless, watching the screen.
          On screen, we see Lena walking, her back turned, for a good stretch.
          With an equal obsession, she is followed down the street by the son
          and in the screening room by the father.

          

          

          

          

          85. LENA'S BEDROOM, ERNESTO'S MANSION. DUSK FALLING. 1994

          

          
          An avalanche of snow, on the television screen.
          (Some short shots of both ice and whisky as they fall into a tall
          glass function as an ellipsis between one scene and the next).

          

          

          

          

           110

          
          Lena paces around anxiously in her bedroom. She attempts to focus on
          a fashion magazine, but is unsuccessful. She takes a deep breath,
          makes a decision. She opens the closet and takes out a small, weekend
          suitcase. She fills it with her most indispensable clothes.

          

          
          She exits her bedroom, on the top floor. In the hallway, only a few
          meters separate the door to her bedroom from the stairway. There is a
          small landing just before the top of the stairs, it has a small table
          against the wall, a beautiful vase with flowers, a mirror and two
          small sofas on either side of the small table. Ernesto is seated on
          one of them, holding a glass of whisky in his right hand. It cannot
          be the first he's had. One could say he's been waiting some time now
          for Lena's exit, a bottle and an icebox keeping him company. Lena
          walks a few steps. Se approaches Ernesto, but keeps her distance.
          She speaks to him in passing.

          

          

           LENA
           (Suitcase in hand) I am leaving, Ernesto. I am leaving
           you.

           ERNESTO SENIOR
           (Cold, drunk, contemptuous) You are not going anywhere.

           LENA
           And how will you stop me?

          

          
          (Every single one of the words in this dialogue sounds laded and slow)
          No sooner has she said it than Lena realizes that it has been an
          unnecessary provocation. But it's too late to take back what's been
          said. Ernesto Senior shoots her a deathly look. But then gets up and
          changes his expression to calm her.

          

          

           ERNESTO S.
           (Pleading) Lena, please.

           111

          
          One more time, Ernesto begs forgiveness, but Lena doesn't want to see
          him or hear him. She turns and begins to descend the stairs. The
          first step.

          

          
          Ernesto approaches her slowly, from behind. He is still pleading, as
          in a litany: "Lena, please". "Lena..."

          

          

          86. CONTINUED. ON THE STAIRWAY.

          

          
          But Lena keeps her back to his supplication, descends one more step,
          her second one. Suddenly, without any change in his expression,
          Ernesto pushes her with a quick and unexpected movement of his arm.
          Lena loses her balance and falls, rolling, bouncing violently against
          the edges of the steps until her whole body hits the floor at the foot
          of the stairs. During the time the fall takes, Ernesto doesn't move,
          he watches her fall, bump by bump. He waits until she's on the floor
          and she casts him a fulminating glance, before he reacts.

          

          

          

          

          87. CONTINUED.

          

          
          Lena lands on the floor, broken and stunned by the blows.
          She lifts her head and attempts to move, but can't. Ernesto descends
          quickly and comes to her side. He begs, calmly, without violence, for
          her not to move. Lena cannot stand, her battered body only allows her
          to drag herself toward the door, like a reptile.
          Ernesto takes her, delicately, in his arms. Lena gazes at him in
          horror.

          

          

          

          

           112

          

          88. PUERTA DE HIERRO MANSION. LAWN. EXT. NIGHT. 1994


          

          
          He exits into the night, onto a green lawn, with the woman in his
          arms, they look like two newlyweds. The dogs, disconcerted, follow
          them in procession, they intuit that something is not right.

          

          
          Once inside the car (none of the hired help is there that night), he
          opens the gate from the inside and exits onto the highway.

          

          

          

          

          89. HIGHWAY. EXT. NIGHT. 1994.


          

          
          Lena is lying on the back seat, pale and in pain, but she's not
          complaining. Ernesto is driving faster than 180 Km/hr. He alerts a
          pair of patrolmen. When he realizes he's being followed, he increases
          his speed. The patrolmen signal with their lights for him to stop on
          the curb, but Ernesto Martel ignores their signal until the police car
          catches up to him and forces him to stop.

          

          

          

          

          90. A DIFFERENT SEGMENT OF THE HIGHWAY. EXT. NIGHT. 1994


          

          
          The two patrolmen get out of their vehicle and head, enraged, toward
          Ernesto. They gesture for him to lower his window.
          Ernesto lowers the window, relaxed, despite the situation. The two
          patrolmen, especially the one who calls the shots, recriminate him,
          their voices raised, for all the infractions he has just committed.
          They are very agitated and they quickly notice the high level of
          alcohol emitted by the driver's breath.
          Knocked out on the back seat, Lena observes the whole scene. Her face
          is contorted with pain and anxiety.

          

          

           113

          
          (A river of cars continues to pass nearby.)
          Using a nasty tone, one of the policemen asks Ernesto for his
          documents.
          The following conversation takes place while the policemen verify the
          vehicle's documents. Ernesto explains to them with a common sense
          that's disarming:

          

          

           ERNESTO SENIOR
           We have to get to the hospital. My wife is badly hurt...

          

          
          Lena moans in affirmation. The Policeman takes a look inside the car,
          in order to ascertain that she is indeed not faking it...

          

          

           POLICEMAN
           What's happened?

           ERNESTO
           I was in the living room and, since we weren't
           planning to go out, I started drinking early. I am
           pretty drunk, as you may notice. Suddenly, I heard a
           thump, I ran to the stairs and there she was. She
           tripped and fell down the stairs...

           POLICEMAN
           Is this true, Madam?

           LENA
           Yes... Can't you leave the paperwork for later?

           POLICEMAN
           Your husband can't drive in this condition!

           ERNESTO SENIOR
           What do you mean?

          

          
          Ernesto attempts to start the car, but the other policeman stops him.

          

          

           114

          

           POLICEMAN
           You're crazy!

          

          
          Lena moans inside the car. She may even start crying.

          

          

           LENA
           Please!

          

          
          She says this to the two men.

          

          

           POLICEMAN
           Get out of there! I will drive!

           ERNESTO S.
           Absolutely not!

           POLICEMAN
           You either let me drive or we all stay here until the
           ambulance arrives!

           LENA
           (To Ernesto) Stop it, Ernesto! Let him drive!

           POLICEMAN
           (To Ernesto, paternalistic and contemptuous) Get down
           and sit in the back, with your wife!

           ERNESTO S.
           (Threatening) If anything happens (referring to Lena),
           you better be ready... You have no idea who I am!

          

          
          Taking his time, Ernesto vacates the driver's seat and sits in the
          back, next to Lena.

          

          

           POLICEMAN

          

          

          

          

           115

          
           I will pretend that I didn't hear you. I will also
           pretend I noticed neither how drunk you are nor your
           affronts to authority, Mr. Martel.

          

          
          Sulking and with an alcohol-driven affection (and casual) he asks

          LENA:

          

          

           ERNESTO S.
           Are you all right?

           LENA
           (Screams) No! (to the policeman) And could we get (the
           fuck) going?!

          

          
          The policeman gets the car moving and his partner follows them in the
          patrol car.

          

          

          

          

          91. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE. EXT. NIGHT. 1994


          

          
          Ernesto's car, driven by the patroleman, arrives to the entrance of a
          hospital.
          Cut to.
          Immediately, at the Emergency Room, some male nurses arrive with a
          stretcher.

          

          

          

          

          92. HOSPITAL. INT. NIGHT. 1994


          

          
          X-Rays of arms, legs and head, along with all other routine tests, in
          short shots. A broken leg. Various contusions. A cast must be
          applied.

          The image of the X-Ray takes up the whole screen. We may hear the
          nurses giving instructions. "Don't move", "Don't breathe", etc.

          

          

          

          

          93. HOSPITAL. INT. NIGHT. 1994


          

          
          The last thing we see is the X-ray of the head, which dissolves over
          Lena's head and face as she asks a nurse for the telephone, telling
          her that she needs to make an urgent phone call.
          Ernesto censures her with his look. Once the last X-ray has been
          taken, the nurse brings her a supplementary handset and plugs it in.
          She hands the handset to Lena.

          

          

           ERNESTO
           You really can't wait?

           LENA
           (Defiant) No.

          

          
          Ernesto looks at her not knowing what to expect. Nonetheless, he
          remains seated next to her. Lena doesn't react, she doesn't care if
          he overhears the conversation, she almost wants him to.
          The brutal beating to which she has been victim is an inescapable
          reality that gives her an edge over Ernesto, an edge of which she
          intends to take advantage. She is wounded, but she is no longer
          afraid of him.

          

          
          She rings Mateo's number. They greet each other.

          

          

           LENA
           Hello, Mateo?

           OFF MATEO

          

          

           117

          
           What's going on? Are you not coming?

           LENA
           Not tonight.

           OFF MATEO
           Has something happened?

           LENA
           Something unexpected has happened, but don't worry,
           everything's OK.

           OFF MATEO
           Tomorrow the shooting begins in the afternoon, will I
           see you before then?

           LENA
           I won't be able to. I will see you directly at the
           studio. I have something to do.

           OFF MATEO
           (Worried) You're acting strange, Magdalena. Are you
           sure nothing's wrong?

           LENA
           Yes. I'll see you tomorrow.

          

          

          

          

          94. THE NEXT DAY. PUERTA DE HIERRO MANSION. ON THE LAWN.

          DAY. 1994

          

          
          Ernesto Senior's car arrives at the Puerta de Hierro Mansion.
          Various members, three or four, of the Mansion's personnel approach to
          help the couple.
          Lena exits the car with her leg covered in a cast up to her knee. She
          leans on crutches or a cane.
          Cut to.

          95. MANSION. GROUND FLOOR. INT. DAY. 1994.


          

          
          The group gathers in the living room of the ground floor. Ernesto
          asks the help to bring them something and then to leave them alone.
          Cut to.

          

          

          

          

          96. MANSION. GROUND FLOOR. INT. DAY. 1994


          

          
          A table set ad hoc.
          Lena is sitting in front of her breakfast (or lunch), sullen, pale,
          implacable, she doesn't move a single muscle of her massacred face.

          

          
          Ernesto Senior is all sweetness toward his victim. Lena begins to
          pick at her food, listless, in silence, in order to keep her mouth and
          eyes occupied.

          

          

           ERNESTO SENIOR
           (Begs, sincerely) What would you like me to do? What
           can I do so that you will forgive me?

           LENA
           (Seriously) Take me to the studio.

           ERNESTO SENIOR
           You shouldn't move.

           LENA
           If you don't take me, I'll go there myself, even if I
           have to drag myself.

          

          
          Her face is still covered in bruises, on her cheekbone and around her
          eyes.

          

          

           119

          
          At some point someone from the hired help appears: "Sir, Madam, do you
          need anything else?". "No, you can leave us alone, I have already
          told you this, for God's sake!" Ernesto Senior responds. The servant
          quickly vanishes.
          Lowering his tone:

          

          

           ERNESTO SENIOR
           And what will you say? how will you explain the cast
           on your leg and the bruises?

          

          
          Lena appears implacable throughout the conversation.

          

          

           LENA
           It's up to you.

           ERNESTO SENIOR
           To me? I will do whatever you ask, as long as you
           promise you'll stay with me.

           LENA
           I will stay, under the condition that you let Mateo
           finish the shooting, according to what he decides.

           ERNESTO SENIOR
           He will barrage you with questions, that guy's not
           stupid.

           LENA
           I will tell him I tripped.

           ERNESTO SENIOR
           And how will you shoot, if you can't walk?

           LENA
           I don't know. Whatever Mateo decides, but I want to
           rest assured that you will respect his decision, no
           matter the cost nor the time that it will take. Is
           that clear?

           120

          
          Ernesto Senior hates to negotiate under predetermined limitations. He
          weighs out his options and realizes that Lena has the upper hand.

          

          

          

          

          97. WAREHOUSE, SHABBY STUDIO. EXT. INT. DAY. 1994


          

          
          They enter the warehouse, temporarily turned into a studio. (The
          darkness is almost absolute. A huge door opens. The silhouettes of
          Ernesto Senior and Lena, on a wheelchair, enter.)
          The dark, vast space is pierced by the blinding light of a doorway,
          which both frames and silhouettes the figures of Ernesto and Lena,
          like cut-outs; creating a powerful image. Epic and terrible.
          They bump into some of the members of the team, who begin their work
          day, slothfully.
          When Mateo discovers the pair, he approaches them immediately.
          Cut to.

          

          

          

          

          98. MATEO'S OFFICE, IN THE WAREHOUSE TURNED STUDIO. INT. DAY.


          1994

          

          
          Mateo is seated at a casual table. The entire decoration of the
          office is casual and chaotic, not luxurious, austere, nothing like
          Lena's dressing room. An enormous drip eats away at one of the
          corners of the room.
          Lena is sitting across from him, on a wheelchair, and seated on an
          ugly armchair, Ernesto Senior. Judit is also present, she's standing.
          They have just finished talking. Lena has told the version that she
          and Ernesto Senior agreed on.

          

          

          

          

           121

          

           LENA
           ... And that's it.

          

          
          Mateo looks at them in disbelief. Judit, still as a statue, waits for
          the others' reactions. Lena breathes, expectantly. And Ernesto
          Senior looks uncomfortable and insecure, he is used to being the one
          who calls the shots; the inverse role, that of listener, disorients
          him and puts him in a bad mood.

          

          

           LENA
           Ernesto is prepared to support whatever you decide.

           MATEO
           (Containing his rage) Decide, what?! I can't move
           from one shot where you are walking normally to
           another one where you are wearing a cast! How long
           must you wear the cast?

           LENA
           Three weeks.

          

          
          Mateo lets out a huff...

          

          

           JUDIT
           (To Ernesto Senior) Can we stop for those three
           weeks? With pay for the team, of course.

           ERNESTO S.
           If there is no other option!

           MATEO
           (A bit agitated) I hate stopping! Movies, when you
           pick them back up, are no longer the same!

          

          
          Looks at Judit and Ernesto Senior.

          

          

           122

          

           MATEO
           (Dryly) Do you mind if I speak to Lena alone for a
           moment?

          

          
          It's not a question but a demand.
          Judit shoots him a look of recrimination, as if saying "This is not
          the moment for that", but she cannot do anything to stop him.
          Ernesto Senior is also not pleased (but he knows he cannot say no, and
          this irritates him even more). He glances first at Lena, who orders
          him with her own glance to accept, and then looks at Judit, who warmly
          invites him to exit with her.
          For some reason, Ernesto Senior empathizes with that woman.

          

          

          

          

          99. WAREHOUSE, SHABBY STUDIO. NEXT TO MATEO'S DRESSING ROOM.

          INT. DAY. 1994


          

          
          Judit and Ernesto Senior exit the office and hang around not far from
          to the door. They smoke, perhaps. They are both restless. They look
          at each other as if seeking some kind of understanding, despite their
          differences. And they find it. They are joined by their jealousy.
          At the other end of the warehouse, like a mirage amongst the shadows,
          Pina's loft appears, majestic, ramshackle and mysterious. Ernesto
          contemplates it without understanding it, but is affected by its
          presence. He is unable to understand the essence of this make-belief
          game, but it's the first time he begins to grasp its hermetic
          fascination.

          

          

          

          

          100. MATEO'S OFFICE. WAREHOUSE, SHABBY STUDIO. INT. DAY. 1994


          

          

          

           123

          
          Mateo lifts her skirt in an attempt to see how far up the cast goes.
          On the white skin of her thighs, like in an uneven print, various
          asymmetrical bruises stand out. Mateo touches with his lips on every
          one of them, kissing them delicately. Lena shudders.

          

          

           LENA
           Be careful, he may walk in.

           MATEO
           Let him walk in!

          

          
          And he continues kissing her thighs until he comes close to her pubis.
          Lena lifts and/or caresses his head. Mateo lifts it to look at her.

          

          

           MATEO
           Tell me the truth! People don't fall down the stairs,
           that only happens in movies.

          

          
          Lena avoids giving a direct answer, but in her own way, she lets him
          know, somberly and urgently.

          

          

           LENA
           Mateo, we must finish the shooting as soon as
           possible! Until then, I cannot leave Ernesto.

           MATEO
           Why not? He's a psychopath! What more proof do you
           need?

           LENA
           I cannot leave, I've made a deal with him.

           MATEO
           A deal? What deal?

           LENA

          

          

           124

          
          I have promised to stay in his house in exchange for
          his letting you finish the film, under your
          conditions.

           MATEO
          But I cannot ask you for such a sacrifice.

           LENA
          You have not asked me...

           MATEO
          I can't accept it either.

           LENA
          (Pleads) Mateo, please!

           MATEO
          There must be another answer.

           LENA
          What else? The only solution is that I continue to live
          with him until you finish the film.

           MATEO
          Can you take it?

           LENA
          You don't have to think about that... What's important
          is that you finish shooting.

           MATEO
          Exactly what have you agreed to?

           LENA
          I've told you, to live under the same roof, with him
          in his room and me in mine. He doesn't have the right
          to anything more.

          

          

          

          

           MATEO
          And you think he will be content with that?

           LENA

           125

          
           (Angst-ridden) I don't know... but the sooner you
           finish shooting, the better! Come up with a reason
           not to pause!

          

          
          Mateo goes over the story in his head, desperately attempting to think
          of something. Lena observes him, expectantly. Finally, something
          seems to hit him.

          

          

           MATEO
           (Unenthusiastic) We would have to repeat part of the
           stairway scene...

          

          

          

          

          101. SHOOTING AT THE STAIRWAY. STAIRWAY LANDING, IVAN'S HOUSE.

          INT. DAY. 1994


          

          
          (Taking up the whole screen, we see the scene through the Moviola,
          with the texture of a bad copy, streaks, grain, etc. The solution
          Mateo has proposed is to repeat the last part of the sequence. On the
          surface of the Moviola screen, the reflection of Mateo's face is
          barely visible over the first set of images screened.)

          

          
          A wooden landing and stairway in a building of the old Madrid. At its
          center, an elevator, also antique.

          

          
          Pina has just left a note for Ivan on the door to his study asking him
          to please call on her, that she needs to speak to him urgently, that
          something unexpected has come up... (She is dressed as she was when she
          came out of the entrance hall in the previous scene with Chus. This
          sequence is supposed to be the one that follows it.)

          

          

          

          

           126

          
          She has just left the note when Julieta appears, she is dressed
          conventionally, but with some extravagant detail, something that
          garners attention. She bumps into Pina by the elevator, Pina does not
          know her. Julieta knocks on the studio's door (just as Pina had done
          earlier), she doesn't get an answer. She notices the note that Pina
          has just affixed on the door. She takes it down and reads it, much to
          Pina's bafflement, who has been watching her from the other side of
          the landing. After reading it, Julieta crumples it up. Pina cannot
          believe it. She remains motionless on the other side of the landing,
          because she doesn't trust the eccentric looking woman.

          

          

           PINA
           (Indignant) Leave that note there! It's not for you.
           How dare you take it and crumple it?

          

          
          Julieta throws the crumpled note through the gap in the stairway and
          looks condescendingly at Pina while she approaches her, prepared to
          walk down the stairs.

          

          

           JULIETA
           What do you have to speak to Ivan about, you whore!

           PINA
           It's none of your business.

           JULIETA
           I am his wife.

           PINA
           His wife has been admitted at a psychiatric hospital
           for twenty years now.

           JULIETA
           Not anymore.

          

          

          

          

           127

          

          UP TO THIS POINT WE WATCH THE SEQUENCE THROUGH THE IMAGE-TEXTURE OF

          THE MOVIOLA AND THE REFLECTION OF MATEO'S FACE.
          (These images are what will be retained from what had been shot
          previously.)

          

          

          

          

          102. SHOOTING AT THE STAIRWAY. CONTINUED.

          

          
          Pina makes a gesture as if to say: "So you are the ex-wife, the crazy
          one."
          Pina and Julieta begin to descend the stairs.

          

          

           JULIETA
           (Repeats) I am no longer committed. I am now here
           with you. Walking down the stairs.

          

          
          Pina looks at her apprehensively... She steps down only one
          stair.

          

          

           JULIETA
           You are in a hurry to see him, aren't you?

           PINA
           Yes...

           JULIETA
           Well, what are you waiting for!

          

          
          She pushes her and Pina falls, rolling all the way to the bottom.
          Cut to.

           128

          
          Images that indicate the passing of time during the shooting. Short
          sequences of the minute work done by each of the teams, as if
          assembling ballet pieces, all of it accompanied by a musical score:
          The D.P. sets up the lighting for the shoot, the bulbs are lit, the
          filters applied, the interior of the camera cleaned, the film is
          loaded. The atmosphere is set. Pina in her bedroom, lying on the
          bed, with one leg in a cast, is relaxing, breathing deeply. The
          actress playing Chon jokes around with the costume team, they laugh.
          But no one pays attention to the others. Edurne, in a close-up,
          retouches one of Pina's eyes. The mouth as well. Chon stops laughing
          so that the hair-stylist may shape her hair.
          All the images are very brief... The score predominates, the ambient
          sounds of the activities of the different teams is heard more like a
          whisper. The scene must not last longer than a minute. This set of
          images serves to abridge time and to indicate that the shooting is in
          its final days, after a long journey.
          There will probably not be many images, but less: the bulb that
          lights, Lena's eye as Edurne retouches it, its blinking, its sadness.
          Chon's mouth as she speaks without pause, stopping only when lipstick
          is added. The film loaded, the hair fluffed. Lena lying on the rug
          in her dressing room, totally motionless, her eyes made-up and closed,
          doing breathing exercises for relaxation, her leg in a cast, etc.
          Motor. Action!

          The doorbell rings in the loft. Pina limps over to the door. She
          looks through the metal peephole, its design creates an optical
          illusion. On the other side of the peephole, Chon's exalted eyes
          appear. Chon is a Better Midler type, in her 40s, that kind of
          extroverted woman who at first glance appears chubby but isn't quite
          so. She is wearing designer clothes, despite the fact that her
          demeanor is direct and crass. Both of them, Pina and Chon, are tired
          and hysterical, which each one of them interprets in her own way.
          Pina opens the door and Chon enters. Even though they are good
          friends, the last thing Pina is in the mood for is to see Chon, much
          less an over-excited Chon with "problems".

          

          

           PINA
           (Whispers) What a drag! (she opens the door, in a
           languid, bored tone) Oh, it's you?

           CHON
           (Reproaches, depressed) I've left you a thousand
           messages!

           PINA
           Yes...

          

          
          Chon notices Ivan's suitcase in the middle of the foyer and looks at
          it as if she'd never seen a suitcase.

          

          

           CHON
           And this suitcase?!

          

          
          Judging from the tone, one would guess she could care less. But the
          script asks for her to inquire about the suitcase and she inquires.

          

          

           PINA
           (Sounding bored, asleep) It's Ivan's. He's leaving me.

           130

          
          Chon, disconcerted, notices that Pina drags herself around with a cast
          on her leg.
          (She has picked up Pina's inexpressive tone)

          

          

           CHON
           And that broken leg?

           PINA
           His ex-wife, the crazy one. She pushed me down the
           stairs . . .

           CHON
           I see, we're in great shape...

           MATEO
           (Interrupts the take) Cut!

          

          
          Final clap board. It's take number twelve.

          The camera team directs "load camera" (new film stock is loaded, the
          one already inside has run out).
          Mateo has a look of worry, the scene is not funny at all, the
          actresses are bored and tense. They behave like automatons. Lena
          looks at Mateo, she had never seen him so disconsolate.

          

          
          A general impasse and discouragement. The team betrays boredom,
          preoccupation, and exhaustion.

          

          

          

          

           131

          
          The actress playing Chon grumbles, annoyed. Juanba, the hair-stylist,
          approaches her to fix her hair. In the background, one sees Mateo
          speaking to Lena.

          

          
          Ernesto Junior wanders around the set.
          We suppose that he has already shot the other takes, we notice a
          change in his attitude. He watches Lena and Mateo converse, then
          watches them as they move away from the set; he has no intention of
          following them. One might say that he is now on their side, against
          his own father.

          In some place of the warehouse where no one can see them and they can
          speak calmly. Mateo and Lena.
          During this time, Lena has been keeping her end of the deal and
          continues to live with Ernesto Martel but, as much as she attempts to
          diffuse it, its effect has been devastating. She is very depressed.
          She can hardly hold herself up. Lena's state of mind and how it
          affects the shooting, makes Mateo feel impotent and guilty.

          

          

           LENA
           (Distressed, maybe she'll cry) I am sorry...

           MATEO
           Don't worry, it will turn out. (Acknowledges) But I
           don't know what more direction to give you.

           LENA
           (Exhausted, hard on herself) You have told me
           everything, in every way possible...

          

          

           132

          

           MATEO
           (Somber and guilty) Ernesto is getting just what he
           hoped. That we make a piece of crap of a movie! I
           told you not to agree to that deal...

          

          
          Lena breathes, grasping for a solution and for breath. She attempts
          to regain her strength.

          

          

           LENA
           We can't let him have his way! (She dries her tears,
           feeling newly replenished) Every day I arrive worn
           out and every day I recover, right?

           MATEO
           (Acknowledges) Yes...

           LENA
           I ask you only for a bit more patience... And a kiss!

          

          
          Mateo kisses her as one kisses one shipwrecked, although the one
          shipwrecked is really him. In any case, the kiss brings life back to
          both of them.

          Motor. Action. The clap board indicates that they will shoot take
          number thirteen. A traveling shot follows Lena as she limps toward
          the door. She looks through the peephole, behind it, Chon. They are
          supposed to be good friends, but she's the last person Lena wants to
          see.

          

          

           PINA

          

          

           133

          
           (Whispers) What a drag! (contemptuous, she greets
           her) Oh, it's you?

           CHON
           Listen, if that's how you'll greet me, I'll leave.

           PINA
           No, c'mon! Come inside!

          

          
          Pina treats her with a friendly disdain, which plays comically. She
          has once again recovered her strength and her lightness. Her low
          spirits have disappeared and she comes off thoughtless and impudent.
          Her reenactment has an effect on Chon, who also performs much better
          than in the previous take.

          

          
          These first few phrases are enough to determine that the two actresses
          have improved. Lena is now a different actress, light and delicious.
          Mateo smiles, brimming with admiration.

          Mateo and his editor (and the assistant editor) watch the end of the
          sequence on the Moviola.

          

          

           MATEO
           She's so much better! Grab this one!

           LUIS
           Yes.

          

          
          Mateo smiles, satisfied. On the same table where the Moviola sits,
          Luis, the editor, has a notebook in which each page corresponds to a

          

          

          

          

           134

          
          sequence, numbered respectively. The sequences are divided by shots
          and the shots by the number of takes.
          Luis draws a circle around take number thirteen.

          

          

           MATEO
           Let's look at fourteen, it's even better!

          

          
          Luis, an editing assistant and Mateo, sitting in front of the Moviola,
          examine the footage.
          There is a palpable complicity between Luis and Mateo. Luis has edited
          all of Mateo's films, they have been colleagues for a long time. As
          with Judit, despite their differences, one can tell that Luis belongs
          to Mateo's artistic family.

          Time passes.
          The characters are dressed differently.
          As they load the film and sound onto the Moviola, we hear Harry's
          voice-off.
          Only audio:

          

          
          YEAR 2008. VOICE-OFF OF HARRY SPEAKING TO DIEGO. We hear it over the
          running Moviola.

          

          

           OFF HARRY
           When we finished shooting, I quickly selected all the
           takes for the film so that I could rescue Lena as soon
           as possible from the Martel house. The situation had

          

          

           135

          
           worsened, we could hardly see each other, he had
           practically kidnapped her... They were difficult days for
           everyone, but Lena insisted that I leave all the takes
           selected... then, we could leave.

          

          
          He hasn't finished saying this when we hear the phone ring. The
          assistant, phone in hand: (to Mateo) "It's for you". He takes it,
          surprised, he is still staring at the Moviola screen. It's Lena.

          

          

           OFF
           It's Magdalena.

           MATEO
           Is there something wrong?

           OFF
           No. I'm downstairs. I've forgotten my money. I have
           to pay the cab . . .

           MATEO
           I'll be right down.

          

          
          He exits the editing room.

          INT. NIGHT. 1994


          

          
          Mateo descends the stairs of Cinearte at a good clip, he wasn't
          expecting Lena's visit. He can sense something's happened.
          When he arrives at the foyer, he can't find her.
          The phone operator (ugly, but polite) at the reception desk tells him
          Lena is in the bathroom.

          He enters the bathroom and finds Lena, barefoot, wearing only her bra
          and panties, cleaning wounds she's suffered on her face and legs. The
          surface of the sink is tainted with blood. Mateo looks at her,
          horrified. (She is no longer wearing a cast). A man's jacket lies on
          top of the counter, this is the only piece of clothing that appears in
          this scene.

          

          

           MATEO
           (Horrified) But . . . what has happened?!

           LENA
           We have had a brutal fight... At the end, he ripped my
           clothes off and my shoes and he threw me out naked onto
           the highway. The jacket belongs to the cab driver.
           You must give him a good tip, if it weren't for him I
           don't know how I would have made it here...

          

          
          Mateo cannot believe his eyes. He hurls insults at Ernesto Senior.
          Lena's apparent composure is purely hysterical.

          Mateo and Lena exit Cinearte.
          They enter a cab that is waiting for them.

          

          

           MATEO
           (To the cab driver) Take us to the nearest police
           station...

          

          

           137

          

           LENA
           No, please...

           MATEO
           We must denounce him, Magdalena!

           LENA
           He will turn against you!

          

          
          The cab begins moving.
          Mateo gives the cab driver his address.

          

          

           LENA
           No, not your house.

           MATEO
           We have to look after you. Let's go to a hotel...

           LENA
           (Pleads) Let's leave Madrid.

          

          
          Mateo looks through his pockets, fortunately, he has all his credit
          cards on him.

          

          

          

          

          113. LANZAROTE. FAMARA BEACH. BUNGALOW ZONE. EXT. DAY. 1994


          

          
          Mateo and Lena are living in a bungalow zone on Famara Beach, a
          complex nestled between the beach and the foot of a mountain. It is a
          special and intimate place, like an enormous grotto, where the sky is
          its ceiling and the mountains one of its walls.

          

          
          Lena and Mateo exit a bungalow and get into a rented car, a red Opel
          Corsa, not in very good shape.

          On the peak of a reddish rock, on Golfo Beach, Mateo takes photographs
          of the natural wonders surrounding him. Next to him, Lena
          contemplates the view.
          What Mateo sees with his camera:
          a) Wine colored rocks
          b) The yellow-green lake circumscribed by a rope that has become
          white, against the black sand.
          c) The black sand of the enormous beach, licked by the shimmering foam
          of the waves.
          d) The rocky walls enveloping the beach, eroded through centuries by
          the wind on the surface of which it has created peaks and valleys
          resembling the jutted edge of a watch cog.

          

          
          One of the images captures part of a wine-colored rock. Below it, the
          infinite surface of the black beach, licked by the white foam of the
          waves. In the backdrop, an immense limestone wall, its surface full of
          pit holes where the wind circulates.
          The sequence ends with a close-up of the click of Mateo's camera's
          shutter, opening and closing like an owl's eye.

          

          

          

          

          115. SOUVENIR AND PHOTOGRAPHY STORE. LANZAROTE. INT. DAY. 1994


          

          
          Mateo-Harry and Lena pick up their photos at the store's counter. The
          owner of the shop hands them to him, he is an attractive and bohemian
          middle-aged man.
          Mateo opens the envelope impatiently, he wants to make sure that his
          photographs are, in effect, the ones inside it.

          He looks at the last one closely, the landscape with the rocks, the
          beach, the foam, etc. Somewhere on the vast black-sand beach one can
          make out a couple, their size is tiny compared to the immensity of the
          beach. The two are melded into a tight embrace. The beach is
          deserted. Mateo had not been aware of them when he took the
          photograph and is overtaken by his discovery.
          He shows it to Lena. Half-joking.

          

          

           MATEO
           Look. It's us. (I thought it was empty)

          

          
          Mateo asks the bohemian Attendant for a larger print.

          They go through various traffic circles. Mateo comments that it is
          "the island of the useless traffic circles". "That's part of its
          charm", comments Lena.

          

          

          

          

          117. TRAFFIC CIRCLE WITH CESAR MANRIQUE SCULPTURE. EXT. DAY.


          1994

          

          
          They stop on one of the stop signs at the traffic circle. In the
          center there is a huge mobile sculpture by Cesar Manrique, rocked by
          the wind.
          Mateo and Lena exit the car to take pictures of themselves. Their
          faces close together, their eyes happy. The sculpture turning around
          itself produces a strange screeching sound.

          118. BUNGALOW. FAMARA BEACH. INT. DUSK OR NIGHT. 1994


          

          
          Many days have passed. Mateo's hair is longer and he appears more
          tan, the proximity to nature and the absence of a social life has also
          affected Magdalena's appearance, now much more savage, but also more
          serene and more humble. She is dressed in cheap clothing, which she
          has bought on the island (and which fits her marvelously) and her hair
          is pulled up into a messy bun.

          

          
          The photograph, enlarged, presides on top of a small table where Mateo
          writes. The picture is leaning against the wall. It's the only image
          inside the bungalow. The photograph is a clear metaphor for the
          mysterious quality of the island as well as of the isolation of Mateo
          and Lena and of their fusion.

          

          
          While Mateo writes, Lena cleans the dishes or she does the laundry in
          the bathtub. The two wear T-shirts, comfortable and sporty clothes.
          (On the tape-deck one hears La Lupe singing: ... "porque hay un hombre
          para cada mujer y una mujer para cada hombre, y nosotros somos,
          nosotros somos... la pareja" [because there is only one man for each
          woman and only one woman for each man, and we are, and we are... the
          couple]). Mateo and Magdalena, the couple.

          

          
          In the bungalow there isn't much furniture; there's a large couch on
          which they can lie comfortably, a short table, along with the wooden
          table on which Mateo writes. Some armchair and lamps. And a tape-
          deck.
          Cut to.

          119. BUNGALOW. INT. DUSK OR NIGHT. 1994


          

          
          Engulfed by the couch, Mateo and Lena are absorbed watching, on a
          small television, a broadcast of "Voyage in Italy" (Roberto
          Rossellini's).
          The scene they are watching is set in a place where a group of men are
          working on some excavation. The married couple (in the midst of their
          breakup), played by George Sanders and Ingrid Bergman, is on a tourist
          trip in that area of Italy and they have gone to visit the excavation.
          One of the technicians describes the delicate work that is involved in
          excavating part of a city that had been buried, centuries ago, by the
          lethal eruption of the Vesuvius.
          At that moment, the men who are working on the excavation begin, bit
          by bit, to uncover a couple, a man and a woman, sleeping in an
          embrace, whom the eruption had taken unaware, leaving them preserved
          in this position for centuries.
          Ingrid Bergman cannot stand the sight of this couple calcined in an
          eternal embrace. She compares it to her own marriage, destroyed by
          their lack of communication and by the absence of generosity between
          them. She walks away from the place, unable to contain her tears.
          The scene affects Magdalena and Mateo as much as it had Ingrid
          Bergman.
          Mateo and Lena instinctively embrace each other, seeking refuge in
          each other, their posture echoes that of the calcined couple.

          

          
          Suddenly, Mateo breaks their embrace. He positions the camera on top
          of the table where he writes, not far from where the image of the
          other "embrace" sits. He points it toward the couch and he presses
          the automatic button. And they take a picture together, locked in an
          embrace.

          Harry and Diego, now completely cured, are sitting on a bench.

          

          

           HARRY
           Do you want to go back home and return to the "Donate
           Blood" story?

           DIEGO
           I am hoping to get back to it, but first tell me what
           happened in Lanzarote. You can't leave me hanging!

          

          
          Harry takes a deep breath. At this stage of the narrative, it is only
          understandable that Diego would want to know everything. But it pains
          him to think of what is still left to tell.

          

          

           HARRY
           Without realizing, a month had elapsed... I knew that
           sooner or later we would have to return, but we kept
           postponing it. I was only worried about you and your
           mother. I had not even said goodbye and you were still
           suffering from your allergy problem when we left... I can
           imagine Judit was furious with me.

           DIEGO
           You can't imagine how much.

           HARRY
           I was planning to return soon to finish the editing...
           and to explain things to your mother. But Magdalena
           decided she'd wait for me on the island. She couldn't
           stand the thought of seeing Ernesto again.

          Mateo and Lena are walking toward the office for the bungalow complex.
          (Part of the previous dialogue is heard as the couple are approaching
          the office)

          

          

          

          

          121. A. INTERIOR OF THE RECEPTION HALL, FAMARA BUNGALOWS. INT.


          DAY. 1994

          

          
          Behind the counter there are two foreign employees, a man and a woman.
          Lena addresses them in English, while Mateo keeps himself busy at the
          other end of the reception hall, next to a table with magazines and
          newspapers. He grabs a newspaper.
          In English:

          

          

           LENA
           Sorry to interrupt... I wanted to ask if there are any
           employment opportunities available here, with you... You
           always look so busy... I have a lot of free time...

           EMPLOYEE
           We could use the help, especially now that the high
           season is about to start... Do you have experience?

           LENA
           I have worked as a secretary at M. Capital, a very
           important finance company.

           EMPLOYEE
           (Looks at her) You could first work during the
           afternoons and, then, we could see...

          

          

           144

          
          With his back to the counter, at the other end of the reception desk,
          Mateo reads a newspaper, frozen.
          Suddenly, the employee opens a National newspaper and looks for a
          particular page. He shows it to Lena. On the Entertainment page, an
          ad for Mateo's movie (Opening Soon). The ad is a close-up of her, in
          her role as Pina, in the movie. Lena is stunned. She can't believe
          it.

          

          

           EMPLOYEE
           We were just saying that the girl in the ad looks like
           you.

          

          
          Lena looks toward where Mateo is standing and she notices that he is
          as perplexed as she is, staring at the ad for a soon-to-be-released
          film in the newspaper.

          

          

           LENA
           (To the employee) No. It's not me.

          

          
          They exit the office.

          

          

          

          

          122. BUNGALOW COMPLEX. EXT. DAY. 1994


          

          
          Mateo and Lena walk toward their bungalow as if someone were chasing
          them. They have just run into the very thing they have been
          attempting to escape in Madrid.

          

          

           MATEO
           I was wondering how long it would take him to emerge!

          

          

           145

          

           LENA
           (Disoriented) But they can't release the film so
           soon, right?

           MATEO
           No. It's a scheme to annoy us, and a trap to get you
           to return. The ad is only lacking the words "Missing."

           LENA
           What are we going to do?

           MATEO
           Nothing. Fuck them!

          

          

          

          

          123. TWO WEEKS LATER. ON FAMARA BEACH. EXT. DAY. 1994


          

          

          A TITLE TAKING UP THE WHOLE SCREEN: TWO WEEKS LATER

          

          
          A few surfers are preparing to go into the ocean. A father and his
          young son toss their kites into the wind.
          Lounging on lounge chairs, on a cobble-stone area before one reaches
          the sand, Lena and Mateo-Harry are reading the news of the opening of
          the film in a National newspaper. They only have one copy and Mateo's
          eyes are transfixed on the news.
          The note accompanying the event says, in bold type:
          "The financier, Ernesto Martel, has managed to gather all of Madrid
          for his first film as a producer, missing are only its director and
          star."
          Two pictures accompany the news of the event. Printed next to them,
          there is a review entitled, "Disaster."
          Mateo throws the newspaper away from him, enraged. He refuses to read
          the review.

          

          

           146

          
          The wind dishevels the newspaper pages. Lena rises and chases the
          pages that fly, like kites, slightly above the ground.
          In mid-flight, she catches the Entertainment page and reads it as she
          approaches Mateo, who watches the ocean, feeling impotent, furious,
          unable to quite grasp what is happening.
          Lena sits down next to him, still reading.

          

          

           MATEO
           (Disconsolate) What does it say?

           LENA
           That the only intelligent thing we have done has been
           not to attend the premier, that my acting is pathetic,
           that you seem like a first-time director and that you
           lack talent. At the end, it wonders who might have
           made your first films. Never before has such a
           resounding downfall been witnessed... How horrible!

          

          
          Mateo rises and heads quickly for the bungalow, which functions as the
          office for the complex.
          Lena follows him, alarmed.

          

          

           LENA
           What are you going to do?

          

          

          

          

          124. OFFICE FOR BUNGALOW COMPLEX. FAMARA BEACH. INT. DAY. 1994


          

          
          Cut to, directly to the shot of the telephone. Mateo has just dialed
          Judit's number. He gets the answering machine, hearing Judit's voice
          encourages him to leave a message. "Hi. You have reached Judit

          

          

          

          

           147

          
          Garcia's voicemail. Leave your message after the tone and I will
          return your call as soon as possible."
          Mateo leaves his message.

          

          

           MATEO
           (Dryly) Judit. It's me. I hope you and the boy are
           OK. I apologize that I left without notice, but
           terrible things have happened, I will explain.
           Speaking of which, I need to talk to you, urgently.
           Please call me! Here's the number... (Asks one of the
           employees) Oh, and, ask for Harry Caine, I have
           registered under that name... (said almost as an order)
           I will be waiting for your call!

          

          
          He also rings Luis, the editor. He also doesn't answer. He leaves
          Luis a shorter and more violent message.

          

          

           MATEO
           Luis, I just read in the newspaper that the film has
           opened and I am beside myself!! I don't know what the
           fuck is going on there, but I would like to know! OK,
           I'll ring back!

          

          
          He looks at Lena, breathless, his face contorted from sheer
          helplessness.

          

          

          

          

          125. RETURN TO 2008. HARRY'S HOME. DEN. DAY.

          

          
          Harry is standing, pacing back and forth. Diego stands next to the
          bookcase. The drawer with the photographs is open.

          

          

           148

          
          He looks at the photograph of the traffic circle and at the one of
          "The embrace" on the black sand of Golfo Beach.
          He has taken them out of the large brown envelope. At the bottom of
          the drawer one can begin to see Luis' (the editor) notebook. Diego is
          holding a Dymo label machine, (this Dymo has appeared in previous
          scenes) with all of its keyboard buttons, corresponding to the regular
          alphabet, in Braille. He is writing, in Braille, "Famara ­ Lanzarote
          94" so that he can stick the raised title onto the old envelope.

          

          

           DIEGO
           And mom, did she call you back?

           HARRY
           No.

           DIEGO
           (Can't understand, he's almost indignant) Why?

           HARRY
           She was pissed, I suppose.

           DIEGO
           I remember that time, it was while I was undergoing
           treatment for pulmonary aspergillosis. It was a
           horrible time for me... Not just because of the illness,
           my mother was like a crazy woman... I had just seen "The
           Exorcist" and, for some time, I believed she was
           possessed...

           HARRY
           (Smiles pathetically) I was the demon, Diego. And I
           am sorry. I suppose I behaved selfishly, but I am not
           sure I had a choice...

          

          
          Diego thinks about this.

          

          

           DIEGO

           149

          
           (Emotionally exhausted) No matter how upset she was,
           she should have alerted you to what was happening.

           HARRY
           The fact is she never did, and we've never spoken of
           it. Neither one of us has broached the topic.

           DIEGO
           (Surprised) And you weren't curious?...

           HARRY
           (Emphatically) Me? Curiosity was killing me! For
           two days I called both your mother and Luis non-stop,
           the editor (says it agitated), but neither of them
           answered! So I decided to return to Madrid the next
           day so that I could witness what was happening for
           myself!

          

          

          126. RESTAURANT. EL MIRADOR [THE LOOKOUT]. EXT. DUSK. 1994


          

          
          (Night falls while they dine.)
          Mateo and Magdalena dine at "El Mirador," a local restaurant with
          spectacular views. Their table is beside a long sliding-door window
          that overlooks the valley. A group of rocks seem to grow next to the
          window as if they were plants made of stone. The view of the valley
          is breathtaking.
          There are few patrons inside the restaurant. Perhaps a foreign
          couple, sitting far from Lena and Mateo. A waiter brings their first
          course. They are drinking wine.
          Lena appears melancholic and fearful.

          

          

           MATEO
           How did you meet Ernesto Senior?

           LENA

          

          

           150

          
           (It's not a topic she likes, but she doesn't hesitate
           to answer.) I was one of his secretaries.

           MATEO
           And... how did you end up with him? You fell in love?

           LENA
           He was very generous with me and my family. My father
           was dying, I needed to take him to a private Hospital
           and Ernesto took care of everything... He paid for
           everything... And he made sure that my parents could
           return to their home town and that they lacked nothing...

          

          
          Mateo imagines the situation, it upsets him. He is perturbed by the
          very idea of Lena's past with Ernesto, but he doesn't want to upset
          her on the night before his departure. They have gone out to dinner
          with just the opposite intent.

          

          

           MATEO
           (Lovingly) Pardon me, I have no right to ask you about
           that time in your life.

           LENA
           It's only natural that you would want to know. And I
           don't want any skeletons between us. (Unguarded) I
           would like to be able to forget all that, but you have
           the right to ask.

           MATEO
           (Assuring her) No. I do not have any right. For me,
           you were born the day you came for the audition. You
           looked at me, I saw your face and... I was left
           hypnotized.

          

          
          Lena smiles. She is both comforted and relived by remembering that
          moment.

           151

          

           LENA
           I remember your face perfectly. I think I fell in
           love with the way you looked at me. I thought: this
           man will be my salvation.

          

          
          Mateo is moved by her use of those terms to speak of their first
          meeting.

          

          
          Cut to.

          They exit in an embrace and head toward their car, parked nearby.
          They kiss before they get in the car. We notice another car which we
          will have the occasion to recall in the future, the camera gives it
          just a passing glance.

          

          

           LENA
           (Childish) It's the first time we part...

           MATEO
           (Pampering) Either way, I will return next weekend.
           But if you are going to be worried, you should come
           with me.

           LENA
           No... I will be better off here.

          

          
          And she smiles, as if the worry has already passed, so as not to
          disquiet Mateo.

          View of the sea of lava or of La Geria in an aerial shot with the car
          moving across the landscape. The full moon allows us to glimpse
          through the darkness of the landscape.
          Mateo's car once again heads for the bungalow complex. Show the
          highway illuminated by the headlights and the landscape as it appears
          to its left and right.

          

          
          From inside the car, one can see the mobile sculpture of Cesar
          Manrique at a distance.

          

          

           MATEO
           (Very insecure) And did I manage to save you from
           anything?

           LENA
           (Enigmatic and unwavering) Yes!

          

          
          Lena does not elaborate on the dangers that Mateo has saved her from,
          he doesn't understand them exactly, but he likes to hear her say so.

          

          
          They approach the traffic circle. A set of lights first betrays the
          presence of a car that appears from the left. Mateo yields to it, and
          briefly kisses Magdalena on the lips.

          

          
          Mateo continues on his way, a short instant later, as he enters the
          traffic circle, an SUV moving at full speed crashes into them.

          

          

          

          

           153

          
          Everything happens very fast. From inside the car, without any
          particular attention to Lena or Mateo, the screen fills up with light,
          noise and darkness. All the different noises form a deafening magma.

          

          
          At the center of the traffic circle, Cesar Manrique's sculpture
          rotates, propelled by the wind.

          

          
          In any case, we will also shoot the crash from the outside. And
          although it will not be obvious at first sight, the back side of
          Mateo's car is illuminated by the headlights of a car that we never
          quite see, but which has been a witness to the accident.

          NIGHT. 1994.

          

          
          The huge mobile sculpture by Cesar Manrique continues to rotate with
          the wind immediately following the collision.
          One can hear the screeching wheels of the SUV escaping from the
          accident scene. One also hears the sound of a second vehicle, which
          approaches and stops, and something that sounds like a door opening
          and a moan.
          The camera only focuses on the sculpture, swaying in the wind.

          Diego looks at Harry in silence, he doesn't say a word. He is still
          holding the Dymo. Harry also says nothing.

           Magdalena's death didn't catch us melded in an embrace,
           but sitting on separate seats. It caught me by
           surprise, in that of leaving me alive.

          

          
          When Harry's face once again appears, we begin to hear his voice-off.

          The entrance to a Hospital in Lanzarote.
          Through one of the windows, we can see Mateo's gaunt and nebulous
          figure resting on a bed, his head bandaged.

          Just as in the beginning, Judit is next to Mateo's bed. She is
          holding his hand and begs him:

          

          

           JUDIT
           Mateo, say something!

           HARRY
           Mateo is dead, Judit.

           JUDIT
           (Bags under her eyes and tearful) Don't say that!

          A naturalist décor and stage-setting of an island Hospital of that
          era, located in a very picturesque place. Through the window we can
          see the local surroundings. The walls are a pastel color, green or
          blue, an aquatic color, and they have various spots where humidity has
          seeped through.
          Other than the psychiatrist, there is another doctor present,
          explaining the situation to Judit.

          

          

           PSYCHIATRIST
           We call him by his name, but he doesn't respond to it.
           He insists Mateo has died.

           JUDIT
           Images are the source of his work... and to live in the
           dark, I suppose that's death to him... Is there any
           chance he will see?

           DOCTOR
           None. His is what we refer to as a cortical
           blindness, and it's irreversible. It's the result of
           a lesion to the occipital lobe, the intelligent part
           of the brain, which has the role of processing all
           visual information. In other words, the neurons have
           died... and that's permanent...

           I felt as though I had died with Lena. The Mateo-
           film-director who had left Madrid would never return.

          

          
          Days or weeks later.

          

          

           156

          
          Judit exits the hospital, with blind-Mateo (he's hidden behind black
          sunglasses), now without the bandages or very few, and with little
          Diego (eight years old), holding hands. Mateo walks tentatively and
          slowly. He will probably be aided by the typical blind man's cane.
          They get into a car that is waiting for them. Judit instructs the
          driver to take them to Famara Beach, to the bungalow complex.

          A CLOUDY AND WINDY DAY.

          

          
          (This is a good opportunity to show some of the more dramatic
          landscapes of the island. The lava sea, black and twisted, and the
          rented car that crosses it through the highway that divides it. Or
          "La Geria" and its vine stalks buried in half-spheres of black dirt to
          protect them from the winds. The green palm tree fronds flop around
          against the backdrop of this black-dirt landscape.)

          

          
          Inside the car, Mateo asks Judit:

          

          

           MATEO
           Did you visit Lena's mother at her hometown?

           JUDIT
           Yes.

           MATEO
           What did she say?

           JUDIT
           She was very thankful to Ernesto for having taken care
           of everything...

           MATEO

          

          

           157

          
           That's it?

           JUDIT
           Yes, they buried her next to her father.

           MATEO
           Did you visit the grave?

           JUDIT
           Yes.

          

          
          Mateo nods in defeated acknowledgement.

          

          

          

          

          135. FAMARA BEACH. BUNGALOW COMPLEX. EXT. DAY. 1994.


          

          

          A CLOUDY AND WINDY DAY.

          

          
          The car stops in front of the bungalow that functions as the
          "Reception Desk" for the complex.
          Judit and little Diego exit. Judit helps Mateo out.
          Mateo remains glued to the ground. He can't move. Judit stares at
          him. Even though Mateo had renounced being Mateo, he has inherited
          his most painful memories. Being near the RECEPTION bungalow, and
          thus near the bungalow where he lived with Magdalena, generates some
          kind of spasm in him that keeps him from moving. He feels an intense
          heat (inside and outside of him), as if he were approaching a bonfire
          the flames of which would slowly scorch him, were he to move.
          (Perhaps we'll have to inlay the image with the flames of an imaginary
          conflagration). The face contorted.

          

          

           JUDIT
           What's wrong?

           MATEO

          

          

           158

          
           (Weakened) You go... I can't... I'll wait for you on the beach.

          

          
          The idea excites little Diego.

          

          

           DIEGUITO
           I also want to go to the beach!

          

          
          He approaches Mateo and instinctively grabs his hand. Judit watches
          the couple. The situation unfolds before she can stop it.

          

          

           MATEO
           Do whatever you need to do. We'll wait for you there.

          

          
          Judit is worried about the wind. She buttons Diego's jacket and wraps
          his scarf around him. She does the same thing with Mateo.

          

          

           JUDIT
           Bundle up! And don't get too close to the water. (To
           little Diego) Don't let go of his hand!

          

          
          Little Diego grabs Mateo's hand. Despite the wind, the boy is excited
          about the idea of going to the beach. He has just become Mateo's
          guide and Mateo lets him guide him, like a somnambulist.

          

          

          

          

          136. BUNGALOWS OFFICE. INT. DAY. 1994.


          

          
          In the offices of the complex, the two employees are in the middle of
          a brawl. (Consult with the original) In front of the desk, Judit
          addresses one of them, in English.

           We don't have anyone here registered by that name.

          

          
          Judit gestures that she doesn't understand.

          

          

           JUDIT
           It's the man who had the accident. He was in bungalow
           number two.

          

          

          

          

           EMPLOYEE
           Oh, you mean Harry Caine.

           JUDIT
           Yes, of course.

           EMPLOYEE
           Poor souls! They are not the first to have an
           accident on that traffic circle! Awful!

          

          

          

          

          137. FAMARA. ROUTE TO THE BEACH. NEXT TO THE BUNGALOWS. EXT.


          DAY. 1994.

          

          
          Mateo and little Diego walk only a few meters past bungalow number
          two, where he lived with Magdalena. At that moment they are walking
          facing the wind, a fierce wind that threatens to tear off their
          clothes. It is as if nature itself wanted to keep Mateo from walking
          away from the bungalow where he loved Lena. From this point on, his
          life will become just that, an endless battle against the elements and
          against the memory of Lena.

          

          

           160

          
          Little Diego's voice distracts him.

          

          

           DIEGUITO
           Look... There are kites!

          

          
          At times little Diego forgets that Mateo cannot see. So he points
          toward the sky of a nearby beach, whose surface is dotted by various
          kites.

          

          
          Mateo is grateful for the life-affirming sound of the boy's voice and
          so he allows himself to be towed.
          The wind's violent sweep over all the different elements that compose
          the landscape creates a symphony of strange sounds.

          

          

          

          
          138. BUNGALOW No.2. FAMARA. INT. AND EXT. DAY. 1994.

          

          
          Judit, using the key she was handed at the Reception Desk, opens the
          door to bungalow number two. She enters into what had been Mateo and
          Lena's love nest. She takes the entire space in with one glance; she
          is overtaken, as if she has entered an ancestral and sacred space.
          She imagines Mateo and Lena filling up the space with their presence.
          (A strange modesty comes over her, but her curiosity is greater).
          Lena's spirit (at least in Judit's mind) hangs in the air, but in the
          material surrounding her absence is absolute. Those who took her body
          did not leave any trace of Lena. Not a single object, not a single
          dress. Nothing. Ernesto Senior's cohorts (or Ernesto himself) took
          all of her things.

          

          
          Mateo's clothes and things are found piled up in a closet. Yet the
          table where he sat to write remains intact. On it, the photograph of

          

          

           161

          
          the embrace on Golfo Beach still rests, along with his notebook, blank
          pages and some envelopes.
          Judit observes the photograph on Golfo Beach as if it were alive,
          still palpitating. And she imagines that the two lovers, locked in an
          embrace, lost in the anonymous vastness of the black sand, are Mateo
          and Lena.

          

          
          She opens the desk's drawer and, much to her surprise, finds it
          overflowing with torn photographs of Mateo and Lena, shuffled in no
          particular order (one might say they had been thrown violently into
          the drawer. The violence of the hand that ripped and threw them has
          left its pulsating mark).
          Judit picks up all the pieces, slowly and delicately, and she places
          them inside a brown envelope that she finds next to Mateo's notebook.
          Her sense of guilt is so profound that it dries out her throat and the
          expression on her face.

          

          

          

          

          139. FAMARA BEACH. EXT. DAY. 1994.


          

          
          At the base of the complex, on one end of the beach, the car that
          brought them is waiting. Judit places the bags with Mateo's
          belongings, which she has just carried from the bungalow, inside the
          trunk. She raises her head, emotionally exhausted. From where she
          stands she can see little Diego, ecstatic, in front of a group of
          surfers wearing brilliant colors traversing the waves and a group of
          kites (around eight or ten) darting through the sky like flying fish.
          Mateo is motionless, in front of the sea, soaking up its strength.

          

          
          Judit's pain is at odds with the boy's joy and the overwhelming
          vitality that the place exudes at that very moment.

          

          

           162

          
          She begins to walk toward Mateo and little Diego. Once she is a few
          meters away, she observes a surfer riding a wave. In the foreground
          of her line of sight stands Mateo, out of focus. As he comes into
          focus, Judit yells out to him:

          

          

           JUDIT
           Harry! Harry Caine!

          

          
          It seems as though she is invoking the wind (a hurricane) which moves
          the waves along with the expert surfers riding them.
          When he hears Judit's voice, Mateo turns to face in her direction and

          RESPONDS:

          

          

           HARRY
           We're here, Judit! (And raises his hand like a child)

          

          
          Judit approaches them, petrified with emotion. The wind tears tears
          from her eyes.

          

          

           JUDIT
           We have to go, Harry.

           HARRY
           (To the boy) Let's go, Dieguito. Give me your hand.

           DIEGUITO
           (Protests, politely) Can't we stay a little longer?

           HARRY
           No. We must obey your mother... You've had enough wind
           for one day...

           DIEGUITO
           But I'm already all better!

          

          

          

          

           163

          
          Judit walks in front of the blind man and the boy, her eyes glitter.
          Mateo has responded to her call, and that has filled her with
          uncontrollable emotion. At this very moment she decides that she will
          dedicate her life exclusively to the care of this man. This is how it
          will be.

          

          

          

          

          140. HARRY'S HOME. INT. DAY. 2008.


          

          
          Diego is still sitting on the floor, next to the brown envelope. He
          sticks on the Braille title, "Famara. Lanzarote 94." In front of him,
          spread on the floor like a puzzle, lie the pieces of various embraces
          between Mateo and Lena (like archeological finds, like the Minoan
          paintings in Crete). The pieces begin to join with one another, an
          order is established and, soon, the better part of the picture is
          clear. There are four photographs where, regardless of the missing
          pieces, one can make out the image. Two are of embraces and the rest
          are of domestic scenes. The scratches on the four photographs reveal
          the passing of time.
          Neither of the two men speak. Mateo remains seated at his desk.
          Pensive.
          Cut to.

          They prepare to watch/hear a DVD. Diego goes over Harry's collection
          (even though one would imagine he knows it). On the spines, the
          titles are written in Braille. He has already asked him what he would

          

          

           164

          
          like to watch (he reads off some titles; in general, all the movies
          are made prior to '94, all classics).

          

          

           HARRY
           Play "Elevator to the Gallows" and take a look at the
           ending...

          

          
          While he looks for it...

          

          

           DIEGO
           Do you always watch the same movies?

           HARRY
           Yes. Since I know them by heart, I can visualize the
           action.

           DIEGO
           Is there any new movie you'd want to see...?

           HARRY
           Yes. But you'd have to describe the action. Your
           mother used to describe some to me, some time ago.

           DIEGO
           I wouldn't mind doing so.

           HARRY
           I would like to "watch" one by Tarantino or Scorsese,
           and also some Asian cinema...

           DIEGO
           Done.

          

          
          They pick a movie (chosen by Mateo). Diego hooks up the television,
          then inserts the DVD.

          Images of Mateo Blanco's last film, "Girls and Suitcases," appear on a
          random television station, it is the beginning of one of the sequences
          of which the spectator is already aware.
          For Harry it is all a shock, there is not doubt that it is his film.
          It is the sequence where Magdalena, wearing a cast, opens the door for
          her friend Chon.

          Pina limps toward the door. Through the peephole she sees her friend
          Chon, looking back with an exaggerated look of reproach:

          

          

           PINA
           What a drag! (she opens, not very welcoming) Oh, it's
           you?

          

          

          

          

          RETURN TO 142. IN HARRY'S LIVING ROOM. 2008.

          

          
          In front of the television, having heard only those two phrases, Harry
          jumps up as if propelled by springs.

          

          

           HARRY
           That's "Girls and Suitcases"!

          

          
          Diego observes him and then looks at the television.

          

          

           DIEGO

          

          

           166

          
           Yes.

           HARRY
           Turn up the volume!

          

          
          Sitting on the floor, next to the television, Diego turns up the
          volume.
          Harry focuses on the sounds from the screen and Diego on everything
          else.

          Chon enters. (They are supposed to be good friends). Chon has an
          endearing appearance, she is a little chubby, well dressed, according
          to her age (forty) and her profession, a Counselor for Social Affairs.
          Spontaneous and direct (she is kind of a Bette Midler in her forties),
          but the actress is lacking grace and her restlessness reveals more
          about her fear of running into the moving camera, than about the very
          funny way that the character inhabits her own anxiety. Lena is also
          quite languid, lacking spark, tired and unenthusiastic. (As a comedy,
          it's without charm and, as a drama, it's uninteresting, that's what
          the critics said).

          

          

           CHON
           (Reproachful) I've left you a thousand messages.

           PINA
           Yes. A thousand from you, and none from Ivan.

          

          
          As if Ivan's phone call depended on Chon.

          Harry twitches around in his chair, anxious and impatient. He doesn't
          like what he hears.

           (Sees the suitcase sitting in the middle of the loft.
           Looks at it as if it were some strange insect.) And
           this suitcase?

           PINA
           It's Ivan's. He's leaving me.

           CHON
           And the cast on your leg?

           PINA
           His ex-wife, the crazy one. She pushed me down the
           stairs and I broke my leg...

          

          
          All said without any spark. The actresses are reciting the text
          mechanically and they appear tired of interpreting it.

          

          

           CHON
           Wow! Well, we're in good shape... I also broke up with
           my husband...

          Diego and Harry are still staring at the television. Harry with his
          ear turned toward the screen, disappointed and tense. Diego is more
          indulgent of the scene.

          

          

           HARRY
           (Annoyed) They're terrible!

          

          
          Each of the men focus their respective senses on the television
          screen.

          

          

           HARRY
           How could I have thought these takes were the good
           ones! What was I thinking!

          

          
          With the same fury with which he had thrown down the newspaper with
          the bad review of his film onto the sand, he abruptly shuts off the
          television monitor.
          He remains suspended for a few moments, as if trying to find an
          explanation for what he has just heard. Was he so caught up in
          Magdalena's problems that he was unable to distinguish when a take was
          good or bad?

          

          
          Cut to.

          

          

          

          

          148. HARRY'S HOME. INT. DAY. 2008.


          

          
          The next morning, Harry wakes up early. He has spent an entire night
          thinking about the same thing. Dressed in a bathrobe, but not
          showered yet, he walks over to his desk.

          

          

          

          

           169

          
          All these scenes take place in the dark. A faint light from the
          breaking dawn enters through the corners of the drapes that cover the
          windows.
          He opens the drawer with the photographs. (When Diego had opened it
          before, we had been able to see that along with the photographs there
          were other objects, for example, Luis' notebook (the editor). Diego
          had not mentioned any of this to Harry). Harry pokes around in the
          drawer with his hands, finds the notebook.
          He grabs it. He opens it on top of his desk. He touches the
          different pages. The tips of his finger tips run over the numbers
          corresponding to the sequences, the shots, the selected takes,
          attempting to find a message.

          

          

          

          

          149. DIEGO'S ROOM. INT. DAY. 2008.


          

          
          Harry walks over to Diego's room with the notebook in hand. The boy
          is naked, drying himself with a towel after his shower.
          Harry asks permission to enter.

          

          

           HARRY
           May I come in?

           DIEGO
           (Drying himself) Yes, come in!

          

          
          Not giving him time to get dressed, Harry hands him the notebook.

          

          

           HARRY
           Luis, the editor, sent it to me six years ago. At
           that time I didn't even bother to open it, I didn't
           want to know anything about him. I am now thinking

          

          

           170

          
           that perhaps he had something to tell me. Would you
           mind seeing if beyond the takes and all of that there
           is something else written?

          

          
          Diego looks through it carefully. The last pages are empty. The rest
          only have the numbers pertaining to the sequences, the shots, and the
          selected takes, like we have seen in the sequence with the Moviola.
          Although, there is something written on the last page. "My new
          number: 91 6994079."

          

          

           DIEGO
           At the end he says this is my new number, a number's
           written down.

          

          
          Harry hands him his mobile phone.

          

          

           HARRY
           Call him, please!

           DIEGO
           Right now? It's too early.

           HARRY
           It doesn't matter.

          

          
          Diego dials the number and hands the phone to Harry.

          

          

           DIEGO
           May I get dressed? I'm naked...

           HARRY
           Oh, I'm sorry.

          

          
          He turns around and leaves.

          He exits the bedroom and heads for his dark den.

          

          

           HARRY
           (On the phone) Could I speak to Luis, please?

           WOMAN'S VOICE
           (Surprised) Luis died six years ago!

           HARRY
           Oh, I am so sorry... I had no idea!

           VOICE
           It was cancer. I'm his widow. Who are you?

           HARRY
           Mateo Blanco. Luis edited all my films...

           VOICE
           (More serene) Mateo Blanco! Luis spoke to me about
           you. I am his second wife...

           HARRY
           The one I know is Nieves, the first one.

           VOICE
           We married twelve years ago.

           HARRY
           (Sincere and sorrowful) I am sorry to hear about Luis'
           death. I would have liked to speak to him...

           VOICE
           He would have liked so too! Once he was quite ill and
           didn't want to speak to anyone, he would always tell
           me that, if it was you, I should hand him the phone...

          

          
          Harry keeps silent.

          

          

           172

          

           HARRY

          Cut to.

          Diego is in the kitchen. He is preparing breakfast, both for himself
          and Mateo.
          Harry, heavy-hearted, approaches the kitchen, pensive. A half-hearted
          "happy birthday" escapes Diego's lips. Harry doesn't react, perhaps
          he hasn't heard him. Noticing the look on his face Diego is not eager
          to insist.

          

          

           DIEGO
           What's going on?

           HARRY
           My editor. I just found out he died six years ago...

          

          
          Diego remains silent and lets Harry continue talking.

          

          

           HARRY
           Not long before he died he sent me this notebook. But
           I didn't want to know anything about him, I also
           didn't know he was dying... and I put it away... until
           today... His wife just told me he would have liked to
           speak to me, that was the purpose of sending me the
           notebook... but I didn't give him the chance.

           DIEGO
           Had you spoken since the accident?

           173

          

           HARRY
           No. Never.

          

          
          Diego places plates with toast and juice on the table. He serves
          Harry some coffee and adds sugar.

          

          

           DIEGO
           The coffee is in front of you...

          

          
          Harry finds the cup easily.

          

          

           DIEGO
           Are you OK? Would you like me to stay here?

           HARRY
           No, no... You're heading out?

           DIEGO
           My mother arrives today. I would like to be home when
           she arrives.

           HARRY
           I didn't know she was arriving...

           DIEGO
           I didn't either, she left me a message this morning.
           She's coming to celebrate your birthday, with us...

           HARRY
           It's my birthday?

           DIEGO
           It seems so. Today's the (he tells him the day), does
           that sound right?

           HARRY
           Yes. A day like today, fifty-one years ago, I entered the
           world.

           DIEGO

           174

          
           Happy birthday!

          

          

          

          

          152. JUDIT AND DIEGO'S HOME. INT. DAY. 2008.


          

          
          Judit returns from location scouting. She enters her house. She hugs
          her son, effusively.

          

          
          She drops a large suitcase, with wheels. (The sequence takes place in
          various rooms in the house. From the foyer she should move toward the
          bedroom or the kitchen, where she makes herself some tea, or where she
          opens bags full of food that she's brought, typical to the region
          she's just visited. (She looks inside the refrigerator and doesn't
          find anything). Things like that.

          

          

           JUDIT
           I was dying to see you! Are you OK, my son?

           DIEGO
           Yes.

           JUDIT
           I was very worried about you!

           DIEGO
           Mateo has looked after me day and night...

           JUDIT
           Mateo? You're not calling him Harry...?

          

          
          Diego had not realized.

          

          

           DIEGO
           Yes...

           JUDIT

          

          

           175

          
           Today's his birthday, we must get him something... What
           have you been up to all this time?

           DIEGO
           Nothing... Watching movies... and talking...

           JUDIT
           (As if it were something strange) Talking?

           DIEGO
           Yes...

           JUDIT
           What about?

           DIEGO
           Mom, please!

          

          
          Judit looks at her son. She finds him different. As if all the
          confidences shared with Harry had left a physical and visible mark on
          him. Diego seems to guess what his mother is thinking.

          

          

           JUDIT
           OK. So what happened to you? (Sort of joking) I
           don't know if I should believe the thing about the
           stomach flu, you two used that as an excuse in a
           script...

           DIEGO
           (Elusive) (I suffered) ... an accident. But I would
           rather not speak of that right now...

           JUDIT
           (Irritated, by the surprise) What kind of accident?

           DIEGO
           It's hard to explain.

           JUDIT
           (Orders him, annoyed) Try to! I am not that stupid!

           DIEGO

           176

          
           Let's leave it for another time, yes? I am all well now.

          

          
          Judit gets the sense that she can no longer speak to her son in the
          same way that she could before she left on her trip. Those two weeks
          have irreversibly changed him.

          

          

           JUDIT
           What's wrong with you, Diego?

           DIEGO
           Nothing. I'm doing just fine. I'm going to buy a
           present for Mateo.

           JUDIT
           (Repeats) For Mateo...

           DIEGO
           Alright, Harry.

          

          
          (Offended, she doesn't want her son to think she is a drag, so she
          makes an effort not to bombard him with questions)

          

          

           JUDIT
           Call him however you wish. That's the advantage of
           having two names.

          

          
          Diego disappears and leaves her in mid-sentence.
          (Is this his way of avenging himself? Perhaps his reaction is unfair,
          but he cannot stand to stay there with his mother, answering thousands
          of questions regarding an "accident" when there has been another
          "accident" that he is much more intrigued by and that she has kept
          silent for fourteen years.)

          

          

          

          

          153. MATEO-HARRY'S HOME. INT. DAY. 2008.


           177

          
          (The maid may be around)

          

          
          Mateo goes to open the door. Judit has the key in one hand and a huge
          flower bouquet in the other. They greet each other enthusiastically.
          Mateo-Harry attempts to hug her but his arms collide with the flowers.

          

          

           JUDIT
           Wait, my arms are full...

           MATEO
           Are those flowers?

           JUDIT
           Yes! Happy Birthday!

          

          
          Cut to.

          

          

          

          

          154. MATEO-HARRY'S HOME. INT. DAY. 2008.


          

          
          Mateo and Judit talk, they are sitting on a sofa, the conversation is
          already mid-way.

          

          

           JUDIT
           Thank you for looking after Diego... I don't know how to thank
           you!

           MATEO
           You've been looking after me for fourteen years now...

          

          
          Judit brushes his acknowledgement off, with a half-smile.

          

          

           JUDIT

          

          

           178

          
           I've found him somewhat hostile. He left without
           telling me what it was that happened... Will you tell
           me?

           MATEO
           I don't know. It should be your son to tell you.

          

          
          Judit is upset by both of their evasiveness.

          

          

           JUDIT
           What is wrong with the two of you? Why is it that he
           suddenly is not calling you Harry but Mateo?

           MATEO
           (He evades the first question, but responds to the
           second one.) Two weeks ago, at the place where he
           D.J.'s, by mistake, he grabbed a friend's drink that
           had been spiked with G.H.B., liquid ecstasy. He
           thought it was his drink, both drinks had Coca-cola.

           JUDIT
           Liquid ecstasy?

           MATEO
           Yes. It's a very dangerous drug when it's mixed with
           alcohol and Diego had already had two Cuba Libres
           before he drank from his friend's glass...

           JUDIT
           And... what happened... exactly?

           MATEO
           (Being vague.) He was badly affected. He spent two
           days in urgent care, after that, I brought him here.

          

          
          Judit looks at him, horrified. She can't seem to comprehend such a
          turbulent and simple story.

          

          

           179

          

           JUDIT
           Diego's a drug addict?

           MATEO
           No. I've told you, he drank from the glass containing
           liquid ecstasy by mistake...

           JUDIT
           But how can one make a mistake with something like
           that?

           MATEO
           At first glace one cannot tell the difference. Both
           glasses contained Coca-cola... It's not the first time
           it happens...

          

          
          Judit sighs, defenseless and horrified.

          

          

           MATEO
           Diego has not told you so that you wouldn't be alarmed...

           JUDIT
           (That I wouldn't be alarmed?!) Well, he hasn't
           succeeded. At some point he will have to speak to me,
           no?

           MATEO
           He is wanting to do so!

          

          
          Judit takes a cigarette out of its box and lights it.

          

          

           JUDIT
           Is that so? Because I ask him and he doesn't answer!

           MATEO
           Then you should try answering him, when he asks you.

          

          

          

          

           180

          
          Judit smokes in silence, she is curious to know what Mateo and Diego
          have been talking about in her absence, but she doesn't dare ask
          Mateo.

          

          

           JUDIT
           The two of you are acting very differently. Both of
           you. You both have changed.

          

          
          She laments it, as if she had been put aside and they had not taken
          her into account.

          

          
          Cut to.

          

          

          

          

          155. "NO VIEWS" RESTAURANT. INT. NIGHT. 2008.


          

          

          AT THE BAR BEFORE ONE ENTERS THE RESTAURANT.
          Judit and Mateo are having something to drink. Mateo tilts his head
          subtly in front of Judit.

          

          

           MATEO
           You smell good...

           JUDIT
           (Insecure) I have put on some makeup and I am dressed
           as a woman.

           MATEO
           What's the dress like?

          

          
          Judit describes it, with few words and almost shyly.

          

          

           MATEO

          

          

           181

          
           And the hair? How are you wearing your hair? It's
           been so long since I've asked you that I don't even
           know whether it's long or short.

          

          
          The fact that Mateo betrays that type of interest flatters and
          disconcerts her.

          

          

           JUDIT
           I haven't changed much, Harry. I am wearing my hair short.

           MATEO
           Short like Jean Seberg in "Breathless"? Like Joan of
           Arc on the bonfire? Like Liza Minnelli in "Cabaret"?
           Or like Yul Brynner?

           JUDIT
           Short, or rather, very short, like that of all
           fortysomethings who want to appear younger.

           MATEO
           I am sure it looks good on you. Thanks for dressing up
           for me, Judit...

          

          
          Diego looks at them, amused. He hands Mateo three DVDs (Scorsese's
          "Goodfellas" (or the Coen Brother's "Fargo"), Tarantino's "Kill Bill,"
          and Kiarostami's "Taste of Cherry").
          Near them, on the bar table, two couples talk excitedly as if they
          were about to go on a ride at an Amusement Park.

          

          
          The barman tells them they may now enter.

          

          

          

          

          156. "NO VIEWS" RESTAURANT. INT. NIGHT. 2008.


          

          

          

          

           182

          
          Once they've crossed the doorway, a man signals them to follow him.
          He's a blind man that, like Mateo, moves smoothly, he knows the place
          by heart.
          The restaurant is completely shrouded in darkness, all the waiters,
          men and women, are blind. The one in charge of Mateo, Diego, and
          Judit introduces himself:

          

          

           JAVIER
           My name is Javier. How many are you?

           MATEO
           Three.

          

          
          There is not a single light inside. The following sequences take
          place in absolute darkness.

          

          

           JAVIER
           Please, grab onto each other's shoulders and follow me
           in Indian-file. I will guide you to your table. It's
           number eight.

           JUDIT
           What is the idea here, Harry?

           MATEO
           We are dinning in darkness.

           JAVIER
           You didn't know this, ma'am?

           JUDIT
           (Anxious, feeling slightly ridiculed) No...

           JAVIER
           You should have been warned, but don't worry. People
           get used to it after a few minutes.

          

          

          

          

           183

          

          157. "NO VIEWS" RESTAURANT. INT. NIGHT. 2008.


          

          
          They have arrived to their table, as signaled by the waiter. Table
          number eight. He tells them where to sit.

          

          

           JAVIER
           Imagine that your plate is the face of a watch. Your
           silverware is at 9h and at 3h. Your glass at 1h.
           Bread at 11h.

          

          
          Each of them reaches for the objects as indicated by the waiter around
          an imaginary clock.

          

          
          Judit still believes this is some kind of joke and that the lights
          will come on at any moment and that something spectacular will appear
          before her eyes.
          If she had been able to see, she would have been witness to the very
          interesting scenes surrounding her. Two couples kissing, with bestial
          enjoyment. And a well-bred woman performing fellatio on the man
          sitting next to her. No one sees them except our camera.

          

          

           JUDIT
           Harry, what is all this about?

          

          
          The waiter responds.

          

          

           JAVIER
           We want our clients to discover that the lack of sight
           harnesses the other senses. Touch, taste, smell and
           sound will acquire a special intensity tonight, ma'am.
           I hope you'll enjoy them.

          

          

           184

          
          Judit says nothing. She hides her nervousness in order not to ruin
          Mateo's night, he seems fascinated with the place and completely
          unaware of the process she is now living: the discovery of absolute
          darkness. A bottomless pit.

          

          

           JAVIER
           Will the gentlemen be drinking something?

           MATEO
           Bring us a bottle of wine, to toast.

          

          
          The waiter leaves them.
          Slowly, Judit begins to walk the plank that will plunge her into
          anxiety. The evening feels far from a party, but she doesn't want to
          spoil it for either Mateo or Diego. She hears Mateo explaining to

          HIM:

          

          

           MATEO
           I found out about this place in the newspaper and I
           wanted to check it out.

           DIEGO
           It's a German idea, there are various restaurant like
           this one, they're totally in fashion.

           JUDIT
           (Can't believe what she's hearing.) Darkness, in
           fashion? I don't understand.

          

          
          Silence. Judit pours herself some water and drinks. And she gets
          depressed, in silence.
          She lights a cigarette.

          158. "NO VIEWS" RESTAURANT. AT THE TABLE. INT. NIGHT. 2008.


          

          
          Javier, the waiter, arrives with the wine. He tells Judit she can't
          smoke. She puts out the cigarette. (On the floor?)
          To enliven the occasion, Diego proposes a toast.

          

          

           DIEGO
           Let's toast!

           JUDIT
           Yes. Let's toast.

          

          
          Mateo pours the glasses. They each grab one. Clumsily, they bring
          them close until they can her the sound of the crystal clinking.

          

          

           DIEGO
           Happy Birthday!

           JUDIT
           Happy Birthday! We must look into each other's eyes.
           (She has already said it and it's too late when she
           thinks of retracting it.)

           DIEGO
           Well, we're kind of screwed...

           JUDIT
           Oh, sorry... It slipped.

          

          
          They attempt to clink glasses. It is not such an easy task. The
          three glasses head for each other in the darkness, it would have been
          easiest to have all three meet at the center, but instead each opts to
          find the other. Only Mateo puts his forward and leaves it in place,
          waiting for the other two to find his. When this happens, Judit's
          glass collides with too much force, breaks his glass and wine spills

          

          

           186

          
          all over the table cloth. Mateo attempts to make light of the
          situation, as if nothing had happened. He presses his fingers into
          the wine that has spilled on the tablecloth and exclaims:

          

          

           MATEO
           Joy! Joy! (to Judit) Bring your ear to me so that I
           can sprinkle some wine behind it. It's for good luck!

          

          
          Judit attempts to heed his request, she leans forward, offering her
          head, parallel to the table. Mateo can't quite find her ear. Judit
          collapses. Her head topples onto the table, without strength, and she
          bursts into tears.
          Cut to.

          

          

          

          

          159. "THE MIRROR" TERRACE. INT. EXT. NIGHT. 2008.


          

          
          Show both terraces, the exterior one and the glass-enclosed one. The
          sequence begins once all three of them (Judit, Diego and Harry) are
          seated and drinking. Judit's emotional state has not improved. The
          short sequence of events that she's had to live through since her
          arrival have been making her increasingly tense and worried. She is
          trying to combat the letdown by way of gin-and-tonic.

          

          
          (They are sitting on one extreme of the ellipsis that makes up the
          glass-enclosed terrace, decorated with cheesy Decó motifs).
          At the center, where the bar is located, two or three waiters prepare
          to clean up the tables. Once in a while, they look over at the only
          three remaining clients. Once in a while, they are also able to catch
          Judit's words. And once in a while, the waiters function as the

          

          

          

          

           187

          
          audience, witnessing a theatrical production. Although on this
          occasion, the setting is real and so is the drama.
          Judit sips-down the gin-and-tonic quite rapidly. Mateo and Diego
          accompany her.

          

          
          Cut to.

          

          

          

          

          160. CONTINUED. MIRROR TERRACE. INT. NIGHT.


          

          

           JUDIT
           I don't know what you've been talking about these past
           days...

          

          
          A topic which they have waited to broach since she arrived from her
          trip.
          Neither of the two men respond, but they are both made uncomfortable
          by the comment.

          

          

           JUDIT
           But I do know what I haven't talked to you about all
           these years...

          

          
          Mateo directs his face toward her, surprised and polite.

          

          

           MATEO
           I've never asked you...

           JUDIT
           But you must have asked yourself a thousand times.
           This is my birthday gift, Mateo. (To Diego) The gift
           is also for you, Diego.

          

          

           188

          
          She takes another sip to draw courage, but she's already gathered
          enough momentum:

          

          

           JUDIT
           (To Mateo) After you disappeared, Ernesto Senior
           thought only of his revenge. A plan had occurred to
           him but, to carry it out, he had to bribe, at the very
           least, both Luis and me. It wasn't an issue, we both
           sold ourselves without hesitation. Luis and I. With
           me, he had the courtesy to provide an alibi, he
           proposed that I leave for a month and a half to the
           United States, to the Mayo Clinic, so that Diego could
           undergo a cure for his aspergillosis, that way I
           wouldn't have to be present while he destroyed the
           movie (because that was his plan, to make a mess out
           of the film). I opted to stay in Madrid and have
           Diego undergo his cure here. I wanted to witness
           everything. If I was going to betray you, I wanted to
           pay the full price...

           MATEO
           What a living hell! For both of you!

           DIEGO
           You said it!

          

          
          She takes a deep breath and continues:

          

          

           JUDIT
           Yes. It was torture to watch Ernesto select the worst
           takes of each shot and Luis edit them together, turning
           your film into a monster (briefly tears?). The only
           way of withstanding that was to suffer more.

           189

          
           (Overcome) I sold myself to Ernesto because of my pain
           and jealousy. I couldn't take it and I couldn't (then)
           forgive you for having abandoned Cinearte with Lena
           without saying a word! My betrayal was my revenge
           against you, against her and against myself... The only
           innocent one was Diego... (To Diego) Forgive me, my
           son, for the bitterness that you've had to absorb all
           these years... no one deserves to grow up like this...

          

          

          

          

          161. CONTINUED. MIRROR TERRACE. INT. NIGHT.


          

          
          Judit rises. She approaches the bar table. She orders another gin-
          and-tonic. The waiter doesn't dare to tell her they've already
          closed, so he serves her.
          With the glass in her hand, Judit returns to the table where Mateo and
          Diego wait, expectantly.
          She has observed them whispering, but she hasn't heard what they have
          said. She sits down with them.
          Judit takes a sip.

          

          

           MATEO
           (Interrupts her) Don't continue, Judit! It's not necessary.

           JUDIT
           Yes. Now that you once again call yourself Mateo, I
           have no excuse.

          

          
          Judit takes a sip from her drink, to gather her strength.

          

          

           JUDIT

          

          

          

          

           190

          
           No one knew where you were. We had no idea. Ernesto
           Senior put everything together, the premier, all that
           ruckus, to see if you'd react. His revenge was
           pointless if neither of you found out about it.
           (Pauses) Ernesto asked me constantly if I knew where
           you were, but I said that I also didn't know anything,
           which was true.

           MATEO
           (Somber) That's why I never called you, but even if
           you don't believe it, I was very worried for you and
           the boy.

           JUDIT
           I believe you...

          

          
          Diego attempts to say that he, too, believes him, but Judit doesn't
          give him time.

          

          

           JUDIT
           Ernesto hired various detectives to search for you, but
           before they found you, you called me, two days after
           the premier. (Slowly, debilitated.) I was too
           embarrassed to answer, and... too stunned. I still am.
           When Ernesto Senior asked me again about you, I don't
           know why, I gave him the phone number for Famara...

          

          
          Mateo and Diego listen to her, with renewed attention. This new
          information reveals an unexpected possibility, something that neither
          of the two men had considered. Their reaction toward Judit's painful
          declaration changes in character. In Mateo's case, his compassion
          vanishes and is replaced by doubt, now incited by new suspicions.

          

          

           JUDIT

           191

          
           Ernesto sent his son to find you in Lanzarote.

          

          
          (Images of Ernesto Junior, inside a rented car, following the couple
          across various places on the island, including the highway that leads
          to Famara, on that last night.)

          

          

           JUDIT
           He was the one who found you after the accident and
           called the hospital...

           DIEGO
           Did he have something to do with the accident?

           JUDIT
           No! But I can't stop thinking that had I not given his
           father the phone number, perhaps nothing would have
           happened...

           MATEO
           (Dryly) Why do you think that?

           JUDIT
           I don't know...

           MATEO
           (Categorically) If you don't know, then stop torturing
           yourself.

          

          
          He says this with spite and somewhat disparagingly. For Judit it's
          like a splash of cold water to the face.

          

          
          The confession, rather than ending as a liberating catharsis, has
          devolved in its opposite. The silence is weighed down by suspicion
          and the new abyss between Mateo and Judit.
          Never before has Judit felt Mateo this distant and antagonistic. Her
          dramatic confession, far from liberating her, has opened new wounds

          

          

           192

          
          and generated new suspicions. And Judit feels taken over by an arid
          anxiety, corrosive, unbearable. She almost can't breathe.
          Cut to.

          

          

          

          

          162. CASTELLANA STREET. EXT. NIGHT. 2008.


          

          
          Judit, Mateo and Diego are inside Judit's car. Diego is driving. The
          three are tense and silent.

          

          

          

          

          163. MATEO'S BUILDING. EXT. INT. NIGHT. 2008.


          

          
          In silence, they arrive at the entrance of the building where Mateo
          lives. (Mateo is possibly carrying his umbrella or a blind man's
          cane). He exits the car. Judit walks him to the front door. She is
          glad that Mateo can't see her look of embarrassment.

          

          

           MATEO
           Good night.

           JUDIT
           (Destroyed) Good night. Call me if you need anything...

          

          
          Mateo doesn't respond. When the entrance door shuts like a resounding
          "no."
          Judit waits until she sees him disappear into the elevator.

           193

          
          From Judit's point of view, Mateo disappears into the elevator, which
          soon begins to rise.

          

          

          

          

          165. STREET. IN FRONT OF THE ENTRANCE TO MATEO'S BUILDING.

          EXT. NIGHT. 2008.


          

          
          Undone, and she no longer pretends otherwise, Judit returns to the
          car.
          Before she opens the door she bends over and retches violently.
          Diego gets out of the car and holds her by the waist. He attempts to
          help her.
          Judit's face is contorted. She wipes a thread of saliva still hanging
          from her lips. Despite the retching, she has not vomited anything
          other than liquid.

          

          

           DIEGO
           (Touching her forehead) You are sweating...

           JUDIT
           It's a panic attack... (Takes a deep breath, as if she
           had lost her wind) Hand me the purse!

          

          
          Diego finds the purse in the car and hands it to her immediately.
          Judit searches through the purse, impatiently. She takes the purse
          and drops all of its contents on the sidewalk. She find a box of
          tranquilizers. The pill she presses through the aluminum seal comes
          out with a pop; she places it on her tongue. She leans over the car.
          Diego looks at her, scared, he has never seen her like this.
          Articulating poorly, so as to not move her tongue, Judit say to him:

          

          

           JUDIT

          

          

           194

          
           This will pass soon...

          Diego hands her a glass of water. Once in bed, Judit takes two
          sleeping pills. She has overcome the crisis.
          Diego looks at her, very concerned. His mother has never shown
          herself to be so physically fragile. He wants to help her, but it
          doesn't seem like there is anything more he can do than what he
          already has.
          Judit attempts to smile in order to calm him.

          

          

           JUDIT
           I will sleep well with this...

           DIEGO
           Do you want me to stay here?

           JUDIT
           (Surprised) Here? What for?

           DIEGO
           In case the panic returns, so that you don't feel alone.

          

          
          Judit eyes swell with tears.

          

          

           JUDIT
           Thank you. I am feeling better... and I'll fall asleep
           soon.

           DIEGO
           Call me, if you are not feeling well...

          

          

          

          

           195

          
          He kisses her twice and exits. The curtains that cover a large window
          that looks out into an interior terrace are made from the same
          material as those that Mateo has in his bedroom.

          The next day.
          Standing over his desk, Mateo searches the desk drawer under the
          computer. It's open. There are not many things inside (credit cards,
          envelopes with money, a jump drive, the MP3, etc.), he goes through it
          meticulously until he finds the note that Ray X had left him the day
          he came to ask him if they could write a script together. Ray X has
          hand-written his own telephone number on the note. He goes over it
          with his fingertips, as if he could see through them.

          

          
          He dials a familiar number, Diego's.

          Diego's mobile phone vibrates four or five times. But Diego is
          sleeping and he doesn't wake up. The mobile phone stops vibrating.
          In all the scenes where Mateo is alone at home, he never turns on the
          light. He will be in the dark, lightly illuminated by any light that
          the cracks in the windows let through.

          

          

          

          

          RETURN TO 168.

          

          

          

          

           196

          
          Mateo leaves him a message: "I am sorry to call you so early. Tell
          your mother to call me as soon as she can."

          As usual, Mateo buys his newspaper at the same news-agent. He turns
          his body toward the Modeling Agency, but no one there enters or exits
          whose odor or whose clacking heels rings familiar.
          There are a few people on the sidewalk and those he crosses are all
          heading, like zombies, to work.

          He enters the bar where his Waiter Friend works. The place has just
          opened. There are very few clients.
          He greets him.

          

          

           WAITER FRIEND
           Why here so early?

           MATEO
           I couldn't sleep. Would you mind dialing this number?

          

          
          He hands him the phone and the piece of paper where Ray X's number is
          written.

          

          

          

          

          172. KITCHEN, JUDIT'S HOME. INT. DAY. 2008.


          

          

          

          

           197

          
          Diego is meticulously preparing breakfast for himself and Judit. He
          works hard to ensure that they both start their day with the help of a
          generous and varied breakfast, toast, juice, coffee and tea,
          marmalade, toasted bread spread with oil and tomato, etc..
          Judit appears through one of the kitchen doors, calm, with a look of
          having rested (but also with the hangover of having survived a
          nightmarish day, the day before). Diego does not hear her approach.
          The mother takes advantage of this to observe her son with a tender
          smile. When Diego turns to look, the tenderness disappears a little,
          more out of modesty and a lack of habit. In any case, Judit enjoys
          the peacefulness of the moment: her son caring for her after the
          storm.
          Judit looks over the culinary display.

          

          

           JUDIT
           How impressive!

           DIEGO
           I am specializing in breakfasts. I would do the same
           for Mateo...

          

          
          Judit's expression changes, now a bit more somber.

          

          

           DIEGO
           Are you OK?

           JUDIT
           Yes, (still a bit beaten down) don't worry about last
           night. It's horrible, but it only happens occasionally
           and I know how to stop it...

           DIEGO
           It scared me, it seemed as though an alien would pop
           out of your stomach.

           JUDIT

           198

          
           It's not a bad way of describing a panic attack...
           (Changing the topic, one can tell she's made the
           decision before she arrived in the kitchen). Diego,
           there was one last thing I didn't tell you yesterday.

          

          
          Assuming it will be painful, he attempts to dissuade her:

          

          

           DIEGO
           About Mateo?

           JUDIT
           Yes.

           DIEGO
           You can tell me some other time. Now it's time for breakfast.

           JUDIT
           If I don't tell you now, I may never do so... At the end
           of the eighties, in `77, to be exact.

           DIEGO
           The year of punk.

           JUDIT
           Yes, in the year of punk, Mateo and I became involved...

           DIEGO
           In a love affair?

           JUDIT
           Yes... We were just getting started in film, and we are
           still at it, but our love affair ended, at least on his
           side... That didn't keep us from working together...
           until now...

           DIEGO
           I knew all that, or I imagined it...

           JUDIT
           There's one more thing... Mateo is your father...

          

          

           199

          
          Diego looks at her, astonished.

          

          

           DIEGO
           And that fleeting lover, my supposed biological
           father? You made him up?

           JUDIT
           No... I... can hide things... but I never make things up...
           I don't know how to make up... The fleeting lover
           existed, he was gay and our affair was short-lived.
           His name was Vicente and it was while I was with him
           that you were conceived, but your biological father
           was Mateo, not Vicente.

          

          
          Still thinking about what he has just heard, Diego places the
          breakfast on the main kitchen table and serves his mother a cup of
          tea. Judit begins to drink it, one tiny sip at a time.

          

          

           DIEGO
           (Assimilates the news. He is not displeased) Does
           Mateo know?

           JUDIT
           No. At that time, he asked me and I denied it, of
           course. I didn't want to put pressure on him, I
           didn't want our relationship to change because of it.
           After all, I had never asked him if he wanted to
           become a father.

          

          
          The pieces begin to fall together.

          

          

           DIEGO
           I see...

           JUDIT

           200

          
           If you think I made a mistake, don't tell me now. We
           have the rest of our lives for recriminations.

          

          
          Diego remains pensive for a moment.

          

          

           DIEGO
           I will not recriminate you... I think I like being
           Mateo's son (the son of a bitch) ... Speaking of, he
           called early this morning...

           JUDIT
           Who?

           DIEGO
           Mateo. At 8h.

          

          
          She looks at the clock and it's 11h.

          

          

           JUDIT
           What did he want?

           DIEGO
           For you to call him as soon as you could.

           JUDIT
           (Surprised, tense) That I call him? Why in the world
           have you not awakened me?!

           DIEGO
           Because, after what happened last night, you needed to
           sleep. He didn't say it was urgent. You can call him
           now.

          

          
          Judit grabs her son's phone, agitated once again, and dials Mateo's
          number.

          173. ALTERNATING BETWEEN JUDIT'S HOME. INT. DAY. 2008.


          174. PUERTA DE HIERRO MANSION. ERNESTO JUNIOR'S STUDY. INT.


          DAY. 2008.

          

          
          In the beginning the shot is close up and so we are not aware of where
          he is. All one can see is a bit of a curtain, out of focus.

          

          
          Phone conversation.

          

          

           JUDIT
           (Attempts to appear calm, since her confession her
           voice has a less authoritarian edge and is weaker)
           Diego has told me to call you. Are you OK? Do you need
           anything? (This is what she's most worried about.)

           MATEO
           (Almost with irony) I am not alright, Judit. And yes,
           I do need something... The forty thousand meters of
           negative we shot during my last film in order to edit
           it... I am at the home of Ernesto Junior and I just
           found out the material was destroyed in '94. I
           imagined something like this, I just didn't think it
           would have happened that soon...

           JUDIT
           (With urgency) Let me explain...

           MATEO
           (Cuts her off) No. I am in a hideous mood, Judit,
           and I don't want to take it out on you!

           JUDIT
           (Surprised and alarmed) What are you doing at
           Ernesto's house?

          

          

          

          

           202

          
          The shot opens up, and we discover Ernesto Junior at the other end of
          the room, next to a 16mm camera (on a tripod) recording everything
          that Mateo says and does, while he searches around in some drawers.

          

          

           MATEO
           I think I am going to bribe him. We need money, I
           don't want Diego back at that damn bar. I want to pay
           Diego a salary, we need money and he has money to
           throw...

          

          

          

          

          175. PUERTA DE HIERRO MANSION. ERNESTO'S STUDY. INT. DAY. 2008.


          

          
          The studio has a different configuration than when his father lived,
          but we recognize the place nonetheless; when the father was alive the
          space served a different purpose.
          Ernesto looks at Mateo fearlessly, he is still determined to search,
          urgently, for something inside the drawers of a chest. The place is a
          pretty big mess.

          

          

           JUDIT
           Mateo, stop talking crazy!

           MATEO
           It is not craziness. I can't think of anyone else to
           blame for Magdalena's death.

           JUDIT
           My God! (She asks Diego to bring her the box of
           tranquilizers.) Wait a second... I have something to
           tell you.

           MATEO
           Let it be, you already said enough last night.

           JUDIT

           203

          
           (She takes a pill and yells at him) Listen to me,
           Mateo! (As she raises her voice, she becomes
           dominant.) I was the production director, if you want
           to know anything about the footage, ask me!

           MATEO
           Since you insist, I will ask you. What do you have to
           tell me?

           JUDIT
           In effect, Ernesto Senior asked for it to be
           destroyed.

           MATEO
           In '94! Very shortly after the release of that
           aberration.

           JUDIT
           Yes. In any case, sooner or later the lab disposes of
           all the material... and that was many years ago.

           MATEO
           That's not anything that I don't already know.

           JUDIT
           As the film's producer I was the only one who had
           access to the lab... to all the material. After I gave
           the order to have everything destroyed, I intercepted
           it. And I kept it. I have all of it at home.

           MATEO
           You are lying to me.

           JUDIT
           I didn't tell you this last night because I didn't
           realize you wanted to edit it. I took everything, all
           the double takes, the internegative, the sound tapes...
           Everything! You can have it whenever you want!

          

          
          The silence on the other end of the line reassures her.

           204

          

           MATEO
           That changes everything.

           JUDIT
           (Begs) Please, get out of that place, leave Ernesto
           alone. He had nothing to do with this.

          

          
          Mateo looks over at Ernesto Junior. The camera is still on its
          tripod, rolling.

          

          

           MATEO
           I am not so sure. He has yet to explain what he was
           doing in Lanzarote. I'll let you go, it seems he
           wants to talk... (Hangs up)

          

          
          Ernesto, finally, finds a DVD. He has it in his hand and brings it
          toward Mateo. (His hand enters into view on the screen of the 16mm
          camera).

          

          

           ERNESTO J.
           Here is a copy of "the making of".

           MATEO
           And why would I want that? I can't watch it! Plus,
           I'm not interested.

          

          
          Ernesto takes his hand and places the DVD softly onto it.

          

          

           ERNESTO J.
           Have someone you trust watch it and tell you about it.
           (This DVD proves that I wasn't responsible for the
           accident.) Oh, and even if my father had asked me to

          

          

           205

          
           harm you, I never would have... You are very important
           to me, Mateo...

          

          
          Ernesto speaks naturally, for the first time, Mateo takes him
          seriously.

          

          

          

          

          176. MATEO-HARRY HOME. INT. DAY. 2008


          

          
          Diego is watching the images of "the making of", while Mateo works out
          on his treadmill.
          At the last moment, an instant prior to being struck by the SUV, Mateo
          and Lena kiss inside the car. They are then distracted by a noise
          from the car that is about to hit them. These images have been
          recorded from inside a different car, which has been following them
          from behind, at a safe distance (Ernesto Junior's car).
          Mateo reaches the living room from the other end of the house,
          dripping with sweat.
          Diego has just watched the kiss and the accident. He rewinds and he
          pauses right at the moment when Mateo's and Lena's kiss fills the
          whole screen.

          

          

           MATEO
           Is there something new I should know about?

           DIEGO
           (Surprised and moved) It's a very interesting
           documentary... And, yes, in effect, Ernesto followed
           you to Lanzarote, until the last moment.

           MATEO
           The images are there?

           DIEGO

          

          

           206

          
           Yes.

           MATEO
           Those of the last night?

          

          
          They take a look at the images that Ernesto taped at "El Mirador" from
          the outside. Through the glass of the large window we see Lena and
          Mateo talking.

          

          

           DIEGO
           Yes. He recorded you at a safe distance, while you
           were on you way back after dinner. The scene is lit
           by the light of his headlights. It's not a lot, but
           enough to see what happened. Not only did he not have
           anything to do with the accident, he saved your life.

          

          
          Mateo watches the screen of the television without being able to see
          it, taking in the information Diego gives him.

          

          

           DIEGO
           And one more e thing: When you were at the traffic
           circle, before the SUV crashed into to you, you and
           Lena kiss...

           MATEO
           A kiss? I don't remember it...

           DIEGO
           It was an ordinary kiss, just one more of the many
           kisses a couple gives each other, almost without
           thinking...

           MATEO
           (Pensive) The last kiss...

           DIEGO

          

          

           207

          
           Yes. Even if it sounds cheesy, someone has to tell
           you: Lena did not die in your arms, as you dreamed,
           but the last sensation she experienced in this world
           was the taste of your mouth...

          

          
          Mateo watches without seeing the television, he gets close to the
          screen. With his fingertips, he caresses the surface, literally
          touching Lena's last kiss.
          Shots of Mateo's hand caressing the screen, with the image of the
          kiss. Shot of Diego observing the entirety of the scene, moved. A
          shot of everything. The appropriate kind of music accompanies the
          scene as it begins to fade out, bit by bit, while a sign appears:

          EPILOGUE.

          

          

          

          

          177. ON THE AVID. INT. 2008


          

          
          Luis' notebook, open on given sequences, as if Luis were present on
          this last moment of the definitive editing. An ashtray with a lit
          cigarette. The hands of the editor powering the Avid, directing the
          mouse through all the necessary steps until the screen fills with a
          block of sequences of "Girls and Suitcases," in Pina's loft.

          

          
          The images fill the entire screen of the main narration. It begins
          with the same sequence Diego and Mateo watched on television.
          Everything is the same, but it plays completely differently. The
          actresses are funny and fresh. The spectator does not know what the
          difference is, but, unconsciously, he must feel enthralled by the
          sequences of Pina and Chon, as if spellbound.

          HALL. INT. 2008


          

          
          Pina limps (fed up) toward the door. Looks through the peephole,
          behind it, Chon. They are good friends, but Chon is the last person
          Pina wants to see right now.

          

          

           PINA
           (Whispers.) What a drag! (She opens, not the least
           bit welcoming.) Oh, it's you?

           CHON
           (Anxious, reproachful.) I have left you a thousand
           messages!

           PINA
           Yes. A thousand from you and none from Ivan.

           CHON
           (Looks at the suitcase as if it were a menacing,
           strange bug.) What about this suitcase!

           PINA
           It's Ivan's. He's leaving me.

          

          
          She notices that Pina is wearing a cast on her leg.

          

          

           CHON
           And that cast on your leg?

           PINA
           His ex-wife, the crazy one. She pushed me down the
           stairs...

           CHON
           Well, we're in good shape! I've also broken up with
           my husband...

          

          

           209

          

           PINA
           Oh, sorry to hear it! I will make some coffee, I have
           spent my entire night looking for Ivan and I haven't
           gone to bed.

           CHON
           Neither have I.

          

          
          On her way to the kitchen Chon notices, through the bedroom door, that
          the bed has been burnt. She bumps into the phone that has been ripped
          out of its socket, now on the floor. She says nothing, she doesn't
          want to pry, but she thinks that Pina's situation must be more
          complicated than hers.

          

          

          

          

          179. LOFT'S KITCHEN. INT. 2008


          

          
          The chickens are living large, free to roam throughout the entire
          place.

          

          

           PINA
           When did you leave him?

           CHON
           Four days ago. I could see it coming. The thing is
           that after breaking up, I go out onto the street and I
           notice there is this "guy" looking at me.

          

          
          She also discovers the gazpacho on the kitchen table.

          

          

           CHON
           (Voracious.) Oh my, gazpacho! Can I have a bowl?

           PINA

          

          

           210

          
           No! I've spiked it with an entire box of downers...

           CHON
           How so?

           PINA
           In case Ivan arrived, he loves gazpacho.

           CHON
           (Scolds her.) Pina, my God!

          

          
          Throughout the conversation Pina makes coffee and prepares a tray of
          Fornassetti cups and the whole bit.

          

          

           PINA
           And that's not all! Since he wasn't calling, I've
           torn the phone from the wall, in a moment of rage...

           CHON
           I've tripped on the thing, but I didn't want to pry...
           And the bed? I think I noticed it smoking a bit...

           PINA
           I dropped a lit match and it began to burn, and I
           didn't want to squelch it. Fire purifies. I will
           have to change the mattress, but all for the best! A
           whole lot of less memories!

          

          
          Chon looks at her friend.

          

          

           PINA
           But excuse me, I've interrupted you. You were telling
           me...

          

          
          She grabs the tray, now full with coffee and pastries.

          

          

           PINA

           211

          
          Let's have breakfast on the terrace.

          

          
          The two women head for the terrace, which sits in front of the
          beautiful backdrop curtain of Madrid.

          

          

          

          

          180. LOFT'S TERRACE. INT. 2008


          

          
          Chickens and rabbits, running around. Lots of plants, etc. An
          idyllic and false image. Only the feelings are authentic and the
          women's happy disposition for living in hysteria.

          

          

           CHON
           (Struggling with what she's about to say.) Yes. I
           was telling you that I also have a suitcase at home.

           PINA
           Your husband's?

           CHON
           No. It's a suitcase with fifteen kilos of cocaine,
           uncut.

          

          
          Pina's eyes open wide.

          

          

           PINA
           You've become a dealer, Chon?

           CHON
           No! How could you think that! I am still a Counselor
           for Social Affairs in the City Hall! The suitcase
           appeared in my closet. Imagine the scandal if the
           police find out. They could put me in jail!

           PINA

          

          

           212

          
          Certainly!

           CHON
          I have to get rid of those fifteen kilos as soon as
          possible. (Thinks.) Because of the hours we keep,
          politicians consume a lot of drugs. So, between my
          party cohorts and city hall, I could distribute two
          kilos, but what do I do with the rest!

           PINA
          Throw it out!

           CHON
          Are you crazy? How could I throw it out?! I have to
          keep the police from finding it in my house... I have
          to take it some other place, immediately!

           PINA
          But I don't understand...

           CHON
          (Interrupts.) Well, it's clear, honey!

           PINA
          (Finishes her question.) How is it that the suitcase
          appeared in your closet?

           CHON
          (Drinks a little coffee, and takes a bite from a
          pastry.) As I was telling you, after breaking up with
          my husband, I bumped into this guy on the street who
          kept watching at me, good-looking, well hung. Summing
          up, I took him home and screwed him over and over...
          (Takes another sip of coffee.)

           PINA
          An how was he?

           CHON
          In bed? Divine. Look at my arm hair? I've got
          goose-bumps! (She shows her the hair on her arm,

           213

          
           standing straight up.) He's that kind of guy who
           knows how to drive a woman mad with pleasure!

           PINA
           So you lost your mind...

           CHON
           What else could I do?! So he asked me if he could
           stay at my place for a few days and I said OK, but I
           couldn't promise anything. I didn't want him thinking
           that I was that easy. So (breathes in) he brought the
           suitcase. He asked me if I cared if he kept it in the
           closet. He said that he was attached to the suitcase.
           And, well, why would I care?! (breathes in) By pure
           chance, I am watching TV last night and I find out
           that the police have nabbed him in the course of a
           drug sting operation and that he is one of the most
           wanted traffickers! I open the suitcase and I
           discover that it is filled with little bags of
           cocaine. I ran out of the house and I haven't
           returned since...

          

          
          Pina breathes out in solidarity.

          

          

           PINA
           What a story, my God!

           CHON
           (Concluding.) I was wondering why he was such a good
           fuck! For men living in such high-stakes conditions,
           each fuck could be the last! (She reaches her arm
           out, again.) Look, the goose-bumps!

          

          
          Once again, she shows Pina her arm, hair standing straight up.

          

          

           214

          

           PINA
           I've seen them already... They comes easy for you...
           (Changing topic.) And the suitcase?

           CHON
           (Humble.) I was going to ask you... if you didn't mind
           that I brought it here. If they find it in my house,
           well, it's not about what could happen to me, but that
           it's just not an ideal situation for the Counselor of
           Social Affairs. Imagine how upset the mayor would be,
           and my party! My party can't take one more scandal!

          

          
          The doorbell rings:

          

          

           CHON
           The police!

           PINA
           Shush, how could it be the police?! No one knows
           you're here!

           CHON
           I am a woman who attracts attention, Pina. Since I
           was a little girl...

           PINA
           Just pretend you're here for coffee...

          

          
          Pina limps toward the door, uncertain. (Behind it she will find new
          adventures). She looks back, toward Chon, half-smiling, tired but
          charming, filled with understanding and a love for life, with all its
          emotions and its contradictions. It's with this half-smile on
          Magdalena's face that the sequence arrives at its end.

          

          

          

          

          181. AVID ROOM. INT. 2008


           215

          
          Mateo, Judit, Diego, and the new editor, somewhat removed from them,
          are seated in front of the editing table, they are both moved and
          entertained.

          

          

           DIEGO
           This is hilarious!

           MATEO
           (Wants to be sure.) It doesn't sound like what we
           watched on TV, right?

           DIEGO
           Not at all! This is a whole different thing!

          

          
          Judit is the one who is most deeply moved. She may cry, but this time
          her tears will be happy tears, welcome tears.

          

          

           JUDIT
           It's wonderful, Mateo. We should re-release it.

           MATEO
           The important thing is to finish it. Films must be
           finished.

          

          
          Judit keeps crying.

          

          

                                         THE END
THE BROTHERS BLOOM

1   EXT. DIRT ROAD - SUNRISE                                      1

    Dawn with her rose-red fingers rises over a dusty country
    road. A car chugs over the horizon.

                        NARRATOR
              As far as con man stories go,
              I think I've heard them all.
              Of grifters, ropers, faro fixers,
              tales drawn long and tall.
              But if one bears a bookmark in
              the confidence man's tome,
              twould be that of Penelope,
              and of the brothers Bloom.


2   EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE - MORNING                                  2

    The car deposits two shabby boys (10 & 13) in front of a
    country house.

    Both in black.   Each with a suitcase.

                        NARRATOR
              At ten and thirteen Bloom and
              Stephen (the younger and the old)


3   INT. KITCHEN (FLASHBACK)                                      3

    The two brothers and an oafish FOSTER FATHER sit eating
    breakfast.

                        NARRATOR
              had been through several foster
              families.

    The FOSTER FATHER slaps Bloom upside the head. Stephen
    LAUNCHES across the table, tackling the dad and beating the
    crap out of him.

                        NARRATOR (cont'd)
              Thirty eight, all told.


4   INT. CHILD WELFARE OFFICE - DAY                               4

    CLOSE ON - A CHILD WELFARE FILE COVER

    "Bloom" stamped on it. It opens, and dozens of reports flip
    by. Under the "REASON FOR RETURN OF MINORS" field we catch
    different entries: "BEHAVIOR INAPPROPRIATE", "UNMANAGEABLE",
    "MOLESTED CAT", "SOLD OUR FURNITURE", "CAUSED FLOODING".



                                                               2

                           NARRATOR
                 Mischief moved them on in life, and
                 moving kept them close.


5   EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE PORCH                                     5

    The brothers on the porch, suitcases in hand.

                           NARRATOR
                 For Bloom had Stephen, Stephen
                 Bloom, and both had more than most.

    The front door opens, and a pair of FOSTER PARENTS eye the
    brothers suspiciously.


6   EXT. SMALL TOWN SQUARE - LATER THAT DAY                      6

    A wide dusty Main Street, which the two brothers survey.

                           NARRATOR
                 Another home, another main street.
                 Stephen looked around,
                 then summed the burgh up thusly:

                           STEPHEN
                 Bloom, we've hit a one hat town.

                           NARRATOR
                 One theater. One car wash. One
                 cafe. One park. One cat. Which,
                 through some mishap, had one leg.

    The cat sits on a roller skate, rowing itself down the street
    with its one leg.

                           STEPHEN
                 Sweet Jesus. Look at that.


7   EXT. SCHOOL - DAY                                            7

    A group of children flee the school joyfully.

                           NARRATOR
                 One school, which meant one tight-
                 knit group of local well-off kids.

                                                                 3
  




8    EXT. CANDY SHOP                                                 8

     The children run out of the candy store, all slurping Rocket
     Pops.

                           NARRATOR
                 Their pocket-change bought rocket
                 pops,


9    INT. CANDY SHOP                                                 9

     The brothers at the counter. Bloom watches the children go,
     while Stephen counts out pennies.

                           NARRATOR
                 The brothers,

     Stephen slaps the change down angrily and points with a
     scowl.

                           STEPHEN
                 Pixie Stix.


10   EXT. PARK                                                   10

     The children play, resplendent with their Rocket Pops.

                           NARRATOR
                 They were the `they'. All well
                 loved, rooted, happy as you please.

     Bloom and Stephen sit off to the side of the park, none too
     happy nursing their Pixie Stix.

                           NARRATOR (cont'd)
                 Always there. In every town.

     Stephen glares, flicks the Stix away like a cigarette.

                           STEPHEN
                 The playground bourgeoisies.

     He storms off.    Bloom lingers, staring silently at the
     children.

                                                                  4
   




11   EXT. FOREST                                                  11

     The brothers amble down a wooded path.     Bloom stops, staring
     into the trees.

     Through the dense thicket of foliage... the children playing.
     And one gleaming eye framed perfectly through a small open
     patch in the leaves.

     Bloom pushes the leaves aside. A girl. Golden curls.
     Summer dress. Standing in the distance on a wide lawn.

     Bloom gazes.    Stephen places his hand on Bloom's back.


12   EXT. PARK - CONTINUOUS                                       12

     Bloom stumbles from the trees (very much as if he's been
     shoved) and regains his footing and freezes, not shielded at
     all now from the playing kids and the girl.

                         NARRATOR
               Could he simply

                         STEPHEN (O.S.)
               Talk to her!

                         NARRATOR
               Just drop his fears and go? Leave
               his brother in the woods, and join
               the children?

     The girl makes eye contact, twisting a daisy chain between
     her tiny fingers. Bloom's adam apple convulses.

     He turns tail and runs back into the woods.

                            NARRATOR (cont'd)
               No.


13   INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT                                         13

     Brothers in bed. Bloom gazes window-ward. Stephen gazes Bloom-
     wise, shuffling a pack of cards.

                         BLOOM
               What's doing?

                            STEPHEN
               What?



                                                                   5
    
13   CONTINUED:                                                    13


                            BLOOM
                  You shuffle when you're thinking
                  something through. So whatcha
                  thinking?

                            STEPHEN
                  Not a thing.

                            NARRATOR
                  This wasn't really true.
                  Cause in the root of Stephen's
                  psyche, something now began.
                  A seed of grand epiphany. A hook.
                  A tale.


14   EXT. WOODS - DAY                                                14

                            STEPHEN
                  A plan.

     Stephen spreads out a hand-drawn flowchart on a stump, and
     talks Bloom through it.

                            NARRATOR
                  A fiction made for profit, in which
                  both boys played a part.
                  A simple con in fifteen steps.

                            STEPHEN
                  And this is where we start.

     Stephen runs his finger backwards down the connected boxes,
     each neatly numbered, stopping at #1.... "Bloom Talks To
     Girl"


15   EXT. PARK - DAY                                                 15

     Children and the gold haired Girl playing.      The wall of
     foliage where the forest begins shimmers.

                            NARRATOR
                  And then, as if a curtain had been
                  pulled back from the sky...
                  Some barrier within the younger
                  Bloom was broken.

     Bloom bursts through the trees and strides across the wide
     lawn, confident, glowing, stopping face to golden face with
     the girl.


   

                                                                  6

                            BLOOM
                  Hi.

     They talk.    They run.   They laugh.   They play.

                            NARRATOR
                  So Bloom performed his role in
                  Stephen's story to a T.

     BOX #2 on the flowchart - "Bloom wins the kids' trust"


16   EXT. TOWN SQUARE                                             16

     Bloom does indeed, sitting and laughing with a circle of
     kids, suddenly a natural born charmer.

                            NARRATOR
                  And being who he wasn't, could be
                  as he wished to be.

     The Golden Girl smiles at him.

     From the shadows of an adjacent alley, Stephen watches,
     pleased. He slinks away.

     BOX #3 - "Stephen finds a cave" dissolves to Stephen scouting
     out a cave deep in the woods.


18   EXT. PARK - DAY                                              18

     In the park, Bloom runs with the kids, laughing.

     BOX #5 - "Stephen buys supplies" dissolves to: Stephen in a
     hardware store, pointing. A flashlight, snow boots and
     several large coolers are purchased.


20   EXT. PARK - DAY                                              20

     Back in the park, Bloom says goodnight to the kids and walks
     homeward in the warm twilight.

                                                               7

     BOX #8 - "Stephen scouts church" dissolves to: Stephen's
     eyes poke up from behind a pew in a church. He manages to
     look devious as he snags a SUNDAY SCHOOL SCHEDULE.


22   INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT                                         22

     Bloom enters, hears running water from the bathroom. He
     glimpses down at the flowchart on the bed, scanning down to:

     Box #10 - "Bloom comes home to find Stephen filling the
     coolers"

     Stephen backs out of the bathroom trolling a heavy cooler.

                         STEPHEN
               Oh - kay. How's it going on the
               playground front?

                         BLOOM
               It's great.

                         STEPHEN
               So, on to step eleven, then.   The
               Tale. You tell them -

                            BLOOM
               Wait...

     Bloom's lip quivers, obviously conflicted.

                         NARRATOR
               Must the numbers rattle on?    Must
               the fiction end?

                         BLOOM
               I think I need more time to win
               their-

                          STEPHEN
               Bloom. They're not your friends.
               They're part of this, and this aint
               real. Remember, it's a con.
               And when it's done, we've just got
               us. And we'll be moving on.
                   (beat)
               So, the tale. You tell them
               there's a

     Bloom holds court with the kids.

                            BLOOM
                  hermit in the woods. A one eyed,
                  steel toothed vagabond...


24   INT. ATTIC                                                24

     Back to Bloom and Stephen in the attic

                            BLOOM
                  ...with blood red eyes?

                             STEPHEN
                      (nods)
                  That's good. He stopped you coming
                  home from school...


25   EXT. PARK - DAY                                           25

                            BLOOM
                  ...and told me of a cave.

                            GIRL
                  What kind of cave?

                            BLOOM
                  A cave of wonders.

                              BOY
                  Pffft ha.

                            GIRL
                  Shut up, Dave.

                            BLOOM
                  At noon on every Sunday, there
                  appears a ball of light, which
                  flutters like a butterfly...

                            GIRL
                  A will-o-whisp?

                            BLOOM
                  That's right. It guides you

                                                               9

                  ...to where the treasures lay.

                            BOY
                  So where's this cave?

                            GIRL
                  Yeah, where?


28   INT. ATTIC                                                28

                            STEPHEN
                  Ah-hah. The hermit didn't say.
                  He got this greedy glinting look,
                  the filthy red-eyed leech... and
                  said he'd tell for thirty bucks.

     Something in Bloom's face falls.


29   EXT. PARK                                                 29

     The girl's bright, trusting face looking at him. A moment of
     silence. Then, triumphant, an excited boy leaps to his feet.

                            EXCITED BOY
                  Well that's just two bucks each!

     The kids all rejoice, and fist-fulls of dollars are thrust at
     Bloom. He looks almost crestfallen as his eye catches the
     girl's joyful gaze.

                            NARRATOR
                  So Sunday came...


30   EXT. WOODS                                                30

     Children in their bright Sunday clothes run through the dark
     woods, led by Bloom.





                                                                10

                            NARRATOR
                  ...and straight from church, into
                  the woods Bloom led.


31   INT. CAVE                                                    31

     In the dim light of a cave, Stephen overturns the coolers of
     water and retreats into shadow. A flood soaks into the dirt
     floor, as outside the mouth of the cave the group of panting
     children come into sight.

                            NARRATOR
                  They stopped. Their hearts leapt.
                  There it was.


32   EXT. CAVE                                                    32

     The children look at the craggy mouth of a forboding cave.

                            GIRL
                  Just like the hermit said!

     Deep in the cave's dark maw, a spark of light.

     The children gasp collectively.    The Girl grabs Bloom's arm.

     Bloom stares, transfixed as any of them.

     The spark becomes a glowing, fluttering point of light, which
     hangs in the mouth of the cave for a tantalizing moment, then
     recedes deeper into the gloom.

     With a cry the children, Bloom included, dash into the cave.


33   INT. CAVE                                                    33

     The light glows just around the next corner... the children
     run after it, slipping in the mud, laughing, turning the
     corner...

     And the light glows just around the next corner. They
     scramble, they slip and slide, they can't catch the light,
     but they're all having the time of their lives.

     Bloom included.    Holding the girl's hand, laughing, eyes full
     of wonder.






                                                                11

                            NARRATOR
                  For just one moment, Bloom forgot
                  himself and ran too fast.

     He puts on a burst of speed, gets ahead of the crowd.

                            NARRATOR (cont'd)
                  He'd catch the light and find the
                  treasure...

     Turning a corner, he (alone) sees the rather tawdry image of
     Stephen, flashlight in hand, shooing him back as he turns the
     next corner.

     Bloom stops running.

                            NARRATOR (cont'd)
                  But the moment passed.

     The other kids and the girl pass him, but Bloom stands dead
     still, a strange expression on his face.

     The girl turns back towards him, still running, and holds out
     her hand for him to follow.

     But he doesn't.    He stays behind, and is soon left alone.


34   EXT. PLAYGROUND                                               34

                            NARRATOR
                  They didn't catch the will-o-wisp,
                  but didn't really care.

     The muddied children walk home, laughing, while Bloom leans
     against a lamppost. Stephen appears behind him, counting
     their money.

                            STEPHEN
                  It seems to me that in the end, the
                  perfect con is where
                  each one involved gets just the
                  thing they wanted.

                            BLOOM
                  Yeah I guess so.

                             NARRATOR
                  Our fledgling thieves were
                  satisfied.

                                                                12
  




35   EXT. FOSTER HOUSE - DAY                                      35

     A front door opens, revealing a porch-full of 30 angry
     parents holding 15 muddied kids by their ears.

                          NARRATOR
                The children's parents, less so.

     The Foster Parents exchange a glance.

     QUICK SHOTS -

     Stephen is smacked.

     The wad of money is snatched from a grubby small hand by an
     angry big one.

     A telephone slams down.

     On a form, the field "Reason for return:" is filled with
     "Larceny."


36   INT. BEDROOM - DAY                                           36

     Two suitcases on a bed are snapped closed and pulled away.
     The bed sits solid and vacant in the dusty afternoon
     sunlight.

                          NARRATOR
                A bitter ending? Maybe. But
                there's sweetness in the mix.

     Beneath the bed, forgotten, a piece of paper.    On it, the con
     flow-chart. Numbered boxes.

                          NARRATOR (cont'd)
                The brothers Bloom had found their
                calling.

     One of the boxes... number six...

                          NARRATOR (cont'd)
                As shown in number six.

     BOX #6:   "Cut % O'Henry's"

                          NARRATOR (cont'd)
                `Cut' meant to negotiate, `percent'
                percentage deal.

                                                              13





37   EXT. SMALL TOWN SQUARE - DAY                                 37

     Through a storefront window - rows of the children's muddy
     Sunday clothes hang, each tagged.

                         NARRATOR
               `O'Henry's' was the town's one dry
               clean shop.

     And striding out of the store beneath the `O'Henry's
     Cleaners' sign is Stephen, fifty dollars in hand, sucking a
     Rocket Pop. The OWNER leans out of the door, looking a
     little nervous. Stephen throws him back a salute.


38   EXT. BACK ALLEY - DAY                                        38

     Bloom sits against a wall, suitcases beside him. Boxes of
     Rocket Pops, and one in each fist. Stephen plops down beside
     him.

                         STEPHEN
               So how's it feel?

     Bloom's eye catches the children, and the girl, playing in
     the distance.

                         NARRATOR
               In truth, young Bloom won't know
               for twenty years just how he felt.

     HONK! A `Child Welfare' car waiting out on the street.    The
     brothers pick themselves up.

                         NARRATOR (cont'd)
               And so, we'll skip ahead now in our
               story.

     Stephen tosses his Rocket Pop.

                         STEPHEN
               Let `em melt.

     The con man team of the brothers Bloom, suitcases in hand,
     strides down the alleyway.

     Stephen in front.






                                                               14

     Bloom a few steps behind, stealing one last glance back at
     the children playing in the sun.

40   INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT                                         40

     Flames spread over a wall of bookshelves.

     TITLE CARD:    BERLIN, 25 YEARS LATER

     A YOUNG MAN in a nice suit and bowler hat steps in front of
     the flaming books.

                            YOUNG MAN
                  He gets the scarab, you get the
                  money, I get the girl... so in the
                  end, everyone gets everything he
                  wants.

     Three gunshots, two bloody holes in the nice suit and the
     young man folds to the ground.

     A sweaty man named CHARLESTON (40s) lowers his gun, while
     behind him the rest of the library roars in flames.

                            VOICE (O.S.)
                  Wha - Charleston, what - oh my god
                  are you... oh god he's dead,
                  Victor's dead... you've killed us!
                  We had it he was right it was all
                  in the bag and now we're dead, why?
                  Why, you stupid son of a bitch?

     The owner of the voice, a MAN a bit younger than Charleston
     in a derby cap, snatches the gun away and slaps Charleston
     hard.






                                                               15

                             CHARLESTON
                  Cause the Turk was right. After
                  seeing her, after that night on the
                  airstrip, after Cairo everything
                  changed, and he couldn't see the
                  play through that one milky eye,
                  but the Turk was right about one
                  thing, that there's nothing
                  beautiful about money. She's
                  beautiful.

                            MCGUIRE
                  This isn't happening...

                            CHARLESTON
                  He'll never have her now. She's
                  free. And I'll never see her in
                  scarlet again, her chestnut hair,
                  but it's worth the money and my job
                  and his life and the rest of my
                  life that she's free.

                            MCGUIRE
                  Charleston. I can't be here...

                            CHARLESTON
                  You're not here. Neither of us
                  are. It's Mowcher's gun.

                            MCGUIRE
                  Mowcher is at the bottom of the
                  Spree with a cowl in his neck!

     Charleston gets to his feet.

                            CHARLESTON
                  They won't find him for a week, and
                  the Albino will chalk it up to
                  Davey, he won't talk. We're clean.

                            MCGUIRE
                  Listen to you - four months ago you
                  were an investment banker! Now
                  you're nothing. The Scarab's lost.
                  The money's gone. It'll rot in the
                  Peruvian earth. It's gone.

     Charleston limps to the flaming doorway.






                                                              16

40   CONTINUED: (2)                                            40


                         CHARLESTON
               The man named Charleston you met
               nine months and a thousand years
               ago at the hotel bar in Jodhpur is
               dead. If we see each other again
               it'll be as strangers. As for the
               money... let it rot.

     He exits, leaving McGuire stooped beside the crumpled form of
     Victor. A long beat. The distant roar of an engine, tires
     squealing.

     Then through the smoky doorway steps a beautiful ASIAN WOMAN,
     early 20s. She gives a nearly imperceptible nod.

                         MCGUIRE
               Wow.

     He pats Victor, who sits up, spitting blood. McGuire looks
     to Victor and the woman for a reaction. Gets none.

                         MCGUIRE (cont'd)
               Wow is the word you're both looking
               for. Wow.

     The Asian woman nods slightly.

                         VICTOR
                   (un-wowishly)
               You're a genius, Stephen.

     For McGuire is, of course, Stephen.

                         STEPHEN
               We're a genius, Bloom.

     Just as Victor is, indeed, Bloom.   He spits.

                         BLOOM
               Tastes like tin foil.

                         STEPHEN
               So does real blood. Buy you a
               drink.

     Stephen escorts the Asian woman out, while Bloom wipes his
     lip.

                                                              17





41   EXT. HOUSE - PRE-DAWN                                       41

     A stately house in the middle of nowhere, on fire. Stephen
     holds the door of a car open, while Bloom steps from the
     flaming house.

                         STEPHEN
               "Four months and a thousand years
               ago." That's Kipling, isn't it?
               He stole that from Kipling.

                           BLOOM
               No.


42   EXT. BERLIN - PRE-DAWN                                      42

     Hazy light over the sprawling city.


43   INT. DEUTCH MARK                                            43

     A low, cozy basement level bar. A dozen people crowd it, all
     expectant in a surprise-party type way.

     A TURKISH GENTLEMAN in a white linen suit and eye patch
     raises his drink when Bloom, Stephen and the woman enter.

                         THE TURK
               Make way, make room for the
               brothers Bloom!

     The bar bursts into cheers.


44   INT. DEUTCH MARK - LATER                                    44

     A DWARF dances on the bar. Stephen plays cards with the
     Turk, an ALBINO and a small crowd of character types.

                         THE TURK
               Nine months, six countries, three
               faked deaths, for one mark. You're
               a beautiful antique, my friend.

     They clink glasses.

                           ALL
               Proust.





                                                                    18

                            THE TURK
                  One thing baffles me. The entire
                  con would have fallen apart if
                  Charleston had walked away. How did
                  you know he'd pull the trigger?

     Stephen riffle shuffles a pack of cards.

                            STEPHEN
                  Just think of any card.    Got one?

     Stephen cuts the deck randomly - 2 of spades.

                               THE TURK
                  No.

     Stephen shrugs.

                            STEPHEN
                  But if I do it enough, eventually
                  it'll work on someone. And then
                  it'll be the best card trick in the
                  world.

     Wink. The dwarf slips, plummets from the bar. Stephen kicks
     a chair across the room, into which he lands with a crunch.

                               STEPHEN (cont'd)
                  Ante up.

                            THE TURK
                  It's true you never work with the
                  same crew twice?

                            STEPHEN
                  That's true.

                               THE TURK
                  Well shit.     Except for the uh, for
                  her?

                            STEPHEN
                  La Chinoise?

                               THE TURK
                  Yeah.

     Back at the bar - the Asian woman.       The CHINK.   Being hit on
     by a weasly ROMANIAN.

                            ROMANIAN
                  Yeah, I'm pretty big into anime.

  

                                                               19

     She almost imperceptibly rolls her eyes.

                         STEPHEN
               Our fifth Beatle. She knows the
               ins and the outs, and so far as I
               can tell, speaks three words of
               English.

     She taps on the bar.

                            THE CHINK
               Jameson.

                            BARTENDER
               Ice?

     She says `no' with a look.

                         THE ALBINO
               So she's with you and Bloom till
               the end.

                         STEPHEN
               Just till the wind changes.

     Stephen makes a gun with his finger and shoots at the Chink.

     She flicks a champaign flute to make a `DING!' and mimes the
     bullet bouncing off her.

                         THE TURK
               Where is Bloom?

     In the corner of the bar, in a private booth with drawn
     velvet curtains, Bloom sits alone playing solitaire. Stuck
     with a queen of hearts he can't play.

     A beautiful woman in scarlet with auburn hair pokes her face
     through the curtains.

                         ROSE
               There you are. Hiding?

                            BLOOM
               Yeah.

                         ROSE
               I've been learning.      Stephen likes
               to talk about you.

                         BLOOM
               Did he tell you the cave story?



                                                              20

                         ROSE
               Is it true?

                         BLOOM
               What else did he tell you?

                         ROSE
               I'm not going to tell it as good as
               Stephen. You two kicked around
               till your early teens, then stowed
               away on a merchant marine freighter
               and ended up in St. Petersburg,
               where you spent five years under
               the tutelage of a shadowy old
               swindler named the Diamond Dog.
               And he was your Fagin and Stephen
               was his Artful Dodger, but it ended
               suddenly and badly.

                         BLOOM
               Stephen took his eye out with an
               antique rapier.

                         ROSE
               Why did he do that?

                         BLOOM
               And then the Brothers Bloom lit out
               on their own to make their fortune
               as gentleman thieves. Sounds
               romantic.

                          ROSE
               It does.

     She pushes the cards aside and slides clumsily onto the
     table, her face inches from Bloom's, eyes closed, expecting a
     kiss.

     Bloom's eyes stay open.

                         BLOOM
               You want to know how Stephen did
               it? With Charleston?

                         ROSE
               It's not the first thing on my
               mind.

                                                              21





45   INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                          45

     A replay of Bloom in front of the flaming bookshelf.

                         BLOOM (O.S.)
               He positioned me in the same spot
               where, seven years ago,
               Charleston's wife stood and told
               him she was leaving.

     The room transforms, becomes daylit, not on fire, seven years
     ago, a WIFE standing in Bloom's place.

                         BLOOM (O.S.) (cont'd)
               He chose my outfit to mirror her
               suit.

     Sure enough, the colors and shape of Bloom's suit matches the
     Wife's outfit.

                         BLOOM (O.S.) (cont'd)
               He even phonetically matched my
               final words to hers.

                         WIFE
               This is the end. Charelston, you've
               always been a dunce.

     Everything snaps back to Bloom in the flaming room.

                         BLOOM (IN FLASHBACK)
               So in the end, everyone gets
               everything he wants.

     BANG.


46   INT. DEUTCH MARK                                          46

                         BLOOM
               That's what he does, he writes his
               cons the way dead Russians write
               novels, with thematic arcs and
               imbedded symbolism and shit. And
               he wrote me as a vulnerable anti-
               hero. And that's why you think you
               want to kiss me. It's a con.

     He leaves Rose lying on the table and sweeps through the bar
     towards the exit, passing Stephen.




                                                                   22

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  I need air.

                            STEPHEN
                  Who doesn't?
                      (plays a card)
                  That's the big 2.


47   EXT. BERLIN STREET - EARLY MORNING                               47

     Bloom stumbles up stone steps to street level.      A THOUSAND
     YEAR OLD MAN sweeps up across the square.

     Bloom sits wearily on the curb, bowler hat in hand, shirt
     bright red with fake blood, face long as hell.

     Putting the broom aside a moment, the old man walks painfully
     across the street to Bloom. Standing nearly toe to toe with
     him, the man pulls a huge joyful smile across his grizzled
     face.

     He then smears his hand over his mug, pulling the smile off
     his face and rubbing it on Bloom's mouth. When he takes his
     hand away, Bloom plays along and has the same big joyful
     smile. The old man winks at him and walks back to his broom.

     As soon as the old man is away, Bloom drops the smile.

     Stephen paces out into the street.

                            STEPHEN
                  We missed the sunrise.    That
                  would've been nice.

     They walk across the street to the Tiergarten.


48   EXT. TIERGARTEN - EARLY MORNING                                  48

     Berlin's Central Park and zoo, dead and brown. The brothers
     stroll through the woods, Stephen a few steps ahead, Bloom
     trailing behind, lost in thought.

     Camel heads poke over a wall with `Kamelhaus' painted on it.
     Stephen throws open the wall's gate.

                            STEPHEN
                      (to camels)
                  Back to the swamps!

     The camels are unimpressed.       Bloom slouches into a bench.

 

                                                               23

     Stephen shows the deck of cards to Bloom, who nods. Stephen
     cuts the deck, shows him a card. Bloom shakes his head, no.

                            STEPHEN (cont'd)
                  At least you're honest.

     Bloom stares into space.

                            STEPHEN (cont'd)
                  Alright, let's do this. Let's just
                  get it done. So first you say `I'm
                  quitting, Stephen. I'm out.' Then
                  I say...

                            BLOOM
                  `Do we have to go through this
                  again.'

                            STEPHEN
                  Then you make a show of putting on
                  your jacket and say `no I mean it
                  this time Stephen, this time I'm
                  really out.'

                            BLOOM
                  Then you say `let's have a drink,
                  and in the morning Bloom you'll
                  have come to your senses'

     Stephen pulls a flask, unscrews it.

                            STEPHEN
                      (re: Bloom's bright red
                       blood stain)
                  That's a major design flaw in fake
                  blood, by the way.

                            BLOOM
                  `and we'll be moving on.'

                            STEPHEN
                  Real blood turns brown after a half
                  hour.

                            BLOOM
                  Listen to me, Stephen.

                            STEPHEN
                  This scotch costs more than your
                  suit.

               Listen to me.

                         STEPHEN
               And the flask stopped a bullet from
               a black powder rifle at Appomattox.

                         BLOOM
               Listen.

     Bloom bats the flask away. A camel catches it, tips its
     camel neck back and gulps it down.

                         STEPHEN
               That's my new favorite camel.

                         BLOOM
               I hate you. I hate this life, I
               hate it, I hate that you won't
               fucking listen to me for one
               goddamn second. Just listen.

     Stephen listens.

                         BLOOM (cont'd)
               I can't wake up next to another
               stranger, who thinks they know me,
               or even wants to know me, cause I
               don't know - who - I'm thirty five
               years old, and I, I'm useless, I'm
               crippled, I don't, I've only ever
               lived life through these roles that
               aren't me, that are written for me
               by you.

                         STEPHEN
               Tell me what you want.

                         BLOOM
               Why? So you can write me a role in
               a story where I get it? You're not
               listening to me. I want a real...
               thing, I wanna do things how I
               don't know are gonna work out, a,
               I, want, a...

                  Aauuugghh god!

     The camel belches.    Bloom makes a show of putting on his
     jacket.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  I'm going away. Somewhere you or
                  even the Chink won't be able to
                  track me down, so don't try. No
                  more stories.

     Bloom tosses Stephen the bowler, and storms off.    He gets
     about ten feet, then hesitates.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  I love you. Bye.

     Then goes.

     The camel nudges Stephen's jacket, looking for more scotch.
     Stephen puts the bowler on its camel head.

                               STEPHEN
                  Sorry bud.     I'm dry.

     Stephen watches his brother walk off into the rising morning
     mist, lost in thought.

     His hands mechanically begin shuffling the pack of cards.

     FADE OUT

     FADE IN:


49   EXT. ITALIAN COUNTRYSIDE - DAY                                49

     Beautiful green hills surround the walled medieval city of
     Ferentino.

     TITLE CARD:    Ferentino, Italy - 3 months later.

     A tiny red car inches its way across the countryside. It
     winds its way up and deeper into the city on the hill.

                                                                26
  




50   EXT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - DAY                                50

     The tiny stone porch outside a private apartment.   The red
     car's bumper pulls up, parks.

     On a small wood table, empty booze bottles and a loose pack
     of cards. Fingertips spread the cards, then the fingertips'
     owner heads for the apartment door.


51   INT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - DAY                                51

     Stephen steps in cautiously, surveys the apartment.

     A goddamn mess. Empty bottles and glasses, very little
     light. Stephen opens the curtains, light streams in the
     window. A groan of displeasure comes from the gloom.

     Bloom stirs, passed out in a hammock. Unkept beard, a few
     extra pounds. Crushed cigar hanging on his lip.

     A rotund GRANDMOTHER waddles in, cleaning up bottles and
     berating Bloom in a constant stream of angry Italian.

                         STEPHEN
               She's right, you know.

                         BLOOM
               Why are you here, Stephen?

                         STEPHEN
               Put on your face, let's eat.


52   EXT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - LATER                              52

     Stephen guides a dressed Bloom out the door. The grandmother
     follows them, still barking angry Italian at Bloom. At the
     last moment she says a few kind words, kisses him on the
     cheek and sends them off.


53   EXT. FERENTINO CAFE - DAY                                     53

     A few tables on a stone walkway overlooking the countryside.
     The red car parked nearby. Stephen eats, Bloom stares.

                         BLOOM
               How'd you find me?

                  How've you been?

                  Great.

                            STEPHEN
                  I've done a lot of thinking the
                  past three months. You don't want
                  out. You think you do but you
                  don't. Here, c'mere. I want to

                  I'm quits, Stephen.

     Stephen stands, strolls off.        Bloom wearily follows.

55   EXT. LUDICROUS MANSION - AFTERNOON                                55

     A long private road through a tunnel of trees leads to a
     ludicrous mansion. Our trio watch it from the road.

                            BLOOM
                  Looks like an etching from a Bronte
                  novel.

     Stephen flips open a first edition Jane Eyre. The
     illustration inside is in fact an exact match, right down to
     a plaster deer in the front yard.

                  Huh. Look at that. Well thanks.

                  Big money. Inheritance. Dad died
                  early, Mom died two years ago after
                  ten years fighting an illness that
                  I can't pronounce.

                              BLOOM
                  How much?

     The Chink writes a number in the snow with a stick. Just
     when we think she's done, she adds several more zeros.

                              BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Jesus.

                              STEPHEN
                  Look out.

     Stephen pulls Bloom into the trees as a cherry red
     Lamborghini roars down the private road, does an unruly donut
     and crunches painfully into a tree, kicking up a cloud of
     dust and smoke.

     Thumping bass from the audio system turns off, and from the
     dust cloud emerges PENELOPE, early 30s, beautiful but in a
     non-Lamborghini way.

     Bloom watches her through the trees, none too happy.


56   EXT. THICKET - LATER                                        56

     Off to the side of the house. They lean on the hood of their
     rental car, an old school Cadillac.

     In the background, a tow truck arrives with a brand new
     Lamborghini, and leaves towing the old one.

                            BLOOM
                  What am I doing here, Stephen? I

                  No women. One rule. You know we
                  don't do women, I don't, and it's
                  not a morality thing or- a thing-
                  it's, whatever it is it doesn't
                  matter what it is, that's just our
                  rule. So what are we,
                      (RE: the rental car)
                  Did you rent a `78 Caddy?

     Stephen nods to the Chink.       Bloom nods appreciatively.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Controversial choice. So no, is
                  what I'm saying. I'm quits anyway.
                  I'll be in Italy. Drinking.

     The front door of the mansion slams, and they watch Penelope
     drag a harp around into the back yard.

                            STEPHEN
                  Penelope Stamp. Thirty three.
                  Lived at home her whole life.

     Bloom's eyes never leave Penelope.

                            BLOOM
                  An eccentric shut-in rich bitch.
                  You're not helping your case.

     The Chink silently hands Bloom a retractable spyglass, he
     watches Penelope drift atop a hill and sit on a stump.

                            STEPHEN
                  She's bored, a seed in the snow.
                  We're going to put her through a
                  grand adventure, bring her to life.

                            BLOOM
                  So this is the big plan. Lure me
                  back into things with some
                  beautiful intriguing elusive girl,
                  stir up old memories with the
                  prospect of redemption and rebirth.
                  Seriously Stephen. Amateur night.

     Bloom watches her play Clash songs on the harp.



   

                                                              30

                         BLOOM (cont'd)
               I'm not saying yes. But what's the
               con?

     Stephen spreads a folded piece of paper on a tree stump, with
     a flowchart on it. Numbered boxes.

     Bloom doesn't take his spyglass off Penelope.

                         STEPHEN
               It's actually pretty simple. We're
               brothers, antique dealers, perusing
               the Americas for antiquities en
               route to someplace exciting via
               luxury steamer, say Greece. You
               tie into her and work your magic...

     Penelope plays on.


57   INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT                                    57

     Very late. Bloom and Stephen in armchairs, collars loosened,
     drinks drunk. The Chink's Chuck Taylors stick up over the
     back of a chair.

     Bloom holds the con flowchart.

                         STEPHEN
               ...and so that's how it ends, in
               Mexico, a burst of violence then a
               moment of truth on the beach. What
               do you think?

     Bloom idly looks over the chart.

                         BLOOM
               You've got something up your
               sleeve. This is about me, right?
               Somehow.

                         STEPHEN
               This might not be something you
               know, but they've all been about
               you. Maybe that's why they've none
               of them been perfect, I've never
               been able to give you what you
               really want.






                                                                31

                            BLOOM
                  I want to be outta all this. So by
                  definition, this is not going to
                  give me what I want.

     Stephen answers by letting an ace fall from his sleeve.

                             BLOOM (cont'd)
                  This will be the last one.    You'll
                  let me go.

     The Chink's inert sneakers come to life and she's on her
     feet, silently going to Stephen's side.

                            STEPHEN
                  I will never approach you to do
                  another con again.
                      (to the Chink)
                  Let's make it a red Schwinn.

     Bloom stares at #1 on the flowchart - "BLOOM MEETS PENELOPE."


58   EXT. HILLTOP - MORNING                                      58

     A grumpy Bloom perched on the red Schwinn, an ill fitting
     Styrofoam helmet on his head.

     Stephen sits in a lawn chair watching the highway below.

     The Chink sets up a lawn umbrella, a chair for herself, and a
     cooler with Coronas.

                            BLOOM
                  There are less painful ways to cut
                  into a mark.

                            STEPHEN
                  Wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk.
                  Score to beat is 7.9. Keep your
                  head in the game, the Chinese judge
                  is tough.

                            BLOOM
                  This is a banana seat, man!

     He directs this to the Chink, who blinks with innocent
     incomprehension and opens two Coronas.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Don't give me that blank look, you
                  know what a fuckin banana seat is.

 

                                                                   32
     
58   CONTINUED:                                                     58


     Stephen spots something and blows a whistle.       With a grunt,
     Bloom launches the Schwinn forward.

     Gaining speed, bumping over weeds and gopher holes, down the
     steep steep hill.

     At the bottom of the hill, a two lane highway.      Cruising down
     the highway, a cherry red Lamborghini.

     Whose front right fender Bloom expertly smashes into.

                                                            CUT TO:


59   EXT. HIGHWAY / SKY - DAY                                         59

     Silent and blue. Time slows to a crawl as Bloom sails
     through the air, arcing over the Italian luxury car's hood
     and past a horrified Penelope, face frozen mid scream behind
     the wheel.

                            BLOOM (V.O.)
                  There's actually a knack to this.
                  You want to avoid dying or breaking
                  anything that won't grow back, but
                  you don't want to roll out of it
                  and come up roses. If you're
                  trying to fast track into a mark's
                  sympathies, there's nothing quite
                  as efficient as having your first
                  conversation be from a hospital bed
                  they put you in. I usually like to
                  try for a dislocated shoulder.

     Several things happen at once.

     Bloom hits the pavement shoulder-first, hard.      The bent bike
     follows suit.

     Up on the hill, Stephen and the Chink raise score cards.         8.9
     and 5.6.

     The Lamborghini screeches to a stop.

     Everything is still.

     Then the car jolts forward. Then stops. Then again, jolts
     and stops. Rolls forward a few feet, lazily drifting, then
     jolts and stops.

     Bloom painfully stands, as confused by the car's behavior as
     us.

 

                                                                33
  
59   CONTINUED:                                                  59


     Stephen and the Chink lower their cards, equally confused.

     One last long beat of silence, then the car jolts forward,
     veers drunkenly to the left, tips into a ditch and chunks to
     a stop. The horn blares.

     Bloom looks up to the hilltop for guidance.

     Stephen stares blankly.    The Chink raises a new score card -
     7.8.


60   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT                                   60

     Penelope sleeps, bruised and battered. Bloom sits bedside
     uncomfortably, arm in a wimpy sling. She stirs. Bloom leans
     forward.

     Slurred with sleep and drugs, she painfully barely breathes

                            PENELOPE
                  Are you alright?


61   INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT                                61

     Bloom consults with Stephen and the Chink, both in scrubs.

                            STEPHEN
                  The Chink had it - I'm telling him,
                  I know, thank you - in her report,
                  I missed it. This is actually kind
                  of great, I'll tell you why.

     The Chink lights a cigarette.

                            BLOOM
                  You missed it?

                            STEPHEN
                  Dostoevsky was an epileptic.

                            BLOOM
                  I know.

                            STEPHEN
                  His seizures were preceded by an
                  enlightened euphoria, a sort of
                  opening of his spiritual eye.

                            STEPHEN (cont'd)
                  I think the fact that she saw your
                  face the instant before a seizure
                  is a pretty goddamn good foot to
                  start things out on, right?

     Bloom stares blankly.        The Chink burps into her stethoscope.


62   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT                                      62

     Bloom slumps in a chair, watching Penelope sleep.

                            BLOOM (V.O.)
                  The next step is to figure out a
                  way to insinuate yourself into
                  their personal life.

     Bloom drifts off, then wakes with a start.

     It is MORNING.     Penelope is shaking him.

                            PENELOPE
                  I think they took my car.     Could
                  you drive me home?

                                BLOOM
                  Uh.   Yeah.

     She walks away, the back of her gown wide open, then turns.

                            PENELOPE
                  I'm Penelope Stamp.

                                BLOOM
                  Bloom.


63   INT. CADILLAC - MORNING                                         63

     Bloom drives, Penelope gazes stiffly out the window.

                            BLOOM (V.O.)
                  Engagement. Find a connection with
                  your mark through conversation.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  I'm sorry about your Lamborghini.

                                PENELOPE
                  S' ok.

     Silence. He notices her playing with the side mirror knob,
     angling it to stare at him while looking out the window.

  

                                                                      35

                  Jersey.

     More silence.

                            PENELOPE
                  This car is like riding in a huge
                  marshmallow.

     And still more silence.

                            BLOOM (V.O.)
                  Having now deftly set your hook in
                  the mark's psyche, this would be
                  the perfect time to tug the line,


64   EXT. LUDICROUS MANSION - MORNING                                  64

     They pull up in the car.          A tow truck is dropping off a new
     Lamborghini.

                            BLOOM (V.O.)
                  Get invited in for coffee, and tell
                  them the full tale.

     Bloom looks about to launch into something, when Penelope
     drops a stack of cash bound in a green rubber band on his
     dashboard.

                            PENELOPE
                  For the bike, and the whole, thing.
                  This was a big shit sandwich. Ok.
                  Bye.

     The car door slams and she's gone.         Bloom sits a moment.

                            BLOOM (V.O.)
                  However, there are advantages to
                  playing it cool. Letting it lie
                  for a day or two, then casually re-
                  establish contact.

     Bloom starts driving off, and adjusts the passenger side
     mirror so it points back to the road. As he does he sees
     Penelope in it, sprinting after his car.

     He stops.    A moment later she appears at his window, heaving.

                  right?


65   INT. PENELOPE'S KITCHEN - DAY                                65

     Bloom and Penelope sit in a luxurious stone-based kitchen,
     neither touching their coffee. Bloom talks.

     This is how Penelope listens: she starts with her eyes on
     Bloom, then very quickly drifts away into her own thoughts,
     then recognizes she's doing it and makes eye contact again
     and gives an overbaked "oh yes go on" smile/nod, then does it
     all again. Three or four times.

                            BLOOM
                  ...didn't really have anyone except
                  each other growing up, and our
                  father was in the antique business,
                  he had a shop in Charleston. So we
                  stuck together, my brother Stephen
                  and me, we and just took over the
                  shop when dad died. Then we
                  realized one day, we saw the
                  dealers who were finding and
                  selling us the antiques coming from
                  exotic countries all over the
                  world, and there was a, almost a
                  scent they had, when they'd come in
                  the dusty shop we worked nine to
                  five in since we were nineteen, the
                  air would, like before a rain, the
                  ions would line up, and you could
                  just smell midnight trains to Paris
                  and steamer ships and Calcutta
                  bazaars, and we made the decision,
                  we just did it, that we want to
                  have that sort of life. So we did,
                  and we've been travelling and
                  treasure hunting the world ever
                  since, and could you, I'm sorry,
                  stop doing - that, you're, I'm, ok.
                  Alright, look.

                            PENELOPE
                  I'm really bad at talking to

                            BLOOM
                  I told you, that's alright.
                  You want me to go?

                             PENELOPE
                  No!   I want to talk to you.   Fuck.

     She storms out.

     Victorian, expensive. Penelope leans against the window,
     looking out. Sulking. Bloom enters.

                            BLOOM
                  So what kind of stuff do you do?

                             PENELOPE
                  Nothing.   Maybe you should go.

                            BLOOM
                  Alright. I'm just gonna finish my
                  coffee first.

     Very slowly, he sips it.     Each sip becomes a noisier and
     noisier slurp.

                            PENELOPE
                  I collect hobbies. I see someone
                  doing something I like, and I get
                  books and learn how to do it.

                             BLOOM
                  Hm.   Anything interesting?

                            PENELOPE
                  Not really.

     HOBBY MONTAGE

     In which Penelope demonstrates the following with exacting
     seriousness and skill for Bloom:

     Playing the piano.      The classical guitar.   The fiddle.   The
     banjo.

     Putting the finishing touches on a ship in a bottle.

     Executing a perfect ollie on a skateboard.



   

                                                                    38

     Juggling various items.       Riding a unicycle.   Juggling while
     riding a unicycle.

     Playing ping-pong against a wall with ungodly speed.

     Karate chopping through too much wood.

     Breakdancing.

     Playing the accordion.

     Rapping to a drum machine.

     Creating a perfect origami dragon.

     END HOBBY MONTAGE

     On Bloom's shell-shock face.

                            BLOOM
                  Is that it?

                             PENELOPE
                  No.   I know a lot of stuff.

                            BLOOM
                  You just learned this stuff, here
                  by yourself?

                               PENELOPE
                  Kinda sad.

                            BLOOM
                  No. So you just thought, `so I
                  want to learn this and this,' and
                  you just did it? How do you plan
                  to use all these skills?

                            PENELOPE
                  I dunno. I'm not a planner. I
                  just do stuff. Here, look at this
                  watermelon. It's a camera. You
                  can make a pinhole camera out of
                  anything hollowish and dark.

                            BLOOM
                  It's gotta warp the image though,
                  right?

                         PENELOPE
               No, yeah it does. That's what -
               the Taj Majal taken by a fat
               tourist with diarrhea and a point-
               and-shoot camera can be the
               flattest, dullest, "here's us at
               the Taj Majal," "Oh lovely lets go
               stick our thumbs up our asses"
               picture. But you can look at the
               most menial everyday thing, and
               depending on how your pinhole
               camera eats the light, it's warped
               and peculiar and imperfect. It's
               not reproduction, it's
               storytelling.

                         BLOOM
               It's a lie that tells the truth.

                         PENELOPE
               I dunno about truth. A photograph
               is a secret about a secret. The
               more it tells you, the less you
               know.

                         BLOOM
               What's changed between now and
               twenty minutes ago? Cause this is
               kinda like a conversation.

                           PENELOPE
               Huh.    Well shit.


67   EXT. BACKYARD - DAY                                       67

     Bloom and Penelope walk and talk, finally rounding the house
     and ending up at the driveway.

                         BLOOM
               Well, I should, uh, it's late. So.
               I meet a lot of people in my job I
               have to professionally act
               interested in. It's a good feeling
               to be genuinely interested in
               someone.

                         PENELOPE
               Are you leaving?

                           BLOOM
               Yeah.



                                                                40

                  Are you coming back?

                            BLOOM
                  Well next time I'm in town. We're
                  taking a steamer at noon tomorrow
                  off the docks, to the continent for
                  a few months.

     During this, Bloom very naturally moves his hand to the small
     of Penelope's back. The edge of his thumb comes to rest on a
     small slit of exposed skin.

     Penelope's expression does not change, but a noticeable blush
     crosses her still face.

     When Bloom removes his hand, the blush falls.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Paris and Greece, I think. I've
                  gotta get a hat. Thanks for the
                  pinhole camera demonstration. And
                  for the good conversation. Goodbye
                  Penelope.

                            PENELOPE
                  Goodbye Bloom.

     He drives off.    She stands in the doorway, watching him go.


68   EXT. THE DOCKS - DAY                                        68

     A jaunty steamer ship docked and ready. Bloom watches the
     access road, Stephen makes notes, the Chink whittles.

                            BLOOM
                  I need another day with her.

                            STEPHEN
                  You'll have two weeks on the boat.

                            BLOOM
                  I need another day to get her on
                  the boat, she isn't hooked. That
                  bit I skipped where we were talking
                  in the backyard, it was ten minutes
                  on the optics of lensless
                  photography, we didn't really talk.

                  It isn't the talking that hooked
                  her.

     Bloom turns from the road.

                            BLOOM
                  I think you're wrong.

     A screech of distant tires and a crash.        Bloom doesn't look.

                            BLOOM (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                  Though every time I say that, you
                  end up being comically right.
                  That's her, isn't it? Yeah.

     Penelope pulls a clumsy steamer trunk that never could have
     fit in her Lamborghini, which is bent around a pylon.

     Bloom meets her.

                              PENELOPE

                  Hi.    What are you doing here?

     She holds out the stack of bills in the green rubber band.

                            PENELOPE
                  You left this money in my kitchen.

     He doesn't take it.

                            BLOOM
                  Yeah, I didn't want it, but thanks.

                  Well I'd never been to Greece. Or
                  Europe. Or outside New Jersey.

                            BLOOM
                  It just seems like a big leap.
                  From where you were at yesterday to
                  being a world traveler.

                            PENELOPE
                  It looked like fun.   I wanted to do
                  it.

                            BLOOM
                  A new hobby.

     Up ahead, Bloom spots a large man in a fur collared cape
     gazing out to sea. He quickly turns Penelope away.

71   EXT. SHUFFLEBOARD DECK - DAY                                 71

     The Chink and Stephen play shuffleboard.     Bloom leads
     Penelope to them.

                            BLOOM
                  Penelope, this is my brother
                  Stephen.

                  Pleased to make your acquaintance.
                  Bloom's told me about you, you're
                  the epileptic photographer?

                             PENELOPE
                  Sort of.

                  This is my personal secretary and
                  masseuse, Mrs. Yuengling.

     A nearly imperceptible glare from the Chink.

                  Yuengling like the beer?

                            PENELOPE
                  I don't plan.

                            STEPHEN
                  Good for you.

     The Chink hits a damn near impossible shuffleboard shot, then
     gives Stephen a pointed deferential giggle-bow.


72   INT. STATE ROOM - NIGHT                                    72

                            STEPHEN
                  I was writing in a bar. And she
                  doesn't drink, how does she know a
                  Philly beer?

                             BLOOM

                  Yes it was. Did he spot you?

     An ominous glance.

     Several small tables scattered about the moonlit deck, Bloom
     and Penelope sit with flutes of champagne. Penelope, in an
     elegant but understated dress, shuffles a pack of cards.

                            BLOOM
                  You look very nice.

     She laughs as if at a joke she doesn't think is funny.

                  Lucky guess.

     Penelope's hands move faster.     She knows how to shuffle
     cards.

                  Well it's funny how everyone's
                  usually got one.

     As Penelope tells her story she gets fancier with her
     shuffles.

                            PENELOPE
                  When I turned six I started getting
                  allergies, hayfever, rashes, really
                  bad. So my mom took me into the
                  doctor, and he did that test where
                  they use needles to prick a grid on
                  your back with all the different
                  toxins, to see which ones you're
                  allergic to. The next day I came
                  in, the doctor lifted up my shirt,
                  and my back looked like a patch of
                  oily, moldy, blackish green double-
                  puff marshmallows. I was allergic
                  to everything. So they sealed the
                  house with plastic and a special
                  ventilation system, and I spent my
                  entire childhood and adolescence
                  indoors. Mostly alone. Lonely.

     She pulls the Queens out of the deck and lays them face up on
     the table.

                         BLOOM
               Wow.

                         PENELOPE
               It wasn't `til I was nineteen they
               discovered what I was actually
               allergic to was the aluminum alloy
               the hypodermic needle was made out
               of. Then I was going to leave, but
               my mom got sick. So I stayed. And
               she stayed sick, a long time.

                         BLOOM
               Do you feel cheated?

     Penelope does an amazing card trick using the four queens.

                         PENELOPE
               The trick to not feeling cheated is
               to learn how to cheat. So I
               decided this wasn't a story about a
               miserable girl trapped in a house
               that smelled like medical supplies
               wasting her life on a dying person
               she sometimes hated. It was about
               a girl who could find infinite
               beauty in anything, any little
               thing. And do anything she decided
               to do. And love the person she was
               trapped with. So I told myself
               that story until it became true.
               Now did doing that let me escape a
               wasted life, or did it just blind
               me so I wouldn't want to escape it?
               I don't know. But either way, I
               was the one telling my own story.
               So I don't feel cheated.

     She finishes the trick.

     A single pair of hands clapping turns their heads. At the
     far end of the deck, alone at a table, the large man in the
     fur collared cape, who for reasons unlikely to become clear
     at the moment will be called THE CURATOR.

                         THE CURATOR
               And a magician is just an actor
               playing the part of a magician.   My
               compliments.

     Bloom takes Penelope gently by the elbow and guides her up
     and away.

                                                                 46
   




74   EXT. BOW - NIGHT                                             74

     They stroll out onto the moonlit bow of the ship.

                         PENELOPE
               Who is that man? You avoided him
               earlier on the deck.

                         BLOOM
               I don't know, but he's carrying a
               knife up his sleeve and wearing a
               cape. Do me a favor and steer
               clear of him.

     A waltz drifts through the air from a band unseen.

                         BLOOM (CONT'D) (cont'd)
               I don't suppose in all your hobby
               acquiring you ever learned how to
               dance?

                         PENELOPE
               I went through a phase when I was
               mildly obsessed with the Bolero.

                         BLOOM
               Give me a minute.

     He leaves her alone. Clouds obscure the moon, shadows
     deepen. She shivers.

     A match strikes.   She jumps.

     The moon re-emerges, and she is no longer alone on the deck.
     The Curator lights a dapper briar pipe, shakes out the match.

                         THE CURATOR
               Mademoiselle.

                           PENELOPE
               Monsieur.

                         THE CURATOR
                   (in French, subtitled)
               I didn't mean to startle you.

                         PENELOPE
                   (in French, subtitled)
               Yes you did.

                            THE CURATOR
                      (in French, subtitled)
                  Apologies, but the deck was dark,
                  and I had to approach.
                      (English)
                  It's been such a time since I've
                  encountered the Brothers Bloom.

                            PENELOPE
                  You're in antiques?

                            THE CURATOR
                      (Cheshire grin)
                  Antiques. I wonder, my dear, if
                  you know the true nature of the men
                  you travel with?

     The band strikes up a Bolero. The Curator flicks his wrist,
     and a long thin blade falls into his hand.

                            THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                  A little fear might suit you, I
                  think.

     He raises the blade... it is in fact a fine mustache brush,
     which he delicately employs.

                            THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                  Bon soir, ma cherie.

     With that the Curator backs into the shadows, and is gone.
     Moments later Bloom trots up to her, oblivious.

                            BLOOM
                  It isn't a Spanish band, but
                  they'll do their best.

     He hands her a single blood red rose. She puts it in her
     teeth, and they dance. If there is a tinge of tension in the
     air, the Bolero suits it.

     The moon ducks behind a cloud once more, and they dance on in
     the dark.


75   INT. STATE ROOM - MORNING                                    75

     Bloom wakes with a start. Morning light pours in through his
     porthole. He opens it, looks out to sea.






                                                              48

     His dinner jacket draped over a chair. The rose in its
     lapel. He fishes it out. Runs his fingers over the teeth
     marks on the stem.

     Then raises an eyebrow at a lump in the breast pocket, and
     pulls out the stack of bills in the green rubber band.




76   EXT. DECK - MORNING                                          76

     The Chink and Penelope lie on their stomachs on the deck, a
     beer can pinhole camera between them.

     Penelope gives a lesson on how it works.

     The Chink appreciates her.


77   EXT. BREAKFAST DECK - LATER                                  77

     Bloom escorts Penelope to breakfast.

                            PENELOPE
                  How'd you find her?

                            BLOOM
                  The Chi-nese, uh, Yeungling?   She
                  found us.


78   INT. KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING (FLASHBACK)                     78

     Bloom cooks breakfast in his bathrobe.

                            BLOOM (O.S.)
                  A few years back, when we hit the
                  top of our art dealing game, she
                  just appeared.

     A door opens and slams. Bloom turns. The Chink sits at his
     place at the table, suitcase beside her, smoking a cigarette.

                            BLOOM (O.S.) (cont'd)
                  She's stuck with us. We figure
                  when she gets bored she'll vanish
                  with the same lack of noise.

     Like feeding a strange animal, Bloom pours her coffee.   She
     drinks it without looking at him.

                                                              49





79   EXT. BREAKFAST DECK                                          79

                         PENELOPE
               I like her.

                           BLOOM
               Good.

     They smile when they see Stephen and the Chink at a table.

     Their smiles drop when they see the Curator sitting with
     them. Bloom glares at the Curator, but speaks to Stephen.

                         BLOOM (cont'd)
               What's he doing here?

                         STEPHEN
               I invited him, sit down. This
               ship's too small to dance around
               each other for a week, we might as
               well have it out now. Bloom. Sit.
               Penelope, do you know our friend?

                         PENELOPE
               Only as the creepy Frenchman.

                         THE CURATOR
               Book-learned. You know languages
               but not accents, my dear. I am
               Belgian. Maxmillion Melville, at
               your service.

                         BLOOM
               Also known in certain professional
               circles as the Curator.

                         PENELOPE
               Pleased to make your acquaintance.
               What do you do?

                         THE CURATOR
               I'm a curator, presently for the
               National Museum in Prague. And
               yourself?

                         PENELOPE
               I'm an epileptic photographer.

               do?

                  We've gone straight, Max.

                             THE CURATOR
                  Pardon, but you do not ascend to
                  the grand heights of the Brothers
                  Bloom only to toss it all and sell
                  terra cotta to blue haired weekend

                  But Mademoiselle appears...
                  confused. Perhaps she is unawares?

                  Eat your waffles, fat man.

                            THE CURATOR
                  Unaware that the Brothers Bloom are
                  in fact the two most highly
                  respected art smugglers in the
                  western world?

                            STEPHEN
                  Were. We've been on the straight
                  for three years. So that's that.

                            THE CURATOR
                  Well, if that is that, then that is
                  indeed that. As you say.

     Penelope snaps her fingers.     Everyone looks up.

               Sorry, no, cause I noticed but I
               couldn't place it, this ship is the
               Fidele, which was the ship in
               Melville's novel "The Confidence
               Man." So that's weird.

               Huh.


80   INT. DECK - NIGHT                                         80

     Bloom paces, Stephen shuffles cards.

                         BLOOM
               I know you like to throw those
               clever little details in, but
               you've gotta watch that shit with
               her Stephen. She had a lot of time
               alone in that house, and she used
               it. She did the best Double Dutch
               Queens I've ever seen up on the
               deck last night.

                         STEPHEN
               Double Dutch Queens uses gaffed
               cards.

                         BLOOM
               She had them in her purse and cut
               them in while I was folding my
               napkin.

                         STEPHEN
               Jesus.

                         BLOOM
               That's what I'm saying. She's
               different, she knows, sometimes it
               feels like she knows everything.
               Doesn't that worry you?

                         STEPHEN
               No. But something about her is
               worrying you plenty.

                         BLOOM
               She feels like one of your
               characters.



                                                                   52

                  The day I con you is the day I die,
                  Bloom.

                             BLOOM
                  I know that.
                      (beat)
                  How did you get the Belgian, on our
                  budget?

                  He's beautiful, right?

                            BLOOM
                  I didn't expect him to actually be
                  Belgian.

                            STEPHEN
                  I'm not sure he is.   I'm to bed.

     Stephen stands to go, then pauses.

                            STEPHEN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                  I've always protected you, right?
                  The only real danger in this whole
                  play is that you'll actually fall
                  in love with her. Look at me.
                  Don't fall in love with her.


81   EXT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS                                     81

     The Chink sits smoking her whittled pipe, watching Bloom
     alone on the deck. Stephen passes her, and she stops him
     with a look.

                             STEPHEN
                  Shut up.   I know what I'm doing.

     She hands him a thin piece of paper.       He looks it over.

                            STEPHEN (cont'd)
                  This came through just now?

     The paper is a telegram with the Fidele's imprint, received
     from St. Petersburg. Stephen reads it.




    

                                                                   53

                            STEPHEN (cont'd)
                  "My dear Stephen STOP Word on the

                  Dog.

     He crumples the paper, looks down at Bloom.

                            STEPHEN (cont'd)
                  Wire him back for me. "Dear Dog

                  excess of eyes left in your head

83   EXT. DECK - MORNING                                            83

     Bloom and Penelope lie on the deck, watching dolphins.

     She says this word like she's eating chocolate:

                            PENELOPE
                  Smugglers. It's like an adventure
                  story. Whose idea was it to go
                  straight?

                            BLOOM
                  Mine. Stephen always loved the
                  life. Then he was almost killed on
                  a run to Jakarta, two thugs with
                  heads like canned hams worked him
                  beyond all reason.


84   EXT. JAKARTA PIER - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                          84

     Stephen is set upon by two thugs.    He rushes them.

                            STEPHEN
                  Have at thee, you ham headed
                  bastards!

85   EXT. DECK - MORNING                                      85

                         BLOOM
               And I called it, that was it.

                           PENELOPE
               Scary.

                         BLOOM
               For me. Stephen enjoyed it. He
               loved the idea that we were
               internationally infamous art
               smugglers, but I think deep down,
               same as me, he felt like we were
               putting on a persona, faking it.

                         PENELOPE
               Telling a story.

                         BLOOM
               He'd love to die on a job.
               Cornered at midnight on a run to
               Jakarta. That's his dream, to tell
               his story so well it fulfills
               itself. It somehow would make it
               finally real for him.

                         PENELOPE
               That's kinda the thing we all want,
               right?

     He looks at her in the sun.

                         BLOOM
               Trying to get something real by
               telling yourself stories is a trap.
               Trust me on that one.


86   EXT. GRECIAN PORT - DAY                                  86

     Kalamata, if it matters.

     The Fidele docked in bright blue water. Our intrepid heroes
     stand aside a dusty road, surrounded by their luggage.

     The Curator approaches, tips his hat to them.

                         THE CURATOR
               Best of luck with the antiquing,
               boys. Au revoir, Chinois.

                      (to Penelope)
                  Mademoiselle. Mes restes d'offre.

     With a wink, he is gone.     A beat.   Penelope stands apart.

                            BLOOM
                  My French is a little rusty, but I
                  believe he just told you `my offer
                  stands.'

                            PENELOPE
                  He came out of nowhere last night.

     Penelope taking air on the moonlit deck.     The Curator
     dissolves out of the darkness.

                            PENELOPE (V.O.)
                  Whatever's in his pipe, it made me
                  thick.

     He brings her face close to hers, smoke twisting, and speaks
     unheard words low and fast.


88   EXT. GRECIAN PORT - MORNING                                     88

                  Oh lord.   What has he got?

                            PENELOPE
                  An 8th century prayer book.

                            PENELOPE (V.O.)
                  From his museum in Prague, stashed
                  in the castle.

     Up to the base of the castle, through a grated hole in an
     ancient wall, into...


90   INT. MUSEUM VAULT                                               90

     A stunning illuminated manuscript lies open on a stone table.
     The Curator's hands close it gently and take it away.

                  A book of hours.

                            PENELOPE (V.O.)
                  Yeah. Medieval art bores the crap
                  out of me so I don't know it that
                  well. So that's what he does, he
                  makes pieces in his collections
                  disappear, then sells them off via
                  a trusted middleman.

                  That's what he does.

                            STEPHEN
                  Wonder who's his fence?

                            BLOOM
                  Probably his Spanish guy, right?
                      (asks Penelope)
                  Did he say who's buying?

                            PENELOPE

                  A gentleman from Argentina. He's
                  quite sick, cancer in his bones,
                  and desperate for sentimental
                  reasons to own this piece while he
                  may.

                  one million, US. The Argentin...a
                  guy will pay two point five.

                             STEPHEN
                  Not bad.

                            PENELOPE
                  Is he legit?

                  The Curator? That's a relative
                  term. He's telling the truth.

                            BLOOM
                  I'm sorry you had to deal with that
                  guy.

     Behind Penelope, two porters load her steamer trunk into the
     back of a taxi.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)

     Bloom breathes.

                  Let's do it. Let's, just, I want
                  to try this. Let's be smugglers.
                  I think it'd be fun. We should do
                  this.

                             BLOOM
                  No.

                  I do, I've got, that's whatever.   I
                  mean a real reason.

                  This is real, it's dangerous, it
                  could go very bad.

                            PENELOPE

     Stephen reclines, hat on his face.    Bloom paces.

                         STEPHEN
               Take it easy. She's having fun,
               that's the point of this.

                         BLOOM
               She's making a flag for our
               "smugglers gang," man. She made me
               learn a secret smugglers handshake.
               Unhealthy. This afternoon, when
               she was writing, in the observation
               car? A letter? A journal? No.
               She is getting way too into this.

     Bloom fishes a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket and
     thrusts it in front of Stephen's face.

     On it are written dozens of variations in stylized fonts of
     "Penelope the smuggler."

                         BLOOM (cont'd)
               She's been singing the Smuggler
               Song since Athens.

                         STEPHEN
               What Smugglers Song?

                  isn't... there isn't a Smuggler
                  Song, is there? Ok. She made up a
                  Smuggler Song. With hand motions.

                            STEPHEN
                  The whole point of this was to
                  sweep her off her feet. Let her
                  enjoy it.

                            BLOOM

                  Nothing lasts.

     Exit Bloom.    Stephen sighs and drops his hat back on his
     face.


96   INT. BLOOM'S SLEEPING CAR                                    96

     Bloom reads. Footsteps pound by outside. Penelope and the
     Chink run past his door. A moment later a uniformed
     ATTENDANT runs past.

     A beat, then the footsteps come back, and the girls duck into
     Bloom's cabin, slamming the door. Sacks in their teeth.

     Off Bloom's quizzical look:

                               PENELOPE
                  Smuggling.     From the snack car.

     They pull bags of chips and tiny liquor bottles from their
     sacks.

     Bloom glares at the Chink, who tries to avoid his gaze.

                  Jameson.

                            BLOOM
                  I'm not paying for that.

     She holds up two fingers, the Attendant pours two.

                             ATTENDANT
                  Ice?

     She says no with a look, they drink.

                            BLOOM
                  She made up the Smuggler Song.

     The Chink nods.      Bloom pays for the Jameson.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  I thought it was a Disney thing.


98   INT. PENELOPE'S SLEEPING CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT              98

     The lights are off. Penelope reclines on the bed, surrounded
     by empty tiny gin bottles. Drunk.

     Bloom sits on the floor, both framed in a big window looking
     out on a breathtaking moonlit landscape rolling hypnotically
     by.

                            PENELOPE
                  Gin is fuckin fruity. Have you
                  taken this train before?

                             BLOOM
                  Yeah.

                            PENELOPE
                  So this is all like fuckin
                  `whatever' to you.

                            BLOOM
                  I usually drink with the Chink in
                  the snack car, play cards.

                            PENELOPE
                  With the who?


 

                                                               61

     Oops.

                            BLOOM
                  Mrs. Yeungling. That's her
                  smuggler nickname.

                            PENELOPE
                  That's offensive.

                            BLOOM
                  I think if it were offensive to
                  her, she'd let us know.

                            PENELOPE
                  Do I get a smuggler nickname?

     Bloom quietly slips the stack of cash in the green rubber
     band into Penelope's luggage.

                            BLOOM
                  No.

                            PENELOPE
                  I think you're constipated.   In
                  your fuckin soul.

     Bloom makes several attempts to form a response to this
     before giving up.

                            BLOOM
                  What?

                            PENELOPE
                  You've got a big load of grumpy
                  petrified poop up your ass, I'm
                  just calling you out on it. Yeah
                  I'm pretending I'm a smuggler, so
                  you know what? I'm a fuckin
                  smuggler. If that's your thing,
                  fuckin tell it like you own it.
                  When you've got a spotlight in
                  front of your feet, man, fuckin
                  jump into it and dance the shit out
                  of it. Stop fuckin thinking so
                  much. Enjoy the fuckin ride.
                  Fuck.

     A roll of thunder and spectacular flash of lightning ignites
     the landscape, and rain starts to patter. Penelope stiffens.

                            PENELOPE (cont'd)
                  Whoa.

 

                                                                62

                Shh.    I love thunderstorms.

      Another crash. Lying on her stomach, Penelope slowly starts
      feeling something which makes her undulate. Bloom stares,
      confused.

                          PENELOPE (cont'd)
                Whoa ha. Oh ho ho. Ohhhhhh whoooo
                ha ha ha ha.

      Beneath her, the train wheels rhythmically clack and vibrate
      against the tracks. Another flash of lightening, the rain
      falls harder.

      Penelope writhes.   Bloom silently shrinks back in terror.

                          PENELOPE (cont'd)

      The door to her car latches, and Bloom is gone.


99    INT. SNACK CAR - NIGHT                                        99

      Bloom sits drinking and playing cards with the Chink.    He
      spaces out, she snaps her fingers to wake him up.

                          BLOOM

      looming before them.

      Penelope slumps pale faced in dark glasses.

      t-shirt, takes pictures with one of several cameras around
      her neck.

106   INT. APARTMENT STAIRCASE - DAY                              106

      A baroque spiral staircase, the spine of a high apartment
      building. Our intrepid four ring the bell beside an
      apartment door.

                             THE CURATOR (FROM INSIDE)
                   Who the hell is that?! Who is it?!

                   Candy-Gram. It's us, Max.

      Stephen pushes open the door, and an instant later a SHOTGUN
      BLAST takes out a chunk of the landing beside his head.

      They all dive onto the floor, piling on top of each other.

                             THE CURATOR (FROM INSIDE)
                   Who the hell are you, what do you

      whoa!                             whoa now!

      The Curator stands in the smoky apartment hallway, sloppily
      draped in a ratty bathrobe, bottle in one hand and shotgun in
      the other. He squints at them.

                             THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                   Ah. Good morning. Come in. I

107   INT. THE CURATOR'S APARTMENT - LATER                        107

      A schematic of the castle laid on the kitchen table. The
      Curator looks even worse in the light, red rimmed eyes, heavy
      skin on his face.

                             THE CURATOR
                   Here, off the Basilica, are offices
                   of administration, and beneath
                   those, an otherwise inaccessible
                   section of catacombs. And the
                   book.

                   Administrative offices.    So how do
                   you steal the book?

                             THE CURATOR
                   The book is already stolen. The
                   stealing is in the bureaucracy, in
                   the filing, red tape. As far as
                   the museum is concerned, the book
                   does not exist. I am the curator,
                   I walk in, pinch the copy girl's
                   baboosh, put the book in a
                   briefcase and walk out. Tomorrow,
                   say, at two.

                             STEPHEN
                   Today.

                             THE CURATOR
                   Today is not a good day.

                             STEPHEN
                   Tomorrow. Now what about this
                   Argentinian.

                   Belguta Rioso. I get his file.


108   INT. CURATORS APARTMENT BEDROOM - LATER                     108

      Penelope and Bloom wander into the bedroom, looking at an
      array of beautiful paintings on the wall.

                   Gin is slow death, man.

      Stephen and the Chink poke their heads in, leaving.   The
      Curator strolls in.

                   We'll see you back at the hotel.
                       (glances at the Curator)
                   Soon.

      They go, leaving Bloom and Penelope, who squints at an
      unframed oil on canvas, of a lonely stone well in a primeval
      forest clearing. It sits at the foot of an unmade bed.

                   From a private collection on the

                   Why is it the last thing you see
                   every night, and the first thing
                   you see every morning?

                             THE CURATOR
                   That's a story. You have a minute?

      He closes the blinds and sits on a stool in front of the
      painting. Setting the stage.

                             THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                   My daughter travelled with me when
                   she was very young, and I'd show
                   her the places and the art, all the
                   most joyous and terrifying things
                   in the world.

      Memories of his daughter's hand in his, flashing against the
      sun.

                             THE CURATOR (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                   I wanted that the world was alive
                   in the most fantastic way for her.
                   To built her a pair of wings. Make
                   these things real. But maybe more
                   than any other objet d'art, she
                   loved to hear she'd ask to hear the
                   story of the stone golem. From a
                   painting in a small private
                   collection on the island of Ikaria.

      He motions to the painting, and we move into it. As he tells
      the story the scenes are shown in the painting, just as still
      images, which we move across like a picture book.

                   Well Rachel, like most monsters the
                   Golem was once a human. A boy,

                home, and he quarrelled, he fought,
                with a good friend of his. They
                got very angry and his friend
                pushed him a certain way and the
                boy fell and struck his head and
                died. The boy's friend was very
                sad but also very frightened. So
                instead of telling the boy's
                parents, he did something awful.
                He pulled the body into a quarry, a
                pit of broken rocks, and hid the
                boy beneath a pile of large stones.
                Well. Years went by, and the boy's
                friend became a young man, and one
                day while drinking in town (which
                in his guilt he did quite a lot of)
                he heard that a well was being
                built near the forest... with the
                stones from the quarry. He ran to
                the quarry to find it nearly
                empty... no stones, no body. He
                ran to the well where the masons
                were finishing their work. `Did
                they find anything strange in the
                quarry?' he asked, expecting, maybe
                hoping they'd arrest him for the
                awful crime on the spot. But no,
                they said, motioning to the well.
                Nothing strange. Just stones.
                They left him alone there at the
                well, and he stood looking into it
                as the sun fell behind the
                mountains and twilight set the
                world in a deep, still silence.

      The last image we land on is the well, alone in the clearing.

      Its dark innards loom ominously in the long pregnant silence
      that follows.

      Then, with a piercing ROAR, a living monster of stone lunges
      out of the well, animated and terrifying, grabs the friend by
      the throat and with a crunching of bones and one last roar
      pulls him back down into the depths of the well.

      Silence again. We pull out of the painting, back to the
      Curator, sitting very still.

                          THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                My daughter died nineteen years ago
                today. She was six. She went out
                to play one afternoon and vanished.

                                                                 68

                          THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                The next morning we found her, in a
                stone well on a neighboring
                property. I climbed down to her,
                but slipped and broke my leg, and
                while we waited for the rescue team
                to pull us out she died in my arms.
                If you've had a child... my whole
                everything just focused down to one
                thing, to hold her and make her
                feel safe. But no matter what I
                said to her, I couldn't stop her
                shaking, crying. Her last moments
                on this earth were filled with
                terror. Of a stone golem.

      He stands, opens the blinds, pours another drink.

                          THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                It was the first painting I
                `acquired.' I keep it maybe hoping
                some night the golem will come for
                me.


109   INT. APARTMENT STAIRCASE - MOMENTS LATER                   109

      Bloom trots out, ahead of Penelope.

                          THE CURATOR
                Mademoiselle.

      Bloom keeps going, anxious to leave, but Penelope lingers on
      the staircase. The Curator comes out.

                          THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                It is you I do business with, yes?

                           PENELOPE
                Right.   Oh, right.

      She gives him the envelope with the certified check. He
      shakes her hand, then deftly adjusts his grip so that just
      for a moment he holds her hand as you would hold a child's.

      He lets go, and smiles apologetically.

                             THE CURATOR
                Au revoir.

                                                                 69
   




110   EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - DAY                                  110

      Penelope and Bloom stroll home in silence through crowded,
      vibrant cobblestone streets.

                          PENELOPE
                You aren't constipated. You're
                scared. What are you scared of?

      They walk on, suddenly somehow holding hands.

      As they approach the hotel, Bloom deftly breaks their hand
      holding off. Penelope notices why.


111   INT. PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS                        111

      Stephen, up in the window watching them approach.   He recedes
      into the room.


112   EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - NIGHT                                112

      The sun sets against the castle, taking us into night.


113   INT. PRAGUE HOTEL BAR - NIGHT                              113

      Bloom drinks alone, sketching Penelope's face with a pencil.
      A smell breaks his concentration.

                          BLOOM
                Diamond Dog, carrying a cup and a
                cane.

      Standing behind him, a soft old man in an ashy suit and
      eyepatch. The DIAMOND DOG.

                           DIAMOND DOG
                Bloom. How long has it been?
                     (sits, orders)
                Tea.
                     (to Bloom)
                Can you believe that? Tea? Been a
                long while.

                          BLOOM
                If I call Stephen down he'll kill
                you.





                                                                  70
    
113   CONTINUED:                                                  113


                             DIAMOND DOG
                   Well then please don't call Stephen
                   down. Look at you, you're
                   terrified. C'mon now, look. Take
                   a look. I'm an old man with no
                   depth perception. You don't have
                   to be scared of me.

      The Dog plays with a heavy gold lighter, making sparks.

                             DIAMOND DOG (cont'd)
                   It's been a funny thing, watching
                   you boys take what I taught you and
                   eclipse me. I'm so proud to be a
                   footnote in the lives of the
                   Brothers Bloom. And you hate me.
                   The curse of all bad fathers - that
                   my presence on this earth after I
                   die will not live on the lips of
                   admiring men, but will sink into
                   the murky backwaters of my
                   children's psyches.

                             BLOOM
                   Is this profundity?   Cause you can
                   skip it.

                              DIAMOND DOG
                   Ha!   Ha ha. Piss and vinegar.

      The Dog scoots next to Bloom.

                             DIAMOND DOG (cont'd)
                   When I first took you boys in,
                   showed you the ropes, haunting St.
                   Pete's, piss and vinegar. I still
                   crave that youthful joy. Even
                   today.

      The Dog's hand touches Bloom's leg.     There is something
      horrible about this.

      Beneath the bar, Bloom grips the sharp pencil like a knife.

                             BLOOM
                   Don't touch me.

                             DIAMOND DOG
                   You probably won't believe I loved
                   you boys very much.



   

                                                               71
 
113   CONTINUED: (2)                                           113


                          BLOOM
                You're going to take your hand away
                or I'm going to break your arm,
                there's nothing between.

      He does, but Bloom's fingers don't loosen on the pencil.

                          DIAMOND DOG
                But love, you know. We know, folks
                like us, you can always blink and
                realize that it's a fiction, and
                like Peter walking on water or
                Wiley Coyote running off a cliff,
                if you look down in doubt you'll
                fall. That's the price of our
                lives, the wax in our wings. One
                day Stephen's going to fall. It
                may be glorious, but he's going to
                fall hard and he won't be there to
                tell you what to do and protect
                you. When he's gone, remember me.

      The Dog has moved in very close to Bloom, his breath hot on
      his face, and his hand comes to rest fully on Bloom's leg.

      Bloom's hand with the pencil quivers, about to strike-

      When Bloom is pulled from the bar stool by a heavy hand.
      Stephen, his eyes burning through the Dog.

                          DIAMOND DOG (cont'd)
                Hello Stephen.

      Stephen smashes a bottle from the bar and slashes it across
      the Dog's hand.

      Waiters and porters tackle him, the Dog howls, holding his
      bleeding hand. Bloom stands numb, and puts the pencil in his
      pocket.


114   EXT. PRAGUE HOTEL - NIGHT                                  114

      Bloom watches the Dog get into a waiting black Mercedes. For
      an instant the car's interior light shows an 11 year old boy
      behind the tinted glass, as the Dog slides in and puts his
      arm around him.

      The Mercedes drives off.

                                                                72
  




115   EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - NIGHT                               115

      Right in front of the hotel, on the water. Bloom sips coffee
      from a china cup, spinning a paper in his hands. Stephen
      joins him, with a matching cup.

                          STEPHEN
                I'm sorry I wasn't there.

                          BLOOM
                You can't always be there.

                          STEPHEN
                No, I guess can't.

      A beat.

                          BLOOM
                That was a real tonal shift.    The
                Curator's tale.

      On one side of the paper is the sketch of Penelope, on the
      other is the con flowchart. "#12 - The Curator's Tale."
      "#14 - Castle Break-In."

                          STEPHEN
                I'm a big fan of tonal shifts. I
                didn't write it for him, though.

                          BLOOM
                He made it up on the spot?

                          STEPHEN
                I don't know.


116   INT. BLOOM'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                           116

      Bloom flops into bed.   He turns and looks at the wall.

      Right on the other side of it...


117   INT. PENELOPE'S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS                   117

      Penelope lies in bed, looking at the wall also.   She closes
      her eyes.

                                                                  73
    




118   INT. BLOOM'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                             118

      Bloom's breathing slows.   He closes his eyes.

      A beat. Then light snoring breaks the silence, coming
      through the wall. Penelope snoring.

      Bloom smiles slightly.   What a cute snore.

      The snoring deepens slightly.

      The clock on the wall advances from 1:30am to 5:50am, and
      through the window the horizon glows with the approach of
      dawn.

      Bloom lies wide awake on his back, red rimmed eyes wide open,
      the guttural snoring ringing in his ears.


119   INT. APARTMENT STAIRCASE - MORNING                          119

      Our four at the Curator's door. Bloom knocks, and they all
      step judiciously back. No response.

                           STEPHEN
                Max?

                          BLOOM
                We're a little early...


120   INT. THE CURATOR'S APARMENT - MORNING                       120

      Still and silent in the breaking light of morning.

      And totally empty.   Picked clean down to the bare walls.

      The only thing left in the apartment is the painting of the
      well... broken on the floor.

      Our intrepid four stand in various states of thoughtfulness.
      Penelope stares at the painting, Bloom at the window.

                          PENELOPE
                The Golem came for him. In my
                dream. Crawled out of the painting
                and killed him in a horrible way.






                                                                74

                             BLOOM
                   Well at least he had the decency to
                   just skip out on us, not do
                   something tacky like fake his own
                   death.

      Poking around the room, Bloom opens a closet. The Curator
      stands pressed against the back wall in his pajamas.

                             THE CURATOR
                       (sotto)
                   You're a little early.

      Bloom quickly closes it.

                             STEPHEN
                   I don't get it. If he was
                   hightailing it he could have waited
                   eight hours till we traded the
                   million for the book, and had some
                   traveling money. Well. Back to
                   antiquing. Nothing gained, nothing
                   lost.
                       (to Penelope)
                   And you got to see Prague, which is
                   nice.

      Penelope's eyes widen with realization.

                             PENELOPE
                   Oh.

                             BLOOM
                   You should stay in the city for
                   awhile, they have these amazing
                   puppet show opera things-

      But Stephen raises a hand to shut him up.

                             STEPHEN
                   Oh?


121   EXT. SIDEWALK BAR - DAY                                     121

      Several empty glasses of wine, one full one in Penelope's
      hand. All heads are slumped.

                             PENELOPE
                   Oh.





                                                                    75

                             BLOOM
                   It's my fault. I can't believe I
                   left you alone with him.

      The Chink hands Stephen a piece of paper.       He glances at it.

                             STEPHEN
                   The check was cashed yesterday
                   afternoon, he'd have deposited it
                   in a Swiss account. I'm sorry Pen.

                             PENELOPE
                   What a waste.

      Bloom puts his hand on her arm, sympathetic.

                             PENELOPE (cont'd)
                   That poor man. What a waste.

      Bloom's expression turns quizzical.

                             PENELOPE (cont'd)
                   That poor Argentina man. He'll
                   never see the book now, it'll just
                   rot in the catacombs. What a
                   waste.

      When Penelope lifts her suddenly brightened eyes in a moment
      of divine inspiration, Bloom meets her gaze with fear.


122   EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE, PRAGUE - DAY                             122

      Bloom paces, Penelope looks up at the castle with binoculars.
      The Chink and Stephen stand by.

                             BLOOM
                   No. No no. Can't you see what
                   happened here, there is no book,
                   we've been swindled -

                             PENELOPE
                   But maybe there is, maybe it's
                   real, we don't know!

                             BLOOM
                   It's not real, it's a con.

                             PENELOPE
                   It's my money, I'm going to find
                   out for sure. He gave us every
                   piece of information we need.

  

                                                                  76

      She spreads the castle floor plan out on a bench.

      Bloom turns to Stephen and the Chink with a "this is crazy
      right?" expression and gesture. They give him nothing back.

                             STEPHEN
                   We'd need to clear the
                   administrative offices.   Some sort
                   of disruption.

      The Chink strokes her chin in mock-thoughtfulness.

                             PENELOPE
                       (to Bloom)
                   C'mon. Help me break into this
                   castle. It'll be fun.


123   EXT. FIELD - DAY                                            123

      A Barbie Doll set up in the middle of the field explodes in a
      theatrical plume of fire.

      Several others follow suit.

      The Chink pops up from behind a mound of dirt in her aviator
      goggles, cigarette dangling from her lip. She leans on a
      detonator plunger.

      Bloom, Stephen and Penelope crouch nearby, watching her work.

                             STEPHEN
                   She's an artist with nitroglycerin.
                   It's kind of her thing.

                              PENELOPE
                   I feel like I want to know more
                   about her.



                    BLOOM                            STEPHEN
      Yeah.                             Yeah.

                             STEPHEN
                   Check the tat.

      On the back of the Chink's neck, a few finely scripted lines
      of Chinese.






                                                                77

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   An inky wisp of personal
                   information. We transcribed it,
                   brought it into a Chinese
                   restaurant.

                             PENELOPE
                   What's it say?

                             BLOOM
                   The literal translation is
                   something about water cranes, but
                   essentially it means "When you're
                   done with something, blow it up."


124   INT. PENELOPE'S PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - EVENING               124

      The Chink lies on the floor with Penelope, showing her how to
      build a tiny remotely detonated bomb. She slices a tiny bit
      off a brick of dynamite, sets it in a petri dish with a
      detonator, and puts the whole thing in a handbag.

      Penelope appreciates her.

      Bloom and Stephen hunker over the castle floorplan.

                             STEPHEN
                   There's a smoke detector in these
                   empty rooms in the east tower. So
                   we plant and set off a tiny -
                       (to the Chink)
                   TINY tiny, tiny charge.

      The Chink clicks a seemingly innocent ballpoint pen. With a
      BEEP, a tiny poof of fire plumes from the handbag setting it
      on fire, and the smoke rises to the ceiling.

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   Fire drill ensues, offices empty,
                   and you'll have exactly four and a
                   half minutes to get through the
                   access hatch, into the catacombs,
                   get the book and get out before the
                   fire department arrives.

      Penelope and the Chink do their elaborate handshake, and she
      gives Stephen and Bloom a finger snap thumbs up.

                                                                  78
    




125   INT. PENELOPE'S HOTEL ROOM - LATER                             125

      Bloom and Penelope, up late at the table.     Going over the
      floorplan one more time.

                          BLOOM
                So straight down the corridor,
                again, tell me where.

                          PENELOPE
                Second left, third right, access
                hatch behind the copier, I need to
                sleeeeeeep...

                          BLOOM
                The abort code if we need to abort
                is "corned beef." For some reason.

                          PENELOPE
                Bloom, I need to sleep.

      He folds up the plans, she wraps up the brick of dynamite and
      bomb components and spots a black leather backpack beside an
      open handbag on the table.

                          PENELOPE (cont'd)
                Is this Yeungling's backpack?

                            BLOOM
                Yeah.

      She gently puts the brick of stabilized nitroglycerin inside
      the front zipper compartment, and sets the tiny petri-dish
      bomb beside the handbag.

                          PENELOPE
                You know what I feel?

                            BLOOM
                Horny?

                          PENELOPE
                Scared. All my big talk.       But this
                isn't a story, it's real.      Fuckin
                scary.

      She kisses him.    He kisses her back.






                                                                 79

      The pure whole hearted sensuality with which they attack each
      other and the deluge of almost child-like need let loose in
      this one simple act quickly reaches a point where as a viewer
      we no longer feel comfortable intruding with our gaze.

      Fifteen seconds after this point, we FADE OUT.


126   EXT. PRAGUE - DAWN                                         126

      The sun arcs into the sky above the castle.


127   INT. PENELOPE'S PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - DAWN                   127

      Bloom half wakes.

      Across the landscape of the bed, Penelope sleeps.   Sunlight
      on her body and her sleeping face.

      Distant KNOCKING.     From the next room over.

      Bloom's eyes snap open.    He scampers.


128   EXT. PRAGUE HOTEL WINDOW LEDGE - DAWN CONTINUOUS           128

      In his boxers, holding trousers and shirt in his teeth, Bloom
      swings over the ledge from Penelope's window into his.


129   INT. BLOOM'S PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - DAWN CONTINUOUS           129

      He opens the door for Stephen, who regards him narrowly.

                             STEPHEN
                   Ready?


130   INT. PENELOPE'S PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - MORNING                130

      The Chink picks up the backpack, handbag and petri dish bomb.


131   INT. PENELOPE'S PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - MORNING                131

      Penelope folds a plastic bag and puts it under her jacket.


132   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - DAY                         132

      A little alcove with a good view of the castle.

 

                                                               80

      Stephen trains his gaze on one set of windows high in the
      Eastern tower. Bloom paces.


133   INT. EASTERN TOWER ROOM - CONTINUOUS                        133

      An empty storage room, half under construction. The Chink
      walks in, wearing the backpack and carrying the handbag. She
      goes straight for a spot just under a smoke detector.


134   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - CONTINUOUS                   134

      Stephen, Bloom and Penelope are joined by the Chink.

                              STEPHEN
                   Ok.

      He looks through his binoculars again.

                              BLOOM
                   Alright?

                              PENELOPE
                   Ok.

      They share a brief moment with their eyes, and Penelope trots
      off. The Chink caught it. She looks at Bloom slyly.

                             BLOOM
                   For the record, I'm still against
                   this. Why send her in alone?

      The Chink finds a way to casually smell Bloom's fingers.

                             STEPHEN
                   Because going in alone is a very
                   important thing to do. She's
                   walking into a zero security
                   tourism office during a fire drill
                   and taking a five hundred dollar
                   manuscript replica from a utility
                   crawlspace. Worst case scenario, a
                   file clerk asks if she's lost.
                   Which isn't even going to happen.
                       (to the Chink)
                   She's in position.

      He spots Penelope casually waiting beside an unmarked door.

      Bloom notices the Chink looking at him with a knowing grin.
      She mimes sealing her lips and tossing the key.



                                                                       81

      She then takes the ballpoint pen detonator... out of the
      handbag dangling at her hip.

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   Cause nobody's going to know we
                   were ever here.

      Bloom spots the handbag.         Something's not right.

                               BLOOM
                   Uh-

      The Chink clicks the pen.


135   INT. EASTERN TOWER ROOM - CONTINUOUS                             135

      The black backpack, sitting under the smoke alarm, beeps.


136   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - CONTINUOUS                        136

      A THUNDEROUS EXPLOSION blows a massive ten foot wide chunk
      out of the side of the Eastern tower, spewing a painfully
      dramatic ball of fire and debris.

      Screams.   Shouts.      Panic.

      Our three look up at the tower, agape.

                               THE CHINK
                   Fuck me.

      Bloom grabs the binoculars from Stephen, looks for Penelope.


137   EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY                                      137

      Panicked tourists stumble away from the descending dust.
      Penelope sees what's happened, but holds her ground.

      The unmarked door opens, and a dozen business people pour
      out.

                   don't-



     

                                                                  82

                   They're locking down the castle,
                   she won't get in.


139   EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY                                 139

      She takes a step towards the door.


140   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - DAY                          140

      Bloom drops the binoculars and sprints.


141   EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY                                 141

      A burly SECURITY GUARD trots across the courtyard, herding
      tourists and smoking a cigar.

                             SECURITY GUARD
                   To ze back, no panic, to ze back...

      He blocks the office door, and sets his cigar down for a
      moment. Penelope spots it.


142   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - DAY                          142

      Bloom nears the courtyard, sees Penelope up ahead.

                             BLOOM
                   Pen! Don't - abort!   Corned beef!
                   Corned beef!


143   EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY                                 143

      Penelope deftly spins the cigar 180 degrees.

      The Guard absently picks it up and puts it back in his mouth,
      fire-side first. He howls, doubles over.

      She dashes into the door.

      Bloom bursts out of the crowd and lunges for the door, but a
      SECOND SECURITY GUARD stops him.

      Dozens more security guards swarm in. Overhead, an army
      helicopter buzzes by. Bloom stares into the doorway,
      helpless and scared.

                                                                 83
   




144   INT. TOURISM OFFICE HALLWAYS - DAY                         144

      Water rains down from the ceiling sprinklers.   Penelope
      weaves through the halls.


145   INT. COPY ROOM - DAY                                       145

      Cramped, ill lit, and with its own sprinkler.

      Penelope dashes in, shoulders the massive cold war era copy
      machine and with a Herculean effort pulls it away from the
      wall.

                          PENELOPE
                I'm in Prague. I burned a man's
                lips off to break into a castle in
                Prague.

      Revealing an access hatch.


146   INT. CRAWLSPACE                                            146

      Tiny, earthy.   Penelope shuts the hatch behind her.

      Light from a barred window illuminates a rectangular shape
      lying on a stone slab. Penelope approaches the small BOOK OF
      HOURS reverently.


147   EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - DAY                                  147

      A full view of the castle reveals just about the worst case
      scenario. The entire area swarms with army helicopters and
      tanks, soldiers with rifles, yellow tape, news crews.

      Stephen, Bloom and the Chink sit behind the police line on
      the bridge with the rest of the crowds. Heads in their
      hands.


148   INT. CRAWLSPACE                                            148

      Penelope is broken out of her stupor by heavy footsteps all
      around her, soldiers searching the castle.

      Voices right outside the hatch.   She slides the wimpy little
      bolt shut. It rattles.

      She looks up - a moldy vent in the muddy ceiling.

                                                               84
 




149   EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - DAY                                149

      Bloom suddenly stands.

                          BLOOM
                Wait. Wait, we're fine. She's
                fine. If the soldiers find her
                wandering the halls they'll assume
                she's a clerk, they'll just shoo
                her out. So as long as she doesn't
                do anything suspicious, she's fine.


150   INT. VENTILATION DUCT                                    150

      Penelope wriggles on her belly through a tin ventilation duct
      barely big enough for her. The book, encased in the plastic
      bag, hangs from her teeth.

      Sounds of soldiers searching the offices come from below her.

      Up ahead she sees a point of light. With a gleeful grunt she
      shimmies faster - she's nearly made it!


151   INT. TOURISM OFFICE - CONTINUOUS                         151

      A dozen SOLDIERS and the CHIEF OF POLICE have their eyes (and
      guns) trained on the tin ventilation duct above their heads.

      It is very very obvious not only that a person is crawling
      through it, but exactly where that person is.

      The Chief of Police pointedly coughs to get her attention.


152   INT. VENTILATION DUCT                                    152

      Penelope freezes.   A beat of silence.

      The tin gives way, and she plummets...


153   INT. TOURISM OFFICE - DAY                                153

      ...hitting the ground hard, then springing to her feet and
      through some knee-jerk primal instinct kicking a nearby
      soldier in the head.

      Eleven rifles cock and aim at her.




                                                                    85
      
153   CONTINUED:                                                    153


      And that's how she's caught, frozen in a kung fu stance,
      plastic bag in her teeth.

      She locks eyes with the Chief of Police.      Lets the bag drop
      from her teeth.

      And opens her mouth to speak.


154   EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - AFTERNOON                               154

      The hubbub has died down considerably, soldiers march away
      from the castle in formation. Bloom Stephen and the Chink
      sit watching for some sign.

      Three police cars, sirens blazing, drive down the length of
      the bridge.

                             BLOOM
                   The Chief of Police.

      As the last one passes, Bloom sees the Chief of Police riding
      shotgun, and Penelope sitting with a soldier behind caged
      mesh in the back seat.

      His face falls.

      Then Penelope spots him, points and says something.

      Very suddenly, the police car stops.

      The Chief of Police gets out.       Nods at our intrepid three.

      And opens the door for Penelope. As she climbs out he
      motions for the passing soldiers to stand at attention and
      salute her.

      He kisses her hand.

                             CHIEF OF POLICE
                       (in Czech)
                   It has been a privilege, madame, to
                   behold even briefly such a strong,
                   beautiful flower.

                             PENELOPE
                       (in Czech)
                   Thank you sir, I will not soon
                   forget your kindness.

      She blushes and smiles, then does an unhurried victory strut
      back to Bloom, Stephen and the Chink.

  

                                                                    86
      
154   CONTINUED:                                                    154


      The police cars drive off.

      Penelope pulls the book out from under her jacket and sets it
      on a bench. A moment of victorious silence.

      Clapping her hands, she does a little shuffle dance of joy.

                              PENELOPE (cont'd)
                       (sings)
                   We're a band of smugglers hey,
                   la la la la la,
                   we smuggle by night, drink by day,
                   smugglers ho, ho ho...
                   Everybody!


155   EXT. SIDEWALK BAR - LATE AFTERNOON                              155

      Bloom and Stephen sit among empty wine glasses.

      The Chink approaches, gives Stephen a hand gesture.

                             STEPHEN
                   Let her sleep. Train doesn't leave
                   till eight.

                             BLOOM
                   That was real.

                             STEPHEN
                   Yeah, I know.

                             BLOOM
                   Fuckin scary.


156   EXT. PARK - LATE AFTERNOON                                      156

      Bloom walks pensively through a green park. Cat Stevens'
      "Miles from Nowhere" plays from a nearby radio.

      His eye catches something.       A shiny red apple on a fruit
      seller's cart.

      He approaches it slowly, face flushed, breath shallow, eyeing
      the elderly vendor with a thin semblance of nonchalance.

      Holy shit.    He is going to steal that apple.

      Deftly he passes, lifting and pocketing it just as the Vendor
      turns away. Bloom has done it. His pale face tightens.


  

                                                                   87
     
156   CONTINUED:                                                   156


      And turns.

      And sees a five year old boy.      Giving him a stare of infinite
      judgement.

      Bloom turns on his heel and RUNS HELL FOR LEATHER.

      The vendor shouts. The little boy chases him, pointing and
      screaming. Dogs bark. People stare. And Bloom sprints,
      apple in hand, a joyful smile forming on his lips.


157   INT. PRAGUE POLICE STATION - EVENING                         157

      Stephen bails Bloom out.

                               STEPHEN
                   An apple?

                             BLOOM
                   Yeah, but it was part of an
                   epiphany.


158   EXT. HUNGARIAN COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT                           158

      The train thunders South, towards Greece.


159   INT. TRAIN SLEEPER CAR - NIGHT                               159

      Stephen pokes his head into Penelope's car, says goodnight.

      As soon as he's gone, a foot dangles down outside the window
      and taps it. Penelope pulls it open, Bloom shimmies in with
      two mini bottles of gin.

      He kisses her.


160   INT. SHIP STATE ROOM - MORNING                               160

      Bloom holds a sleeping Penelope, watching the sun stream
      through the window and slipping the green rubber band cash
      into her suitcase.

      A low horn blows, and Bloom's face darkens.


161   EXT. THE ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY                                161

      The good ship Fidele breaks the waves, blowing its horn.

 

                                                                 88
   
161   CONTINUED:                                                 161


      Stephen stands on the deck.      Bloom joins him.

                             STEPHEN
                   Mexico.

      He strolls off, leaving Bloom watching the horizon gloomily.


162   EXT. DECK - DAY                                            162

      Our intrepid four sit around a small table (except for the
      Chink, who lies on a deck chair in a bikini and Chuck
      Taylors, sunning herself.)

                             STEPHEN
                   Oh-kay. We're rendezvousing with
                   Senor Rioso's guys here, on an
                   isolated beach just south of the
                   Mexican port town Tampico. A
                   simple handoff. Penelope and
                   Yeungling will stay with the car,
                   Bloom and I will do the handing.

                             PENELOPE
                   You guys seem a little tense.

                             STEPHEN
                   Well I'm not thrilled they set this
                   in Mexico. There could be
                   legitimate reasons, but Mexico's -
                   and I don't want to simplistically
                   vilify an entire country, but
                   Mexico's a horrible place. So
                   we'll be careful.


163   EXT. MEXICO BEACH - LATE AFTERNOON                         163

      The Chink fires an automatic pistol eight times into the dead
      center of a target pinned to a palm tree. She re-loads.


164   EXT. TAMPICO HOTEL GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS                    164

      The beach sprawling below them, Penelope and Bloom meander.

      The hotel itself feels very old, red ruinous stone.

                             PENELOPE
                   Is this going to be more dangerous
                   than I think, tomorrow?


 

                                                               89
 
164   CONTINUED:                                               164


                             BLOOM
                   Yeah. You should sleep at the
                   hotel tonight, I'll stay with
                   Stephen at the beach house. You'll
                   need sleep.

      On the distant beach, following the faint rapport of gunfire,
      a palm tree falls over.

                             PENELOPE
                   I'm really happy right now.   Are
                   you?

                             BLOOM
                   Right now I am.

      She kisses him and runs off along the cliff side, singing the
      smuggler song.

                             BLOOM (cont'd)
                   Penelope...

      But she's too far away now, and the ocean is too loud. She
      can't hear him, and he can't hear her, and in another moment
      she has vanishes into the green brush and white flowers.

      Behind Bloom's pained face, the sun dips towards the beach.


165   INT. BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT                                  165

      Stephen packs for tomorrow, Bloom stares out the black
      window, drinking. Flower in his lapel.

      Stephen picks up the con flowchart.

                             STEPHEN
                   The last box in our last con. Let
                   them begin the beguine. How's it
                   feel?

                             BLOOM
                   She's something special, Stephen.

                              STEPHEN
                   Uh huh.

                              BLOOM
                   Can I...

      He stares at his drink.


 

                                                                    90

                             BLOOM (cont'd)
                   Can I just have a little more time?
                   Just a few days. I want to keep
                   her, like this, I don't want this
                   to just end. Don't make me do
                   this.

                             STEPHEN
                   Be angry at me, you son of a bitch.
                   Don't be pathetic. Make you?
                   Jesus. I told you not to fall for
                   her-

                             BLOOM
                   I'm not gonna do this.

      Stephen comes very close to Bloom's face, looks him straight
      in the eye. Finds his answer.

                             STEPHEN
                   I don't believe you.

      He goes back to packing.


166   EXT. TAMPICO HOTEL GROUNDS - NIGHT                            166

      Bloom stands, the beach behind him, the glowing lights of the
      hotel before him. Growing determination.


167   EXT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT                                    167

      Bloom knocks on a door.       Penelope answers, in her bathrobe.

                                PENELOPE
                   Hey.

                             BLOOM
                   I know what I've gotta do. I've
                   gotta talk to you. Are you wearing
                   shoes?

                                PENELOPE
                   What's up?

      He pulls her out of the room.


168   INT. TAMPICO HOTEL GROUNDS - NIGHT                            168

      Bloom pulls Penelope by the hand, but she stops.

  

                                                                91

                   Bloom.   What?

      Deep breath.

                             BLOOM
                   My brother and I are con men. All
                   things considered, we might be the
                   most respected con man team working
                   today. And everything since you
                   hit me with your Lamborghini, all
                   of this, it's all fake. It's all a
                   con.


169   EXT. BEACH - NIGHT                                          169

      The waves break angrily on the beach. In the distance,
      Stephen finishes his drink on the beach house porch, goes
      inside and turns out the light.


170   EXT. TAMPICO HOTEL GROUNDS - NIGHT                          170

                             BLOOM
                   No, we were going to blow you off
                   tomorrow using the cackle bladder,
                   it's a, term, we have actors
                   playing the Argentina guy's men,
                   when we showed up the deal would go
                   bad, they would open fire on us,
                   Stephen and I would pretend to be
                   shot using blood packets, squibs.
                   That's - cackle bladder, in the old
                   days they put fake blood in chicken
                   bladders, so... So you'd escape
                   with the Chink, she'd send you off
                   with a little travelling money and
                   that would be that.

                              PENELOPE
                   Wow.

                             BLOOM
                   But that's not how this one's going
                   to end. I love you now, and I want
                   to get you out of this. I'm going

                   out of this, away from all this for
                   good. Are you ready?

                                                                   92
     




171   EXT. BEACH - NIGHT                                           171

      Bloom leads Penelope down the beach by the hand.

                           BLOOM
                 Stephen's gone into town to prep
                 the Argentina actors. Your money's
                 at his place.

                           PENELOPE
                 Money? I don't want the money,
                 let's just leave.

      For a moment he's tempted.      The dark beach house looms ahead.

                              BLOOM
                 C'mon.


172   INT. BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT                                     172

      Dark. Bloom leads Penelope in, stumbles in the dark,
      switches on a lamp. Click, click - it doesn't come on.

                           STEPHEN (O.S.)
                 You have to switch it on at the
                 base.

      A beat.   Bloom does.

      Stephen sits in an easy chair, not looking happy.     But not
      angry. Much more sad than angry.

                           BLOOM
                 So I've told her our whole play.
                 And I'm here. To take her money
                 back. How's that make you feel?

                           STEPHEN
                 Disappointed.

                           BLOOM
                 This isn't the ending you wanted?

                           STEPHEN
                 It doesn't matter now. This is the
                 way it ends. So let's get it over
                 with.

                           BLOOM
                 Where's the money?

 

                                                                    93

                               STEPHEN
                   I ate it.

                             BLOOM
                   Give me the money, Stephen.

                               STEPHEN
                   No.

                             PENELOPE
                   I don't want the money.

                             BLOOM
                   He's not going to keep a single
                   piece of you.

      Stephen stands.

                             STEPHEN
                   I'm sorry you fell in love with
                   her. But she's a mark. And all of
                   this, all of it is a con. Every
                   moment you shared with her, you
                   were just playing the part of a man
                   falling in love. That's what
                   you're afraid of, right? That you
                   don't know the difference? Or
                   maybe that there is no difference.
                   That that's what love is.

                             PENELOPE
                   We're leaving.

                             STEPHEN
                       (to Bloom)
                   No. You're too scared to leave.
                   You're scared to ride off into a
                   sunset that isn't painted
                   tarpaulin, cause real sunsets are
                   beautiful but they turn into dark
                   uncertain nights. If you were
                   ready for that, you wouldn't be
                   here. The money is in my bedroom.
                   Right behind me. But in my story
                   you don't get the money or the
                   sunset or the girl.

      A long beat.       The dark bedroom doorway looms behind Stephen.

                               PENELOPE
                   Bloom.    Let's just go.   Please.

      Bloom LUNGES, cracking Stephen in the jaw.

      Stephen goes down, Bloom leaps past him - but Stephen grabs
      Bloom's leg and brings him down.

      Then they are fighting.    Penelope watches, horrified.

      A frightening, brutal brawl that tears the small beach house
      apart, thirty years worth of a fight.

      Until Stephen throws Bloom to the ground at Penelope's feet.

      Upsetting a small table. The Chink's pistol, lying on the
      holey paper target, falls and strikes the ground.

      And goes off with a deafening rapport.

      Blood spreads just beneath Stephen's collarbone.

      Penelope screams.

      Stephen stays standing for a moment, shocked. A dribble of
      blood out of the corner of his mouth. He half grins.

                          STEPHEN
                Tastes like tin foil.

      And sinks to the ground.

      Bloom's eyes glaze.    He crawls to his brother.   Takes him in
      his arms.

                             BLOOM
                I'm sorry.

      Penelope watches the brothers holding each other. Tears in
      her eyes, but she backs away a step, very conscious of not
      being a part of this moment.

      Bloom looks up at her, almost taking a moment to recognize
      her.

                             PENELOPE
                Bloom...

      He doesn't move from his brother.

                             PENELOPE (cont'd)
                I'm sorry.

      She leaves.




                                                                 95

      For a long moment the Brothers Bloom lie in each other's arms
      in the middle of the broken room.

      Then Bloom stands, goes to the window and watches Penelope
      walking off into the distance down the beach.

      From the darkened bedroom doorway steps the Chink, her face a
      mask.

      Stephen stands.   Lifts his shirt and removes the squib and
      blood packets.

      Bloom steps outside.


173   EXT. BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT                                    173

      A wood patio with steps leading down to the sand.   Bloom
      watches Penelope, now very distant, almost gone.

      Stephen comes out, pulls out a flask.

                             STEPHEN
                Hey.
                    (nothing)
                I think that was the most honest
                conversation we've ever had.
                    (more nothing)
                You actually connected on a few of
                those punches.

                          BLOOM
                Did you expect me to do it? To
                come here tonight, end it the way
                you wrote it? Or were you really
                disappointed I didn't run off with
                her?

                           STEPHEN
                I was disappointed.    But I wasn't
                surprised.

      Bloom turns and SLUGS him in the jaw.   Stephen falls to the
      sand.

                          BLOOM
                I let you do your monologue, but
                you wanna know why I did it? I did
                it so she'd never want to see me
                again. To get her away from all
                this for good.


 

                                                               96

      Without looking back Bloom walks off down the beach, in the
      opposite direction of Penelope, leaving Stephen bleeding in
      the sand, alone in the dark uncertain night.

                                                       FADE OUT.

174   EXT. LUDICROUS MANSION - DAY                               174

      Penelope's home, bucolic on a lazy Spring day.

      At a picnic table at the far edge of the front lawn, Penelope
      sits writing with intense concentration on a piece of paper.

      After awhile she raises her head, regarding what she's
      written thoughtfully. Folds it up, puts it in her pocket.

      Clicks the seemingly innocent ballpoint pen.

      BEEP.

      The mansion EXPLODES, completely.

      She walks away without looking back.

      After a beat, the plaster deer explodes in a ridiculous
      fireball.


175   EXT. ITALIAN COUNTRYSIDE - DAY                             175

      Green hills surround the walled medieval city of Ferentino.
      A tiny white car inches its way across the countryside, and
      up into the city.


176   EXT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - DAY                             176

      Bloom walks up the stone alley to his apartment, a bag of
      groceries in hand. He spots the white car parked out front.

      Loud shouting in Italian grows louder, until Penelope and the
      Grandmother burst out the front door. Berating each other
      with Italian curses and hand gestures.

      Penelope sees Bloom, and freezes.

                            PENELOPE
                   Hello.




                                                                97

                                BLOOM
                   Hey.

      The Grandmother keeps up her barrage as she takes the
      groceries from Bloom, but as soon as she's behind Penelope's
      back she gives Bloom a wink, points to her and gives a thumbs-
      up of approval.


177   EXT. FERENTINO STREETS - DAY                              177

      Bloom and Penelope wander the twisty alleyways of the city.

                             BLOOM
                   How did you find me?

                                PENELOPE
                   The Chink.

                             BLOOM
                   How did you find the Chink?

                             PENELOPE
                   She gave me her cell when we got to
                   Mexico.

                             BLOOM
                   I didn't even know she had one.

                             PENELOPE
                   I think she's kind of selective in
                   who she gives the number to.


178   EXT. FERENTINO CAFE - LATER                               178

      They sit with wine and bread.

                             BLOOM
                   Why are you here, Penelope?

                             PENELOPE
                   Why did you decide to stay with
                   your brother instead of coming with
                   me in Mexico?

                             BLOOM
                   Everything Stephen said that night
                   was true.






                                                                   98

                             PENELOPE
                   I've been doing a lot of thinking
                   the past three months. I want you
                   to consider something.

      She takes a piece of paper from her pocket, unfolds it and
      slides it across the table to him.

      On it, written over and over in a dozen different stylized
      fonts, is "PENELOPE THE CON ARTIST."

      Bloom sets the paper down with a snap.

                             BLOOM
                   Go away. Everything Stephen said
                   was true. I was just playing you
                   as a mark. Everything between us,
                   none of it was real.

      She leans in close to him, her hand on his leg.

                             PENELOPE
                   I don't believe you.

      It's obvious even before she kisses him that she's right.

      Bloom dials a pay phone.    He's been crying.    It rings.

                             BLOOM
                   Pick up... c'mon...


180   INT. MONTE CARLO CASINO - CONTINUOUS                          180

      Lush, Edwardian. In a private room, a card table is
      overturned. Stephen lies on the ground in a defensive
      posture, a RAVISHING WOMAN in red lunging at him with a
      curved dagger. A BEARDED MAN with an eyepatch holds her back
      by the wrists, while a MONOCLED MAN in an antique wheelchair
      holds his tear stained face in his hands.

      This whole scene is frozen like a tableau, as Stephen's cell
      phone chirps away.

      Annoyed, the Bearded Man gives him a `go ahead' nod.

      Stephen hastily answers it.



   

                                                                99

                   Uh... Nine-ish?

      Bloom fishes out his pocket watch.

                              BLOOM
                   Alright.

      Click. As he's putting his pocket watch back, he finds the
      stack of green rubber band money in his breast pocket.

      Stephen and Bloom sit on the little landing outside the
      apartment.

                             STEPHEN
                   So she comes back wanting to work
                   with us. Honestly? I think we'd
                   be lucky to have her. If you
                   called me to hear my opinion on the
                   matter. Which I'm getting the
                   feeling you didn't.

                             BLOOM
                   I did what I did in Mexico to get
                   her out of all this. I would rather
                   die than bring her into the con.

                             STEPHEN
                   So maybe you want to tell me what
                   I'm doing in Ferentino.

                   You knew she'd come back. What did
                   you figure she was good for,
                   another million?

                             STEPHEN
                   One point seven five.

                             BLOOM
                   We will play her again, one last
                   con, but not for money. I'm gonna
                   tell you how this one's gonna end.
                   You built us into this, you're
                   gonna fly us out, end it so she's
                   done with all of us. End it all so
                   it can't start up again.

                             STEPHEN
                   You want me to plan a con whose
                   sole purpose is to blow her off for
                   good?

                             BLOOM
                   I love her. You owe me this. I
                   don't want to turn her into me.


184   INT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - NIGHT                            184

      Penelope sleeps on a cot against the window.

      Bloom enters wearily.    Sits in a chair.   Watches her.

      In the next room over, Stephen sits in the dark.    Shuffling
      cards.

      A lovely tune sung in Mandarin Chinese plays over this,
      segueing us into...


185   INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT                                    185

      On a television screen, images of the Shanghai skyline.

      TITLE CARD - Shanghai

      A wall of monitors, which the Chink steps in front of,
      singing the climax of the song. Beautiful and sad.

      As the song ends, she sees through the spotlight Penelope,
      Bloom and Stephen at a table. Penelope waves.


 

                                                               101

      The Chink's face betrays just the slightest hint of
      disappointment.


186   INT. KARAOKE BAR PRIVATE BOOTH - LATER                    186

      The four sit with drinks.

                             PENELOPE
                   So what's the next job?

                             STEPHEN
                   Before we do the next job, we need
                   to liquidate our assets from the
                   last job.

                             PENELOPE
                   But you've got-

                             STEPHEN
                   Your money from the last job, well
                   that's profit, not capital, the
                   three of us have already split it
                   up. So step one: sell the book of
                   hours.

                             PENELOPE
                   I thought it was fake.

                             STEPHEN
                   With all your random expertise we
                   couldn't risk a flat out fake. It
                   isn't worth two point five million,
                   we could maybe catch four hundred
                   grand for it, but it's real. Who'd
                   we buy it from?

                              BLOOM
                   Minskie.

                             STEPHEN
                   Perfect, we'll sell it right back
                   to him.

      The Chink hands him a piece of paper.

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   If he wasn't dead.

                             BLOOM
                   Well there's Demarco or Boyer. Or
                   Roche, if we want to go state-side.



                                                                  102

                             STEPHEN
                   All traceable. With Minskie out
                   we'd have to go deep black market
                   if we wanted to be a hundred
                   percent clear. There's only one
                   place that's deep enough for that.

      Bloom and the Chink know exactly what he's talking about, and
      they don't look happy.

                              PENELOPE
                   Where?


187   INT. KARAOKE BAR BACK ROOM - LATER                           187

                             BLOOM
                   Russia. It's like `cancer', I
                   don't even like saying the word.

      Bloom, Stephen and the Chink drink in a cramped little
      concrete room adjacent to the bar's kitchen.

                             STEPHEN
                   We're obviously not going to deal
                   with real Russians. They'll be our
                   guys in a phony set up, they'll
                   take our phony book and give her
                   phony cash, a closed loop. Safe
                   and simple.

      Bloom looks to the Chink for an opinion.      Gets a blank face.

                              STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   So.   We go to St. Petersburg.

      At the mention of St. Petersburg Bloom looks sharply at
      Stephen, but Stephen presses on.

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   She does the hand-off with our fake
                   "Russians." But while we're
                   driving out of town, everything
                   goes bad.

      He lays a simple flowchart, drawn on a napkin - three boxes.
      He points to the first, "Penelope sells book to `Russians'"




 

                                                                103

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   We discover we were sold a
                   counterfeit book in the first
                   place, which we've now sold to
                   Russian smugglers. We discover
                   this when the Russian mob starts
                   taking us out one by one. Oh shit.

      He points to the second box, "Red Dawn."

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   First they ambush our car,
                   destroying the money. Then they
                   take me out, then the Chink, and
                   finally you Bloom, in a heroic
                   death that allows Penelope to
                   barely escape with her life.
                   Devastated but reborn with the
                   knowledge that you loved her so
                   much you died so she could live,
                   she drives off into a romantic life
                   of adventure and peril, on the run
                   from imaginary Russians.

      He points to the third box, "The End."

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   What do you think?

189   INT. ST. PETERSBURG HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                       189

      Penelope snores on the bed, while our intrepid three unpack.

      The phone rings.    Stephen answers it, listens, hangs up.

                             STEPHEN
                   Our "Russians" have arrived.

      red suitcase.

                   To play the "Russians?"

      DING.

      The elevator doors open, revealing the Diamond Dog.

191   INT. HOTEL BAR - LATER                                     191

      Empty. The Dog leans against the bar with several LACKEYS,
      waiting patiently, making sparks with his gold lighter.
      Sounds of shouting come from the adjoining dining area.


192   INT. HOTEL DINING ROOM                                     192

                   I don't understand. Tell me so I
                   understand. Three months ago you
                   were ready to blind the old bastard-

                             STEPHEN
                   We need someone who can pass for
                   the Russian mob to buy our fake
                   book. The Dog's got his big store
                   right here in St. Petersburg.

                             BLOOM
                   Alright, fuckin stop. You want
                   this to finish in St. Petersburg,
                   you want this to end with the Dog
                   for some what thematic something?
                   Fine but don't tell it like a
                   story, let's say it. Twenty three
                   years ago and I can still smell,
                   that blood red apartment of his,
                   the smell of that place. I hate
                   him Stephen but this isn't that,
                   this is I don't trust him.

                   I've thought this one out, believe

                   Stephen, still the grand architect
                   with your symbols. Red for
                   temptation, white for salvation.

      The Dog opens it, revealing US hundreds.      Examines it with a
      loupe.

                             DIAMOND DOG (cont'd)
                   Impressive, boys.

                             BLOOM
                   It's trash. There's visible cross
                   hatching in Franklin's eye.

      Sure enough - obvious jagged misprints cut into Ben
      Franklin's eye on the bills.

                             DIAMOND DOG
                   Hm.  I'll be damned.
                       (closes case)
                   Ruskies wouldn't be caught dead
                   handing over a rag bag like this,
                   it should be a steel attache.

                               STEPHEN
                   This'll   do. We'll do the drop off
                   at your   store. Make it scary,
                   think a   movie version of the
                   Russian   mafia, but don't hassle
                   her.

                               DIAMOND DOG
                   Alright.

      The Dog closes the case, and for a moment Bloom's eyes rest
      on his bandaged hand.

      He then takes the case and quickly moves off with his crew.

      The Chink leads Stephen and Bloom around the brown Peugeot.

                             STEPHEN
                   So. Our fake Russian attack. One
                   small charge will simulate a bullet
                   hit, and blow out the back window.

      The Chink points with an extendable pointer to a small nub on
      the rear windshield.

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   So that one bang, then we roll off
                   the road. Once we get clear of the
                   car the Chink sets off the final
                   charge, incinerating the car and
                   the money in the trunk. This'll
                   all happen exactly twenty seconds
                   after we cross the main bridge out
                   of town. After the bridge.

      Stephen makes a note in a manila envelope, tucks it in his
      jacket.

                   You've been awful quiet.

      She doesn't react.

                             BLOOM (cont'd)
                   I'm doing this for her.

      But a door clicks shut, and Bloom is alone in the hall.

                                                                   107

      Penelope in bed. Her door cracks open, and she sleepily
      looks up. Bloom stands silhouetted in the doorway.

                          PENELOPE
                Tomorrow it all starts.

      She lifts the sheets. He gets into bed, and as she drifts
      into peaceful slumber Bloom is very conscious of holding her
      for the last time.

      When her snores begin, he has ear plugs ready.

198   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG ALLEY - DAY                               198

      Bloom, Stephen and the Chink parked in an alley, watching a
      doorway across the street with a pair of binoculars.

      Bloom breathes uneasily, checks his watch.

                          BLOOM
                She gives the Dog the book, he
                gives her the fake money. This is
                taking too long.

      Just then Penelope trots out.    Metal attache case in hand.


199   EXT. RUSSIA HIGHWAY - MORNING                                 199

      On the outskirts of town, parked beside a murky little lake.
      Our heroes gather around the metal attache case on the hood.

                          PENELOPE
                He hassled me. Took forever
                looking the book over, haggled the
                price. Wanted to pay me in Rubles.

      Stephen smirks, then opens it.    The money's there.

                           STEPHEN
                Alright.   Let's get the hell out of
                Russia.


  

                                                                 108
    
199   CONTINUED:                                                  199


      Bloom pulls the Dog's gold lighter from his pocket, takes one
      last glance at St. Petersburg and tosses it down into the
      lake.


200   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG HIGHWAY - MORNING                       200

      The brown Peugeot drives towards the climbing sun.


201   INT. PEUGEOT                                                201

      The Chink drives, Stephen rides shotgun.

      Bloom and Penelope in the back seat.    He looks weary.

      He sees the bridge approaching, maybe a half mile ahead.

      She pulls his head down into her lap, fingers in his hair.
      He breathes, closes his eyes.

      An explosion shatters the front passenger window.

      Bloom's eyes snap open, he bolts upright.

      The bridge is still a quarter mile away.

      In the next moment the car becomes a din of breaking glass,
      screams, tires screeching.


202   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG HIGHWAY                                 202

      A BLACK MERCEDES roars out on to the road, machine gun fire
      blazing from its windows, literally shredding the Peugeot.

      The car spins, tires flapping, and hits a highway embankment
      full speed, launching into the air.


203   INT. PEUGEOT                                                203

      A moment of strange silence as the car flips mid-air.     The
      brothers lock eyes for a split second.


204   EXT. FOREST BESIDE ST. PETERSBURG HIGHWAY                   204

      The car slams into the steep grassy embankment, manages to
      flip upright, and rolls into a thick forest, coming to an
      abrupt stop against a stout tree.




                                                                   109
      
204   CONTINUED:                                                    204


                             STEPHEN
                   OUT!

      They all four dive out of the car, Bloom shoving Penelope,
      tumbling into the thick forest an instant before the car
      becomes a roiling ball of flame.

      Bloom lies shell-shocked, his vision blurry. He vaguely sees
      Penelope passed out beside him, Stephen on the other side of
      the car.

      A DARK FIGURE comes trotting into the woods, shining a
      flashlight on the charred car. Goes to Stephen. Reaches
      down to him...

      Bloom's mind flutters away into darkness.


205   INT. FOREST - DAY                                                205

      Bloom wakes. Rain splattering.       Slumped against a tree.
      Penelope hunches over him.

                             BLOOM
                   What happened?

                             PENELOPE
                   Are you alright?

                             BLOOM
                   What happened?

                             PENELOPE
                   Yeungling went to get another car.

                             BLOOM
                   Where's Stephen?

                             PENELOPE
                   We don't know. He was gone.

      Bloom stands shakily, goes to the charred car.      Runs his
      fingers over the dozens of bullet holes.

      Goes to where Stephen fell.       Lying in the grass, a manila
      envelope.

                             PENELOPE (cont'd)
                   We're going to find him. If he
                   escaped, he'll contact us. If
                   they've got him, it's for ransom.


  

                                                                110

                             BLOOM
                   Who's got him?

                             PENELOPE
                   The Russians.

      The Chink pulls up in the green bug, headlights catching
      Bloom's face against the dark forest depths.


206   EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY                                     206

      A desolate gas station parking lot. Bloom sits in the Bug,
      loading his revolver with shaky fingers. Penelope stands
      outside.

                             BLOOM
                   Stephen, god please what's
                   happening. I don't know what to
                   do. I don't know Stephen please.
                   Please. What's happening. Please.

      A long black sedan screeches to a halt in the parking lot
      outside the window, Bloom bolts out of the car, pistol ready.

      But the Chink climbs out of the black sedan.

                             PENELOPE
                   Where does she get all these cars?

      Bloom motions for Penelope to stay back, then goes to meet
      the Chink in the middle of the parking lot.

                             BLOOM
                   If you know what's happening, now
                   would be a really good time to
                   speak up.

      She sets a suitcase down beside her.    Bloom takes this in.

                             BLOOM (cont'd)
                   No, please. Not now. I need your
                   help here now, I don't know what to
                   do.

      The slightest smile communicates all the compassion in the
      world. But she's leaving.

      She hands him a small slip of paper, their fingers touching
      for an instant.



 

                                                                    111

      She gives Penelope a quick little "call me" gesture, picks up
      her case and walks off.

      A truck blocking our view of her car pulls away, and she gets
      in.

      Bloom looks down at the slip of paper.        A short phrase, in
      Chinese.

                               BLOOM (cont'd)
                   Thanks.

      The engine turns over, and the Chink's car EXPLODES in a
      dramatic fireball.

      The paper flutters out of Blooms's fingers a moment before he
      and Penelope are thrown to the pavement by the shock wave.

      Bloom and Penelope lift their heads, absorbing what just
      happened.


207   EXT. CHICAGO - DAY                                             207

      A busy street, which a title card identifies as "Chicago,
      Illinois."

      On the corner, an unassuming Chinese restaurant.


208   INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - DAY                                  208

      A dive.   The chef on the phone.

                             CHEF
                   Ah, ah yes, Mr. Bloom.      Yes, ok.

                               ALL THE COOKS
                   Blooooom!

      He puts the phone down and goes to the fax machine, which is
      spitting out a facsimile of the Chink's slip of paper.


209   INT. ST. PETERSBURG COPY SHOP - EARLY MORNING                  209

      Bloom on a pay phone, scribbling on a piece of paper.




   

                                                               112

                             BLOOM
                   Uh huh. Assholes. Ok. Um, ok.
                   So I've got "We are all assholes in
                   our own theatrical enterprises."
                   You sure?

      This phrase, written on Bloom's paper.

                             CHEF
                   And then it end with "Goodbye shit
                   head."

                                BLOOM
                   Shit head?

                             CHEF
                   But it is different meaning in
                   Mandarin, uh, endearing. "Shit
                   head" if you have affection for
                   shit.


210   EXT. SIDEWALK - MOMENTS LATER                             210

      The Bug parked nearby. Penelope sits on the curb, crying.
      Bloom sits next to her.

                             PENELOPE
                   What did it mean?

                             BLOOM
                   I don't know.

                             PENELOPE
                   What did it say?

                             BLOOM
                   "We're all of us marks in our own
                   cons." And she said goodbye.

                             PENELOPE
                   I still can't believe it.

                             BLOOM
                   That the Chink fell for a car bomb?
                   Neither can I.

                             PENELOPE
                       (hopeful)
                   What? Oh, oh god do you think she
                   faked it? So the Russians would
                   think she was dead?



                                                                   113

      Bloom stands, paces away. He leafs limply through the manila
      folder - addresses, pictures, information...

      A paper with the Dog's photo clipped to it.       An address in
      St. Petersburg.

      The napkin Stephen wrote the con flowchart on.      The third box
      - "The End."

                             PENELOPE (cont'd)
                   What do we do now?

      Scrawled on the inside of the manila envelope - "An unwritten
      life." Bloom's face clears. He wipes his eyes.

                             BLOOM
                   Ok.

      Bloom goes to the Bug.

                             PENELOPE
                   Where are you going?

                             BLOOM
                   This wasn't Russians. This was
                   done by an old mentor of ours who
                   wants us off the map. He has an
                   apartment in St. Petersburg. So
                   this is, yeah. I've gotta go back
                   to that apartment to face the Dog
                   and get my brother back. That's
                   how I'm gonna end this.

      Penelope's eyes gleam. She jumps up to the passenger door,
      and Bloom stops her with a weary look.

                             PENELOPE
                   We can skip the whole you-sending-
                   me-nobly-away-and-me-refusing-to-

                             BLOOM
                   Thank Christ.


211   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG STREET - LATE MORNING                     211

      A narrow alley between tall apartments.    Bloom parks, pulls
      his gun and checks it.




  

                                                                     114

212   INT. APARTMENT ENTRYWAY - DAY                                   212

      A badly lit apartment hallway.       Bloom approaches a door,
      Penelope behind him.

      His breathing becomes hard.        His face contorts.   He crumples
      next to the door.

                             PENELOPE
                   What's in there? Tell me who this
                   guy is.

      Bloom's breathing steadies.

                             BLOOM
                   He's just an old man.

      He tries the knob.     It opens.


213   INT. DIAMOND DOG'S APARTMENT - D                                213

      Blood red walls.

      Dark, neglected and to all appearances empty.       Bloom creeps
      down the darkened corridor, gun outstretched.       Breathes
      through his nose, chokes.

                              BLOOM
                   Dog!   I came back.

      He kicks open a door, revealing a large living space.         Empty.

      He lowers his gun, switches on the light.

      Penelope enters.     Sniffs the air.

                             PENELOPE
                   Moth balls.

      Bloom almost laughs.

                             BLOOM
                   Is that what that smell is?

      BAM! A closet door smacks open, revealing the business end
      of a double barrel shotgun.

    

                                                                   115

      Bloom spins, gun drawn.      Penelope screams.

      Then a moment of stillness.       The shotgun barrel quivers.

      It's held by the 11 year old boy Bloom saw in the Dog's
      Mercedes in Prague. Malnourished and scared.

      Penelope approaches him slowly.

                             PENELOPE
                       (in Russian)
                   It's okay. Honey, it's alright.

      The shotgun sinks to the ground.      Penelope strokes his hair
      back from his face.

      Bloom lowers the gun, trembling.

                             BLOOM
                   Ask him if anyone else is here.

      She does.

                             BOY
                   Nyet.

                             BLOOM
                   Ask him where the Diamond Dog is.

                             PENELOPE

                             BOY
                       (in English)
                   The Dog of Diamonds is gone.

      Bloom does a quick search of the rest of the room. As he
      does Penelope asks the boy one more question in Russian, and
      gets a quick answer.

                             BLOOM
                   Get the car started.

                             PENELOPE
                   What about him?

                             BLOOM
                   It's alright.



  

                                                               116

      She believes him, and goes.   Bloom kneels in front of the
      boy.

                          BLOOM (cont'd)
                You don't need to be afraid of him
                anymore. Or angry at him. Or ever
                come back here again. He doesn't
                concern you anymore. Understand?
                It's gonna be ok.

      The boy nods. Bloom hands him the stack of bills wrapped in
      the green rubber band. The boy snatches it and runs off.


214   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG STREET - DAY                             214

      Bloom trots out of the apartment building, and sees two
      things: Penelope working the VW's starter, and a black
      Mercedes speeding down the narrow street towards her.

      He sprints towards her, screaming

                           BLOOM
                Get out!   Get out of the car!!

      She sees the approaching Merc, too late, and ducks down.

      A hand hurls something from the darkened window. It smashes
      through the Bug's passenger side window, showering Penelope
      with glass.

      The Mercedes roars off down the street.

      Bloom reaches the Bug and throws the door open.

      Penelope lies covered in safety glass, holding a Russian
      nesting doll.


215   INT. BUG - LATER                                             215

      The seven progressively smaller dolls lie open on the back
      seat, Bloom holds the two halves of the final tiny doll, and
      Penelope holds a note.

                          PENELOPE
                It's a ransom note. It says they
                have Stephen, it says they want the
                money wired to a specific account,
                they give a bank to do it at and a
                manager to ask for.

                   Then an address to come to, at two
                   p.m. In two hours.

                             BLOOM
                   I'll wire the money from my
                   account, and we'll go get Stephen.

                             PENELOPE
                   It's a lot.

                               BLOOM
                   How much?

                             PENELOPE
                   I'll do it, I want to, I've got
                   plenty-

                             BLOOM
                   How much are they asking for?

                             PENELOPE
                   One point seven five million.

      A cold pit opens in Bloom's stomach.

                              BLOOM
                   Oh.   Oh oh. No no NO.

      He punches the dashboard.

                             BLOOM (cont'd)
                   No I'll kill him. I'll kill him if
                   that's what this is, if that's all
                   that this is, no NO NO.

                             PENELOPE
                   What are you talking about?

                             BLOOM
                   There's another possibility that I
                   should of, I'm a fucking idiot.
                   This might all be a con. By my
                   brother. To get me - oh god - he
                   wanted me to face the Dog, to end
                   it, and he gets your money. Oh
                   god. I'm going to be sick.

                             PENELOPE
                   Would he do that? To you?

                             BLOOM
                   I don't know. Yes.   Yes of course
                   he would.

                whole, goddammit, that's what.

                          PENELOPE
                But you don't know. Let's transfer
                the money. You don't know.

                          BLOOM
                Son of a bitch.

                You don't know. This is your

                money.


216   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG BANK - DAY                              216

      Bloom sits in the car, alone. He punches the dashboard
      again, helpless enraged and scared.

      Penelope gets in, looks at the address on the note.

                          PENELOPE
                Ok.


217   EXT. BURNED OUT THEATER - DAY                               217

      Penelope and Bloom sit in the car, parked in front of the
      impressive facade of a closed, burned out old theater.

      The clock on the dashboard reads 1:50.

                           BLOOM
                I'm so scared. Anything I can
                imagine finding in there, I'm
                scared of.

                          PENELOPE
                I'm going to be here when you come
                out.

      She kisses him.

      He puts his hand on the door.    Hesitates.   Then goes.

      Walks up the stairs to the inky maw of the theater door.
      Goes in alone.

                                                               119
  




218   INT. THEATER LOBBY                                            218

      No lights. Moldy dust. A genuinely creepy place.      Bloom
      steps lightly, deeper into the theater.

                           BLOOM
                Stephen!


219   INT. THEATER AUDITORIUM                                       219

      A few lights flicker on the walls, fitfully illuminating the
      broken dusty seats and bare ruined stage.

      Bloom walks down the aisle, trying to keep his voice steady.

                           BLOOM
                Stephen!

      A spotlight snaps on from the mezzanine, right in Bloom's
      face. He spins, trapped in its glare.

      A guttural command is shouted in what might be Russian.

      When Bloom doesn't respond, the spot silently advances a few
      feet ahead of him towards the stage.

      Bloom gingerly follows it, up onto the splintered stage and
      finally resting on a split in the tarpaulin backdrop.

      With a wary glance back, Bloom steps through it.


220   INT. THEATER BACKSTAGE                                        220

      Giant fossils of antique stage scenery. Utility lights high
      above, cut by scaffolding, patch everything in dim jagged
      forms of light and black.

                          BLOOM
                    (unsteady)
                Stephen. Game's up. Come on out.
                Let's blow this one hat town.

      Silence. Then a harsh utility lamp snaps on, cruelly
      lighting Stephen's face.

      Shockingly bruised and battered, old and new blood.

      Bloom cries and rushes towards him...




                                                                120

                              STEPHEN
                   No!   No Bloom, freeze.

      He obeys. Stephen is tied to a chair. A dark figure behind
      him holds the lamp with a black gloved hand.

                             BLOOM
                   Stephen, who is it?   Is it the Dog?

                             STEPHEN
                   Did Penelope wire the money?

                              BLOOM
                   Yeah.

                             STEPHEN
                   They're calling to check right now.
                   Don't move. I'm alright.

      The dark figure's cell phone rings, he holds it to his ear
      for a moment then flips it closed.

      Something happens in the blackness, and Stephen shakily
      stands, cut loose.

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   Stay where you are, Bloom. I'm
                   coming to you.

      He takes a couple wobbly steps.

      Behind him, Bloom sees the dark figure raising his gun
      towards Stephen's back, pulling the hammer...

      And the utility lamp switches off.

                              BLOOM
                   No!

      Bloom's revolver pops out of his sleeve and he's firing into
      the blackness.

      Stephen drops flat to the ground.

      The fiery rapport of a big pistol flashes from the blackness,
      strobing the scene like stage lightning.

      Bloom reloads behind the cover of a heavy flat, but Stephen
      lies on his stomach out in the open.

                              BLOOM (cont'd)
                   Stephen!



                                                                 121

                              STEPHEN
                 Stay back!

      But Bloom makes a dash for his brother, out into the open,
      unloading three more rounds into the dark.

      The dark figure returns fire on Bloom, who is sprinting full
      on his feet in a large pool of light. A sitting duck.

      Stephen launches himself up, tackling Bloom backwards.

      Just before they fall behind the safety of the flat, a red
      burst of blood flowers from Stephen's left lower back.

      Bloom sets him down gently, and hears heavy footsteps behind
      him.

      He turns, firing, but only sees a blur of dark coat go by,
      through the torn backdrop.

      Bloom runs out on stage, tearing the tarpaulin, and fires
      after the dark figure limping up the aisle and away into the
      lobby.

      Silence.

      Bloom walks back to Stephen, who lies behind the flat,
      breathing heavy. Blood soaking through his shirt.

                           BLOOM
                 Please tell me this is all gonna be
                 ok. Tell me that's a squib, and
                 that's makeup, and that you just
                 gave me what I always wanted and
                 pulled off the perfect con.

      A long, long moment.

      Stephen coughs, spits.     Then a wry grin spreads across his
      face.

                           STEPHEN
                 You said it, not me.

      He stands, the shakiness gone.

                           STEPHEN (cont'd)
                 Can I get a `wow' for this one?

                           BLOOM
                 You son of a bitch.




                                                               122

      Bloom looks like he might hit him, but his face breaks and he
      embraces him, crying. The Brothers Bloom stay like that for
      a long while, holding each other in the spotlight's glow.

      Finally Stephen pulls away, tears in his eyes.   He wipes
      them, wipes blood from his lip.

                          STEPHEN
                Tastes like tin foil. Alright
                here's what I want you to do. The
                Chink split?

                           BLOOM
                Yeah.   Clean exit.

                            STEPHEN
                How?

                            BLOOM
                Car bomb.

      A hint of relief in Stephen's face.

                          STEPHEN
                Good. Here's what. Take Penelope
                back to Helsinki, take that flight
                to Rio. Lay low like we said.
                Play out the on-the-run-from-
                vengeful-Russians thing, that'll be
                fun for her. Play it like I'm
                dead, actually - that'll add some
                gravity to everything, that'll be
                nice. And I'll see you when I see
                you.

                            BLOOM
                Soon?

                          STEPHEN
                I hope not. Last thing you need is
                me hanging around. Anyway, how
                could I top this?

      Bloom hugs him again.

                          BLOOM
                I love you. Bye.

      He turns to go.

                            STEPHEN
                Hey.    Think of any card.

                              BLOOM
                 Alright.

      Stephen cuts, to the Queen of hearts.

                           BLOOM (cont'd)
                 Stephen. That's it.
                     (grins)
                 That's the best card trick I've
                 ever seen. I just wish you had a
                 bigger audience.

                           STEPHEN
                 You're the only audience I've ever
                 needed.

      Wink.   Bloom leaves.

      Stephen watches him go.


221   EXT. RUSSIA HIGHWAY - LATE AFTERNOON                      221

      Rumbling towards Finland.

      In the Bug, Bloom sleeps in Penelope's arm while she drives.

      She looks at his hand on hers, his shirt cuff bright red with
      Stephen's "blood." She strokes his shoulder sadly.

      Off Bloom's sleeping face...


222   INT. THEATER STAGE                                        222

      Stephen pulls a chair out onto the stage, sets it right in
      the spotlight's glare.

      Trembling as if it takes all his last strength in the world.

      Sits.   Looks at the Queen of Hearts, moves his fingers over
      it.

      Then slides is up his sleeve.

      Blood trickles down his hand.

                                                                  124
     




223   INT. BUG - SUNSET                                            223

      Bloom wakes with a start.

                            PENELOPE
                  Hey. Hey, it's ok. The bridge is
                  coming up, we're almost at the
                  border. Were you dreaming about
                  Stephen?

      She strokes his hair back from his face.

      He nods, and looks down at his sleeve.

      Stephen's "blood" on his white cuff.

      Now a dark shade of brown.

      Bloom looks at this shirt.      All the blood, it's all brown.

      He looks up at the road, nearly panicked.

      Maybe a quarter mile ahead is the bridge.

                               BLOOM
                  Pull over.     Pull over!!

      She does.

      He bursts out of the car, and run/tumbles down the grassy
      hillside till he finds the car tracks.

      He follows them to the charred remains of the Peugeot.

      Penelope stumbles down after him.

                            PENELOPE
                  What is it? You're scaring me-

                            BLOOM
                  What did you ask the Russian kid,
                  in the Dog's apartment? He said
                  the Dog isn't here, then what did
                  you ask?

      Bloom kicks open the trunk.      Pries open the blistered attache
      case.


 

                                                                125

      Sifts through the charred pile of cinders that was the money
      from the "Russians" till he finds what he was looking for and
      brings it out into the dying light.

                             PENELOPE
                   How long had he been alone.

                             BLOOM
                   And what did he say?

      A scrap of unburned money.    A fragment of Ben Franklin's
      face.

                             PENELOPE
                   Since yesterday morning.

      A single eye gazing up at him, the green grass behind it.

      The eye is perfect.    No cross hatching.

      Bloom sinks to his knees.

                             BLOOM
                   This is real. They hassled you.

                             PENELOPE
                   Bloom-

                             BLOOM
                   The Dog was gone before we got
                   there. They hadn't cleared out of
                   their apartment, they had been
                   cleared out.


225   INT. DIAMOND DOG'S APARTMENT - DAY FLASHBACK                 225

      RUSSIANS in black overcoats burst in, shooting the Dog's men
      with silenced pistols.

      The BOY shuts himself in the closet, terrified.


226   EXT. ROADSIDE - SUNSET                                       226

                             BLOOM
                   Real Russians. Took his store.
                   They didn't know about his deal
                   with us, but you haggled with them.
                   You really sold the book to real
                   Russians. The Diamond Dog was
                   gone.

                                                              126
 




227   EXT. RUSSIA HIGHWAY - FLASHBACK                             227

      The scene beside the lake, our four heroes checking the money
      in the attache case.

                          STEPHEN
                Let's get the hell out of Russia.

      Bloom tosses the gold lighter, it splashes into the lake.    We
      follow it, plunging beneath the surface.

      Deep deep down, among weak tendrils of light, the Diamond Dog
      sinks into watery blackness, a long blade in his neck.


228   EXT. ROADSIDE - SUNSET                                      228

                           BLOOM
                And they came after us.   And
                Stephen...

      Penelope holds him tight.

                             PENELOPE
                I know.

                          BLOOM
                Stephen saved my life.

                             PENELOPE
                I know.

                             BLOOM
                He's gone.

      Bloom folds into Penelope's arms, but she doesn't let him.
      She holds his crying face up.

                          PENELOPE
                And he did it so you could live.
                Your brother loved you. He loved
                you so much. Look at me. Stephen
                said something once, I got the
                feeling he'd rather be telling it
                to you. He said there's no such
                thing as an unwritten life. Just
                badly written ones. I love you.
                          (MORE)






                                                                127
   
228   CONTINUED:                                                 228
                             PENELOPE (cont'd)
                   We're gonna outrun these bastard
                   Russian mafia, and we're gonna hide
                   out in Rio, then we're gonna live
                   like we're telling the best fucking
                   story in the world. Are you ready?

      She holds his face close to hers for a long beat. Then
      smiles and pushes away, launching up the grassy hill.

      Bloom watches her.

      Time slows as she turns back towards him, still running, and
      holds out her hand for him to follow.

                             BLOOM (V.O.)
                   I was thinking of something Stephen
                   said too. "The perfect con is one
                   where everyone involved gets just
                   the thing they wanted." Well.

      He takes the girl's hand, and runs with her towards the point
      of light breaking over the hill.


229   EXT. HIGHWAY - SUNSET                                      229

      Sunset with her wine-red fingers falls over the road ahead.
      The rumbly old VW chugs away from us, towards the horizon.

INT. KOWOLSKI'S BAKERY - KITCHEN - DAY

A news crew shuttles around a GIGANTIC COOKIE. Standing by
are the KOWOLSKI BROTHERS, GUSTOV and VOL, two SHORT, STOCKY,
MEN, along with MOTHER KOWOLSKI and other bakery family
employees. A "30 YEAR ANNIVERSARY" sign hangs in the
background.
BRUCE NOLAN looks into a make-up mirror, desperately trying
to place a large segment of wayward hair.
                     BRUCE
          Oh, God, no! The hair's wrong.
          This is a bad sign.
               (calling out)
          We really need to get a make-up
          person?!
The segment producer, ALLY LOMAN, steps over.
                     ALLY
          Not in the budget. And not to                         *
                                                                *
          worry, you're going to look great
          in this.
She holds out a HAIR NET.
                     BRUCE
          A hair net? I'm not wearing a hair
          net. I just did the hair.
                     ALLY
               (matter of fact)
          Health code. In the kitchen or
          around the cookie, you gotta have
          it.
                     BRUCE
               (to crew: re hair net)
          You guy's should tell me this
          before hand, this is like a huge
          waste of...moose.
Bruce spreads the hair net, bends down out of frame, comes up
looking ridiculous and very disgruntled.
                     BRUCE
          Remind me to swing by an elementary                   *
          school after this and serve lunch.
Ally laughs.

                                                       2.



                     ALLY
          You're a thing of beauty.     In
          three, two, one. . .
Bruce SNAPS from pissed to instant charismatic TV newsman.
(Note: Whenever Bruce speaks on camera he speaks in his
"REPORTER'S VOICE" - that recognizable, too-smooth delivery
that all news reporters seem to have. In mathematical terms
Bruce's version is to the 7th power.)
                    BRUCE
          For three decades the Kowolski
          Family Bakery has been a mainstay
          in downtown Buffalo. Known for
          their sinfully rich, cream filled,
          deep fried polski pierogis. And
          the occasional sugar induced coma
          that follows. Today, in honor of
          their 30 year anniversary, Momma
          Kowolski and her sons Gustov and
          Vol, decided to do something, a
          little bit different. Tell me
          guys, how did this idea come about?

                       GUSTOV
          Well,    Vol said to me, 'Gustov, why
          don't    we make the biggest chocolate
          chip    cookie in Buffalo?' And I
          said,    'Yeah, sure.'
                    BRUCE
          Wow. Fascinating.
Bruce steps up to the HUGE COOKIE.
                    BRUCE
          The previous Buffalo cookie record
          was 3 feet, 17 inches baked by
          Gladys Pelsnick. But this behemoth
          cookie clearly proving that Gustov
          and Vol have much more free time.
The Kowolski brothers and all celebrate in the background,
toasting with big mugs of milk. Bruce steps forward, looks
dramatically at camera, slow zoom in as he speaks.
                       BRUCE (CONT'D)
          As we witness the ceremonial
          toasting with milk it makes one
          pause and think. What are we
          really looking at here?
                       (MORE)

                                                        3.

                    BRUCE (CONT'D)
          Is it just a big cookie or does
          this cookie represent the pride of
          Buffalo? Our dedicated and hard
          working citizens the key
          ingredient, with a few nuts thrown
          in.
              (motions his eyes to the
               Kowolski twins)
          And finally, the love of our
          families which provides the warm
          chewy center making our beloved
          Buffalo the sweetest place to live.

Camera is in CLOSE as Bruce signs-off.
                    BRUCE (CONT'D)
          And that's the way the cookie
          crumbles. I'm Bruce Nolan,
          Eyewitness News.
Bruce's hair net SLIPS UP, PUFFING HIS HAIR INTO A BUN ON THE
TOP OF HIS HEAD. The Kowolskis and bystanders all laugh.
The frame FREEZES.
We PULL BACK from the TV and find Bruce holding the remote,
watching the recorded spot on TV. We are now...
INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Bruce is with his longtime girlfriend, GRACE. She has a box
of photos on the coffee table in front of her organizing them
into a photo album.
                    BRUCE
          So, what do you think?
                       GRACE
          It's good.
                       BRUCE
          It sucks. It's a story about a
          cookie. People with eating
          disorders will be riveted,
               (goes into huge pathetic
                fan character)
          Dear Bruce, love the bakery piece.
          I can't wait to vomit so I can make
          room for more cookies.
                       GRACE
          I thought it was funny. I love the
          hair net. How'd you get it to do
          that?

                                                             4.



                        BRUCE
          What? I'm cutting that. They made
          me wear that stupid thing. I don't
          even look like myself. The hair is
          one of the most important parts of
          an on camera persona. Right out of
          the gate, I lost the hair
          advantage.
Grace looks at a photo,
                        GRACE
          Oh, my gosh, look at this one. My
          sister is so drunk.
She places it in the album.
                        BRUCE
          Grace. Try to stay focused here.
          I need your help.
                     GRACE
          Aren't you taking this a little too
          seriously?
                        BRUCE
           It's sweeps Grace. It is serious.
           There's an anchor job open. This
           is important. This is our future!
Bruce points to the TV as he says "future," not realizing
he's pointing at the ridiculous image of himself with the
hair net bun. Grace can't help but giggle.
                        GRACE
           I'm sorry.
Bruce collapses into Grace's arms like a child. He clearly
has a fragile temperament.
                     BRUCE
               (sighs)
          I'm never going to get anchor doing
          these kind of assignments. I want
          my work to matter.
                     GRACE
          It does matter. You're funny. You
          make people smile. Come on, take a
          break, help me put this album
          together.

                    BRUCE
               (reluctant)
          Alright.
Grace holds up a photo.
                    GRACE
          Oh look at this. It's the first
          day we moved in together.
It's the two of them, younger, laughing.
                      BRUCE
               (down)
          Yeah, so full of hopes and dreams.
                    GRACE
          Oh, here's me at my sister's
          wedding. I caught the bouquet.
It's a picture of Grace overpowering the other bridesmaids
for the bouquet.
                    BRUCE
          You look pretty intense, hun.
                    GRACE
          Well, I was thinking about you.
Grace cuddles into Bruce.
                    BRUCE
          So, you're attracted to me in some
          way, is that what you're trying to
          say?
Grace rolls over onto Bruce.
                    GRACE
          You have no idea.
                    BRUCE
          I was saving myself for the wedding
          night, but if you keep this up, I
          may lose my resolve.
Grace stands, pulling Bruce up.
                    GRACE
          Well, that's the way the cookie
          crumbles.
They kiss, stumbling toward the bedroom.

                                                           6.



                       BRUCE
            Hey, that's a good line, but you
            need more resonance. From the
            diaphragm.
                (newscaster voice)
            That's the way the cookie crumbles.
                      GRACE
            Oh, say it again.
                      BRUCE
                (bigger)
            That's the way the cookie crumbles.
                      GRACE
                (sweet, southern groupie)
            Oh, I just love on-air
            personalities.
                       BRUCE
                 (newscaster voice)
            Well then, let me take these
            clothes off and slip into my hair
            net.
Grace laughs, Bruce joins in as they disappear into the
bedroom.

Her head wavers, then DROPS on the desk. The camera PANS to

                      BRUCE
            ...Bruce Nolan. And this is Sixty

THE SIXTY MINUTES TICKING CLOCK

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

BRUCE'S ALARM CLOCK - IT RINGS
We are in. . .

                                                            7.



INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Bruce lies next to Grace with a big smile on his face. Grace
hits the alarm, rolls over snuggling close to Bruce.
                    GRACE
          Sweety, time to get up...
She kisses Bruce, gets up.
                    BRUCE
          No, I'm having a great dream.
The covers are RIPPED OUT OF FRAME.   Bruce throws a mock
hissy fit.
INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

Bruce watches TV as he buttons his shirt.
                     SPORTSCASTER
          ...and the Sabers lost another
          close one last night. Four to
          three to the Toronto Maple Leafs.
                     BRUCE
          Of course they lost, they're my
          team.
                                            CUT TO:
MOMENTS LATER

Bruce checks his hair in the mirror practicing his new sign-
off.
                     BRUCE
          "And that's the way the cookie
          crumbles."
               (calls to Grace)
          You know, I think there might be
          something to that cookie line.
          Everything great anchor has his own
          signature sign-off.
               (as Walter Cronkite)
          "And that's the way the cookie
          crumbles."
ANGLE - SAM

Peeing in the corner on the carpet.

                                                              8.


                     BRUCE
          Oh no!   Grace, the dog!
                    GRACE (O.S.)
          I'm in the shower!
                     BRUCE
          Ah!
INT. APARTMENT STAIRCASE
Bruce runs along carrying the peeing Sam with extended arms
dodges a man ascending the stares, who gets sprinkled.
                    BRUCE
          Whoops, sorry.
EXT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
Bruce makes it outside, sets Sam down on the grass. Sam
looks up innocently at Bruce, finished.
                     BRUCE
          Oh, you're all done, huh?
          B-e-a-utiful.
EXT. SMALL WONDERS DAY CARE - MORNING
Bruce pulls up in his Ford Tauras to a cluster of cars
unloading kids. A 2003 MERCEDES SRL passes by.
                    GRACE
          Wow, nice car, huh?
                     BRUCE
          Yeah, if you want to rub your
          success in people's faces.
Then Bruce notices a big medical van in front of the school
with a BLOOD DRIVE SIGN.
                     BRUCE
          What's with the hubbub?
                     GRACE
          We're having a blood drive.
                    BRUCE
          Creepy. Needles, yech...
                     GRACE
          Oh, that's a nice response.

                                                       9.



                     BRUCE
          I mean, it's just s o . . .
                    GRACE
          Helpful and life saving?
                    BRUCE
          C'mon, that's your...blood. It's
          in your body and I don't think it's
          supposed to come out. Besides,
          they stockpile that stuff. They
          have an endless supply frozen in a
          warehouse somewhere then tell
          everyone there's a shortage.

                    GRACE
          They do not. Now stop it. I'm                        *
          giving. I have a very rare blood                     *
          type, AB positive.
                    BRUCE
          Well, I'm IB positive. IB positive
          they aint touchin' me with no
          needle.
Grace sighs in exasperation, starts out when...
                      GRACE
                (suddenly remembers
                 something)
          O. . .
          h
She places a STRING OF PRAYER BEADS on the rearview mirror.
                    BRUCE
          What's that?
                    GRACE
          Prayer beads. The kids made 'em.
          Keep you safe.
                      BRUCE
          Well, I hope they work, cause it's
          going take a miracle to get me to
          work on time.
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
Bruce is stuck in bumper to bumper traffic. He stares at the
prayer beads with a "thanks alot" look.

                                                          10.



A big accident ahead. Bruce looks at his watch, he's
screwed. A person is CARRIED BY ON A STRETCHER, Bruce is
oblivious.
                       BRUCE
             This is just my luck.
Bruce's BEEPER sounds.      He checks it.
                        BRUCE.
             The meeting's starting, perfect...
                  (thinks)
             Screw it.
He looks to the right of the car in front of him, then peels
off onto the shoulder, passing tons of cars.
                       BRUCE
                 (laughs)
             Catch you later, lemmings 1 It's
             kill or be killed, only the strong
             survive, no guts, no glory1
SFX: SIREN
Bruce pulls over, fumes.
                        BRUCE
                  (looking heavenward)
             Thank you.
EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
Bruce screeches into a space, races out of the car, bumping
over a trash can, goes back to pick it up, sees a HOMELESS
MAN who sits peacefully next to a paint bucket and sign
boards. The various "warnings" change daily. Today's SIGN
reads:
                  R EWE BLIND?
Bruce looks at the sign quizzically for a beat, then
continues on.
INT. NEWSROOM - DAY
Bruce rushes through the newsroom, rounds a corner and runs
right into BOBBY, the endlessly yammering PASTRY CART GUY.

                                                         1.
                                                         1

                     BOBBY
          Bruce the goose! Morning, Buddy.
          Don't even move, I got somethin'
          special today. My mom made it just
          for you.
                     BRUCE
          Well, that's- Bobby, I gotta go-
          I'm late...
                     BOBBY
               (bending down)
          You like Quiche?
He comes back up, proudly presents a slice of quiche.
                     BOBBY
          You know, contrary to popular
          belief the quiche was actually
          invented by the Mayans, then stolen
          by the French. They shoulda said,
          "Hey, that quiche ain't yours, it's
          Mayan!"
Bobby belts out a laugh.
                    BRUCE
          Bobby, I can't, I--
                     BOBBY
          Just taste it, taste it...
Bobby shoves a bite into Bruce's mouth. Bruce feigns liking
it with exasperation.
                     BRUCE
          Mmm, delicious, I really gotta go.
                     BOBBY
          That's a buck seventy-five.
                     BRUCE
          Can you get Kelly- Ahh...
Bruce tosses the thought, digs into his pocket, fishing for
cash.
                     BOBBY
               (excited)
          Oh, two o'clock, two o'clock, two-o-
          five, two-ten...

                                                       12.



Bruce glances over, annoyed but freezes at the sight of sexy
anchorwoman, SUSAN ORTEGA across the room.
                    BOBBY
          Way out of our league, huh?
Bruce offers his money to Bobby.
                     BOBBY
          You know, I saw them editing your
          cookie piece.

                     BRUCE
          Really?

                    BOBBY
          They must have gotten high or
          something, cause they was orderin'
          everything, I had. Hey, how long
          have you been interested in pastry?
          'Cause I've got an aunt who makes
          baklava twenty layers deep.

                     BRUCE
               (holding money out)
          Bobby.
                     BOBBY
               (gets a brilliant idea)
          Maybe you could do a story on her!
Bruce tosses the money on the cart, heads off.
                    BRUCE
          Keep the change.
                     BOBBY
               (calling after)
          I'll give her a call, we'll talk
          about it later!
INT. STAFF MEETING ROOM - DAY

ON THE MONITOR:

                     EVAN
          Is something killing your kids?
          Find out tonight at eleven.
Bruce looks at the sign quizzically for a beat, then
continues on.

                                                        13.



IN THE ROOM
The morning meeting is well in progress. Leading the group
is the station manager and Bruce's boss, JACK KELLER, 50's, a
constant furrow in his brow.
Also in the room: Bruce's fellow field reporter and rival
EVAN BAXTER, 30' s , a walking statement. Impeccable posture,
perfect speech, perfect everything and he knows it.
FRED DONOHUE, the ever jovial sports reporter; always tanned,
vain weatherman, DALLAS COLEMAN and segment producer Ally
Loman.

                    JACK
          Okay, promos are approved, let's--
                    ALLY
          Ah, isn't that last one a little
          misleading? I mean, the story's
          about flu shots. Do we have to
          scare people to death?
                    EVAN
          No, just into watching. Or I could
          change it to: "Slow news day, come
          yawn with us. At eleven."
                    FRED
          Sniffles at eleven is nice.
                    DALLAS
          Attack of the killer sniffles?
                    ALLY
              (to Dallas)
          The tanning booth is starting to
          zap your brain, you know that?
                    DALLAS
          I don't use a tanning booth.
A beat and they all crack up.
                    FRED                                        *
          Come on. You're turning orange.                       *
                    EVAN                                        *
          He looks Florida ripe to me.         .                *
More laughs.                                                    *

                                                     14.



                    JACK
          I would have swore I already said
          this, but promos are approved. Now                  *
          can we move on?                                     *
                    ALLY
          Jack, shouldn't the promos be                       *
          focusing on Pete's retirement.
          This is his last week.
                    EVAN
              (leading)
          Yeah, yeah. Any word on the open
          anchor position, Jack?
                     JACK
          Evan, you'11 know something when I
          know something.
Bruce bursts into the room. The meeting stops. Jack doesn't
need to say anything, he just looks at his watch.
                    BRUCE
          Sorry, Jack. It wasn't my fault.
          The traffic was -- You guys already
          played the spots?
                    JACK
          Nice story, Bruce, but we're going
          with Evan's piece on the sex
          scandal at the mayor's office for
          sweeps.
This hits Bruce hard. A beat of silence.
                    EVAN
          And that's the way the cookie
          crumbles.
The others chuckle. Only Ally remains sympathetic.
                    EVAN
          I'm just messin' with you, Bruce.
          See you've got to remember that the
          news room is like a cookie...
More laughs.
                    BRUCE
               (re: Evan's perfect
                posture)
          That's great Evan.
                      (MORE)

                                                          15.

                    BRUCE (cont'd)
          Is you're posture naturally that
          good, or do you have to shove a
          stick up there?
                    JACK
          Okay, knock it off... Bruce we're
          holding your story in reserve.
          Now, can we get back to the board
          so we have something to air today?
Jack continues with assignments. Evan sits smugly, as Bruce
slides down into his chair, deflated.
INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Jack is at Bobby's cart, paying for a sandwich. Bruce
catches up .to him.
                    BRUCE
          Jack, Jack, hey.     Can I talk to you
          for a second?
                    JACK
          Sure, Bruce. What do you need?
                    BRUCE
          Sweeps.
Jack takes his sandwich and leaves. Bobby leans to Bruce.
                    BOBBY
          Don't worry about it.    I called my
          aunt, we're on.
Bruce looks at Bobby, continues after and catches Jack.
                     BRUCE
          Look, Jack. Hear me out, I'm
          getting desperate man, I am pushing
          forty and what have I got to show
          for it? The point is, I've hit
          some kind of a ceiling here. Some
          kind of anti-Bruce barrierI And
          Evan is just lovin' it, by the way.
          He gets the good stories, he gets
          on sweeps. Maybe I have to be more
          like Evan.

                    JACK
          You don't want to be like Evan.
          Evan's an asshole.
                    BRUCE
          I can be an asshole.

                                                          16.



                          JACK
             No, Bruce.     You can't.
Bruce thinks, then flips Jack's sandwich plate over. It
scatters on the floor. Jack and Bruce stare at each other
for a beat.
                       JACK
             Are you going to pick that up?
                       BRUCE
             Yeah, I'm sorry.
Bruce bends down, starts picking up Jack's food.
                       BRUCE
             It's just- this anchor position
             looming, it's gotten me nuts...
He hands the plate to Jack, as sexy anchorwoman SUSAN ORTEGA
saunters by.
               JACK                               BRUCE
Hi, Susan.                           Hi, Susan.
                          SUSAN ORTEGA
             Hi, Jack.
Bruce blanches at this obvious snubbing.
                       JACK
             Look, Bruce. You're a good
             reporter. You make people laugh.
             God knows today we can use it.
Bruce slumps, he's heard this a thousand times before.              *
                        JACK                                    *
                 (beat)
             Alright, tell you what. It's the                   *
             23rd anniversary of the Maid of the
             Mist. I want you at Niagara Falls
             in an hour.
                       BRUCE

          Yes, but watch yourself, Bruce.

          Yes 1 You will not regret this,
          Jack.

          What we've always talked about.
          Jack practically came out and told
          me.
Grace quickly switches gears.   She experienced the premature-
celebration before.
                    GRACE
          Wait, what do you mean practically?
                    BRUCE
          Well, he didn't spell it out, but
          this is exactly what happened to
          Susan Ortega right before she was
          bumped up to the desk.
                    GRACE
              (being cautious)
          I just want to make sure we're not
          getting too ahead of ourselves.
                    BRUCE
          I totally agree, but in the mean

          about what coast you want to live
          on.
Ally interrupts, indicating the time.

Some of the CREW MEMBERS watch the feed.

ON TV

Pete Fineman is reporting.
                     PETE FINEMAN
           ...but because of the fast response
           by our local fire fighters, the
           toxic chemicals were cleaned up
           without incident. Susan.
The female co-anchor, SUSAN ORTEGA:

           Bruce Nolan is standing by at
           Niagara Falls with a report on the
           Maid of the Mist sightseeing boat,
           but before we go live to Bruce, we
           have an announcement to make. As
           everyone knows, after 33 years, our
           beloved Pete Fineman is retiring.
Pete smiles a proud, heart-felt smile.
                      SUSAN
           Pete's shoes are virtually
           impossible to fill, but the show
           must go on. And we could think of
           no one better than our very own
           Evan Baxter.

Listening to the feed. His FACE GOES WHITE.      He stands in
shock.
Evan is seated next to Susan.

          Congratulations, Evan. Looks like
          we'll be sitting side by side from
          now on.
                    EVAN
          Thanks, Susan. I ' m thrilled and
          honored. Like you said, no one can
          replace the great Pete Fineman, but
          I'll do my best. I have to say I
          am so proud to be a part of our
          local community. Of Buffalo. I
          think a great city is a lot like a
          great recipe really. Put in some
          hard working citizens, add some
          care givers, maybe a few nuts...
The other news anchors and Evan himself chuckle at "his"
joke. Bruce listens on the feed, beyond stunned.
                     EVAN (CONT'D)
          All sprinkled with the strength and
          love of our good families, that
          ultimately creates a sweet place to
          live. Thank you.

          news. Back to you fuckers 1
INT. STUDIO CONTROL ROOM - .CONTINUOUS
Susan Ortega stares frozen blankly into camera.
                                           SMASH CUT TO:

EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
Bruce is TOSSED OUT THE FRONT DOORS, his box of possessions
spilling on the ground. Bruce FLAILS at the building.
EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
Bruce carries his box to his car, when he HEARS A NOISE.
A street GANG is hassling the HOMELESS SIGN GUY. Pushing him
around, breaking and painting over his signs.
Instinctively, Bruce walks over.
                    BRUCE
          Hey, come on guys. What are you
          doin'? Just leave him alone.
They turn, look at Bruce, laugh and head off.    Bruce helps
the Sign Guy up, looks after the Gang.
                    BRUCE
          Yeah, you'd better keep walkin'.
They stop cold, turn back to Bruce and CHARGE AT HIM. Bruce
attempts to run, but they leap on him in a big dog pile,
swinging and kicking.
Bruce is left with a bloody lip, lying beside his car. We
hear the sound of smashing glass and scratching metal and the
gang running off. Bruce slowly gets up.
Reveal Bruce's car, WINDOW'S SMASHED, PAINT SCRAPED and the
word "HERO" KEY SCRATCHED ON THE DOOR.
                    BRUCE
          B-e-a-utiful.
               (looks up)
                     (MORE)

                                                       28.

                    BRUCE (cont'd)
          Just what you get for trying to
          help someone.
Bruce gets in, pulls out of the parking lot passing the
Homeless Man who sits beaten up holding a scrawled out sign
"LIFE IS. JUST"
                    BRUCE
          Get a clue, buddy.
INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Bruce is pacing, holding an ICE PACK to his swollen lip.
                    GRACE
          Thank God you're alright.
                    BRUCE
          God, yeah. Let's thank God.
          Thanks for everything, Lord. I am
          so honored that my horrible demise
          is a part of your loving and
          mysterious plan.
                    GRACE
          Bruce, don't talk like that.
                    BRUCE
          Oh, don't worry, he's not
          listening. If he is he doesn't
          care. Have you seen the news
          lately? We got gangs, we got
          drugs, we got corruption. What
          kind of God lets that happen?
          Every time we cure a disease he
          comes up with a new one!
              (goes into God character)
          Yeah, is this the lab? Yeah, it's
          God. They've just come up with a
          treatment for syphilis down there.
          I think it's time to release the
          tainted monkey. Oh, and there's a
          guy in Ohio who's praying for
          strength and wisdom, blind him and
          cut off his legs.
                    GRACE
          So God is torturing us?
                    BRUCE
          Think about it, Grace. God is all-
          powerful . He could fix everything
          in five minutes if he wanted to.
                    (MORE)

                                                         29.

                    BRUCE (cont'd)
          But he doesn't want to. He doesn't
          like me.
Sam starts PEEING ON THE RUG.

                     BRUCE
          Oh, Perfect!
              (to the dog)
          But you're aim isn't so good, I'm
          over herel
                    GRACE
          Bruce, please. This isn't his
          fault.
                    BRUCE
          Of course not.
              (hushed tone)
          It's part of the mysterious plan.
Grace puts Sam outside. Returns, trying to calm Bruce.
                    GRACE
          Honey, you're mad right now. It's
          understandable. And what Evan did
          was slimy and wrong. But your job
          doesn't matter to me. You matter
          to me. You could've really been
          hurt. I'm just glad you're okay.

                    BRUCE
          Okay? News flash: I'm not okayi
          And I'm not okay with the fact that
          you think everything is okay. I'm
          not okay with a mediocre job. I'm
          not okay with a mediocre apartment.
          I'm not okay with a mediocre LIFE!
Bruce angrily swipes at the table knocking the photos and the
photo albums to floor.
                    GRACE
          Is that what you have, Bruce?
          A mediocre life? Well, I'm sorry
          for being a piece in your mediocre
          puzzle.
                    BRUCE
          Terrific. I'm drowning and you
          throw me a brick!
Grace starts to cry.

                                                                  30.



                        BRUCE
            Perfect! I'll have the worst day
            of my life with a side order of
            guilt, please. I-- I don't need
            this.
Bruce grabs his keys and heads out.

INT. CAR - NIGHT
It's RAINING now. Bruce drives, going nowhere in particular.
His frustration is turning to desperation.
                        BRUCE
            Okay, God. You want me to talk to
            you? Then talk back. Tell me
            what's going on? What should I
            do? Give me a sign...
Bruce passes a BLINKING YELLOW CAUTION LIGHT, doesn't
notice. . .
                      BRUCE
            I'm right here. Speak to me.
A PEDESTRIAN stepping into the crosswalk, steps back out of
the way.
                      PEDESTRIAN
            SLOW DOWN, ASSHOLE!

Bruce is oblivious.
                        BRUCE
            All I need is some guidance.
            Please send me a signal.
A TRUCK TRANSPORTING VARIOUS ROAD SIGNS pulls in front of
Br uce . F our way s, bli nki ng. The va rie d s igns re ad: Yi eld ,
Wrong Way, Dead End, Do Not Enter, Stop.

                       BRUCE
            Oh well, I guess you don't care.
Bruce spots the PRAYER BEADS hanging on the rearview mirror.
                        BRUCE
            Okay, we'll do it your way.
                 (pulls the beads from the
                  mirror)
            Lord, I need a miracle. Please
            help me.

                                                               31.



He hits a bump and the BEADS DROP TO THE FLOOR.        Bruce
reaches down, fishes for the beads...
                      BRUCE
           Come on, where'd you go?
                (holds them up in triumph)
           Ah ha! AHHH!
And BAM!11 BRUCE'S CAR SLAMS INTO A LIGHT POST.

EXT. STREET - LAKE EERIE - CONTINUOUS
Bruce stumbles out, surveys his demolished car, then looks at
the beads in his hands. He begins to laugh maniacally.
He spots the lake, starts running toward it like a madman,
HEAVES THE PRAYER BEADS INTO THE LAKE. He looks heavenward,
challenging the Infinite.
                    BRUCE
          Okay, if that's the way you want
          it. The gloves are off, pal! Let
          me see a little wrath! Smite me oh
          mighty smiteri What, no pestilence
          no boils? Come on, you got me on
          the ropes, don't you want to finish
          me off?! You're the one who should
          be fired! The only one around here
          not doing his job is YOU! What are
          we, you're little pet project? A
          hobby you tinker with now and
          again? Answer me. ANSWER ME!!!
A beat of silence then Bruce's BEEPER GOES OFF. He cynically
chuckles at the timing, checks it, sees 772-5623.
                     BRUCE
           Sorry, don't know you, wouldn't
           call you if I did.
Bruce walks off toward his wrecked car, it BEEPS AGAIN.
                                             CUT TO:
CLOSE ON - AN ALARM CLOCK

The BEEPING continues. We are in. . .

INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING

Bruce wakes, slaps at the alarm clock, groggy, reaches for
the phone, finally realizes it's the beeper. He gets up,
begrudgingly, checks it. The same number.

                                                          32.



                    BRUCE
          Well, hello again 772-5623, don't
          hold your breath.
Bruce tosses the pager on the bed, heads for the bathroom.
The beeper BEEPS. Bruce stops in his tracks, turns, opens
the window, grabs the beeper and FIRES IT OUT. It SHATTERS
against a telephone pole. He calmly continues to the
bathroom.
INT. BATHROOM

A note is stuck in the bathroom mirror, with an old picture
of he and Grace in happier times. The note simply says:
"I LOVE YOU.    WE NEED TO TALK.
Grace"

Peering over top of the note, Bruce sees Sam circling on the
rug.
                       BRUCE
          Oh, no.
EXT. STAIR WELL - CONTINUOUS
Bruce runs down the stairs carrying the trickling, Sam.
EXT. APARTMENT - DAY

Bruce sets Sam on the grass. Sam looks up, finished.
                     BRUCE
          What's the point?
BEEP, BEEP, BEEP...

Bruce walks over to the shattered beeper. He picks up a
small piece of it containing the LED read out: 772-5623
ON BRUCE - AMAZED

                                         CUT TO:

INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

A PHONE - BRUCE DIALS THE NUMBER

A PRERECORDED VOICE ANSWERS

                                                           33.



                       COMPUTERIZED VOICE
             Denied that promotion at work? Is
             life unfair? Everywhere you turn
             is there someone less talented than
             you reaping all the benefits ? Is
             your name Bruce? Then do we have
             the job for you. We're located at
             77256 23rd Street...
Bruce reaches for a pen, begins jotting down the address.
                       COMPUTERIZED VOICE
             So come on down, or we'll just keep
             beepin' ya.
EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
An old building on the outskirts of town. A faded sign
painted on the wall reads, OMNI PRESENTS.
Bruce's demolished car enters frame.      He studies the area and
building suspiciously.
Bruce cautiously moves towards the structure and then, STEPS
IN A PUDDLE. He SINKS UP TO HIS KNEE.
                        BRUCE
             Perfect.
He gets out, shakes off his sopping leg, and heads inside.
INT. OMNI PRESENTS - DAY
Bruce enters and checks the BUILDING DIRECTORY.      It reads:
OMNI PRESENTS UNLTD.

Pers onnel    Rm. 7
Ac coun ting Rm. 7
Security      Rm . 7
Creativ e     Rm. 7
                       VOICE (O.S.)
             You're looking for room 7.
Bruce turns to see a JANITOR mopping the floor.     He looks at
Bruce's wet leg, offers the mop.
                       JANITOR
             Want me to even those up for you?

                                                            34.


                     BRUCE
               (feigns a smile)
          How would I get to room 7?
                     JANITOR
          That'd be on the seventh floor.
          Stairs are right over there.
                     BRUCE
          What about the elevator?
He points to an elevator bank a couple of steps away.
                     JANITOR
          Out of order.
Bruce heads for the stairs.
                     JANITOR
          You mind giving me a hand with this
          floor?
                    BRUCE
          What? Yeah, I mind.
He continues on.

SEVENTH FLOOR

The stairwell door opens up to a LARGE ROOM with a SINGLE
DESK at the end of an otherwise empty space.
Bruce hears someone tinkering atop a tall ladder extending
into a hole in the ceiling.
                     BRUCE
          Excuse me. Hello. I'm, ah,
          looking for whoever runs this
          joint...
                     MAN (O.S.)
          Be right with y.a, just fixin' a
          light. Tell me if it's working?
CLICK and an INSANELY BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT ILLUMINATES, shining
down blinding Bruce.

                     BRUCE
          Yep, seems to be.
               (wiping his eyes)
          Kinda bright, though.

                                                         35.



An electrician, silhouetted in the bright light, descends the
ladder.
                    MAN (O.S.)
          Yeah, it is for most people. They
          spend their lives in the dark...
As he talks he steps down next to Bruce and we see that it is
the SAME JANITOR.
                      JANITOR (CONT'D)
          . . . thinkin' they can hide from me.
The two stand, angelically illuminated.    Bruce tries to put
everything together.
                    BRUCE
          Oh, the elevator's broken, huh?
                    JANITOR
          Yeah, but I'll get around to it.
The Janitor CLAPS HIS HANDS TWICE and the light goes off.
                    BRUCE
          You installed a clapper?
                     JANITOR
          Nope.   Catchy jingle, though.
              (sings)
          CLAP ON. CLAP OFF.    CLAP ON, CLAP
          OFF. THE CLAPPER.
               (claps twice)
          You can't get it out of your head.
                    BRUCE
          I gotta go.
                    JANITOR
          Okay, but the boss'11 be right out.
The Janitor unzips his uniform, revealing a very nice suit.
He extends his hand to Bruce.
                    JANITOR
          You must be Bruce. I've been
          expecting you.
                    BRUCE
          Oh, this is hilarious. So you're
          the boss and the electrician and
          the janitor.

                                                         36.



                     JANITOR
          Nothin' wrong with rollin' up your
          sleeves, son. People underestimate
          the benefits of good 'ol manual
          labor. There's freedom in it.
          Happiest people in the world stink
          like hell at the end of the day.
He strolls down the room, takes a seat behind the big desk.
                     JANITOR
          Your father knew that. He was a
          damn good welder.
Bruce approaches the desk.
                     BRUCE
          How do you know my father? And how
          did you get my pager number?
                     JANITOR
          Oh, I know a lot about you Bruce.
          Pretty much everything there is to
          know. Everything you've ever said,
          done or thought about doin', is
          right there in that file cabinet.
He points out a single drawer file cabinet.
                     BRUCE
               (sarcastic)
          Wow, a whole drawer. Just for me?
          Mind if I take a look?
                     JANITOR
          It's your life.
Bruce pulls the drawer and it FLIES OPEN, DRAGGING HIM THE
FULL LENGTH OF THE ROOM --
The Janitor casually pulls a file.
                     JANITOR
          Now this last entry was a little
          disturbing.
He thumps the file cabinet with his fist and the drawer
dramatically sucks closed, DRAGGING BRUCE BACK. The Janitor
reads from the file.
                     JANITOR
               (reads, scanning)
          Thanks for everything, Lord.
                     (MORE)

                                                         37.

                      JANITOR (cont'd)
          I am so honored that my horrible
          demise is a part of your loving and
          mysterious plan.. The gloves are
          off, pal.. Smite me oh mighty
          smiter.
               (aside)
          I'm not much for blaspheming but
          that one made me laugh. Oh, and
          let's not forget "What kind of a
          God would let this happen? I mean,
          have you seen then news lately?"
Bruce stands, dazed. ·
                     BRUCE
          Who are you?
                     JANITOR
          I'm the creator of the heavens and
          the earth. I'm the alpha & omega.
          The first and the last.
                     BRUCE
          Sorry, it's not ringing a bell.
                     JANITOR/GOD
          I'm God, Bruce.
                     BRUCE
          Oh, you're God. Well that explains
          everything1 That's how you know
          everything about me. That's how
          you got up to the seventh floor so
          quickly.
               (placating)
          Well, it's really nice to meet you.
          Thanks for the Grand Canyon and,
          ah, good luck with the apocalypse.
Bruce turns to leave, BUT FINDS HIMSELF WALKING RIGHT TOWARD
GOD AND HIS DESK. He tries again, and again.
                     BRUCE
          Okay, I don't know how you're doing
          that, but I really gotta go. This
          place is obviously rigged in some
          way. We're on some freaky hidden
          camera show.
               (playing to the "cameras")
          ...for which I will not sign a
          release, by the way! But you know
          what, I'd be a little more
          impressed if you didn't use the
          cheesy file cabinet illusion.
                     (MORE)

                                                               38.

                        BRUCE      (cont'd)
              Everyone with a      brain in their head
              would know that      the drawer is being
·             fed through the       wall from behind--
    Bruce pulls the file cabinet from the wall, sees it has a
    normal back.
                           BRUCE
              Okay.     That's good.   That's a good
              one.
    Bruce quickly puts his hands behind his back.
                        BRUCE
              Okay, God. How many fingers am I
              holding out?
    Bruce extends three fingers.
                           GOD
              Three.
    He quickly pulls one finger in.
                           GOD
              Two.
    Bruce begins switching fingers rapidly.      God doesn't miss a
    beat.
                        GOD
              Four. Nine. Six. Eight. One...
    One final attempt, Bruce holds seven fingers.
                        BRUCE
              Okay, how about now.
    He quickly pulls in two fingers.
                           GOD
              Seven.

                          .BRUCE
              AH HAl
    Bruce proudly presents his single hand of five extended
    fingers to God, then immediately notices he has SEVEN FINGERS
    ON HIS ONE HAND.

                          BRUCE
              AAAHHHl

                                                             39,



He shakes his fingers wildly and the two extra fingers
disappear. God approaches Bruce.
                    GOD
          You've been doing a lot of
          complaining about me, Bruce. And
          quite frankly, I'm tired of it...
Bruce backs away from God.
                    BRUCE
          You stay away from me! I don't
          know what your doing. But whatever
          you're doing is probably
          actionable!
                    GOD
          Well, that's not very neighborly.
          I brought you here to offer you a
          job.
                    BRUCE
          Job? Wh at job?
                     GOD
          My job. You think you can do it
          better, so here's your chance.
          When you leave this building you
          will be endowed with all my powers.
                    BRUCE
          Sure, whatever you say, Pal.
He turns to go but GOD STANDS BEFORE HIM in the Janitor
uniform, holding the mop.
                     GOD
          All the power of God.
Bruce glances back at the empty desk, turns back again and
God the Janitor has also vanished. A beat, then Bruce
sprints out of the room.
EXT. OMNI PRESENTS - DAY
Bruce barrels out of the building --
                     BRUCE
          Okay, that did not happen.
He races to his car stepping in the SAME PUDDLE, but this
time his foot doesn't sink, he WALKS RIGHT ACROSS IT. He
paus es f or a bea t --

                                                           40.



                     BRUCE
          No.

He races on.

INT. BRUCE'S CAR

Bruce jumps in, turns the key, the car turns over but doesn't
start.
                    BRUCE
          I'm having a breakdown. That's
          what it is. Just a normal,
          everyday psychotic episode, brought
          on by tumor or brain lesion...
We hear the car wind down to nothing. Bruce releases the key
pounds the steering wheel in frustration.
                    BRUCE
              (to the car)
          Come on, startI
The car INSTANTLY starts.
                     BRUCE
               (denial)
          Well, that was lucky.
Bruce backs up, peels out.
MUSIC UP: "HE'S GOT THE WHOLE WORLD IN HIS HANDS"

EXT. CITY STREETS

Bruce drives, whistling the tune, catches himself,
immediately stops whistling.
                     BRUCE
          Okay, just relax here. I did not
          meet God and I do not have his
          powers.
               (laughs)
          If that was God, then I'm Mario
          Andretti.
Instantly, Bruce's car PEELS OUT, races through traffic,
dodging and passing cars right and left.
                     BRUCE
          AAAHHHHHHHH!J!

                                                            41.


Suddenly there is a GUY IN A RED PIT CREW SUIT standing
before Bruce waving a red flag. Bruce swerves to avoid the
man and SCREECHES into a pit stop. Several other red-suited
Italian men engulf the car. Bruce watches in amazement as the
professional racing team jacks up his car, slaps on HUGE MAG
TIRES, gases him up, etc. PAUL NEWMAN leans into the
driver's window.
                    PAUL NEWMAN
          Hey Mario, did you get that box of
          dressing I sent you?
Bruce responds against his will IN PERFECT ITALIAN --
                    BRUCE
              (in perfect Italian)
          Si, dovete venire sopra per il
          pranzo un certo tempo.
              (SUBTITLES: Yes, you must
               come over for dinner some
               time.)
Bruce reacts shocked.   The crew backs off and urges him on in
Italian.
                     PIT CREW
          Vete l Ve tel
Bruce's car peels out on it's own, he struggles to control
the wheel, finally pulling over to a curb. His car door
won't open so he has to crawl out of the driver's window.

He rushes onto the sidewalk, backing away from his normal
looking Tauras. Not knowing what to do, he slips into a
diner.
INT. DINER - DAY
Bruce quickly walks to a back corner booth. The only other
patron is an OLD MAN seated at the counter.
                    BRUCE
          It isn't real, it isn't real, it
          isn't real...
An older. Sally Kirkland-type WAITRESS, order pad in hand,
stands listening to Bruce with a raised eyebrow.
                    BRUCE
          Oh hi, ah, coffee please.
The waitress pours him a cup.

                                                         42.



                    WAITRESS
          We've got a special on soup today.

                    BRUCE
          No, that's okay.
                    WAITRESS
          It's tomato.
                    BRUCE
          Alright, okay.
She heads off.    Bruce sits thinking.   Could it be real?
He looks at the SUGAR down at the end of the table, holds out
his hand and the SUGAR SLIDES ACROSS THE TABLE RIGHT INTO HIS
HAND. The CREAMER slides into his other hand.
Bruce is half scared, half thrilled. He pours some cream and
sugar into his cup, looks around the table.
                    BRUCE
          Excuse me I need a spoooo...
Bruce chokes up a spoon into his hands, wipes it off with his
napkin.
                     BRUCE
          That's alright, I found one.
The Old Man eyes Bruce suspiciously, gets up and moves
further down the counter.
The Waitress sets down the soup, heads off, then turns back.
                     WAITRESS
          I lie to my sister.
                     BRUCE
          What?
                     WAITRESS
               (becoming emotional)
          And I'm sleeping with my best
          friend's husband. I know he's just
          using me but.. I'm just so tired of
          being alone. I don't know why I'm
          telling you all this. Just seems
          like you'd understand.
                     BRUCE
          Okay.

                                                       43.



                     WAITRESS
               (sets the check down)
          Take care of that whenever you're
          ready.
Bruce looks at the soup. His look grows intense.   He slowly
raises his hands over the soup bowl....
MUSIC UP: THE TEN COMMANDMENTS THEME

The front door blows open, as A WIND SWIRLS through the diner
and with all the flourish of Moses at the Red Sea, BRUCE
PARTS HIS RED SOUP.
A little cockroach scurries across the table, climbs up the
edge of the bowl and walks through to the other side.
                    GOD (O.S.)
          Havin' fun?
Bruce is startled and the soup splashes back to normal
collapsing on the cockroach. He looks up at God standing
beside the booth. Bruce is now awestruck.
                    BRUCE
          You- He- Thy...
                    GOD
          Let's take a walk.
EXT. LAKE ERIE - DAY

God leans down, lets the little soup covered cockroach go.
God and Bruce then walk along the lake shore.
                     GOD
               (re: the cockroach)
          Most people want to kill these
          guys. I'm quite fond of em'. Very
          streamlined design. Like little
          armored tanks. Y'know, they can
          hold their breath for forty minutes
          and their cells divide only once
          per molting cycle creating a
          cytoskeleton with cell adhesion
          that...
               (catching himself)
          Oh, this is a bit over your head,
          isn't it?
Off Bruce's look.

                                                        44.



                    GOD
          Okay, let me explain the rules.
                     BRUCE
          Rules ?
                    GOD
          Yeah, you left in such a rush I
          didn't get a chance to explain.
                    BRUCE
          Well the two extra fingers freaked
          me out a little bit.
                     GOD
               (laughs)
          I figured that would get your
          attention.. I did the same thing to
          Ghandi, he couldn't eat for three
          weeks. Now, here's the deal. You
          have all my power. Use it any way
          you choose. There are only two
          rules. You can't tell anyone
          you're God. Believe me you don't
          want that kind of attention. And
          you can't mess with free will.
                     BRUCE
          Uh huh.   Can I-ask why?
                    GOD
              (excited)
          Yes you can. That's the beauty it.
Suddenly a LARGE SAILBOAT SAIL PASSES RIGHT BY THEM.   Bruce
looks to the sail, oddly, then...
WIDE ANGLE - REVEAL God and Bruce are now walking ON THE LAKE
about 100 feet from the shore. They watch the sailboat pass.
Bruce is awestruck.
                     BRUCE
          This is amazing.
                     GOD
          Oh, speaking of amazing...
God dips his hand in the Lake and pulls out THE PRAYER BEADS.
He pockets them as he talks.

                                                         45.



                     GOD
           Since you're finished with these, I
           think I'll hang to 'em. Might come
           in handy someday.
WIDE MASTER - BUFFALO CITY-SCAPE

God and Bruce are tiny figures on the river, as God begins to
walk away.
                     GOD
           I'll be seein' ya.
                     BRUCE
           Where are you going?
                     GOD
           I'm taking a vacation.
                     BRUCE
           God can't take a vacation. Can he?
           Can you?
                     GOD
           Ever hear of the Dark Ages?
           Besides, I'm covered. You can fix
           everything in five minutes if you
           want to, right?
ON BRUCE
                       BRUCE
           ...Right.
Left alone, Bruce begins to carefully tip toe back to shore,
progresses to a full sprint.
INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

Grace and Debbie stand at the check-out stand. Grace flips
through a celeb magazine, as Debbie places the last few items
from the cart to the conveyor belt.
In the background, throughout, Debbie's daughter, Zoe is
grabbing random items off the shelves and placing them on the
belt.
                       GRACE
                (re: magazine)
           Gosh, this girl is so talented and
           all they ever talk about is her
           hair.

                                                       46.



                    DEBBIE
          Yeah, she should marry somebody
          famous, take the focus off.
Grace checks her cell phone screen.
                    DEBBIE
          We would have heard it ring.
                    GRACE
          I know. It's just that he usually
          calls during the day.
                    DEBBIE
          He just needs to blow off some
          steam, he'll be fine.
                    GRACE
          I hope so. I've never seen him                        *
          that mad. An d I lashed back--                        *
                    DEBBIE
          Wow, you lashed? You never lash.
          I'm impressed.
                    GRACE
          I feel bad for him.   He's wanted
          anchor for so long.
Zoe begins pulling groups of items onto the belt.
                    DEBBIE
          Well, I've been praying to win the
          lottery for fifteen years, but it's
          not going to happen. You know,
          it's not all about money.
The CLERK finishes ringing the last item.
                    CLERK
          That'll be four hundred and twenty-
          seven, eighty.-
                       DEBBIE
          What?!
Debbie looks in a bag, pulls out a handful of various counter
items. Zoe giggles and proudly holds up one of the hundred
or so Tic-Tac mint containers.
                      DEBBIE
          Zoe.
                 (to Clerk)
                       (MORE)

                                                           47.

                       DEBBIE (cont'd)
             Hang on, I might need you to un-
             check a few things.
The people in line hem and haw, exasperated.
                       GUY IN LINE
             Come on, lady.
                     DEBBIE
               (snaps)
          Hey, everybody back-off i
Zoe laughs, enjoying the commotion.
                     GRACE
          Listen, I better get back. I want
          to be there for him.
                    DEBBIE
          You're a saint, Grace.
                    GRACE
          What can I say, I love him. And if
          I know Bruce, he's out there
          wandering around with the weight of
          the world on his shoulders.

                                            CUT T0:

EXT. CITY STREETS - DUSK
Bruce struts down the street the embodiment of confidence.
He turns shooting a finger at a fire hydrant, it BLASTS
WATER. KIDS run off their front steps, start playing.
A PRETTY GIRL IN A DRESS, comes' walking toward him. As she
passes he BLOWS A LITTLE AIR OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS MOUTH
and turns to watch her SKIRT FLY UP.
                    BRUCE
          And he saw that it was good.
He spots a    mannequin in a store window display, wearing a
cool, casu   al outfit. He closes his eyes. When he opens
them, HE'S   WEARING THE COOL NEW OUTFIT and the mannequin is
dressed in   his clothes. He checks his reflection. . . better.
Bruce rounds the corner, sees the SAME GANG that beat him up,
hanging out in the alley.
                    BRUCE
          B-e-a-utifull

                                                              48.


EXT. ALLEY

Bruce approaches the gang.
                       BRUCE
             Hey guys, remember me?
The gang members turn to Bruce.
                       HOOD #1
             Oh look, it's the hero.
                       HOOD #2
             Hungry for another can of whoop-
             ass?
                        HOOD #3
             Your stereo sounds great in my car,
             man.
He and a couple other gang members laugh and high-five.
                       BRUCE
             Look, I don't want to fight you
             guys. So as soon as you apologize,
             I'll be on my way.
A beat, then the Hoods BURST OUT LAUGHING.         A few circle
behind, surrounding Bruce.
                       HOOD #1
             Oh, yeah. I'll apologize... The
             day a monkey climbs out of my butt.
                        BRUCE
             What a coincidence. That's today.
The Hood gets a PAINED LOOK, starts gyrating around, then a
MONKEY comes climbing out the back of his baggy pants.
The Big Guy looks at Hood #1.
                       BIG GUY
             Did that come out of your butt,
             man?
Hood #1 faints from shock.
                       BRUCE
             Now I'm going to have to teach the
             rest of you guys a lesson.

                                                         49.



                     HOOD #2
           Yeah, you and whose army?
                     BRUCE
           Just me... and me...
ANOTHER BRUCE steps out from behind a stack of crates.
                     BRUCE
           And me, and me, and me, me, me, me,
           me and me and me.
As Bruce talks, DUPLICATE BRUCE'S begin popping out from
various spots, a doorway, hanging down from a fire escape, a
dumpster pops open, six Bruce's jump out.
                      BRUCE
           PILE ON THE RABBIT1
T HE B RUGES CONV ERGE ON TH E GA NG --

Hood #2 is instantly tackled by THREE BRUGES --
ONE BRUCE kneels down behind a hood, ANOTHER BRUCE pushes him
down over his back. The two Bruce's high-five --
A Hood climbs a fire escape. ONE BRUCE gives a hand up to
ANOTHER BRUCE, who takes pursuit. ANOTHER BRUCE leans out of
a window SMASHES a potted plant over his head --
ON THE MONKEY - SCREECHING, ENJOYING THE EXCITEMENT

Our Bruce stands in the middle of the action, happily
watching the mayhem.
                      HOOD #2
           Let's get out of here, manl
Hood #2 takes off running, the gang members follow.
                      BRUCE
           Okay guys, Kum Ba Yal
The Bruce's jog over, leaping and diving into Bruce's body.
                      BRUCE
           I'll take it from here.
Bruce takes a deep breath, OPENS HIS MOUTH WIDE, RELEASING A
SWARM OF LOCUSTS --

                                                             50.



EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

The gang streams out of the alley screaming, COVERED IN
LOCUSTS.
Bruce exits the alley, the monkey at his side.        He looks down
to the monkey.
                     BRUCE
           Back home for you, little one.
The monkey takes off back into the alley, as we see HOOD #1
stumbling to his feet.
                       HOOD #1
           NoI   NOOOOO1
He takes off running, the monkey in hot pursuit.
ON BRUCE
He belches and one last locust flies out.      He reacts to the
unpleasant aftertaste and walks off.
                                            CUT TO:
CLOSE ON - BRUCE

We widen to an UP ANGLE of him standing on the top of
Buffalo's tallest SKYSCRAPER. Clouds swirl behind him. He
looks out over the vast city lights, opens his arms and
proclaims to the world.
                      BRUCE
           I AM THE LORD THY BRUCE ALMIGHTY.
           MY WILL BE DONE I
Bruce poses in dramatic god-like form, lightning crashes
behind him. He is an awesome god.
INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Grace sits on the floor next to the coffee table with a box
of photos working on the album. She takes a sip of wine,
sets down the glass. Sam walks over and laps up the wine.
                      GRACE
                (to Sam)
           Well, at least I have someone to
           drink with.
Grace hears Bruce coming up the stairs, singing.

                                                       51.



                     BRUCE
          What if God was one of us. . .
          Just a slob like one of us...
          Just a stranger on a bus...
          Trying to make his way. . .
Grace reacts a bit surprised by Bruce's happy tone, she gets
up, opens the door and there stands BRUCE, beaming smile,
holding a very unique BOUQUET OF FLOWERS.
                    BRUCE
              (finishing song)
          ...home.
                    GRACE
              (re: the flowers)
          Oh, my God.
                    BRUCE
          You can call me Bruce.
                    GRACE
          Where have you been? You're
          so...happy.
                     BRUCE
          Who wouldn't be on a night like
          this?
               (holding out the flowers)
          For you.
Grace takes the flowers, gives Bruce a kiss, still sizing up
his mood.
                    GRACE
          These are amazing. What are they?
                    BRUCE
          It's a totally new breed. A cross
          pollination between tulips and
          Daisies. I call them Todayzees.
                    GRACE
          Todayzees? Okay...
Grace goes to put them in water.

          Bruce, is there something you're
          not telling me?

                                                            52.


                    BRUCE
          Nothing of this world. Why?
                    GRACE
          What do you mean, why? Last night
          you weren't exactly happy with
          life.
                    BRUCE
          Last night, I was only human.
Bruce backs out of the kitchen seductively.

Bruce breezes through, casually instructs the stereo as he

The Stereo illuminates and Barry White music plays.
EXT. BALCONY - CONTINUOUS
Bruce opens the doors, steps onto the balcony. He surveys
the cloudy sky, reaches up with his hand and ERASES THE
CLOUDS, LIKE ON A CHALKBOARD.
Still not completely satisfied he reaches up toward the moon
and makes a LASSOING MOTION, THEN BEGINS TO PULL.
                                          CUT TO:
OUTER SPACE - BEHIND THE MOON
Earth far off in the distance - And with a THUNDEROUS RUMBLE
the MOON starts MOVING CLOSER TO EARTH.
BACK TO SCENE
Bruce adds a finishing touch by adding several stars with
points of his finger.
Grace joins Bruce on the balcony and is taken aback by the
perfectly orchestrated sky.
                     GRACE
          Wow, it really cleared up. I've
          never seen the moon that big.
Bruce puts his arms around Grace from behind.

                                                        53.



                    BRUCE
          We shouldn't waste it.
Bruce starts kissing her neck. Grace turns, .they kiss and a
METEOR SHOWER lights the sky behind them. The kiss ends.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Grace grabs a neglige from the drawer, heads into the
bathroom. Bruce enters, adjusts the ambience of the room,
BLOWS THE LIGHTS OUT with a quick puff of air, LIGHTS CANDLES
with a gesture. His clothes magically fall away.

Grace slips her neglige on, begins brushing her hair.

          Don't rush yourself. Sometimes                        *
          anticipation can heighten the                         *

Grace SHUDDERS a bit at the word "pleasure", quickly finishes *
brushing, picks up her lipstick.                             *
                       BRUCE (O.S.)                             *
          It's a funny thing about, pleasure.                   *
GRACE'S KNEES BUCKLE, causing the lipstick to smear across *
her face. She sits down on the toilet seat to get a hold of *

          It can be extremely pleasurable.                      *
Grace has a very POWERFUL ORGASM and slides off the toilet *
out of frame to the ground.                                *

BRUCE
Standing at the door with both arms extended toward the
bathroom like an WARLOCK CASTING A SPELL. Suddenly the light
hits him from the open bathroom door and he quickly strikes a
casual pose.
Grace stands in the open doorway, panting like an animal.
She dives on Bruce, attacking him.

          develops. . .
Grace half watches the newscast as she finishes breakfast.
INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
Bruce lies blissfully asleep. Big smile, life is good.
Then, we hear WHISPERING - Like distant voices MURMURING all
at once. Bruce wakes with a start. He looks around puzzled,
sticks his finger in his ear checking his hearing as the
voices fade away.
ANGLE - SAM
Circling, getting ready to go on the carpet. Bruce casually
warns.
                    BRUCE
          Sam. Uh uh uh.

                                                         55.



Sam looks at Bruce for a beat, then  walks into bathroom,
raises the toilet seat with his nos e, and STANDS UP ON HIS
TWO HIND LEGS, HOLDING HIS SNAUSAGE WITH HIS FRONT PAWS (NO,
WE DON'T SEE IT) AND STARTS TO GO.   He looks proudly back at
Bruce.

                      BRUCE
          Good boy.

Grace places breakfast on the table. Bruce comes out, fully
dressed with a spring in his step.

          Good morning.
                     GRACE
               (gushy-lovey, sing songy)
          Good morning. Cooked you grilled
          cheese.
                     BRUCE
          Oo, my favey.
Bruce sits, Grace sets down his plate, leans close.
                     GRACE
          Last night was just...
                      BRUCE
          Heavenly?
                      GRACE
          Mmm hmm.
Bruce enjoys his grilled cheese.
                      GRACE
          It's funny, but when I woke up this
          morning, It felt like my boobs were
          bigger.
Bruce looks away, guilty, trying to be nonchalant.
                     GRACE
               (holding them up)
          Do they look bigger to you?
                     BRUCE
          Huh? Ah, no, they, ah, look the
          same to me.

                                                            56.


They aren't.    They are clearly bigger.      She holds them.
                      GRACE
            They're definitely bigger.      They
            feel huge to me.
Bruce throws up his hands.
                       BRUCE
            You got me. Probably just a
            hormonal thing.
                 (takes a quick final bite)
            Well, enjoy your breakfast, I've
            gotta run.
                      GRACE
            Where are you going?
He stops, turns. A new confident Bruce.

Phil and a couple of his crew laugh, as they load the last of
their equipment into the van and shut the doors.

          Hey, Hank found something1

Phil turns back, Bruce and he exchange a glance.

Hank is DIGGING FURIOUSLY, making a BIG HOLE. The Policeman
jogs over, joins the trainer. They watch as TWO DRESS SHOES

          The body of Jimmy Hoffa was
          uncovered in a field today outside
          of a canine training center in
          Buffalo New York. Local Buffalo
          freelance field reporter Bruce
          Nolan was the first on the scene...

We cut to the pre-taped story. Bruce stands with Hank and
his trainer before camera, the body being exhumed from the
ground behind him.

          Since the disapearence of Teamster
          president Jimmy Hoffa in the
          nineteen sixties, his whereabouts
          have remained one of this country's
          great unsolved mysteries. That is
          until just moments ago, when during
          a routine training session, a
          police dog named Hank sniffed his
          way right into the history books.
          As you can see behind us, the body
          is being carefully exhumed and will
          be transported to a hospital
          facility where DNA testing will
          confirm the identity. That, of
          course, only a formality as in a
          bizarre twist, the body was found
          buried with a birth certificate and
          complete set of dental records.
               (rubs Hank's neck)
          Sort of a two-in-one for Hank
          today, as moments later, he busted
          a local news camera crew with four
          kilo's of marijuana.
We see footage of PHIL AND HIS NEWS CREW, being cuffed on the
ground, as large stacks of marijuana plants are being pulled
from the van.

TO GREEN as though being sloppily painted with invisible
brushes.
Bruce exits the car and smooths past the Homeless Sign Guy,
who sits in his usual spot. His sign reads:
"HEAVEN IS AT HAND.   LEGGO YOUR EGGO."

INT. NEWSROOM - DAY
Bruce cruises through the office, fielding greetings.

                                                           60.



                     VARIOUS OFFICE STAFF
          Nice Job, Bruce...Way to go,
          buddy...GO get 'em, Bruce, etc.
Susan Ortega smooths up to Bruce.
                       SUSAN ORTEGA
          Hi, Bruce.

                     BRUCE
               (surprised)
          Oh, Susan.. Hi.
                    SUSAN ORTEGA
          Good work, I'm impressed.
She give's Bruce a "look" and continues on. Bruce is a bit
inflated by the encounter.
Bobby the pastry cart guy wheels his cart up along side.
                       BOBBY
          Hey, Br uce . N ice job , m an. Wa sn' t
          the same without you around here,
          pal.
               (leading)
          I hear Jack wants to see you.
                     BRUCE
          That's the word.
                    BOBBY
          You're going to need your energy in
          there. Can I interest you in a
          donut?
                    BRUCE
          No, thank you, I'm not hungry.
                       BOBBY
          Coffee?
                       BRUCE
          No.
                       BOBBY
          Fiber grain bar with bee pollen and
          Spiralina?
                     BRUCE
          I'm really not interested.

                                                           61.



                       BOBBY
          Yeah, I don't blame 'ya, they taste
          like grass.
Bobby CUTS BRUCE OFF WITH HIS CART.    Bruce is forced to stop.

                       BOBBY
          Tell you    what? I wasn't going to
          break it    open until lunch time, but
          I made a    batch of rhubarb that you
          have got    to try.
                       BRUCE
          Bobby, I--
                       BOBBY
          Come on, it's my mother's recipe
          she's practically cripple...
Bobby forces a ladle of rhubarb out at Bruce.
                     BRUCE
          No, I really- no...
                       BOBBY
          Open up, that's it, here comes the
          news chopper...
               (makes sound of Chopper)
                     BRUCE
          No, Bobby.. Bobby N01 I said I
          didn't want anything.
               (turns, heading off)
          Damn you...
Bruce continues    off, as Bobby stops cold, adopts an odd
expression, then    his EYES ROLL UP IN THEIR SOCKETS, SPIN ALL
THE WAR AROUND,    THEN GLOW RED. LITTLE HORN BUMPS PUSH UP
FROM HIS SKULL.     He turns instantly demonic.

An overly PERKY FEMALE OFFICE WORKER approaches Bobby from
behind.
                     FEMALE OFFICE WORKER
          Hi, Bobby. Is there any of that
          split pea soup left?
She is instantly hit in the chest with a stream of green
vomit. A beat and Bobby offers out a plastic spoon.

Jack pauses for an awkward beat.       His face grows serious.

          I haven't been the best father in

The cameraman pops his shoot and we see Bruce continue to
stream toward the ground below. He falls into a wooded area.
A CAMERA ON THE GROUND picks up the coverage, runs through
the brush with other BYSTANDERS to find Bruce laying on top

              Oh, honey, would you hand me the

Bruce diverts his attention, when the Sabers screw up and the
crowd GROANS. Bruce immediately turns, looks intently at the
puck and GOAL, SABERS! THE CROWD ROARS!

           problem today.
REVEAL A MALE PANDA wholeheartedly humping another PANDA.

WIDE SHOT of the enclosure - PANDA'S are coupled off and
humping everywhere. Mothers are frantically covering
children's eyes, ushering them away from the exhibit.

INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY
Bruce finishes running a bath, gets into the tub but SLIPS as
is UNABLE TO SINK and ends up sliding around ON THE WATER
like on a sheet of glass. He tries to break through, can't.
Then, he concentrates and finally LOWERS INTO THE WATER.

A Mob of photographers flash photos like crazy, as Bruce
stands casually with his arm around BIGFOOT.

Bruce surrounded by Hazel and other chili cook off

MUSIC OUT/MONTAGE OUT

INT. BEAUTY SALON - DAY

Grace lies in full body wrap, while Debbie is in the process
of being wrapped by MARGARITA, a rather ruff Spanish Salon
attendant.
                    DEBBIE
          So this is what success buys you.
                    GRACE
          I guess.
              (wiggling around)
          I feel like a human taquito.
                    DEBBIE
          Well, thank Mr. Exclusive for me.
          He's on a quite a roll. What'd he
          do make a deal with the devil?
                     GRACE
          And he's taking me out tonight to
          dinner at Chez L'Amour.
                     DEBBIE
          Well, la-ti-da. Mike's idea of a
          romantic evening is Chez Sizzler.
Margarita pulls the wrap tightly around Debbie.
                     DEBBIE
               (to Margarita)
          What does this do again?
                    MARGARITA
          EstS para su grasa.
                    DEBBIE
          Grasa? Doesn't that mean fat?

                                                          71.



                       GRACE
          Afraid so.
Debbie eyes Margarita.
                    GRACE
              (gushing)
          So, Bruce said and I quote:
          "Prepare yourself for an amazing
          evening that will change our lives
          forever."
Margarita reaches Debbie's waist and YANKS tightly.
                     DEBBIE
          Good - you wouldn't want to leave
          any spare oxygen in there.
               (back to Grace)
          Wait a second, you don't think he's
          going to propose, do you?
                    GRACE
          I don't think anything.
                       DEBBIE
          You do. You think he's going to
          propose.
                       GRACE
          Well, he's always said when he gets
          his career together, you know...
          And his career is more than
          together. I mean, come on, Chez
          L'Amour. Change our lives...
                       DEBBIE
          I don't know, hun. I mean, I like
          Bruce but that man's priority list
          is him, him, him, then him some
          more and then you.
                     GRACE
          Well, he just might surprise you.
                     DEBBIE
          That's what I'm worried about.
               (re: Margarita)
          Careful, you missed a spot of free
          flowing circulation.
Margarita senses the attitude and pulls tighter. Debbie
reacts.

                                                         72.


                    DEBBIE
          That'd do it.
Margarita motions for Debbie to lay down and leaves.    Debbie
struggles to lay down.
                    DEBBIE
          Let's see, how do I--
Debbie slides to the ground, Grace cracks up, gets up to
help, but also in mummy wrap, topples on top of her. They
both laugh and struggling to get up.
Hearing the ruckus, Margarita enters and gasps.
                       MARGARITA
          Lesbianas1
Grace and Debbie crack up harder.
                    DEBBIE
          Hey, I'll take that over fat...
Margarita tries to pull them up, but falls too.
                    MARGARITA
          No sexo, no sexol
Grace and Debbie can't stop laughing.
INT. CHEZ L'AMOUR - NIGHT
A waiter pours the first trickle of wine into Bruce's glass.
Bruce whiffs it, tastes it.
                    BRUCE
          Very good. If you run out just
          bring me some water, I'll take it
          from there.
Grace looks over the menu as Bruce notices people at various
tables eyeing him. He glances up to a ceiling light and
REDIRECTS IT with his mind, so it SPOTLIGHTS HIM in golden
light.
TWO CUTE GIRLS with dates SMILE and wave.     He waves back.
                       GRACE
          Should we ask for a more private
          table?

                                                         73,



                    BRUCE
          Huh? Oh, no this is fine right
          here.
Bruce looks at Grace lovingly.      He takes her hand.
                    BRUCE
          I was going to wait until after the
          meal, but I think it's going to
          just bust out of me if I don't do
          it now.
Grace beams, looks at Bruce with total love.
                       BRUCE
          You ready?
                    GRACE
              (nervous)
          I think so.
                    BRUCE
          I got anchor.
Grace's face falls.    She does her best to cover.
                       BRUCE
          Evidently, they're having problems
          with Evan. He's finishing up the
          week and I go live Monday.
                    GRACE
          That's great, honey.
          Congratulations. Wow. So that's
          what's tonight is about?
                       BRUCE
          Well, yeah. Grace, I got anchor.
          We got anchor!
She's having a hard time covering her let down.
                     BRUCE
               (noticing her flat
                reaction)
          What's the matter?
                       GRACE
          Well, to be honest, I thought that
          maybe tonight, you--
The TWO CUTE GIRLS interrupt, approach Bruce.

                                                                       74.



                                  CUTE GIRL #1
                       I'm sorry, but we had to come over.
                       We just think you're amazing and...
                                 CUTE GIRL #2
                       Well, we can't believe it's you!
             They both laugh, Bruce enjoys the attention.
                                  BRUCE
                            (laughing along)
                       Yep, it's me.
                                  CUTE GIRL #1
                       Can we get a picture with you?
                                  BRUCE
                       Well, sure.
                            (glances to Grace)
                       Just one second, hun.
                            (leans to Grace)
                       Fans. We better get used to this,
                       huh?
             Grace sits watching the two girls take turns sitting on
             Bruce's lap, taking pictures. Sees Bruce relishing in the
             attention. One girl gives Bruce a peck on the cheek and they
r"sS!w^w!s
             leave. Grace is clearly upset.
                                  GRACE
                       You have lipstick on your face.
                                  BRUCE
                       Oh, thanks...
                                 GRACE
                       Bruce, we need to talk. I thought
                       we had an understanding--
             Suddenly, the WHISPERS start again. Bruce looks around,
             figures it's coming from the restaurant patrons.
                                 BRUCE
                       Wow. It's kind of loud in here.
             Grace looks around the quiet romantic setting.
                                 GRACE
                       What are you talking about? It's
                       not loud.
             The WHISPERS GROW IN VOLUME.

                                                         75.



                     BRUCE
          Geez...
               (shouts to the restaurant)
-----   - COULD YOU ~KEEP TT DOWNl---  --
                     GRACE
          Bruce, this isn't funny.
                       BRUCE
               (talking loud .over the
                "racket")
          WHAT? WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME FOR A
          SECOND?
He gets up and darts off.
INT. CHEZ L'AMOUR KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Bruce races through the restaurant kitchen holding his ears -
EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
He BURSTS out the kitchen exit into the alley. Unclasps his
ears, but no relief. The whispers are now loud voices. We
start to make out fragments of words "Please," "Help me,"
etc.
Overwhelmed and scared, he slides down the alley wall,
covering his face, then TOTAL SILENCE --
Bruce lowers his hands and finds himself SITTING ATOP A HIGH
MOUNTAIN PEAK.
                     GOD (O.S.)
          Really something isn't it?
God sits down next to Bruce.
                    BRUCE
          Is this heaven?
God laughs at this one.
                     GOD
          It's Everest. You should try
          flipping on the Discovery Channel
          every now and then. Well, I guess
          you can't now, being dead and all.
                       BRUCE
          I'm dead?I
God laughs.

                                                         76.



                    GOD
          No, I'm just messing with you.
                    BRUCE
          Those voices...
                    GOD
          They're prayers, Bruce. You keep
          ignoring them and they're going to
          build up on. you like that. You
          didn't think being God was going to
          be all fun and games did you?
                    BRUCE
          Prayers? Those are prayers? Why
          can't I understand them?
God forms a snowball in his hands as he talks.
                    GOD
          You aren't listening, son. Let's
          see, you've had my powers for over
          a week now and how many people have
          you helped?
                     BRUCE
          Okay, so maybe I've righted a
          couple of the wrongs in my own
          life. I was going to get around to
          others. I can do both. I can help
          the world.
                    GOD
          The world? That wasn't the world,
          Bruce. That was just Buffalo,
          between Commonwealth and 57th.
          Didn't want to start you out with
          more than you can handle. Now how
          you doing otherwise? Personal life
          in good shape?
                    BRUCE
          Yeah. Everything is great.
A DOORWAY OPENS like a crack in space. Grace steps out, sees
Bruce.
                     GRACE
          Bruce? What are you doing out
          here?
With that, the terrain TRANSFORMS back into the alley where
Grace has been standing all along. She can not see .God.

                                               77,



                     BRUCE
          Oh, ah,
               (to God)
          She can't...
               (God shakes his head, back
                to Grace)
          I just, ah, needed a little fresh
          air.
Bruce fakes a couple big breaths.
                    GRACE
          Bruce, what is going on? The
          second I want to talk about us you
          run out on me.
                     GOD
               (to Bruce)
          Everything's great, huh?
                    BRUCE
          I wasn't running out on you...
                    GRACE
          You know, I actually had the crazy
          idea that you were going to ask me
          to marry you tonight.
                    GOD

Bruce looks to God to shut up.

          Not helping you what?
                    BRUCE
              (to Grace)
          Look hun, I want to talk about
          this. This just isn't a good time.
          Okay?

                                                               78.


                    GRACE
          When is it a good time? It's never
          a good time.
                        GOD
              She's got a point.

                  (to God)
              Stay out of this.
Grace looks at him like he's nuts.

          Who are you talking to?!
Just then, the WHISPERS start in again.        Bruce reacts.
                        BRUCE
              Oh, not now.
Bruce puts his hands to his ears.       Grace takes this as him
not wanting to listen to her.
                        GOD
          You're going to have to answer
          those things, y'know.

Grace heads back into the restaurant. Bruce stands
completely frustrated.
                     BRUCE
              (to God)
          Thank you.
                     GOD
          You want some friendly advice?
                        BRUCE
          No.
God smiles.

          whiners. This is going to suck up
          my whole life.
Bruce gets an idea, pulls down a menu on the computer,
highlights "ANSWER ALL" types in the word "YES" and hits
enter.
The computer takes over, ANSWERING EACH EMAIL AUTOMATICALLY.
Bruce smiles and gets up.
CLOSE ON - THE COMPUTER SCREEN

We see the list scroll by, everything from "LOST CAT" to
"MORE MONEY" "MAKE ME SMARTER" "MAKE ME THINNER," ETC.
"YES" "SEND", "YES" "SEND" and on and on.

ON JACK
Very uncomfortable, struggles for the right words as he's
firing somebody.
                     JACK
          Look this isn't easy for me. We're
          starting to get some complaints
          and... Well, Bobby, things just
          aren't working out.

                                                       86.


JACK'S POV
Bobby's demon-looking head, slowly ROTATES 360 DEGREES ON HIS

               (scared)
          An, you can keep the cart if you
          like.
We can SEE BOBBY'S BREATH NOW.
                     BOBBY
               (deep demonic voice)
          Thanks. I've grown kind of
          attached to it.
EXT. SMALL WONDERS DAY CARE - DAY
Bruce pulls up, Grace, her BODY BACK TO NORMAL, walks up and
hops in, happy.
                    GRACE
          L ook! I'm back to no rmal. It was
          the wildest thing, I was worried,
          so I said a prayer and the next
          thing I know, I was completely
          healed. It was like a miracle.
                    BRUCE
              (fakes happy)
          That's great.
                    GRACE
          So, you're taking me to lunch?
          Th is i s ra re --
               (catches herself)
          But wonderful.
                    BRUCE
          Oh, I've got something better than
          lunch.
Bruce pulls out. They drive off.
                    GRACE (O.S.)
          Oh, you'll never believe it.
          Debbie won the lotteryI
                    BRUCE (O.S.)
          Really?

                                                        87.



                      GRACE (O.S.)
           But get this, there were like 433
           thousand other winners, so it only
           paid out 17 dollars. Can you
           believe the odds of that?
EXT., UPSCALE HOME - DAY

Bruce leads her out of the car.
                      BRUCE
           Keep 'em closed...
                     GRACE

          What is this?

Bruce leads Grace through the gates.                              *
                     BRUCE
          Okay...open your eyes.
Grace does and sees A STAGGERING MANSION.                         *
                     GRACE                                        *
          Wow. This is a bit overwhelming.                        *
                      BRUCE                                       *

          No. Guess again?                                        *
Grace turns to Bruce confused.
                     BRUCE
          It's mine...ours.

                                                88.



                       GRACE
          What?
                    BRUCE
              (beaming)
          This is our new home.    Come on...
Bruce pulls Grace up the stairs.
                    GRACE
          This had to cost-- I can't even
          imagine how much this had to cost.
                    BRUCE
          7 million. That was the asking,
          but I got a deal.
                     GRACE
          Wh-What am I missing here? You
          can't afford this. You're a
          reporter. Buying cars is one
          t hing, but this--
Bruce grabs a hold of Grace.
                    BRUCE
          We'll have the money. Listen to me
          closely. I'm getting anchor.
          Then, I'm going to get spotted,
          offers will come flooding in to go
          national, and then you and I are
          moving to New York City to a place
          that will put this to shame. This
          has been my exact dream my whole
          life and it's finally going to
          happen. Every step just how I
          pictured it.

Grace just stares at Bruce.
                    GRACE
          There's only one problem.
                       BRUCE
          What?
                       GRACE
          I hate it.
Bruce is surprised.

                                          89.



          GRACE
What were you thinking? Why didn't              *
you talk to me about this?                      *
          BRUCE                                 *
I wanted to surprise you.                       *
          GRACE                                 *
Mission accomplished.                           *
          BRUCE
Honestly, I thought you'd be a
little more appreciative.
          GRACE
Appreciative of what? The fact
that you didn't include me on a
major life decision or that we now
live in the Sultan of Bernai's                  *
house?                                          *
            BRUCE
     (under his breath)
Like pearls to swine.
          GRACE
What is that supposed to mean?
          BRUCE
Let those with ears hear.
          GRACE
What is happening to you? You're
changing.

            BRUCE
Exa ct ly. F or th e bet te r. I' m not
poor and s truggling . And mayb e
that threatens you. I'm telling
you, there are plenty of women who
would love this place.
            GRACE
Yeah, and so would their pimps.                 *
           BRUCE                                *
I can't believe this. I did all                 *
this for us.                                    *
            GRACE                               *
Us ? W hat us? Yo u a lwa ys said wh en         *

                     BRUCE
           I want that.

           'That'. You can't even say the                       *
          word.                                                 *
                     BRUCE                                      *
          Marriage, I want marriage, okay.                      *
          It's just not a great time right
          now.
                     GRACE
          Not a great time. What is that,
          your mantra? This is never going
          to change. . .
Grace heads down the stairs.                                    *
                    BRUCE
          Come on Grace, lighten up.                            .*
          Tomorrow's Saturday. The office is                    *
          throwing me a party here, for
          getting anchor. Let's enjoy the
          ride for a whi le. We're just
          starting to have some fun.
                      GRACE
           No, you're just starting to have
           fun.
Suddenly, the TOILET FLUSHES off camera. Grace sees Sam in
the bathroom spraying some deodorizer before he exits.
                      GRACE
           And what in God's name is going on
           with that dogI?
Grace pulls her cell phone .out of her purse, heads for the
door.
                     GRACE
          I'm going to have Debbie pick me
          up.
                     BRUCE
          Grace.
                     GRACE
          I'm sorry, but    I won't be attending
          your little pa   rty tomorrow. And if                 *
          you would like    to see me after I
          will be at our   home.                                *

                                                           91.


She starts out.
                      GRACE (CONT'D)
           Oh, and that poor, struggling guy
           you talked about? I miss him.

The PARTY OF PARTIES is in order. The place is jam packed
with co-workers, fellow reporters, and various news contacts
Everyone is in an ecstatic mood, many prayers having been
recently answered. We MOVE THROUGH THE PARTY and hear
snippets of various conversations.
                     BUSINESSMAN
           I'll drink to that! My tech stocks
           tripled in five days.
They clink glasses.

Sam walks away, his tail between his legs.
Bruce maneuvers down the hall dancing, high-fiving, drunkenly *
accepting the praise coming at him from all sides.              *

          Hey Bruce, who do you like in the
          game tonight?
                     BRUCE
          Put your money on the Sabers.
          Coach prays a lot.
A FRENCH WAITER approaches Bruce.

                     FRENCH WAITER
          Ah, Mr. Nolan, we're running out of
          hors doerves. I'm afraid we under-
          ordered, sir. And the people are
          hungry.
                     BRUCE
          What do you have left?
The Waiter holds up a small basket.
                     FRENCH WAITER
          Only three chips and two shrimp.
                     BRUCE
               (confident)
          Just take it around.
The Waiter gets a confused look.
                                            CUT TO:
CHIPS OVERFLOWING, SHRIMP SPILLING OUT OF BASKETS, HANDS
REACHING GLUTTONOUSLY FOR THE BOUNTY.

The Waiter walks along amazed as handfuls of shrimp and chips
are pulled from the small basket.
Partiers crowd around Bruce, start to chant.

                                                          93.



                      CROWD
          Speech!   Speech!!   Speech!

Bruce takes center stage, quiets the crowd.
                      BRUCE
          I ' d thank you all for coming, but
          the liquor is free so maybe you
          should THANK ME!
Everyone laughs.

                     BRUCE
          And now let me tell you a story.
          There was a man who had two sons.
          The younger son took his
          inheritance and squandered his
          money on a life of lust and
          debauchery. I LOVE THAT GUY!!

Everyone throws their hands up and continues to party.

Bruce's big smile fades. He looks around the room, hoping to
spot Grace. He grabs a phone, walks out to the balcony,
di al s --

He gets their answering machine, hears their outgoing message
together from happier times. He hangs up.

                       FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
          Hey there.

Bruce turns, sees SUSAN ORTEGA, completely stunning in a sexy
dress.
                     SUSAN
          Hi Br uce. What are you d oing out
          here all alone?
                     BRUCE
          Oh, ah, I was calling Grace.

                       SUSAN
          Yeah, I didn't see her in there. I
          love the new place, by the way. So
          how are you and Grace doing?
                     BRUCE
          I don't know, we had a fight
          earlier. Ever since I . . Well,
          things are different now and...

                                                           94.



                     SUSAN
          You're on fire Bruce. Some women
          can't handle fire. Some can.
Susan smooths close to Bruce.
                     SUSAN
          You know, I always had an instinct
          about you. I knew you were going
          to make something of yourself.
                     BRUCE
          Really?
                     SUSAN
          There's something special about you
          Bruce. I like special...
                    BRUCE
          Look Susan, I don't know, I--
Susan grabs Bruce, kisses him passionately. Bruce doesn't
join in, but doesn't fight it either.
ANGLE - THE FRONT DOOR

Grace and Debbie enter.

                     DEBBIE
          So this is your new place, huh?
                     GRACE
          Cozy, don't you think? Come on
          help me find him.
They head into the room.
                     DEBBIE
          You sure you want to do this?
                     GRACE
          I don't know. It's his big night.                      *
          I don't want to spoil it. I know                  .    *

          So much for lashing back...
Grace stops dead in her tracks. Her face drops.

                     DEBBIE
          Oh, boy.

Bruce turns and sees Grace.
                     BRUCE
          Grace, I...
                     GRACE
             . (fighting back tears)
          Get the car, Deb.
                     DEBBIE
          Right.

                    BRUCE
          Grace, wait.
Grace follows Debbie out.
EXT. UPSCALE HOME - NIGHT
Bruce follows Grace outside.
                    BRUCE
          Grace, come on.
Grace stops, opens her purse, tosses the keys to her new car
in Bruce's chest.
                     GRACE
          Here. I do n't w ant your car. I
          don't want your things. . . I don't
          want you.
                     BRUCE
          Come on, don't say that. I was
          just calling y ou--
                     GRACE
          And you thought Susan's mouth was
          the phone?
                    BRUCE
         I didn't think you were coming-- I
         mean, I . . . I screwed up, okay.
         Let me make it up to you.
                    GRACE
          How about a boat, Bruce?

                    BRUCE
          If that's what you want.

                                                        96.



                     GRACE
          Yeah, a big boat and oh, maybe two
          bags of cash, you know, the ones
          with the big cartoon dollar signs
          on the front. Then I'll be happy.
          Because I'm just hollow inside.
          Debbie's been right. All this
          time. I defended you, told her
          there was good in you. Another
          side to you. Well, I just saw that
          other side and I don't want
          anything to do with it.
Debbie pulls up, Grace storms off to the car. Bruce follows,
                     BRUCE
          Grace, come on, don't do this.
                     GRACE
          Go back to your little co-anchor.
          Or is that ho-anchor?
               (tearing)
          I came back here to apologize. How
          stupid am I?
Grace turns and heads to the car.
                     BRUCE
          You're the one that didn't like the
          new place!
Grace gets in, slams the door.
                    BRUCE
          You can't walk out on me! I'm the
          alpha, lady! I'm the Omega!
Debbie peels out.
                     BRUCE
               (desperate last attempt)
          I could make you stay!
Bruce is left alone in the middle of the street.
                    BRUCE
          Fine! I don't need you! I have
          everything I need. Did you hear
          that?!
               (yelling)
          I have EVERYTHING!

                                                      97.


INT. UPSCALE HOME - MOMENTS LATER
Bruce walks in, Susan is waiting for him.
                     SUSAN
           I was right. She couldn't handle
           the fire.
                                                             *
Bruce looks at Susan with disgust, then glances to a FIRE
ALARM on the wall, mentally TRIGGERS IT. The sprinklers turn
on, as well. People scream, rush toward the exit.
Bruce sits down on the sofa, being rained on by the
sprinklers, alone. He finally plops back and God is sitting
next to him.
                     GOD
          Enjoying your party? Yeah, nothing
          like spending time with some real
          frien ds. Any s hrimp left ?
                     BRUCE
           Grace left me.
                     GOD
           I know.
                     BRUCE
               (certain)
          She'll take me back.
               (uncertain)
          Will she take me back?
                     GOD
          Would you take you back?
Bruce mulls this over,- then...
                     BRUCE
          How do you make someone love you
          when you can't effect free will?
                     GOD
          Welcome to my world, son. You come
          up with an answer to that one, you
          let me know.
Off of Bruce thinking...
                                            CUT TO:

                                                          98.



INT. DEBBIE AND MIKE'S HOUSE - MORNING
Grace's alarm goes off. The radio comes on and it plays a
John Cougar Mellencamp song. But the lyrics are different.
                     JOHN COUGAR MELLENCAMP
           Here's a little ditty,
           about Grace and her man Bruce,
           two Americans growing up,
           needing to make a truce.
Grace's eyes pop open.    Is she dreaming?
EXT. DEBBIE'S HOUSE
Bruce hides behind a hedge, watches Grace jog past.
ON GRACE
notices something    CARVED IN THE TREE it reads: "GRACE +
BRUCE". Carved in     the next tree, "A COUPLE FOR THE AGES".
Carved in the next    tree, "COME ON ALREADY, GIVE HIM ANOTHER
CHANCE". She does     a double take, continues on.
INT. COFFEE SHOP

Grace reaches in her purse to pay for her coffee and a bunch
of PICTURES FALL OUT. They are all of Bruce and Grace. She
thinks, definitely didn't -put them there.
INT. SMALL WONDER'S DAY CARE - DAY

Grace is helping one of the kids, when she notices something
outside the window. It's a cloud formation that strangely
looks like BRUCE (in profile) HOLDING HANDS WITH GRACE. She
reacts as the imagery melts away into a very faint "FORGIVE
HIM."
EXT. SMALL WONDERS DAY CARE - LATER

Grace is talking with one of the other teachers. The kids,
playing dodgeball in the background, laugh and scream louder
and louder. Grace turns and sees...
Bruce getting pelted by multiple balls.
                      BRUCE
           Okay, surrender, surrender.
He walks over to Grace.
                      BRUCE
           Hi.

                                                         99.



                       GRACE
          Hi..
                    BRUCE
          I, ah, have my first anchor
          tonight.
                    GRACE
          That's great. I hope it goes well
          for you.
He's hit in the head by a ball.    Grace can't help but smiles
Bruce leaps at the opportunity.
                    BRUCE
          I miss you.
              (off her silence)
          I just took the first step, shot
          myself out on the ledge, awaiting
          vulnerably your response.
                      GRACE
          . . . I don't know what to say.
                    BRUCE
          How about you love me and you'll
          take me back.
                       GRACE
          No, Bruce.
                    BRUCE
          Come on, what about all the signs?
                    GRACE
          What? How do you know about that?
          Did you talk to Debbie?
                      BRUCE
               (beat)
          Would it help if I told you I acted
          like an ass?
Martin is standing nearby.
                    MARTIN
          Hey, you said ass.
                    BRUCE
          It's okay as long as you mean a
          donkey. I didn't add "hole." It's
          only bad when you say "ass-ho--

                                                        100.


                      GRACE
           Alright, inside, Martin.
                (to the others)
           Okay everyone, inside.
The kids race in. Grace starts to follow.
                     BRUCE
           Grace, please. None of this seems                    *
           right without you.                                   *
               (off her reaction)                               *
           Is that a glimmer of hope I see?                     *
                     GRACE
           I have to go...                                      *
She starts off. . .
                      BRUCE
           Wait.
Bruce DRAMATICALLY RAISES A HAND TOWARD GRACE, like putting a
love spell on her.
                     BRUCE
           Now how do you feel?
She looks at him, oddly.
                      GRACE
           ...Are you out of your mind? Have
           you been drinking?
                       BRUCE
           Drin kin g? Sur e. I'm dru nk wit h
           POWER.
Bruce RAISES BOTH HANDS IN FULL HEXING FASHION...
                     BRUCE
           ...LOVE ME1!!
                      GRACE
                (a beat)
           You need help.
She heads back inside. Bruce throws his hands in the air,
frustrated.
EXT. SMALL WONDER'S PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER
Bruce heads for his car as he sees a two guys in PRISON SUITS
(from the prison yard) drive off with it.

                                                         101.


                     BRUCE

INT. BRUCE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS
The PRISONERS drive off laughing.
                    PRISONER #1
          Ha, nice wheels, huh?
BRUCE sits up in the back seat.
                    BRUCE
          Thou shalt not steal.
The prisoners JUMP.
                    BRUCE
          Car, show them the way out.
Instantly, the car doors fly open and the seats tilt sideways
dumping the prisoners.
                     BRUCE
          What is wrong with the world?

ON JACK
                     JACK
          The world's gone mad.
Jack clicks off the monitor. Bruce hustles in from make-up.
An air of forced confidence about him. Nothing and no one is
going to ruin his big moment.
                     JACK
          Oh, there you are. Your big debut.
          How you feeling?

          You know what? I'm good. The show

Bruce sits in the anchor desk, breathes in the reality.

          Oh, and Bruce, you won the pool
          again. Exact score, dead on.
          Twenty-three to one, who would have
          thought.

together. A beat of silence...

 STAGE MANAGER           The whole booth is down.
CRASH! A BRICK flies through a front window.       Bruce turns to
see...
EXT. DOWNTOWN - NIGHT 
A FULL ON RIOT in progress. College students, city dwellers
going crazy. Cars are burning, people are out of control.
Escaped convicts are running in and out of stores looting
right alongside ordinary citizens.
The Kowolski brothers and Momma Kowolski are helpless against
the onslaught as pillagers run out of the bakery carrying
cakes, pies, bread - whatever they can get their hands on.
Bruce stumbles through the mayhem, confused.
 BRUCE           What's going on?
 COLLEGE KIDS           Partying, man. Wooooll!!     Sabers I!
They continue to trash the area.
 BRUCE           But your team wonl
Cars are being rolled over. A lone POLICE OFFICER protects
himself with his shield as he's pelted with various debris.
The Officer PULLS BRUCE down behind a car.
 POLICE OFFICE           Stay down.

 BRUCE           Where are the other officers?

 POLICE OFFICE           What other    officers? Half the

          "ship came    in." You better get
          home pal. I   t's dangerous out here.

a bottle is tossed through a window that has a lotto sticker
on it.

BACK TO SCENE 
Bruce looks up at a burning building with a flaming "Mr.
Exclusive" billboard above - it comes CRASHING DOWN. Bruce
looks out over the rioters.
ON BRUCE 
We see the anger build in his face, like Moses looking down
on the Israelites. He RAISES HIS ARMS. DARK CLOUDS SWIRL IN
THE SKY. WIND BLOWS. LIGHTENING CRACKS. 
 BRUCE            Hear, O' Buffalo, you have awakened
           my wrath. Vengeance is mine!
A BOLT OF LIGHTENING shoots right into the middle of the
rioters, scattering them. People flee in every direction as
THUNDER CRASHES and lightning bolts continue to strike.
Bruce stands alone in the street, surveys the smoldering
mayhem, then reaches into his pocket and pulls out the key
God gave him. He grips it tightly and...

Bruce stands there, sees God as he originally found him,
mopping. God looks up at Bruce, not surprised to see him.

          Springsteen. I like a little Boss                     *

They finish up.   God looks back at the sparkling floor,
satisfied.
 GOD           There we go. Wonderful thing. No
          matter how filthy something gets,
          it can always be cleaned right up.
God collects Bruce's mop.
 BRUCE           What happened? I gave everyone
          what they wanted.
God sets the mops down.
 GOD           Since when does anyone have a clue
          about what they want?
God holds up a REMOTE AND CLICKS, changing the room into the
DINER where Bruce first parted his soup. (NOTE: Whenever the
room "changes" we're actually still in the room, but seeing a
full projection of an environment on the walls and columns)
The older waitress, Ginnie, clears some dishes...
 GOD           Remember Ginnie?
Ginnie bends down behind the counter and when she comes back
up she is a hot 21 YEAR OLD.
 GOD           Ginnie thought she lost her beauty
          when she got older. I'm trying to
          convince her otherwise.
Ginnie bends down again, and when she comes back up, she is
HER OLDER SELF again.
God clicks the remote, changing the environment into a SCHOOL
YARD. We see the grade school where Filbert Davis, the boy
Bruce helped up the rope, is in a fight.
 GOD           Ah yes, Filbert. Brilliant young
          man. He was going to be a great
          poet.

                     GOD (cont'd)
          The soul of his work would have
          been built out of his hardships.
          He would have touched millions.
               (feigns cheery)
          But now he's headed for a career as
          a professional wrestler.
God clicks, changing the environment into a CONDO. We see a
lonely woman (who found the cash in her purse) sitting
depressed, rocking in a chair.
 GOD           Ester Maha. I love Ester. Ester
          was bankrupt. She was going to
          have to eat her pride and call her
          sister. Would've got the two of
          them together again. Instead, she
          bought a condo in Florida.
 * God clicks the remote again...

God smiles, asks him again what he asked him in the alley...   *
 GOD *           You want some advice?                                    *

 GOD *           Everybody wants a miracle, Bruce.                        *

          But what they don't understand is,
          they're the one's holding the
          power.
God claps the bright ceiling light on, walks over to the
latter.
 BRUCE           Wait. Where are you going?
 GOD           This is good-bye, Bruce. You've
          learned a lot. I think you should
          be able to handle things now.
God climbs, ascending into the light.
 BRUCE           What if I have a question? What if
          I need you?
God stops, looks down to Bruce.
 110. 

 GOD           See Bruce, that's your problem.
          That's everybody's problem. You
          keep looking up. . .
He smiles and disappears into the light, leaves Bruce
thinking.
INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - DAY Bruce stands in the apartment, Sam at his side. No signs of
Grace. The bed is made. Empty.
Then, he notices the BOX OF PHOTOS, the incomplete albums.
He picks up a photo of he and Grace in an even tinier
apartment, Sam is a puppy, they have little money, and
despite it all look very happy. Bruce smiles at the memory.
Reaches for a stack of photos...
EXT. CITY STREETS - MORNING Bruce sits in bumper to bumper traffic. A man's car is
broken down in the middle of the street causing the
bottleneck.
Bruce sees THE SIGN GUY by the side of the road.   His sign
reads: ALL FOR WON.
Bruce looks out at the other drivers honking and shouting at
the frustrated man.
CUT TO - the stalled car is now rolling to the shoulder and
we REVEAL that Bruce is doing the pushing.
INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT THE COMPUTER The auto-function is answering "YES" to the prayer emails.
Bruce clicks cancel, turns off the computer.
INT. SCHOOL YARD Filbert Davis is beating up another kid. Bruce watches at a.
distance.
 BRUCE           Bruce giveth and Bruce taketh away.
Suddenly, Filbert goes to throw a punch but his punch has no
sting. The bigger boy looks down and grins.
CLOSE ON FILBERT - SUDDEN FEAR IN HIS EYES 11 1. 
INT. SCHOOL CLASSROOM The teacher stands before the class, reading a student's
paper.
 TEACHER           "Pain". By Filbert Davis.
As she reads the poem, PAN TO Filbert Davis seated in class
with a ripe BLACK EYE.
EXT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - MORNING Bruce is waiting for Sam to pee.

 BRUCE           Come on, Sam. Let's do this the
          right way... Oh, alright...
Bruce pulls out a SWATCH OF CARPET, lays it on the grass.
Sam happily goes. They walk off together.
 BRUCE           That's not normal you know.
INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY Bobby places three blue home address number tiles on the
counter - all number 6.
 BOBBY               (demonic voice)
          Do you have these in red?
Bruce walks up behind Bobby.
 BRUCE           Okay Bobby, it's time to come back.
Bobby HISSES at Bruce, turns INSANELY DEMONIC.

 BOBBY LEAVE ME HOLY MAN OR I WILL FEED ON           YOUR SOUL!It

 BRUCE                (casual)
          Un-damn you, Bobby.
Bobby instantly transforms to normal.
 112. 

 BOBBY           Hey thanks, Bruce.
               (holds out a cookie)
          Biscotti?
INT. NEWSROOM - DAY Evan is packing his things at his desk, still looking much
worse for the wear. Bruce walks up to him.
 EVAN           You're probably here to gloat over
          the anchor position. Go ahead, I'm
          sure I deserve it.
 BRUCE           You know, Evan.    I've been a real
          prick.
Evan stops, looks up at Bruce, confused.
 BRUCE           You were born to anchor. I'm not
          taking the position. Oh, and I
          never really congratulated you on
          getting the job in the first place.
          Congratulations, Evan.
Bruce offers his hand, Evan takes it. When their hands meet,
there is a kind of ELECTRICAL CHARGE that passes between
them. Bruce walks off, Evan is confused when he catches his
reflection in the mirror. HE'S BACK TO NORMAL!
INT. JACK'S OFFICE - LATER ON TV 
Evan is manning the anchor desk and looking good doing it.
Jack is relieved.
 EVAN BAXTER           In the financial world, things are
          settling back to normal in what
          analysts are calling a fluke market
          fluctuation...
Bruce enters.
 BRUCE           You made the right choice, Jack.
 113. 


 JACK                 So what about you? What will you
                do?
 BRUCE                 With your permission, I think I'll
                go out there and make the people
                laugh. To quote a friend, "God
                knows we could use it."
Jack smiles.
 JACK                 Permission granted.
Bruce turns to go, then turns back.
 BRUCE                 Oh, are you hungry? I know a place
                that makes a mean tomato soup.
EXT. STREET - NIGHT Bruce walks along side Jack. Jack talks and talks, happy to
have the company. Bruce opens a door for Jack, leading to..
INT. DINER Bruce and Jack take a seat at the counter.
 WAITRESS (O.S.)                 Coffee, gentlemen?
Jack and the waitress lock eyes - there's an instant
attraction. Bruce smiles.
 BRUCE                 Jack. This is a friend of mine,
                Cindy. Cindy this is Jack.
 JACK CINDY       (sm itte n)                           (smit ten)
Hi.                                   Hi.
EXT. EYEWITNESS NEWS STATION - DAY ON THE HOMELESS SIGN GUY His sign reads:
"GOD BEE GOOD HONEY" 114. 

PULL BACK to reveal BRUCE, sitting next to him with his own
sign reading:
"WHATEVER fl£ SAID"

With a little arrow pointing to the Homeless Sign Guy.
EXT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - DUSK 
Bruce paces, waiting for Sam.
 BRUCE           You can do it, Sam. Without the
          carpet. Come on.
Sam does. Bruce celebrates, does a happy dance and is
surprised to see Debbie standing there.
 DEBBIE                (re: the peeing dog)
          Looks like your rain dance worked.
 BRUCE           Debbie. Hey. You know, I never
          got to apologize for--
 DEBBIE           I didn't really come to chat, I
          came for Grace's things.
INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT 
Debbie is packing items into a box. She sees the photo
albums on the coffee table. She flips through, surprised.
 DEBBIE           They're full... You did all this?
Bruce nods. Debbie looks at Bruce, sizing him up.
 DEBBIE           You really hurt her, you know.
 BRUCE           I know.
Debbie starts to go, but turns back.
 DEBBIE           You know what I do before I go to
          sleep every night? I tuck my kids
          in bed, I eat a scoop of ice cream
          and watch Conan.
 (MORE) 115. 
                     DEBBIE (cont'd)
          You know what Grace does? She
          prays. Most of the time for you.
This not only touches Bruce, but it gives him an idea.
INT. BRUCE AND GRACE' S APARTMENT - NIGHT Bruce sits anxiously at the computer with Sam, checks the e--
mails and types in GRACE CONNELLY. He hits "search". 1,273
entries appear.
 BRUCE           The woman does pray a lot.
He types in "Grace and Bruce" and eagerly awaits. There are
335 matches. He checks a few...
     "Dear God, please help Bruce to find himself, find
     contentment, find You."
     "Dear God, please help Bruce. He's struggling to find
     meaning."
     "Dear God, help Bruce to be happy. He can't seem to
     find his way..."
Over and over, he finds the same prayer, the same entry every
morning and night for months on end.
Bruce is touched.
 BRUCE           She still loves me, Buddy.
He KISSES SAM and races out.
EXT. DEBBIE HOUSE - NIGHT Bruce stands in front of the house with flowers, another
special creation. He looks at the lavish bouquet, then sets
them down, picks a single, normal Daisy from the garden.
Better.
He heads for the door when he hears crying. It's Grace. He
looks up, sees a light on in the upstairs guest room.
He climbs the fire escape and looks in the window.
GRACE is sitting on the bed crying. As Bruce watches her
cry, feeling her emotion, it starts to LIGHTLY RAIN.
 GRACE           Please God. Please...
 11 6. 


Through her tears she is praying.     Bruce looks at her with
total love.
 GRACE              Please God. I still love him...
Bruce smiles, thankful.
 GRACE              ...but I don't want to love him
             anymore. Please God. Help me to
             forget.
                  (cries)
             I don't want to hurt anymore. I
             want to forget.
Bruce just stands there, stunned. He gets it. He raises a
hand, and with a simple wave, he performs an excruciatingly
selfless act. He lets Grace go.
ON GRACE Her face changes.     She wipes her eyes.   The pain is lifted.
And it is Bruce now who feels that pain. He looks at Grace.
A sad smile.
EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT 
Rain droplets splash on the river where Bruce first raged at
God. He stands in the middle of the street, looks up
heavenward, weakly. Humble.
 BRUCE              You win. I' m done. Please. I
             don't want to do this anymore. I
             don't want to be God.
                  (sighs)
             Please, help me.
And with that, the rain stops. The dark clouds slowly open
as beams of light cut through, shining down upon Bruce,
birds begin to chirp.adding to this magical moment as. . .
HONK1 HONKI 
A MAC TRUCK SLAMS THROUGH FRAME, MOWS BRUCE DOWN. His spirit
remains in the same spot, looking confused, then STREAKS UP
heavenward.
FLYING POV 117. 


SHOOTING HEAVENWARD like a missile, THROUGH THE CLOUDS,
THROUGH THE SKY to...

A HUGE WHITE ROOM - No walls, just white as far as the eye
can see. The flooring is the whitest of white puffy clouds.
Bruce finds himself standing there. He looks around and when
he turns behind him, he sees GOD. Floating on nothing, as
though sitting in the most royal throne.
 BRUCE           Am I...?
 GOD           You can't expect to kneel down in
          the middle of a highway and live to
          talk about it.
 BRUCE           But why? Why now?
 GOD           I work in mysterious ways, son.
A beat as Bruce takes everything in.
 BRUCE           You knew it all along. You knew if
          I got everything I wanted, I would
          ruin my life.
God doesn't respond, just listens.
 BRUCE           So I'm dead... Okay. If this is
          what you want. Okay, okay...
God holds up the PRAYER BEADS, tosses them to Bruce. Bruce
looks at the beads, then up at God, puzzled.
 GOD           Go ahead, use 'em.
 BRUCE           Alright... I've learned that I
          don't know as much I thought I
          did...
 GOD           Boy, you can say that again.
 BRUCE           Hey, I'm praying here.
 118. 

 GOD           Sorry, go.
 BRUCE           If I could have just one thing in
          the world. It would be for Grace
          to live a happy, joyful life. And
          that she finds someone...
              (getting emotional as he
               realizes what he's
               saying)
          ...that she finds someone that will
          treat her with the love and respect
          that she so deserves.
God smiles the most satisfied of smiles.
 GOD           Now that is a prayer.
               (beat)
          Well, I better get on that one.
          See ya, Bruce.
Off Bruce's puzzled reaction he DROPS THROUGH THE CLOUDS --
FALLING POV - BACK DOWN TOWARDS EARTH, back THROUGH THE
CLOUDS, and right INTO ANOTHER WHITE ROOM where...
BRUCE EYES OPEN and he GASPS FOR BREATH.    The PRAYER BEADS
still clutched tightly in his hand.
TWO DOCTORS stop giving Bruce CPR, see that his vitals have
returned. . .
 NURSE           He's back!
 INTERN           BP 40 over 110 and rising.
 DOCTOR #1                (to Bruce) -
          Bruce? Can you hear me?
               (Bruce nods)
          We almost lost you there.
WIDER ANGLE - The WHITE ROOM is a HOSPITAL ROOM - Bruce is
heavily bruised and bandaged.
 DOCTOR #1           You lost a lot of blood. It wasn't
          easy to find a match - you're a
          very rare blood type.
 119. 


Bruce looks to the blood bag, sees "A/B Positive" written on
the side.
CLOSE ON BRUCE - THINKING, HIS MIND RACING 
 BRUCE                (groggy whisper)
          A/B Positive...
 DOCTOR #2 (O.S.)           You should thank God for donors.
          We don't have a lot of that type on
          hand.
 NURSE           There's your angel now.
Bruce turns toward the hospital door and sees...
GRACE 
A cotton swab taped to her arm. Now he remembers where he
heard of that blood type.
 GRACE                (re: her swab)
          I hear that all of this winds up in
          a warehouse somewhere. But you
          know me, I'm a sucker for this
          stuff.
The doctors give Grace the nod to enter as they go, leaving
the two of them alone. Grace tentatively approaches.
 GRACE           I don't even know what I'm doing
          here. But... When I heard that
          you'd been in an accident and that
          you might not make it. . .
She starts to cry.
 BRUCE           Hey, I'm okay.
 GRACE           Does it hurt?
 BRUCE           Only when I talk., and smile... and
          y'know, exist in general.
 120. 


Grace laughs. That's one thing Bruce could always do, is
make her laugh. Grace spots the prayer beads in Bruce's
hand, raises his arm.
 GRACE           Oh my gosh, you still have those?
Bruce looks at the prayer beads, then looks at Grace. He
remembers his prayer to God and the emotion wells within him
 GRACE           What is it?
 BRUCE           Nothing. It's just really nice to
          see you.
She goes to him, Bruce sits up a bit and they embrace.
 DISSOLVE TO: EXT. CITY PARK - DAY A BIG BLOOD DRIVE in progre   ss. Everyone is there, Grace,
Sam, Debbie and Zoe, Ginnie   and Jack, the Kowolski brothers,
Momma Kowolski, Evan, Susan   , Dallas, Fred. Bobby serves
various food items from his   cart.
 BOBBY           You know, French Toast was invented
          by tavern owner, Joseph French, who
          had a poor knowledge of grammar,
          and did not know how to use the
          possessive apostrophe, so he called
          it French Toast instead of French's
          Toast...
Pull back to reveal BRUCE, crutch under one arm, cast on his
leg, mic in hand, reporting. He's now talking in his OWN
VOICE, much more himself.
 BRUCE           This is Bruce Nolan at Buffalo's
          first annual "Be the Miracle" blood
          drive. Remember, the life you save
          may be mine, so hurry down. I had
          a close call and, well, can you
          imagine what life would have been
          like without me?
Laughs in the background, from the people that know Bruce.
Bruce walks over to the Kowolski Brothers.

 BRUCE           In honor of this event, the
          Kowolski brothers have baked a one-
          of-a-kind, creation.
The brothers proudly unveil the special cookie and we see
that it's a HUGE SYRINGE SHAPED CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE.
 BRUCE           Sure, a little creepy and a
          shameless plug, but we love 'em.
              (Bruce breaks off a little
               piece, takes a bite)
          Mmm, good needle. Remember, that's
          Kowolski's bakery. The bakery that
          gets more air time than a high
          speed chase.
Everyone laughs.   The Kowolski brothers beam.
Bruce takes a seat as a VOLUNTEER NURSE pulls up his sleeve,
revealing the prayer beads worn around his wrist. She ties
off his arm, starts to probe for a vein.
 · BRUCE           To be honest, I've never been a big
          fan of shots. . .
The volunteer now is swabbing Bruce's arm and Bruce is
starting to sweat.
 BRUCE               (nervous)
          Okay, we're good to go...They just
          stick it into my arm. Breaking
          through the skin, of course...
The volunteer pulls out the needle and Bruce PASSES OUT COLD.
Gasps, the Nurse leans close, total silence, then:
 BRUCE BLLLAAAA! 
Bruce jolts awake making the Nurse and several people jump.
They all laugh.

 BRUCE           Had you going, didn't IIIIII1

He reacts to the nurse POKING the needle in. Everyone laughs
more.

 BRUCE            No, this is nothing. In fact, this
           is the second time I've given blood
           this week. For those of you who
           haven't heard, I ' d like you to meet
           the soon to be Mrs. Exclusive.
He throws a look to Grace who smiles in return.    The crowd
applauds.
 BRUCE            This is Bruce Nolan reporting for
           Eyewitness News.
The camera cuts.   Bruce lowers his mic, turns to Grace.
 BRUCE            So, what'd you think?
 GRACE *            I don't know, I thought it was very                   *
           pleasurable.                                          *
Bruce smiles, they kiss...
As the blood drive continues, we push through the crowd,
heading somewhere. Bodies clear frame and we see the
HOMELESS MAN sitting on a park bench. His sign reads:
THEE END The Homeless Man smiles into camera. We continue forward and
in a slow, mysterious, subtle fashion his face slowly
transforms into the very pleased, FACE OF GOD, who winks and

               In baseball, you don't know nothing.

                         --Yogi Berra

                

               Whoever wants to know the heart and mind of America had better 
               learn baseball.

                         --Jacques Barzun

                

               You could look it up.

                         --Casey Stengel

                

               Titles over --

               FADE IN:

               A series of still photos. Black and white. Ancient.

               BABE RUTH SWINGS -- An icon of American history. His giant 
               upper body balanced delicately on tiny ankles and feet. The 
               huge bat in an elegant follow-through...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               TY COBB ROUNDS THIRD -- The most vicious ballplayer of them 
               all, a balletic whirling dervish.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               JACKIE ROBINSON STEALS ROME -- Yogi Berra applies the tag.  
               Too late.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               JOE DIMAGGIO WITH HIS SON in the Yankee clubhouse. Walking 
               down the runway, Joe in uniform. Number five.

               PULLBACK REVEALS:

               A WALL COVERED WITH BASEBALL PICTURES behind a small table 
               covered with objects and lit candles. A baseball, an old 
               baseball card, a broken bat, a rosin bag, a jar of pine tar -- 
               also a peacock feather, a silk shawl, a picture of Isadora 
               Duncan. Clearly, the arrangement is -- A SHRINE -- And it 
               glows with the candles like some religious altar.

               We hear a woman's voice in a North Carolina accent.

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         I believe in the Church of Baseball.
                              (beat)
                         I've tried all the major religions 
                         and most of the minor ones -- I've 
                         worshipped Buddha, Allah, Brahma, 
                         Vishnu, Shiva, trees, mushrooms, and 
                         Isadora Duncan...

               PAN AWAY FROM THE SHRINE across the room. Late afternoon 
               light spills into the room, across fine old furniture, to a 
               small dressing table. A WOMAN applies make up.

               ANNIE SAVOY, mid 30's, touches up her face. Very pretty, 
               knowing, outwardly confident. Words flow from her Southern 
               lips with ease, but her view of the world crosses Southern, 
               National and International borders. She's cosmic.

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         I know things. For instance --
                              (beat)
                         There are 108 beads in a Catholic 
                         rosary. And --
                              (beat)
                         There are 108 stitches in a baseball.
                              (beat)
                         When I learned that, I gave Jesus a 
                         chance.
                              (beat)
                         But it just didn't work out between 
                         us. The Lord laid too much guilt on 
                         me. I prefer metaphysics to theology.
                              (beat)
                         You see, there's no guilt in 
                         baseball... and it's never boring.

               ANNIE OPENS A CLOSET DOOR -- Dozens of shoes hang from the 
               door. She chooses a pair of RED HIGH HEELS, with thin straps.  
               She sits on a bench and

                                     ANNIE
                         Which makes it like sex.
                              (beat)
                         There's never been a ballplayer slept 
                         with me who didn't have the best 
                         year of his career.
                              (beat)
                         Making love is like hitting a baseball --
                         you just got to relax and concentrate.

               ANNIE SLIPS ON THE RED HIGH HEELS -- Smoothing her hands up 
               her calves as she does.

                                     ANNIE
                         Besides, I'd never sleep with a player 
                         hitting under .250 unless he had a 
                         lot of R.B.I.'s or was a great glove 
                         man up the middle.
                              (beat)
                         A woman's got to have standards.

               SHE HOLDS OUR HER LEGS DISPLAYING THE HEELS, side by side.  
               Like a little girl showing off her new shoes.

                                     ANNIE
                         The young players start off full of 
                         enthusiasm and energy but they don't 
                         realize that come July and August 
                         when the weather is hot it's hard to 
                         perform at your peak level.
                              (beat)
                         The veterans pace themselves better.  
                         They finish stronger. They're great 
                         in September.
                              (beat)
                         While I don't believe a woman needs 
                         a man to be fulfilled, I do confess 
                         an interest in finding the ultimate 
                         guy -- he'd have that youthful 
                         exuberance but the veteran's sense 
                         of timing...

               ANNIE STARTS PACKING A HUGE HANDBAG -- With fruit, an official 
               scorebook, binoculars, a radar gun, and lipstick.

                                     ANNIE
                         Y'see there's a certain amount of 
                         "life-wisdom" I give these boys.
                              (beat)
                         I can expand their minds. Sometimes 
                         when I've got a ballplayer alone 
                         I'll just read Emily Dickinson or 
                         Walt Whitman to him. The guys are so 
                         sweet -- they always stay and listen.
                              (beat)
                         Of course a guy will listen to 
                         anything if he thinks it's foreplay.

               ANNIE TOUCHES PERFUME BEHIND HER EARS and, ever so slightly, 
               in her cleavage.

                                     ANNIE
                         I make then feel confident. They 
                         make me feel safe. And pretty.

               ANNIE POSES IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR -- She smoothes her dress 
               along her hips. And puts on a flashy pair of sunglasses. 
               Stylish and slightly mad.

                                     ANNIE
                         What I give them lasts a life-time.  
                         What they give me lasts 142 games.  
                         Sometimes it seems like a bad trade.
                              (quickly rebounding)
                         But bad trades are part of baseball -- 
                         who can forget Frank Robinson or 
                         Milt Pappas, for Godsakes!
                              (beat)
                         It's a long season and you got to 
                         trust it.

               ANNIE STARTS FOR THE DOOR and grabs her baseball glove

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ANNIE'S HOUSE -- DUSK

               A frame house with porch and lots of trees -- a Thomas Wolfe 
               house... with a 1959 faded red Volvo in the driveway.

               ANNIE LEAVES ON FOOT, turning onto the sidewalk of a bucolic, 
               old Durham, North Carolina neighborhood. In the b.g. other 
               people are heading the same direction ANNIE PULLS A DURHAM 
               BULLS BASEBALL CAP from her handbag and pulls it on her head.

                                     ANNIE
                         I've tried them all -- I really have --
                              (beat)
                         and the only church that truly feeds 
                         the soul -- day in, day out -- is 
                         the Church of Baseball.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Now visible In the late afternoon sun, a rickety old stadium 
               carved into the center of an old Tobacco town.

               People are arriving on foot from all around...

               "Rock Around the Clock" by Bill Haley fills the air.

               CLOSE ON A BASEBALL CLOWN -- MAX PATKIN, 60, at home plate 
               doing his famous Bill Haley routine. A comic pitcher's windup 
               full of twists and goofy choreography.

               ANNIE SITS DOWN IN HER PRIVATE BOX SEAT -- Her chair is wiped 
               off by a young black boy, JACKSON, 11, who then sits next to 
               her. He is her employed errand runner, note sender, and 
               friend.

               A GROUP OF GROUPIES ENTERS THE PARK -- 20 year old girl/women, 
               dressed in tight pants, tight everything.

               Friendly, eager, innocent -- THEY WAVE TO ANNIE.

               FIVE PLAYERS' WIVES AND THREE SMALL CHILDREN sit in a special 
               box seat behind a small sign "Players' Wives".

               EXT/INT. THE DURHAM BULL DUGOUT -- NIGHT

               As Max Patkin continues his routine, players warm up, and -- 
               THE MANAGER, JOE RIGGINS, 45, known merely as SKIP, short 
               for "Skipper", a chaw of tobacco in his cheek, stands with 
               his pitching coach, LARRY HOCKETT late 30's, an ex-big leaguer 
               whose body has seen too many cocktail lounges.

               LARRY ROLLS SOME RED MAN CHEWING TOBACCO into a slab of pink 
               bubble gum, carefully folding the corners, tucking it neatly 
               together. Larry examines it as they talk -- And shoves the 
               giant chaw into his mouth.

                         No. The guy's professional debut and 
                         he forgets about it.

               short t-shirt on top, and on top of that the head of EBBY 
               CALVIN LALOOSH, baseball cap on backwards. EBBY is a great 
               looking energetic man-child with the endless confidence, 
               naivete and horniness of youth.

               Life is a party.

               A YOUNG WOMAN, MILLIE, 20, half nude, is dressing quickly.

                         debut tonight -- you know how many 
                         guys out there'd give blood to be in 
                         your shoes an' you're leavin' your

               MILLIE LOOKS OUT FROM BEHIND A BAT RACK -- Outraged.

                         recognize ya. Don't take it personal 
                         but if I catch you in here again 
                         you're banned from the ballpark.

                                     MILLIE
                         You can't ban me from the ballpark 
                         'cause Daddy donated the scoreboard 
                         and if you banned me he might take 
                         the scoreboard away.

                         Whatta we need a scoreboard for? We

                              (tough, to Ebby)
                         Get your ass out there.

               As Skip starts to leave.

                         Hey Boss, I got a question.

                         You think I need a nickname? I think 
                         I need a nickname. The great ones 
                         have nicknames -- somethin' like Oil 
                         Can or Catfish...

               Skip stares at him. He can't believe this guy.

                         Ya got three minutes.

               SKIP WHIRLS AND HEADS BACK OUT TO THE FIELD -- And Ebby 
               unperturbed, turns his attention back to Millie.

               warming up casually on the sidelines as Patkin winds up his

               Applause as Patkin takes his bows, leaves the field, shakes 
               hands with a the BULL MASCOT LEADING THE APPLAUSE.

               a cigarette -- always smoking a cigarette. He snuffs out his 
               cigarette and RUNS onto the field with the rest of the team,

               EBBY ENTERS THE DUGOUT from the runway. Larry and Skip 
               encourage their players running onto the field. Ebby is trying 
               to get the zipper on his fly unstuck. He smiles broadly at 
               Skip and Larry, and grabs his glove.

               radio mike of a very small local station. Next to him is the 
               local SPORTSWRITER, WHITEY SHERRARD, 40. Between them they've 
               seen a million minor league players come and go.

                         Is this guy LaLoosh worth a hundred 
                         grand? I hear he's a quart low?

                              (on the air)
                         The Bulls are off to a slow start 
                         having dropped their first three 
                         games, but hope to turn it around 
                         tonight with the professional debut

               Jackson. Clearly, the younger women look up to Annie for 
               wisdom and insight.

                         everybody in trouble.

                         You didn't get "lured". Women never 
                         get lured. They're too strong and 
                         powerful for that. Now say it -- "I 
                         didn't get lured and I will take 
                         responsibility for my actions".

                         The word on LaLoosh is that the good 
                         looking young lefty has a major league 
                         fastball but sometimes has problems 
                         with his control.

               And different. More than just opinions, he actually has a 
               point of view. A career minor leaguer, hanging on wherever 
               he can get a job. Unlike Ebby -- Crash knows a lot about the

               A COCKTAIL WAITRESS DELIVERS another round to them.

                                     ANNIE
                         We didn't order this, honey...

                                     WAITRESS
                              (she points)
                         He did.

                P.O.V. Crash davis sitting alone in the other corner. He 
               waves, and smiles easily.

                                     ANNIE
                              (to Max)
                         Who's that?

                                     MAX
                         Hey -- that's Crash Davis. He's played 
                         in more towns than I have. Helluva 
                         guy -- real different... I actually 
                         saw him read a book without pictures 
                         once

                                     ANNIE
                         Really? Kinda cute...

               ANNIE NODS AT CRASH -- He comes over to her table, greets 
               Max as an old friend, and introduces himself.

                                     CRASH
                         I'm Crash Davis.

                                     ANNIE
                         Annie Savoy. Wanta dance?

                                     CRASH
                         I don't dance.

                                     ANNIE
                         I don't trust a man who don't dance.  
                         It ain't natural.

               SUDDENLY -- HARD CORE ROCK AND ROLL on the juke box. Several 
               couples dance, and out of the pack --

               EBBY DANCES WITH A GROUPIE -- Spinning and whirling, 
               uninhibited and infectious. He's suddenly dancing with a 
               different WOMAN, then another, and another...

               ANNIE, CRASH AND MAX WATCH the mad performance.

                                     MAX
                         Who's he dancing with?

                                     ANNIE
                         All of 'em, I think...

               EBBY PUTS ON A ONE MAN SHOW ON THE DANCE FLOOR -- The whole 
               bar stops to watch him, applauding as he spins to a finish.  
               A quirkier "Saturday Night Fever" show. More naive, fun. He 
               climbs off the floor and joins Annie's table.

                                     EBBY
                         Thanks for the note -- you're right, 
                         I wasn't bending my back.

                                     ANNIE
                         You got a live arm there.

               He extends his hand to introduce himself.

                                     EBBY
                         Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.

                                     ANNIE
                         You need a nickname.

                                     EBBY
                         That's what I been telling everybody!  
                         Wanta dance?

                                     CRASH
                         She's dancing with me.

                                     ANNIE
                         Crash, I didn't think you --

                                     CRASH
                         I'll learn. C'mon --

                                     EBBY
                         Just a minute, pal...

               The two men square off quickly. Annie mocks them.

                                     ANNIE
                         You boys gonna fight over little me?

               CRASH RISES, pulling Annie with him. But --

               EBBY STANDS to challenge Crash.

                                     EBBY
                         Step outside, pal.

                                     CRASH
                         Love to --

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh don't be such guys --

               But Crash and Ebby head outside. She turns to Max --

                                     ANNIE
                         Hell, Max, wanta dance?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE PARKING LOT -- NIGHT

               A circle is formed. Everybody gathers. Millie clings to Tony, 
               her guy of the moment. Crash and Ebby face off.

                                     CRASH
                         I don't believe in fighting.

                                     EBBY
                         Pussy.

                                     CRASH
                         Take the first shot at me.

                                     EBBY
                         I ain't hitting a man first.

                                     CRASH
                         Hit me in the chest with this...

               CRASH PULLS A BASEBALL from his jacket pocket, tosses it to 
               Ebby.

                                     EBBY
                         I'd kill ya.

                                     CRASH
                         From what I hear you couldn't hit a 
                         bull in the ass with a slingshot

                                     EBBY
                         Don't try me.

                                     CRASH
                         Throw it. C'mon, right in the chest.

                                     EBBY
                         No way.

                                     CRASH
                         C'mon, Meat. You can't hit me 'cause 
                         you're starting to think about it 
                         already, you're starting to think 
                         how embarrassing it'll be to miss, 
                         how all these people would laugh.
                              (teasing mercilessly)
                         C'mon, Rook -- show me that million 
                         dollar arm 'cause I'm getting a good 
                         idea about the five cent head --

               EBBY REARS BACK AND FIRES THE BALL -- From ten feet away, 
               right at Crash's chest. But, alas --

               THE BALL GOES THROUGH A SECOND STORY WINDOW in the distance.  
               Crash never blinks.

                                     CRASH
                         Ball four.

               EBBY IS ENRAGED -- HE CHARGES CRASH, lunging at him.

                                     EBBY
                         Who the fuck are you?!

               CRASH LASHES OUT A SHORT LEFT -- With lightning speed, 
               effortless. And brutal. BANG! Ebby goes down. And stays there 
               stunned. He looks up.

                                     CRASH
                         I'm Crash Davis. Your new catcher.  
                         And you just got Lesson Number One --
                         "Don't think -- it can only hurt the 
                         ballclub".
                              (beat)
                         Buy ya a drink?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE CLUB -- NIGHT

               ANNIE AND MAX DANCE to Billy Eckstein on the juke box. Millie 
               and Tony are also on the dance floor.

                                     ECKSTEIN
                              (on juke box)
                         April in Paris, chestnuts in blossom, 
                         Holiday tables under the tree...

               EBBY AND CRASH WATCH FROM THE CORNER TABLE -- Ebby's right 
               eye is blackened. He holds a drink on it.

                                     EBBY
                         We fight, she gets the clown -- how's 
                         that happen?

                                     CRASH
                         Shut up -- I like this song...
                              (sings along)
                         April in Paris, this is a feeling, 
                         No one can ever reprieve...

                                     EBBY
                         She's playing with my mind.

                                     CRASH
                         It's a damn easy thing to play with.

               ANNIE SUDDENLY APPEARS at the table.

                                     ANNIE
                         Well -- you boys stopped fighting 
                         yet? Are you pals now? Good. I love 
                         a little macho male bonding -- I 
                         think it's sweet even if it's probably 
                         latent homosexuality being "re-
                         channeled" but I believe in "re-
                         channeling" so who cares, right?
                              (beat)
                         Shall we go to my place?

                                     EBBY
                         Which one of us?

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh both of you, of course...

               CLOSE ON EBBY -- His eyes full of fear and wonder.

               CLOSE ON CRASH -- He smiles.

               THE THREE OF THEM LEAVE the bar together.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ANNIE'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

               THE SHRINE OF BASEBALL GLOWS -- Annie lights the candles.

               EBBY AND CRASH SIT ON OPPOSITE ENDS OF HER COUCH -- Both men 
               look around the room with wonder. Ebby is clearly more nervous 
               than Crash, who's been in some strange rooms in his minor 
               league career.

                                     ANNIE
                         These are the ground rules.
                              (beat)
                         I hook up with one guy a season -- I 
                         mean it takes me a couple of weeks 
                         to pick the guy -- kinda my own spring 
                         training...
                              (beat)
                         And, well, you two are the most 
                         promising prospects of the season so 
                         far.
                              (beat)
                         So... I thought we should get to 
                         know each other.

                                     CRASH
                         Why do you get to choose? Why don't 
                         I get to choose?

                                     ANNIE
                         Actually none of us on this planet 
                         ever really choose each other. It's 
                         all Quantum Physics and molecular 
                         attraction. There are laws we don't 
                         understand that bring us together 
                         and break us apart.

                                     EBBY
                         Is somebody gonna go to bed with 
                         somebody or what?

                                     ANNIE
                         You're a regular nuclear meltdown, 
                         honey -- slow down.

               Crash rises to leave, and heads for the door.

                                     CRASH
                         After 12 years in the minor leagues, 
                         I don't tryout. Besides -- I don't 
                         believe in, Quantum Physics when it 
                         comes to matters of the heart... or 
                         loins.

                                     ANNIE
                              (challenging him)
                         What do you believe in?

               Crash at the door. Annie's question is slightly taunting.  
               He stops, and speaks with both aloofness and passion:

                                     CRASH
                         I believe in the soul, the cock, the 
                         pussy, the small of a woman's back, 
                         the hanging curve ball, high fiber, 
                         good scotch, long foreplay, show 
                         tunes, and that the novels of Thomas 
                         Pynchon are self-indulgent, overrated 
                         crap.
                              (beat)
                         I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald 
                         acted alone, I believe that there 
                         oughtta be a constitutional amendment 
                         outlawing astro-turf and the 
                         designated hitter, I believe in the 
                         "sweet spot", voting every election, 
                         soft core pornography, chocolate 
                         chip cookies, opening your presents 
                         on Christmas morning rather than 
                         Christmas eve, and I believe in long, 
                         slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that 
                         last for 7 days.

                              (breathless)
                         Oh my...
                              (softly)
                         Don't leave...

                                     CRASH
                         G'night.

               Crash heads out into the night. Annie hurries to the-door 
               while Ebby sits on the couch, bewildered.

                                     EBBY
                         Hey -- what's all this molecule stuff?

               ANNIE STANDS IN THE DOORWAY -- Crash is on the porch.

                                     ANNIE
                         Wait, Crash -- don't go -- all I 
                         want is a date. I'm not gonna fall 
                         in love with you or nothin'.

                                     CRASH
                         I'm not interested in a woman who's 
                         interested in that boy.

                                     ANNIE
                         I'm not interested yet.

               Ebby appears in the door.

                                     EBBY
                         Who you calling a "boy"?

                                     CRASH
                         See ya at the yard, Meat.

               Crash walks out into the Durham night. Ebby and Annie stand 
               in the doorway. She speaks softly to Ebby.

                                     ANNIE
                         No ballplayer ever said "no" to a 
                         date with me.

                                     EBBY
                         Well shit, then, let's fuck.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

               ANNIE PUTS ON A RECORD -- Edith Piaf sings "Le Trois Cloches".

               EBBY STARTS UNDRESSING across the room.

                                     ANNIE
                         Wait, honey, slow down -- I want to 
                         watch.

               She sits in a chair. Piaf sings. Ebby practically rips his 
               shirt off, exposing a great upper body.

                                     ANNIE
                         No, no, no. Put it back on and take 
                         it off slowly.

                                     EBBY
                         Jesus, what kinda broad are you?

                                     ANNIE
                         When you know how to make love, you'll 
                         know how to pitch.
                              (turning to the stereo)
                         Shh. I love this part.

               Piaf sings. Annie listens. Ebby re-buttons, then unbuttons 
               his shirt. It drops, revealing his back.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh my -- what a nice back.

               Ebby drops his pants.

                                     ANNIE
                         No, no, honey... first the shoes and 
                         socks.

                                     EBBY
                         The socks? It's cold in here.

                                     ANNIE
                              (sweetly, unthreatening)
                         You think Dwight Gooden leaves his 
                         socks on?

               Ebby considers this. Pulls his pants back up. Takes his socks 
               off. Then his pants.

                                     ANNIE
                         Ebby honey have you ever been 
                         handcuffed in bed?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DOWNTOWN DURHAM -- NIGHT

               Deserted streets of the old tobacco town. Crash walks alone.  
               He picks up an old newspaper out of a trash can. He stops in 
               front of  a store window. He rolls the newspaper like a short 
               bat. He takes a batting stance, and --

               CRASH TAKES HIS BATTING STANCE in front of the window, 
               studying his reflection. He taken a "swing". And another.

               A GROUP OF OLD BLACK MEN stand in a doorway, watching.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM -'CONTINUOUS NIGHT

               CLICK -- A handcuff is locked onto Ebby's wrist. Both his 
               arms are outstretched -- he's getting very excited.

                                     EBBY
                         Awright! I read about stuff like 
                         this. Bring it on!

               Annie calmly drags a chair over and sits down.

                                     ANNIE
                         Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt 
                         Whitman?

                                     EBBY
                         Who's he play for?

                                     ANNIE
                         Well, he sort of pitches for the 
                         Cosmic All-Stars.

                                     EBBY
                         Never heard of 'em.

               Annie opens a book and begins reading as Piaf sings softly.

                                     ANNIE
                         Good -- then listen.

               Crash who takes beautiful, fluid swings with the rolled up 
               newspaper. Batting practice.

               CLOSE ON CRASH'S EYES -- Studying the "pitches" with intense 
               concentration, endlessly working on his game.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               LARRY, DEKE, MICKEY AND BOBBY ARE SINGING at home plate as a

               Supremes, and the routine is brilliantly tacky.

                         Listen up, guys, could I have your 
                         attention a minute?

                         I'm going to be leading a daily chapel 
                         service at three in the afternoons 
                         here in the locker room and you're 
                         all invited to drop by and worship 
                         before batting practice.

                         Jimmy, God damn it -- loosen up and 
                         get laid.

               BOBBY, 25, smooths the creases of his uniform, preening.

                                     JIMMY
                         I don't care If you think I'm square 
                         but I believe what I believe.

               All heads turn as:

               EBBY ENTERS THE LOCKER ROOM -- He looks trashed.

                                     BOBBY
                         Jesus, Ebby, what truck ran over 
                         you?

                         Call me "Nuke". Annie said it's my 
                         new nickname.

               Lots of teasing from around the clubhouse.

                                     DEKE
                         Annie nailed you? That's great, means 
                         you're gonna have a helluva year. 
                         Does she fuck as good as they say?

                                     EBBY
                         We didn't do it, man -- she read 
                         poetry to me all night, I swear. 
                         It's more tiring than fucking.

               EBBY GOES TO HIS LOCKER and starts undressing. Crash sits 
               next to him, looking straight ahead. Bobby nearby.

                                     EBBY
                         -- of love"... hey, Crash, does that 
                         mean what I think it means? What's 
                         the deal here?

               Crash studies Ebby.

                         Your shower shoes have fungus on 
                         'em. You'll never get to the Bigs 
                         with fungus on your shower shoes.

                         If you win 20 in the Show you can 
                         let the fungus grow back on your 
                         shower shoes and the press'll think 
                         you're colorful.
                              (beat)
                         Until you win twenty in the Show, 
                         however, it means you're a slob.

               CRASH RISES AND HEADS OUT to the field. Ebby sits silently, 
               holding his shower shoes, taking it all in.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               sit, stand, stir restlessly. A combination of relaxation and 
               intensity not visible from the stands.

               CRASH IS HANDED HIS BAT and helmet by the bat boy.

                         He ain't got shit.

               FOLLOW CRASH INTO THE ON-DECK CIRCLE -- The ritual. The bat 
               boy hands him the pine tar rag and he rubs pine tar on the 
               bat with great care.

               CRASH RISES -- Heads to the plate. Talking to himself.

                         You ain't getting that cheese by me, 
                         meat.

               CRASH TAKES HIS STANCE -- Upright. Calm. Head still.

                         Look for the fastball up. He's gotta 
                         come with the cheese. Relax. Relax. 
                         Quick bat. Pop the clubhead. Open 
                         the hips. Relax. You're thinking too 
                         much. Get outta your fuckin' head, 
                         Crash.

               CLOSE ON CRASH'S FACE -- His eyes intensely focused.

               CRASH'S P.O.V. THE PITCHER -- Starts his windup.

                                     CRASH (V.O.)
                         Get on top of the ball. Quick bat.  
                         Don't let him in your kitchen --

               THE PITCHER DELIVERS -- Crash strides. Curveball.

               Crash swings and misses, offstride. Strike one.

               CRASH QUICKLY STEPS OUT OF THE BOX and picks up dirt. Rubs 
               it on his hands. He's pissed.

                                     CRASH (V.O.)
                         You stupid fuck, Crash. What're you 
                         swinging at a breaking ball for? 
                         Why's he starting me off with a 
                         hammer? Fuck me.
                              (more dirt)
                         You're okay. Stay back. Stay back, 
                         you dumb fuck. Wait. Wait.

               P.O.V. THE PITCHER'S NEXT DELIVERY -- CURVE BALL AWAY.

               CRASH STRIDES INTO THE PITCH -- Lashes a line drive down the 
               first base line. Just foul.

               Crash has started to first. Pulls up. Returns slowly to the 
               plate. Picks up his bat.

                                     CRASH
                         Throw that shit again, meat. Throw 
                         that weak ass shit.
                              (beat)
                         Now he's gotta try to slip the cheese 
                         by me. One and one. You're on top. 
                         Now bring me the gas --

                P.O.V.  PITCHER'S THIRD DELIVERY -- High and tight. Right 
               at Crash's head. The ball seems to accelerate. About to 
               explode his skull. For a moment -- THE FEAR OF DEATH...

               CRASH HITS THE DIRT -- It just misses his head.

               CRASH CLIMBS OUT OF THE DIRT -- Brushes himself off.

                                     CRASH
                         This son of a bitch throws hard.
                              (beat)
                         Annie, Annie, Annie -- who is this 
                         Annie?
                              (catching himself)
                         Jesus, get outta the box you idiot, 
                         where's your head? Get the broad 
                         outta your head.

               CRASH HOLDS UP HIS HAND to the ump.

                                     CRASH
                         Time out.

                                     UMP
                         Time out!

               CRASH STEPS OUT OF THE BOX -- Motions to the bat boy for the 
               pine tar rag. The boy brings it over. Crash re-applies it to 
               his bat.

                                     BAT BOY
                         Get a hit, Crash.

                                     CRASH
                         Shut up.

               CRASH WALKS BACK TO THE BOX -- Talking to himself.

                                     CRASH
                         Awright, awright. You've seen all 
                         his pitches. Two and one. Relax. 
                         Wait. Quick bat. You can hit this 
                         shit --

               CRASH IN THE BATTER'S BOX -- Digs in-again. Takes his stance.  
               Upright. Relaxed. Ready.

                                     CRASH
                         Shorten up. Bring the gas... Be quick --
                         be quick -- yeah, yeah...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE AND JACKSON IN THE STANDS -- She's writing a note 
               quickly, and hands it to Jackson, who hurries off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CRASH'S P.O.V. THE PITCHER'S NEXT PITCH -- A major league 
               fastball. It explodes to the plate. Crash swings. And misses. 
               Strike Three.

               CRASH WALKS BACK TO THE DUGOUT -- Head high, no show of 
               emotion. Almost proud. An old Warrior, not giving an inch 
               even in defeat.

               HE RE-ENTERS THE DUGOUT -- Sits down and starts putting the 
               catcher's gear back on. Deke leans over.

                                     DEKE
                         Serious heat, eh?

                                     CRASH
                         He ain't got shit.

               THE BATBOY TAKES THE NOTE FROM JACKSON -- And hands it to 
               Crash, who refuses to accept it, being busy putting his gear 
               on.

                                     BAT BOY
                         From Annie.

                                     CRASH
                         Read it.

                                     BAT BOY
                         Dear Crash. You have a lovely swing 
                         but you're pulling your hips out too 
                         early. I'd be happy to meet you at 
                         the Batting Cage tomorrow to discuss 
                         it. Signed, Annie.

                                     DEKE
                         Well if there's one chick'd know 
                         when you're pulling your hips out 
                         early, Annie's the one.

               Crash doesn't seem too amused. He grabs the note, and the 
               pen hanging from the starting lineup card taped to the dugout 
               wall. He scrawls a quick note.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE'S PRIVATE BOX -- She's watching the players through 
               binoculars as Jackson returns with the note.

                                     ANNIE
                              (looking through the 
                              glasses)
                         What'd he say?

               Jackson looks at the note uneasily, then reads --

                                     JACKSON
                         It says... "I want to -- make... 
                         love to you. Crash".

               ANNIE PUTS DOWN THE GLASSES -- Takes the note.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh my...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. A LOCAL BATTING CAGE DAY

               ANNIE DIGS IN AT THE PLATE -- Bat in hand. Crash a few feet 
               away. Annie spits on her hands, wear batting glove, pumps 
               the bat back and forth.

               THE MECHANICAL PITCHING MACHINE DELIVERS -- Kawoosh.

               ANNIE SWINGS -- Lashes out a line drive. Crash smiles.

                                     ANNIE
                         See my hips?

                                     CRASH
                         Yep.

                                     ANNIE
                         I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.

                                     CRASH
                         When you're hitting you shouldn't 
                         think about anything but hitting.
                              (beat)
                         But you shouldn't think about it too 
                         much. The trick is to use your brain 
                         to not use your brain.

                                     ANNIE
                         But you were pulling your hips last 
                         night.

                                     CRASH
                         So... Wanta make love?

               ANNIE SWINGS AND MISSES the next pitch.

                                     ANNIE
                         I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  
                         You had your chance the other night.

                                     CRASH
                         What'you see in that guy -- he's 
                         dim, pretty boy. A young, wild...

                                     ANNIE
                         Young men are uncomplicated.
                              (Crash mutters)
                         And he's not "dim". He's just 
                         inexperienced. My job is to give him 
                         "life-wisdom" and help him make it 
                         to the major leagues.

                                     CRASH
                         That's my job too.

               ANNIE SWINGS AND MISSES another pitch.

                                     ANNIE
                         Damn.

                                     CRASH
                         You're pulling your hips out.

                                     ANNIE
                         But they're nice hips.
                              (beat)
                         I looked up your records -- You've 
                         hit 227 home runs in the minors.  
                         That's great!

               ANNIE FOULS ONE OFF and digs in gamely.

                                     CRASH
                         Don't tell anybody.

                                     ANNIE
                         Why not? If you hit twenty homers 
                         this year you'll be the all time 
                         minor league champ! The record's...

                                     CRASH
                         247 home runs in the minors would be 
                         a dubious honor, if ya think about 
                         it.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh no, I think it'd be great! The 
                         Sporting News should know about it.

                                     CRASH
                         No. Please.

               ANNIE SWINGS AND MISSES another one.

                                     ANNIE
                         Damn.

                                     CRASH
                         Let me.

               CRASH STEPS IN TO HIT -- He takes his familiar stance. The 
               pitch comes. Crash drills it.

                                     CRASH
                         Your place or mine?

                                     ANNIE
                         Despite my love of weird metaphysics 
                         and my rejection of most Judao-
                         Christian ethics, I am, within the 
                         framework of a baseball season, 
                         monogamous.

                                     CRASH
                         Fact is you're afraid of meeting a 
                         guy like me 'cause it might be real 
                         so you sabotage it with some bullshit 
                         about commitment to a young boy you 
                         can boss around --
                              (whack -- a line drive)
                         Great deal. You get to write self-
                         indulgent little poems all winter 
                         about how hard it is to find a man 
                         even though you just sent him packing --
                              (whack -- a line drive)
                         So what do you really want? You wanta 
                         be a tragic woman figure wallowing 
                         in the bullshit of magic?
                              (whack -- a line drive)
                         Or do you want a guy?

               The pitching machine arm flaps. Empty. Silence.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh Crash... you do make speeches...

               Crash puts the bat down, heads out the gate. She follows.

               A LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM ARRIVES -- Twenty-five 10 year olds in 
               uniform with a couple PARENT COACHES.

                                     LITTLE LEAGUER #1
                         Hey, are you Crash Davis! Can I have 
                         a autograph?!

               CRASH STOPS TO SIGN AUTOGRAPHS amidst 25 Little Leaguers.

                                     CRASH
                              (as he signs autographs)
                         Well, Annie, your place or mine?

                                     ANNIE
                         You got me all confused.

                         A batter has two tenths of a second 
                         to decide whether to swing --

                         I'm not a real batter. I'm a woman.

                                     LITTLE LEAGUER
                         Hey, when are you guys gonna start 
                         winning? You're terrible!

                                     ANNIE
                         It's a long season, boys.

               SUDDENLY A VOICE -- Nuke pulls up, gets out of his Porsche.

                                     NUKE
                         Hey!
                              (coming over)
                         What're you guys doing here -- 
                         stealing my girl?

                                     CRASH
                         Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like 
                         that?
                              (to the little leaguers)
                         Hey kids, this is the great Ebby 
                         Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh.

                                     LITTLE LEAGUERS
                         It's Nuke, it's Nuke! Can I have 
                         your autograph?! Etc.

                                     NUKE
                         No prob, kids --

               And suddenly Nuke is swept up into a sea of Little Leaguers.  
               Crash smiles as he turns Annie and the kids over to Nuke.

                                     CRASH
                         See you guys at the ballpark.

               Crash leaves Annie with Nuke and 25 Little Leaguers.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CRASH GETS INTO HIS CAR -- CONTINUOUS

               AN AGING SHELBY MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE -- The paint's fading, a 
               couple dings in the body, but loaded under the hood.

               CRASH PUNCHES HIS TAPE DECK -- Sam Cooke's "You Send Me".

               ANNIE BITES HER FIST watching Crash leave.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM -- DAY

               The sounds of lovemaking in a darkened room lit only by a 
               few candles.

                                     ANNIE
                         Yes, yes, yesnmmmmyes...
                              (beat)
                         Oh my...
                              (several beats)
                         Oh, that was just fabulous, Crash.

               Several beats of silence.

                                     NUKE
                         Crash?

               He flips on a lamp near the bed.

                                     NUKE
                         You mean Nuke. You said "Crash".

                                     ANNIE
                         I didn't say "Crash". I said Nuke.

                                     NUKE
                         You said "Crash".

                                     ANNIE
                         Honey, don't ever listen to a woman 
                         when she's making love. They'll say 
                         the strangest things.

                                     NUKE
                         You said "Crash".

                                     ANNIE
                         Would you rather me be making love 
                         to him, using your name, or making 
                         love to you, using his name?

               Nuke considers this fabulous logic.

                                     NUKE
                         Yeah maybe you're right.

                                     ANNIE
                         You see how nice things are when we 
                         go slow?

               Nuke sighs; and lets his head sink in the pillow.

                                     NUKE
                         Mmm, hmmm.
                              (beat)
                         You shoulda seen how many people 
                         came to the airport to see me off.  
                         When I got drafted first it was the 
                         happiest day of my Father's life.
                              (beat)
                         He likes baseball more than I do...

                                     ANNIE
                         You can learn to like it.

                                     NUKE
                         I wanted to be the host of Dance 
                         Fever, somethin' like that...

                                     ANNIE
                         Y'know if you make it to the Bigs 
                         you could still become the host of 
                         Dance Fever. Baseball's a good 
                         stepping stone for things like that.

                                     NUKE
                         God, I never thought of that.

                                     ANNIE
                              (sweetly)
                         There is a lot of things you never 
                         thought of, sweetie -- now get some 
                         rest for tonight's game.

               Nuke rests his head on Annie's shoulder. His eyes are wide 
               open and full of nervous energy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               NUKE ON A PAY PHONE -- In his uniform. Players warming up in 
               the background as the ground crew prepares the field.

                                     NUKE
                         Hello? Dad? This is Ebby.

                         These hitters down here are better 
                         than the ones in high school...

                              subject)
                         How's Mom? Yeah? Well I am trying 
                         hard... I am bending my back... you're 
                         not coming down' here to visit just 
                         yet, are you?

                         Can I talk to Mom?

               EXT. HOME PLATE -- THE BALLPARK NIGHT

               THE MAYOR OF DURHAM AND THE CITY COUNCIL stand at a mike in 
               front of home plate. 300 LITTLE LEAGUERS in uniform are lined 
               up along the foul line, restrained by a rope.

                                     VOICE OVER P.A.
                         Ladies and gentlemen, the Mayor of 
                         Durham, the honorable Mutt Clark...

               THE MAYOR STEPS to the mike.  A classic Southern mayor.

                                     MAYOR
                         Welcome to the "Atlantic Seaboard

               As the honorable Mutt Clark drones on -- we INTERCUT:

               NUKE IS WARMING UP TO PITCH -- Crash and Larry watch him 
               closely, giving advice. As Nuke delivers --.

                         Drive off your back leg. You pitch 
                         with your legs as much as your arms --

                         I thought I was --

                         Don't think.

               A MANGY DOG EATS FROM A DISH provided by the players. A couple 
               kids sit with the players.

               MILLIE SITS DOWN NEXT TO A PLAYER -- BOBBY, 25.

                                     MILLIE
                         Hi, I'm Millie.

                                     BOBBY
                         I'm married.

               JOSE FASHIONS A SMALL CROSS OUT OF CHICKEN BONES and rubs it 
               on his bat. Bobby notices this.

                                     BOBBY
                         What's that?

                                     JOSE
                         Chicken bone cross take the curse 
                         off this bat and bring me hits.

                         You a God damn witch?

                                     JOSE
                         Yes. A switch hitting witch. Very 
                         common in Puerto Rico.

                                     BOBBY
                         Will that work for me?

                                     JOSE
                         If you believe in Voodoo.

                                     BOBBY
                         I'm 0 for 16! Gimme some of that 
                         shit.

               BOBBY HOLDS OUT HIS BAT for Jose to rub with the cross.

                                     JOSE
                         No, that is not belief. That is 
                         desperation.

                                     BOBBY
                         C'mon, God damn it, gimme some!

               ALL HEADS TURN, A HELICOPTER APPEARS ABOVE THE FIELD

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BACK TO THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL -- Hair and hats blowing 
               from the chopper turbulence.

                                     MAYOR
                         ...five, four, three, two, one... 
                         let 'er go! One thousand big ones!

               THE HELICOPTER DUMPS HUNDREDS OF DOLLAR BILLS above the field.

               The night sky fills with fluttering money THE ROPE IS DROPPED -- 
               THREE HUNDRED LITTLE LEAGUERS charge across the infield to 
               the falling money, scooping it up wildly, brawling, shoving, 
               clawing for the cash.

               As the money flutters down...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. DURHAM BASEBALL STADIUM -- SHORT TIME LATER

               CLOSE ON THE ROSIN BAG on the mound. A hand picks it up.

               Puffs of rosin "smoke". Nuke is on the mound.

               NUKE NERVOUSLY WALKS AROUND THE MOUND -- Just before the 
               first batter. He picks up the rosin bag. Digs a slot for his 
               lead foot to land. And CRASH APPROACHES, in full gear, mask 
               tipped up on his head.

                                     CRASH
                         Don't try to strike everybody out.
                              (beat)
                         Strikeouts are boring. They're 
                         Fascist. Throw some ground balls, 
                         it's more Democratic.

               CRASH TURNS AND HEADS TO THE PLATE and we hear the beginning 
               of Nuke's interior monologue.

                                     NUKE (V.O.)
                         What's this guy know, eh? If he's so 
                         great why's he been in the minors 
                         for ten years? And if he's so hot 
                         how come Annie wants me instead of 
                         him.

               CRASH TURNS AROUND HALF WAY TO THE PLATE and returns to the 
               mound, as if he knows everything Nuke's thinking.

                                     CRASH
                         And listen, meat. You don't know 
                         shit. If you want to get to the Show, 
                         you'll listen to me. She only wants 
                         you 'cause she can boss you around, 
                         got it?
                              (beat, complete tone 
                              change)
                         Relax, have a ball out here. This 
                         game's fun, okay? Fun, God damn it.
                              (beat)
                         And don't squeeze the ball so tight. 
                         It's an egg. Hold it like an egg.

               CRASH SMILES -- And trots back to the plate.

               NUKE'S P.O.V. The first batter steps in. Crash gives the 
               sign for the pitch.

                                     NUKE
                         Fun? What's he know about fun?
                              (beat)
                         Why's he calling for a curveball? I 
                         wanta bring heat.

                                     CRASH
                         Shake off the pitch. Throw what you 
                         wanta.

               NUKE SHAKES OFF THE PITCH -- Here comes Crash back out to 
               the mound before Nuke's thrown a pitch.

                                     CRASH
                         Why you shaking me off?

                                     NUKE
                         I wanta throw the heater to announce 
                         my presence with authority.

                                     CRASH
                         "To announce your fucking presence 
                         with authority"? This guy's a first 
                         ball fastball hitter. He's looking 
                         for heat.

                                     NUKE
                         But he ain't seen my heat --

                                     CRASH
                         Awright, meat, give him your heat.

               CRASH RETURNS ONE MORE TIME to behind the plate.

               CRASH CROSSES THE PLATE, past the hitter. He speaks to the 
               opposing leadoff batter.

                                     CRASH
                         Fastball.

                                     NUKE
                         Why's he always call me "Meat"? I'm 
                         the guy driving a Porsche.

               NUKE WINDS UP AND DELIVERS -- A fastball.

               THE LEADOFF HITTER TEES OFF on the pitch and sends a line 
               shot over the right field fence.

               CLOSE ON BILLBOARD -- "Hit Cow, Win Steak" sign, The home 
               run hits the cow on a target painted on the cow's rump.

               The COW'S MOUTH OPENS AND MOOS.

               THE BATTER STANDS AND WATCHES the home run, admiring the 
               shot, enjoying the moment. CRASH GETS IN HIS FACE instantly -- 
               and gets very tough.

                                     CRASH
                         What're you lookin' at?! You're 
                         showing up my pitcher, bush -- get 
                         your ass in gear!

               THE BATTER TAKES OFF ON A HOME RUN TROT -- Slightly scared.

               AND CRASH HEADS TO THE MOUND where Nuke watches the Mooing 
               Cow and the circling batter with dismay. Crash smiles.

                                     CRASH
                         Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh?

                         Well, I held it like an egg.

                         God, that sucker teed off on it just 
                         like he knew I was gonna throw a 
                         fastball.

                                     CRASH
                         He did know.

                         I told him.

               CRASH SMILES -- Drops the mask, returns behind the plate.

               NUKE SIGHS -- Takes a deep breath.

                                     NUKE
                         Don't think. Just throw. Don't think. 
                         Just throw.

               NUKE'S WINDUP AND DELIVERY -- A fastball. A powerful, clean, 
               overwhelming fastball. Strike one.

                                     NUKE
                         God, that was beautiful. What'd I 
                         do?

               NUKE WINDS UP AND DELIVERS HIS NEXT PITCH -- A monster. An 
               Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh fastball. Twenty feet wide of the 
               plate.

               THE BULL MASCOT DIVES FOR COVER -- The ball hits the bat 
               rack. Bats go flying.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Bus leaves at six in the morning.

               SKIP HEADS BACK INSIDE his little office with Larry.

               INSIDE SKIP'S OFFICE -- He and Larry open a couple beers.

               THE DOOR OPENS -- BOBBY ENTERS wearing only a towel.

                         You wanted to see me?

                         But the organization has decided to 
                         make a change --

                                     BOBBY
                         Skip, I know I'm in a slump but I 
                         hit the ball hard tonight, right at 
                         'em. A couple flares drop in, and 
                         I'm back in the groove!

               The nearly naked 25 year old man pleads helplessly -- his 
               career is over.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STADIUM PARKING LOT -- DAWN

               THE DURHAM BULLS TEAM BUS is parked. Luggage is loaded. Sleepy 
               players arriving, escorted by wives and girlfriends.

               ANNIE BIDS NUKE GOODBYE -- Off to the side. She pulls 
               something from her handbag and hands it to Nuke. A pair of 
               WOMEN'S RED PANTIES, with lace and frills.

                                     ANNIE
                         I want you to wear these on the road 
                         trip when you pitch.

                                     NUKE
                         What?

                                     ANNIE
                         They'll fit snugly against your balls 
                         in such a wonderful way that you'll 
                         start seeing things differently --
                         plus they'll remind you of me which 
                         is better than thinking about those 
                         nasty hitters.

                         You've been pitching out of the wrong 
                         side of your brain. These'll help 
                         move things to the right side.

                                     NUKE
                         Big League pitchers don't use these.

                         They did when they were in the 
                         Carolina League.

               NUKE STUFFS THE PANTIES in his pocket, bewildered. A small 
               kiss from Annie, and he hurries to the bus.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PLAYERS THROW THEIR GEAR into their travel bags.

               A PAPER BEER CUP IS TAPED TO THE WALL -- With a sign:

               "Married men deposit wedding rings here for road trips".

               CLOSE ON THE CUP -- A ring is dropped in, and another, and...

               We begin hearing Annie's VOICE OVER:

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         A woman should never ask questions 
                         about road trips.

               their apartments, leaving:

               ANNIE WALKING BACK ROME -- Several blocks to her house.

                                     ANNIE
                         Men don't realize that women always 
                         know when they've been unfaithful.

                         This sort of spiritual awareness can 
                         be a mixed blessing, especially if 
                         you're dating a ballplayer. I believe 
                         a woman oughta take care of her man 
                         so thoroughly that he can go on the 
                         road for a few days without having 
                         the desire to search out another 
                         pair of panties
                              (self-aware)
                         That is probably, however, my most 
                         ridiculous belief.
                              (sigh)
                         I just hope the boys start winning 
                         soon. In some profound way I fear 
                         that a last place team is a reflection 
                         on its women...

               THE BUS ROLLS through North Carolina.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE BUS -- MORNING

               SKIP SITS IN THE FRONT of the bus, doing a crossword puzzle.

               LARRY READS A BOOK -- "How to Make a Million Dollars in Real 
               Estate with No Money Down".

               DEKE TURNS UP HIS TAPE DECK -- George Jones sings "He Stopped 
               Loving Her Today".

               MICKEY TURNS UP HIS TAPE DECK across the aisle -- Aretha 
               Franklin sings "R-E-S-P-E-C-T".

               DEKE TURNS HIS VOLUME LOUDER -- Mickey does likewise, and 
               soon we have DUELING TAPE DECKS. C & W going head to head 
               with R & B. A cacophony.

               SKIP LEAPS TO HIS FEET, WHIRLS and shouts.

                                     SKIP
                         I got one word to say to you -- Shut 
                         up!

               Silence.

               And then from the back of the bus, some soft, gentle, but 
               slightly dissonant guitar chords.

               THE BACK OF THE BUS -- Nuke sits across the aisle from Crash, 
               who's re-reading Thomas Pynchon. Nuke has a guitar and is 
               struggling with some chords to "Try a Little Tenderness".  
               He butchers the chords and the words.

                                     NUKE
                              (singing softly)
                         Oh she may get wooly, women do get 
                         wooly, because of all the stress...

                                     CRASH
                              (in disgust)
                         Gimme that.

               CRASH STRONGARMS THE GUITAR from Nuke.

                                     CRASH
                         I hate people who get the words wrong.  
                         It ain't "woolly" it's "weary" and 
                         it nobody's got stress, they're 
                         wearing a dress.
                              (beat)
                         Listen.

               CRASH WHIPS THROUGH THE FIRST FEW BARS of the song.

                                     CRASH
                              (sings softly)
                         Oh she may be weary, Young girls do 
                         get weary, Wearing the same old 
                         dress...

               HE SHOVES THE GUITAR back at Nuke.

                                     NUKE
                         How come you don't like me?

                                     CRASH
                         'Cause you don't respect yourself, 
                         which is your problem, but you don't 
                         respect the game -- and that's my 
                         problem.
                              (beat)
                         You got a gift.

                         What do I got?

                                     CRASH
                         A gift. When you were a baby the 
                         gods reached down and turned your 
                         left arm into a thunderbolt.

               Nuke looks at his left arm rubs his shoulder curiously.

                                     CRASH
                         You got a Hall of Fame arm but you're 
                         pissing it away.

                                     NUKE
                         I ain't pissing nothing away -- I 
                         got a Porsche already. A 944 with 
                         A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.

                                     CRASH
                         You don't need a quadraphonic 
                         Blaupunkt -- you need a curve ball.
                              (beat)
                         In the Show, everybody can hit the 
                         fastball.

                                     NUKE
                         You been in the Majors?

                         Yep.

               Tony and Deke overhear this and turn around. And Crash gets 
               wistful, lyrical, and even slightly hopeful.

                                     CRASH
                         I was in the Show for 21 days, once.
                              (beat)
                         It was the greatest 21 days of my 
                         life. You never touch your luggage 
                         in the show -- somebody else handles 
                         your bags. It's great.
                              (beat)
                         The ballparks are like cathedrals, 
                         the hotels all have room service, 
                         the women have long legs and brains -- 
                         it's a smorgasbord.

                                     DEKE
                         The women are hot, eh?

                                     CRASH
                         Yeah -- and so are the pitchers. 
                         They throw ungodly breaking stuff in 
                         the Show -- exploding sliders.

               Nuke, Tony, and Deke murmur in awe at Crash's pronouncement.

                                     CRASH
                         You could be one of those guys -- 
                         but you don't give a fuck, Meat.

                                     NUKE
                         God damn it I'm sick of you calling 
                         me "Meat"! You wanta step outside!

               CRASH HOPS TO HIS FEET as the bus barrels along, grabbing 
               Nuke by the collar.

                                     CRASH
                         Yeah, let's go.

               Nuke quickly has second thoughts -- Crash can be terrifying.

                                     NUKE
                         No. Wait a minute. Calm down, Crash...

               Nuke sits back down. Calms. Reaches for a baseball sitting 
               nearby. He hands the ball to Crash.

                                     NUKE
                         Teach me how to throw a breaking 
                         ball.

               Crash takes the ball gently and speaks softly:

                         As I was saying ya hold it like an

               As the bus rolls through the country:

               A LATE 60'S OLDS CONVERTIBLE ROARS PAST -- Max Patkin at the 
               wheel. He waves at the team bus and honks.

               The opening bars on the National Anthem -- "Oh Say Can You 
               See"

               And Max roars off through the rolling green-landscape...

               Hit Hank Williams music to play over:

               MAX PATKIN COACHES THIRD in his comic routine, now, for the 
               Winston-Salem team, as Durham is in the field.

               A WINSTON-SALEM BATTER lines a double off the wall.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               TEDDY THE ANNOUNCER re-creates the game for broadcast with a 
               several second delay.

               HIS ASSISTANT (P.A. ANNOUNCER FROM THE BALLPARK) has a phone 
               to her ear, and writes down each play on a piece of paper, 
               holding it up for Teddy who enhances shamelessly in his ON 
               THE AIR "play by play".

               CLOSE ON PAPER -- His assistant writes "DOUBLE TO LEFT".

               TEDDY HITS A TINY MALLET against a jar. Thunk. The sound of 
               ball hitting bat. He punches one of several tape cassettes 
               cued up. A crowd roars. An array of special effects is at 
               his fingertips.

                                     TEDDY

                         are unable to get the first out of 
                         the inning...

               HIS ASSISTANT WRITES ANOTHER NOTE -- "ERROR MCFEE"

               Thunk -- The mallet again.

                         by his glove, another run in and the 
                         crowd loves it --

               PUNCHES A CASSETTE -- A crowd roars.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               embarrassed anyway -- and stuffs them back.

                         wretched road trip I've seen in 20 
                         years, and possibly the worst Durham

               THE TEAM BUS at a drive through hamburger stand somewhere in

               THE TEAM BUS PULLS INTO YET ANOTHER HOTEL and this time, a 
               Bus with a sign -- "Holiday on Ice" pulls in next to them.

               THE WIVES AND SOME GIRLFRIENDS WATCH "DYNASTY" on Annie's

               popcorn, and largely staying in the background.

                         Do you think your husband plays around

                         I guess not... it's just that once I 
                         asked Mickey if he was faithful to 
                         me on the road trips and he said "in 
                         his heart he was faithful".

                         It means he's unfaithful -- but only 
                         a man would put it in those words.

               A BABY CRIES -- Tommy's Wife lifts a baby from the couch, 
               begins rocking It.

                                     CRASH
                         Wake up, it's okay... you're 
                         dreaming...

               CRASH HELPS NUKE back to consciousness. Nuke shakes his head, 
               trying to wake up. Crash is almost tender.

                                     NUKE
                         I was playing naked.

                                     CRASH
                         I know, I know -- I have that dream 
                         all the time. We're almost home.

               The Bus continues across the Carolina landscape.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE STADIUM PARKING LOT -- DAWN

               The team bus pulls into a deserted parking lot. A few of the 
               players' cars are parked. Some of the wives and girlfriends. 
               And Annie.

               THE PLAYERS SHUFFLE OFF the bus. Tired and beat.

               CLOSE ON NUKE -- He looks worse than the rest. He sees Annie 
               and waves. She's waiting next to her old Volvo.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STREETS OF DURHAM MOMENTS LATER

               ANNIE'S VOLVO PULLS OUT -- She drives.

               INT. THE VOLVO -- DAY

               Annie is up -- Nuke is down.

                                     NUKE
                         God I'm tired. What a trip I was 
                         lousy. I was worse than lousy.  
                         Everytime I pitched -- it was like 
                         throwing gasoline on a fire. Kaboom.  
                         I --

                                     ANNIE
                         What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You 
                         only talk about yourself? Aren't you 
                         glad to see me? Don't I look nice?

                                     NUKE
                         Sorry. You look great. I'm totally 
                         exhausted.

                                     ANNIE
                         Good. Total exhaustion can be 
                         spiritually fabulous.
                              (beat)
                         Let's play catch.

                                     NUKE
                         Catch?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ANNIE'S BACKYARD -- MORNING

               Flowers and birdfeeders everywhere. And, 60 feet away in 
               complete, oversized catcher's gear --

               JACKSON IN A CATCHER'S CROUCH -- Nuke stares, in his street 
               clothes, but now with a glove and ball.

                                     JACKSON
                         Hum, babe, hum, babe, fire it in 
                         here, hum babe--

                                     ANNIE
                         That's not necessary, Jackson --
                              (beat)
                         Okay, Nuke, now lean in for the sign.

               He does. Jackson flashes some ridiculous signs.

                                     NUKE
                         This in ridiculous. I'm a pro.

                                     ANNIE
                         Just do what I say. Now, which nostril 
                         are you breathing through?

                                     NUKE
                         Which nostril am I breathing through?

               Annie puts her hand under his nose.

                                     ANNIE
                         The right nostril. Good.

                                     NUKE
                         My right nostril?

                                     ANNIE
                         There are two important psychic 
                         conduits called the "pingala" and 
                         the "ida". The pingala starts with 
                         the left testicle (or left ovary of 
                         the female) and ends at the right 
                         nostril.

               She touches his left nut through his pants in a matter of 
               fact manner. He stares back.

                                     ANNIE
                         The ida originates at the right 
                         testicle (or ovary) and terminates 
                         at the left nostril.

                                     NUKE
                         I'm really beat. I need some serious 
                         "z's" --

                                     ANNIE
                         The pingala is the nostril used for 
                         throwing a baseball.
                              (beat)
                         And if you discover before a game 
                         you're in the wrong nostril, it's 
                         easy to switch.

                                     NUKE
                         Switch nostrils?

                                     ANNIE
                         Right. Okay, fire a couple in there.

               NUKE TOSSES AN EASY PITCH to Jackson. Annie's incensed.

                                     ANNIE
                         You're patronizing me! I will not be 
                         patronized --

                                     NUKE
                         If I throw too hard I'll hurt the 
                         kid.

                                     ANNIE
                         He's handled a lotta pitchers whose 
                         records were better than one and 
                         six.

               Nuke gets a little steamed. He feels his nostril, winds, and 
               fires a medium speed fastball to Jackson.

                                     NUKE
                              (a bit angry)
                         How was that?

                                     ANNIE
                         A little better.

                                     NUKE
                         Gimme the God damn ball!

               NUKE WINDS UP and fires a pitch to Jackson. Alas --

               THE BALL SAILS THROUGH A WINDOW -- Crashing glass.

                                     NUKE
                              (cynically)
                         How ya like that?

                                     ANNIE
                         Much better. Your delivery was fully 
                         integrated because you weren't 
                         thinking about it 'cause you were 
                         pissed off at me.
                              (beat)
                         This is progress.

               Nuke smiles and gives in. And reaches for her.

                                     NUKE
                         I give up. Let's go inside, make 
                         love, and fall asleep till it's time 
                         to go to the ballpark.

               She takes his hand and leads him up to the back porch.

                                     ANNIE
                         Or...
                              (taking his hand)
                         ...We could just take that sexual 
                         energy and save it for a few hours 
                         and re-channel it into your pitching 
                         tonight.
                              (shouting)
                         C'mon, Jackson, I've got some 
                         lemonade!

               Jackson runs over in full gear to join them.

               SITTING ON THE BACK PORCH -- A pitcher of lemonade.

                                     NUKE
                         I can't keep up with you. First you 
                         say sex is gonna make me a better 
                         pitcher -- now no sex is gonna do 
                         it?!

                                     ANNIE
                         It's all the same thing.

               SUDDENLY NUKE'S FACE IS FILLED WITH ALARM -- He points.

                                     NUKE
                         What's that?!

               -- P.O.V. A CARDBOARD BOX ON A TABLE NEARBY -- Scrawled in 
               larged letters on the side are the words "MAX PATKIN".

                                     ANNIE
                              (matter of factly)
                         That's Max. His ashes anyway. He 
                         left no kin...

               Nuke stares, unsettled.

                                     NUKE
                         God... I think I'm gonna be sick --

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh don't be silly. Death is nothing 
                         to be scared of. It's just another 
                         way of living. It's just a fresh 
                         start -- kinda like spring training.

               Nuke thinks about this carefully. Looks at the ashes, at 
               Annie, and at Jackson, in full gear, mask on his head.

                                     NUKE
                         Death is like spring training?

                                     ANNIE
                         Yes. And so is birth. Now look me in 
                         the eyes, Nuke --
                              (sweetly accusing him)
                         You haven't been wearing my panties, 
                         have you?

               CLOSE ON NUKE -- Utterly bewildered.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BULLS LOCKER ROOM -- NIGHT

               NUKE PULLS HIS JOCKSTRAP ON over the red panties.

               Crash notices the panties, and snaps the waistband.

                                     CRASH
                         Hot. Very hot...

               Nuke looks around nervously, continues dressing quickly.

                                     NUKE
                         Annie says her panties will keep one 
                         side of my brain occupied while I'm 
                         on the mound, thus keeping my brain 
                         slightly off center, which is where 
                         it should be for artists and pitchers. 
                         She also said I should throw whatever 
                         pitches you call for.

                                     CRASH
                         Annie's a smart lady.

               Suddenly Deke spots Nuke's panties.

                                     DEKE
                         Hey, fruit alert! Check out the Rook.

               SEVERAL PLAYERS GATHER AROUND -- Wolf whistles aimed at Nuke 
               as the players are dressing into their uniforms.

                                     NUKE
                         Annie says there's no such thing as 
                         straight and gay. We're all sexual 
                         creatures to start with, and we get 
                         formed into certain roles.

                         You believe that?

                                     NUKE
                         When I'm one and six I'll believe 
                         anything.
                              (as they dress)
                         Annie also says that God is a woman.  
                         You believe that, Crash, you think 
                         God's a lady?

                                     CRASH
                         God's definitely a woman -- but she's 
                         no lady.

                                     TOMMY
                         This is all Commie bullshit.

               JIMMY TURNS FROM HIS CUBICLE to answer the theological 
               question.  Ll heads wait for the answer.

               and takes the home run trot as:

               NUKE STARES AT THE OUTFIELD WALL as the batter circles the 
               bases. Crash walks to the mound.

                                     NUKE
                         You told him I was throwing a deuce, 
                         right?

                                     CRASH
                         Yep. He really crushed that dinger, 
                         didn't he. Musta gone 450 feet... 
                         damn...

               NUKE HOLDS OUT HIS GLOVE -- Says nothing. Crash puts a new 
               ball in the glove. Returns to the plate.

               NUKE GETS THE SIGN -- Winds. Delivers. Batter hits a weak 
               one hopper back to the mound. Game's over.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MAXWELL'S BAR -- LATER -- NIGHT

               A raucous celebration of the victory. Booze flows.

               And we begin hearing the familiar sounds of Piaf...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ANNIE'S HOUSE -- LATER -- NIGHT

               ANNIE COMES OUT OF THE BATHROOM -- Dressed in a long, flowing 
               nightgown, elegant and old fashioned. She looks fabulous, 
               PRESENTING HERSELF to Nuke.

                                     ANNIE
                         I'm yours.

                                     NUKE
                         Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it 
                         works for one game, maybe it'll work 
                         for a whole buncha games.

                                     ANNIE
                         Breathing through your pingala always 
                         works, honey --

                                     NUKE
                         Not that. I mean the re-channeling 
                         of my sexual energy.
                              (beat)
                         Maybe we shouldn't make love for 
                         awhile.

                                     ANNIE
                         Now don't go overboard, I look 
                         incredibly hot, right?

               She strikes a pose. She does look hot.

                                     NUKE
                         You know what it feels like to throw 
                         a three hitter?
                              (nervously, with 
                              resolve)
                         We better not fuck.

                                     ANNIE
                         Nuke?!

                                     NUKE
                         Just till I lose.

                                     ANNIE
                         Get over here.

                                     NUKE
                         No.

                                     ANNIE
                         Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh --

               She starts toward him -- and Nuke flees. Out the door, into 
               the night. Annie slumps in disbelief.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

               ANNIE SITS IN BED ALONE -- Lights a cigarette. A puzzled 
               expression -- things have got out of control.

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         Nuke was so encouraged that he took 
                         a vow to not have sex until they 
                         lost...

               Annie reaches over, opens a drawer in her nightstand, and 
               pulls out her baseball glove. She cradles it fondly in her 
               lap, puts it on, pounds it gently...

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         Y'see a ballplayer on a streak 
                         considers himself touched with magic 
                         and he'll do anything to keep from 
                         breaking the spell...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DURHAM BULL LOCKER ROOM -- DAY

               NUKE NEATLY UNFOLDS THE RED PANTIES in his locker.

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         In fact the whole team started making 
                         religious connections and everybody 
                         got hot.

               JOSE BLESSES THE BATS with a chicken bone cross.

               JIMMY READS THE BIBLE and prays alone in the corner.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DURHAM BASEBALL FIELD -- DAY

               PLAYERS TAKING GROUND BALLS and batting practice.

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         I figured Nuke would win a couple, 
                         then lose, and things would get back 
                         to normal...

               PLAYERS PLAYING "FLIP" PEPPER like kids.

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         But it didn't happen like that... 
                         and for one extraordinary June and 
                         July, the Durham Bulls, for whatever 
                         perverse reason, began playing 
                         baseball with joy and verve and poetry --

               NUKE WARMING UP in the bullpen, listening to Crash.

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         The two sides of my own brain were 
                         all jumbled up and cross-wired...  
                         while one side was being neglected, 
                         the other was in paradise watching 
                         our Bulls play like Big Leaguers...

               MICKEY RIPS A TRIPLE UP THE ALLEY -- Slides into third.

               DEKE AND TOMMY TURN A SPECTACULAR DOUBLE PLAY

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         We swept a four game series with 
                         Kingston, back to back doubleheaders 
                         with Winston-Salem, and kicked the 
                         holy shit out of Greensboro in a 
                         three game series...

               SEVERAL PLAYERS SIGNING AUTOGRAPHS at a local mall. A line 
               of kids to meet them. A banner -- MEET YOUR BULLS!

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         They were in demand all over town -- 
                         and Crash, who kept hitting dingers, 
                         was approaching the minor league 
                         record... though I told nobody.

               CRASH BLASTS ANOTHER HOME RUN -- Another win.

               JULY 4 PROMOTION -- LARRY, DEKE, TOMMY, AND JOSE dressed as 
               the "Spirit of 176 Drum and Fife Corps" at home plate, 
               surrounded by a Boy Scout Troop.

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         After sweeping a July 4 doubleheader, 
                         the Durham Bulls were tied for first.

               THE WIVES, THE GROUPIES, AND MILLIE WAIT for the players 
               outside the clubhouse following a game.

               ANNIE SITS ALONE IN HER BOX SEAT as the stadium empties.

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         But beautiful as the winning streak 
                         was, I was getting damn lonely.
                              (beat)
                         Something had to be done. I needed a 
                         man...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE TEAM BUS ON THE ROAD BACK --DAY

               The sounds of Diana Ross and the Supremes.

               INT. THE BUS -- DAY

               LARRY, DEKE, TOMMY AND MICKEY as the Supremes, singing "Stop 
               in the Name of Love" at the front of the bus.

                                     NUKE
                         I love winning, Crash, you hear me?  
                         I love it. Teach me everything.

                                     CRASH
                         It's time you started working on 
                         your interviews.

                         What do I gotta do?

                                     CRASH
                         Learn your clichés. Study them. Know 
                         them. They're your friends.

               Crash hands Nuke a small pad and pen.

                                     CRASH
                         Write this down.

                         Boring.

                                     CRASH
                         Of course. That's the point.
                              (beat)
                         "I'm just happy to be here and hope 
                         I can help the ballclub."

                         It my best shot and, Good Lord 
                         willing, things'll work out."

               NUKE STARTS WRITING them down.

                         Yep. So how's Annie?

               Nuke looks up from his clichés, startled.

                                     NUKE
                         She's getting steamed 'cause I'm 
                         still re-channeling my sexual energy -- 
                         maybe I should cave in and sleep 
                         with her once just to calm her down.  
                         What'ya think?

                         You outta your mind? If you give in

                              (beat)
                         Never fuck with a winning streak.

               Nuke nods seriously, listening to the master.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The players get off, greet their women.

               ANNIE GREETS NUKE -- They head for her Volvo..

               JIMMY STARTS ACROSS THE LOT on foot, dragging his luggage, 
               when Millie pulls up in her car.

                                     MILLIE
                         Hi, Jimmy. Want a ride?

                         Can I give you my testimony?

                         You can do anything you want.
                              (a tiny grin)

               JIMMY NERVOUSLY GETS IN WITH MILLIE They roar away.

               NUKE SITS AT THE TABLE -- He's just finished eating.

               Annie circles him. A pot of soup on the stove.

                                     ANNIE
                         I'm so proud of you and all the guys.  
                         Want some more soup?

                         No, that's okay. All I need's a little 
                         nap.

                                     ANNIE
                         I'm not gonna try to seduce you, 
                         sweetie...

               ANNIE STRETCHES OUT HER LEG and lays it an the table.

                                     NUKE
                         What's that?

               She pulls back her skirt slightly, exposing her garter snaps 
               attached to her stockings.

                                     ANNIE
                         That's my leg.

                                     NUKE
                         I know what it is.

                                     ANNIE
                         I figure we could work on some 
                         fundamentals even if we don't make 
                         love.

               She strokes her leg. Nuke stares fearfully.

                                     NUKE
                         Fundamentals?

                                     ANNIE
                         Sure.
                              (beat)
                         Unsnap my stockings.

               Nuke squirms, then reaches for her garter snaps. And stops.

                                     NUKE
                         Crash once called a woman's, uh -- 
                         pussy -- y'know how the hair kinda 
                         makes a "V" shape? --

                                     ANNIE
                         Yes I do...

                                     NUKE
                         Well -- he calls it the Bermuda 
                         Triangle. He said a man can get lost 
                         in there and never be heard from 
                         again.

                                     ANNIE
                         What a nasty thing to say.

                                     NUKE
                         He didn't mean it nasty. He said 
                         that gettin' lost and disappearing 
                         from the face of the earth was 
                         sometimes a good thing to do -- 
                         especially like that.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh...
                              (beat)
                         Crash is a very smart man. Now c'mon, 
                         honey, give it a try.

               NUKE REACHES FOR THE GARTER SNAPS with two hands. He fumbles, 
               groping awkwardly. Annie stops him gently.

                                     ANNIE
                         Watch... one hand --

               WITH A SINGLE HAND ANNIE FLICKS each snap. Flick, flick, 
               flick. Magic. The snaps open effortlessly.

                                     NUKE
                         oh.

               ANNIE RE-SNAPS THEM QUICKLY, offering her leg to Nuke.

                                     ANNIE
                         Now you try.

               NUKE TRIES AGAIN -- One handed. Awkwardly again, but --

                                     ANNIE
                              (sighing sexually)
                         Mmmmmmm... oh yes...

               BUT NUKE LEAPS TO HIS FEET -- Reacting vigorously, nervously, 
               desperately. The soup crashes on the floor.

                                     NUKE
                         No! You're playing with my mind!

                                     ANNIE
                         I'm trying to play with your body!

                                     NUKE
                         I knew it -- you're seducing me!

                                     ANNIE
                         Of course I'm seducing you for 
                         Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor 
                         job of it --
                              (beat)
                         Aren't I pretty?

                                     NUKE
                         I think you're real cute.

                                     ANNIE
                         Cute?! I hate cute! Baby ducks are 
                         cute! I wanta be exotic and 
                         mysterious!

                                     NUKE
                         You're exotic and mysterious and 
                         cute -- that's why I better leave.

               Nuke starts to leave.

                                     ANNIE
                         Nuke! You got things all wrong! 
                         There's no relation between sex and 
                         baseball. Ask Crash.

                                     NUKE
                         I did.

                                     ANNIE
                         What'd he say?

                                     NUKE
                         He said if I gave in to you I'd start 
                         losing again.

                                     ANNIE
                         He did?

                                     NUKE
                         I'll be back when we lose.

               NUKE HURRIES OUT THE DOOR -- Annie just stares.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE DOWNTOWNER MOTEL -- DURHAM -- DAY

               A run of the mill cheap modern motel.

               INT. CRASH'S ROOM AT THE MOTEL -- DAY

               CRASH WORKS ON HIS SWING in front of a mirror.

               A knock at the door.

                                     CRASH
                         Come in.

               ANNIE ENTERS the room. Crash stays with his stance.

                                     ANNIE
                         Crash... I want you.

                                     CRASH
                         Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?

                                     ANNIE
                         He's confused --

                                     CRASH
                         Aren't we all?

                                     ANNIE
                         Don't you think I'm pretty?

               Crash puts down the bat, and looks directly at her. As he 
               does he picks up two spring loaded hand exercisers and begins 
               pumping them an he talks.

                                     CRASH
                         You're gorgeous, God damn it! From 
                         the moment I first saw you I knew I 
                         had to have you. I had to have you!

                                     ANNIE
                         I want to be had.

                                     CRASH
                         I think of you and the "boy" all the 
                         time.

                                     ANNIE
                         He won't make love to me anymore.

                                     CRASH
                         And he's right! A ballplayer on a 
                         streak has to respect the streak. 
                         They don't happen very often.
                              (beat)
                         You know how hard this game is? If 
                         you believe you're playing well 
                         because you're getting laid or because 
                         you're not getting laid or because 
                         you wore red silk panties -- then 
                         you are!
                              (beat)
                         And I still think Thomas Pynchon is 
                         full of shit.

                                     ANNIE
                         I want you desperately!

               Crash can hardly keep up. So he slows her down --

                                     CRASH
                         Who are you? Do you have a job?

                                     ANNIE
                         I teach part time at the Junior 
                         College. What if I told you I was 
                         through with Nuke? He learned his 
                         lessons quickly and left me.

                                     CRASH
                         And now you wanta teach me?

                                     ANNIE
                         I don't imagine there's much I could 
                         teach you.

                                     CRASH
                         I doubt that.

                                     ANNIE
                         Crash, I get wet just thinking about 
                         you.

                                     CRASH
                         I thought you wanted an 
                         "uncomplicated" boy?

                                     ANNIE
                         I'm ready for a complicated man.

                                     CRASH
                         -- and as soon as we lose a game, 
                         he'll be back in your arms.

                                     ANNIE
                         I said when I think about you, I get 
                         wet.

                                     CRASH
                         Annie, I think you should leave.

               Annie launches into a tirade without orchestration or self- 
               awareness. She's frustrated, confused, angry and...

                                     ANNIE
                         God damn you -- what is happening? 
                         Is there no man who'll have me?
                              (beat)
                         This is the weirdest season I ever 
                         saw -- the Durham Bulls can't lose 
                         and I can't get laid!

                                     CRASH
                              (softly)
                         You okay?

               Annie slides against the wall down to the floor. Tears flow. 
               Her makeup runs. Her eyes are red.

                                     ANNIE
                              (shakily)
                         I need a drink.

               Crash gingerly helps her to her feet.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MAXWELL'S BAR -- DAY

               ANNIE AND CRASH SIT IN THE CORNER of the empty bar.

                                     CRASH
                         Why baseball?

                                     ANNIE
                              (sighs)
                         I was raised in a Baptist church got 
                         dipped in the water when I was 5 -- 
                         born again before kindergarten... by 
                         the time I was 10 I knew it was 
                         bullshit and at 15 I ran away from 
                         home...

               SHE SMILES at the most painful memories.

                                     ANNIE
                         pregnant, had an abortion, got 
                         pregnant again, had an abortion 
                         again... gave up men. Tried women. 
                         Missed men. My mother died.
                              (beat)
                         I bought a car for $200 and drove to 
                         Ft. Lauderdale to bury her.
                              (beat)
                         And after we'd sung some hymns in 
                         some wretched Florida funeral home, 
                         I went outside and something happened --

               Her tone becomes wistful, nostalgic.

                                     ANNIE
                         The smell of cut grass in the warm 
                         March air overwhelmed me and I heard 
                         a noise --
                              (makes the sound))
                         -- tok, tok, tok -- and some men 
                         shouting... then tok, tok, tok.

               Crash smiles slightly. He knows.

                                     ANNIE
                         I crossed the street -- it was the 
                         New York Yankees spring training 
                         field -- tok, tok, tok, was the sound 
                         of a ball hitting a bat -- and I sat 
                         in the warm bleachers to think about 
                         my mother...
                              (beat)
                         And I saw him.

                                     CRASH
                         Who?

                                     ANNIE
                         Thurman Munson.
                              (beat)
                         He was covered with dirt and he was 
                         fighting with everybody -- it was 
                         beautiful...
                              (beat)
                         And he called the ump a cocksucker 
                         and got thrown out of the game even 
                         though it was an exhibition!
                              (beat)
                         So I stayed in the bleachers all 
                         spring and gradually came to 
                         understand what's so great about 
                         baseball.

                                     CRASH
                         What's so great about baseball?

                                     ANNIE
                         If you know where home plate is, 
                         then you know where 1st base is, and 
                         2nd, and everything else -- 'cause 
                         they're always in the same place in 
                         relation to home.
                              (beat)
                         Don't you see? If you know where 
                         home plate is, then you know where 
                         everything else in the universe is!

               Silence.

                                     CRASH
                         I don't know if I'd go that far.

                                     ANNIE
                         It's true, It's true!
                              (beat, down)
                         Least it used to be true. It ain't 
                         possible that baseball's not enough 
                         anymore, is it, Crash?

                                     CRASH
                         It's possible.

                                     ANNIE
                         No.

                                     CRASH
                         Are you gonna be waking up next to 
                         20 year old ballplayers when you're 
                         60?

                                     ANNIE
                         Well... I used to think that wasn't 
                         the worst thing in the world to look 
                         forward to. Lately I'm not so sure.

                                     CRASH
                         Why not?

                                     ANNIE
                              (angrily)
                         Whatta you mean "why not"? Are you 
                         gonna play forever?!

               Before Crash can answer --

               SUDDENLY A VOICE interrupts. They both turn to see:

               MILLIE EXCITEDLY DRAGGING JIMMY into the nearly empty bar.

               She leads him by the hand.

                                     MILLIE
                         Annie, Annie! There she is -- we've 
                         been looking all over for ya. Hi 
                         Crash.

               MILLIE LEADS JIMMY right up to their table. And as they hold 
               hands. Jimmy stands there shyly.

                                     MILLIE
                         Well tell 'em, honey.

                                     JIMMY
                              (nervously)
                         We're getting married.

               MILLIE STICKS OUT HER LEFT HAND Displays a huge ring.

                                     ANNIE
                         Omigawd, honey, I'm so happy for 
                         you.

                                     MILLIE
                         He's a virgin.

               Jimmy squirms defensively.

                                     JIMMY
                         Well, yeah...
                              (to Annie and Crash)
                         I guess that probably seems pretty 
                         corny to people like you.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh Jimmy, honey, I think it sounds 
                         wonderful!

                                     MILLIE
                         Annie, will you be the bride's maid?

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         look loose. Anything bothering him?

                                     LARRY
                         He said his chakras were jammed and 
                         he was breathing out of the wrong 
                         nostril.

                                     SKIP
                              (spitting tobacco)
                         Okay...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BACK TO THE MOUND

               NUKE WINDS AND DELIVERS AGAIN -- Very high. Ball four.

               CRASH IS QUICKLY to the mound.

                                     CRASH
                         What's wrong?

               JOSE THE FIRST BASEMAN JOINS THEM ALL at the mound.

                                     JOSE

                         Then you got to cut the head off a 
                         live rooster.

               INT. ANNIE'S HOUSE NIGHT

               ANNIE IS HELPING MILLIE make her WEDDING DRESS.

               The game can be heard on the radio in the b.g.

                                     MILLIE
                         You should be at the game.

                                     ANNIE
                         No, no -- I'm fine. Millie, how much 
                         time did you and Jimmy spend together 
                         before he proposed?

               Annie holds the dress up to Millie.

                                     MILLIE
                         Five hours. We both just know.
                              (studying the dress)
                         Do you think I deserve to wear white?

                                     ANNIE
                         We all deserve to wear white.

               BOTH WOMEN TURN THEIR HEADS to the radio to listen.

               EXT. DURHAM BALLPARK THE GAME NIGHT

               CRASH FLIPS HIS MASK -- A runner rounds third heading for 
               home. Here comes the throw, on a line. It hits once on the 
               infield grass, takes a long hop --

               AS THE RUNNER BARRELS TOWARD THE PLATE -- Crash takes the 
               throw.

               THE RUNNER SLIDES -- Crash blocks the plate. A cloud of dust. 
               A close play.

               THE UMPIRE SIGNALS "SAFE" -- And Crash flips out. In a second 
               he is nose to nose with the UMPIRE.

                                     CRASH

                         touched the plate.

               THEIR FACES ARE INCHES APART -- Screaming face to face.

                         It was a cocksucking call!

                         No! I said It was a cock-sucking 
                         call and you can't run me for that!

                         You want me to call you a cocksucker?!

               THE UMP THEATRICALLY THROWS CRASH out of the game.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         ...I've never seen Crash so angry 
                         and frankly, Bull fans, he used a 
                         certain word that's a "no-no" with 
                         umpires...

                         Crash musta called the guy a

               INT. THE SHOWERS NIGHT

               CRASH STANDS AGAINST the water, letting it stream across 
               him. He raises a can of beer to his lips, drinks it slowly 
               in the shower.

               As the water runs over Crash...

                                     ANNIE
                         When Crash got throwed out, the game 
                         got out of hand...
                              (beat)
                         ...Jose made three errors with his 
                         cursed mitt...

               JOSE BOOTS A GROUND BALL -- A runner scores.

                         Nuke never quite got in the groove 
                         though he didn't pitch bad...

               NUKE JUST MISSES WITH A PITCH -- Ball four.

                         ...and the winning streak came to an 
                         end with a 3-2 loss...
                              (beat)
                         The good news was that a man was 
                         about to come calling... the bad 
                         news was -- it was the wrong guy.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. ANNIE'S LIVING ROOM NIGHT

               AS PIAF PLAYS on the stereo -- A knock at the door.

               ANNIE GOES TO THE DOOR -- Then refuses to answer it at first.  
               She hides in a corner. Bites her fist.

                                     NUKE'S VOICE
                         Annie! You gotta be in there -- I 
                         can hear that crazy Mexican singer!

               Annie smiles slightly, and opens the door.

                                     NUKE
                         We lost.

                                     ANNIE
                         It's okay...

               She opens the door fully. Nuke's father stands there.

                                     NUKE
                         I'd like you to meet my father.

                                     ANNIE
                              (surprised)
                         Oh -- won't YOU come in?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ANNIE'S HOUSE

               AS THEY ENTER -- She leads them into the kitchen.

                                     NUKE'S FATHER
                         Ebby's told me a lot about you.

                                     ANNIE
                         Uh oh...
                              (beat)
                         Can I offer you some coffee?

               THE KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS -- NIGHT

               She puts a pot of water with a swirl of graciousness.

                                     NUKE'S FATHER
                         Yeah... Ebby tells me you're a very 
                         spiritual woman. He tells me you've 
                         taught him a lot about discipline 
                         and self-control.

               Annie and Nuke exchange glances. Nuke smiles.

                                     ANNIE
                         He's a good student.

                                     NUKE'S FATHER
                         We were worried that Ebby might get 
                         involved with the wrong crowd in 
                         professional baseball -- we're so 
                         pleased, he met a Christian woman.

                                     ANNIE
                         Praise the Lord, eh?

               The Piaf record begins skipping in the next room.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh my -- I better fix that. Ebby 
                         will you help me? I'm no good with 
                         mechanical things

               Nuke picks up his cue and follows her to:

               THE LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS -- NIGHT

               Annie fixes the record.

                                     NUKE
                         I couldn't dump my old man but maybe 
                         later I can sneak away from him...

                                     ANNIE
                         You don't have to...

                                     NUKE
                         I'm starting to understand what you're 
                         teaching me. I mean the panties and 
                         the nostrils and all that shit... I 
                         mean I'm getting it --

                                     ANNIE
                         So am I. Nuke, honey, we need to 
                         talk --

               Nuke gets very aggressive and playful, pinning her.

                                     NUKE
                         Aw hell, let's have a quickie right 
                         here --

                                     ANNIE
                         -- but you're father's in there!

                                     NUKE
                         Crash says I gotta quit worrying 
                         about him -- c'mon, honey, we got a 
                         lotta catching up to do --

               He pins her to the wall, she squirms away.

                                     ANNIE
                         Nuke -- we do need to talk!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BACK IN THE KITCHEN

               Nuke's father is studying pictures on Annie's wall.

               CLOSE ON A HELMUT NEWTON PHOTO -- A nude woman, two afghans, 
               and a toilet.

               CLOSE ON A PHOTO OF SWAMI PRABHAVANANDA YOGANDA

               CLOSE ON A POSTER OF A MARIJUANA LEAF with the inscription 
               "Better Living Through Mexican Agriculture".

               Nuke's father is a bit unsettled by all this, when:

               The phone rings.

               ANNIE SWEEPS BACK into the kitchen -- saved by the bell -- 
               to answer the phone. Nuke trails.

                                     ANNIE
                              (on phone)
                         Hello? Skip? Yeah, as a matter of 
                         fact, he is here.

               She hands the phone to Nuke.

                                     ANNIE
                         It's Skip, for you.

                                     NUKE (ON PHONE)
                         Yeah, Skip, it's me.
                              (several beats)
                         Jeez... Jeez... God... Jeez...

               Nuke hangs up the phone. Looks at Annie and his father.

                                     NUKE
                         I'm going to the Show.
                              (beat)
                         They're sending me up to finish out 
                         the season with the Big Club. I'm 
                         going to the Show!

               NUKE'S FATHER LEAPS TO HIS FEET and embraces his son.

                                     NUKE'S FATHER
                         Let's have a quick word of prayer, 
                         right here, to thank the Lord for 
                         all this --

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh let's not...

                                     NUKE
                         I gotta leave first thing in the 
                         morning.

                                     ANNIE
                         That's great!

                                     NUKE
                         How can I possibly thank you?

               He embraces her rather formally.

                                     ANNIE
                         Just pitch well and do good.

               Nuke hustles his father out of the house.

                                     NUKE
                         I will, I will -- C'mon, Dad, I'll 
                         dump you off. I gotta find Crash.

               As they exit, Nuke's father turns to Annie:

                                     NUKE'S FATHER
                         God bless you.

                                     ANNIE
                              (to herself)
                         She will, Mr. LaLoosh, she will...

               ANNIE SITS DOWN in a kitchen chair. An enormous sigh.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE DOWNTOWNER MOTEL -- NIGHT

               Nuke knocks on Crash's door. Nobody home. Tony is arriving 
               with his GROUPIE GIRLFRIEND to the next room.

                                     TONY
                         Crash ain't there. He never gets 
                         back till four or five --

                                     NUKE
                         Where does he go?

                                     TONY
                         Well, I'd rather not say.

                                     NUKE
                         They called me up to the Show and I 
                         wanta tell Crash goodbye.

               TONY COMES OVER AND GIVES NUKE a heartfelt "five".

                         Goddamn, that's great! Jesus!
                              (beat)
                         Listen, Crash don't like anybody to 
                         know it but --
                              (beat)
                         Most nights he goes down to, you 
                         know, down to Niggertown. To 
                         Sandy's... the whorehouse.

                                     NUKE
                         He goes to a whorehouse every night?

                                     TONY
                         Don't tell him I told you -- he'd 
                         break my neck.

               CLOSE ON NUKE -- Disturbed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE BLACK SECTION OF DURHAM -- NIGHT

               A CAB MOVES SLOWLY through a poor neighborhood. Stops at:

               AN OLD HOUSE -- Decades of ad hoc add-ons.

                                     BLACK CABBIE
                         That's Sandy's. Keep your extra cash 
                         In your shoes.

               NUKE GETS OUT and goes to the door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SANDY'S WHOREHOUSE -- NIGHT

               NUKE KNOCKS AT THE DOOR -- A small barred window opens.

               A face appears -- a TOUGH BLACK, SANDY, 50.

                                     SANDY
                         What'you want, kid?

                                     NUKE
                         I'm looking for somebody.

                                     SANDY
                         Who ain't?

                                     NUKE
                         Looking for Crash Davis.

                                     SANDY
                         Ain't here.

                                     NUKE
                         I'm Nuke LaLoosh. With the Bulls.

                                     SANDY
                              (studying him)
                         Your breaking ball's getting better 
                         but ya need a change up.

               The door opens. Nuke enters.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SANDY'S WHOREHOUSE -- NIGHT

               NUKE ENTERS TENTATIVELY -- Another world. Grim. Sleazy.

               The Doorman leads him down a hallway full of doors. A BLACK 
               PROSTITUTE enters a room with a HUGE REDNECK. As they go 
               down the hallway, and as they do:

               We begin hearing singing -- raucous, soulful, drunk.

               NUKE STOPS IN A DOORWAY -- Looks into the "waiting room".

               -- P.O.V.  SEVERAL HOOKERS in various stages of undress, sit 
               on couches and chairs. Bored, smoking, ancient. The ONE WHITE 
               HOOKER, a skinny 25 year old, accompanies on a guitar, 
               struggling to keep up. And a couple HOOKERS are hanging around 
               a piano that --

               CRASH IS PLAYING and singing. He doesn't look up. Crash is 
               dressed but barefoot. A cigarette dangles from his mouth as 
               he accompanies himself with decent cocktail lounge chords.

               Two Hookers at the piano hum along.

                                     CRASH
                              (singing and playing)
                         But when she does get weary -- Try a 
                         little tenderness...

               NUKE STEPS INTO THE ROOM -- All the Hookers rise in 
               anticipation of a new customer. Crash keeps playing, never 
               looking up.

                                     CRASH
                              (singing)
                         You know she's waiting, just 
                         anticipating, the things that she'll 
                         never possess...
                              (beat)
                         While she's there waiting -- Try a 
                         little tenderness...

               Nuke interrupts the instrumental passage:

                                     NUKE
                         Crash. I'm going to the Show.

               Crash Ignores him, keeps playing.

                                     NUKE
                         Club's expanding its roster to finish 
                         the season --

                                     CRASH
                         Shut up. I'm playing.
                              (singing last 8 bars)
                         Oh you won't regret it, young girls 
                         don't forget it, lost in their own 
                         wilderness...
                              (beat)
                         But it's all so easy -- Just try a 
                         little tenderness...

               As Crash plays on --

                                     NUKE
                         I'm going to the Show.

                                     CRASH
                         Then go.

               NUKE GRABS CRASH by the hair and jerks him to his feet. The 
               two men are face to face.

                                     NUKE
                         I'm trying to thank you.

                                     CRASH
                         Let go of me!

               NUKE LETS HIM GO and Crash staggers drunkenly against the 
               piano, regaining his balance as:

               SANDY RUSHES IN WITH A GUN to break it up.

                                     SANDY
                         He makin' trouble for you, Mr. Davis?

                                     CRASH
                         No, no, Sandy, put it down.
                              (drunkenly, to Nuke)
                         Nuke, you know Sandy Grimes? Hit 
                         .367 at Louisville in 155.

                                     SANDY
                         I hit .371.

                                     CRASH
                         He hit .371 -- C'mon, Nuke -- you 
                         and me, let's step outside and settle 
                         this.

                                     NUKE
                         Settle what?

                                     CRASH
                         C'mon!

                                     NUKE
                         I don't wanta fight you, I wanta 
                         thank you. Let's have a drink and 
                         forget this --

                                     CRASH
                         God damn it, you fucking virgin prick -- 
                         step outside.

               Crash drunkenly heads out the back door in his underwear.  
               Nuke reluctantly follows.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE ALLEY BEHIND THE WHOREHOUSE -- NIGHT

               Several of the Hookers follow to watch. Crash is drunk and 
               lost. Nuke in control.

                                     NUKE
                         C'mon, we got nothin' to fight about.

                                     CRASH
                         You fuck!

                                     NUKE
                         Why am I a fuck?

                                     CRASH
                         Why are you a fuck?
                              (beat)
                         'Cause you got talent. I got brains. 
                         But you got talent! You're God damn 
                         left arm is worth a million dollars 
                         a year.
                              (drunken insight)
                         All my limbs put together are worth 
                         7 cents a pound -- and that's for 
                         science and dog meat.

                                     NUKE
                         You're a great catcher.

                                     CRASH
                         Come over here into the light so I 
                         can kick your ass.

                                     NUKE
                         No.

                                     CRASH
                         Okay, I'll kick your ass there.

               Crash takes a step toward Nuke. Pulls up his bare feet 
               quickly, stepping on a sharp stone.

                                     CRASH
                         ...God damn... I forgot my fucking 
                         shoes. Honey, go get my shoes.

               One of the Hookers goes inside for his shoes.

                                     NUKE
                         I'll take you back to the hotel.

                                     CRASH
                              (drunken, mad)
                         You know what the difference is 
                         between hitting .250 and hitting 
                         .300? I got it figured out.
                              (beat)
                         Twenty-five hits a year in 500 at 
                         bats is 50 points. Okay? There's 6 
                         months in a season, that's about 25 
                         weeks -- you get one extra flare a 
                         week -- just one -- a gork, a ground 
                         ball with eyes, a dying quail -- 
                         just one more dying quail a week and 
                         you're in Yankee Stadium!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE WHOREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

               THE HOOKER FINDS CRASH'S SHOES -- Starts to bring them out 
               to him when... she notices cash in one of them. The Hooker 
               takes a few bills for herself, and continues out --

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BACK IN THE ALLEY -- Crash finishes his tirade as:

               THE HOOKER COMES OUT WITH CRASH'S SHOES

               He struggles drunkenly to put them on.

                                     NUKE
                         Forget it. You ain't worth thanking --

               NUKE STARTS TO WALK AWAY -- Crash fires his one free shoe at 
               Nuke hitting him in the back of the head.

               NUKE WHIRLS -- Comes after Crash.

                                     CRASH
                         Come on, Meat...

               CRASH SWINGS WILDLY -- Nuke ducks it and levels Crash with a 
               short right hand.

               CRASH CRASHES INTO SOME GARBAGE CANS -- Lies there on his 
               back for several beats. Nuke stares.

               CLOSE ON CRASH -- Blood trickles from his mouth.

                                     CRASH
                         Nuke... tell me something. Did you 
                         hit me with your right or your left?

                                     NUKE
                         My right.

               Silence. Crash's next line is both drunk and sober and we 
               don't know if he's just being clever or if, somehow, he's 
               staged It all. Maybe even he doesn't know.

                                     CRASH
                         Good. Good. That's terrific...

                                     NUKE
                         What?

                                     CRASH
                         If ya get in a fight with some 
                         asshole, never hit his with your 
                         pitching hand. Ya might get injured.
                              (smiles)
                         That's another lesson for ya -- now 
                         quit fucking around and help me up.

               CRASH REACHES UP A HAND FOR HELP -- Nuke stares back.

               AND FINALLY NUKE REACHES DOWN AND HELPS CRASH to his feet.

                                     NUKE
                         Ya look like shit.

               The two men head inside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DURHAM STADIUM -- NEXT MORNING -- EARLY

               NUKE'S PORSCHE -- The Clubhouse Boy drags Nuke's out to the 
               car and loads the trunk. Annie, Larry and a COUPLE KIDS AND 
               DOGS are watching.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE LOCKER ROOM -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY

               NUKE CLEANS OUT HIS LOCKER -- Filling his travel bag.

               Crash sits on a stool next to him. Sober.

                                     CRASH
                         Sorry about last night.

                                     NUKE
                         Forget it.

                                     CRASH
                         I have been known, on occasion, to 
                         howl at the moon. D'you understand 
                         that?

                                     NUKE
                         No.

                                     CRASH
                         You will.
                              (beat)
                         Look, Nuke -- these Big League hitters 
                         are gonna light you up like a pin 
                         ball machine for awhile -- don't 
                         worry about it. Be cocky and arrogant 
                         even when you're getting beat. That's 
                         the secret.
                              (beat)
                         You gotta play this game with fear 
                         and arrogance.

                                     NUKE
                         Fear and ignorance.

                                     CRASH
                              (raging)
                         No. Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, 
                         not ignorance!

                                     NUKE
                              (smiles calmly)
                         I know. I just like to see you get 
                         all worked up.

               Crash calms down. Sighs. Nuke nods and picks up his bags.

                                     NUKE
                              (knows it's not true)
                         Well, I got Annie all warmed up for 
                         ya...
                              (knows it is true)
                         She's just waiting for you to show 
                         up, y'know...

                                     CRASH
                         I don't need a crazy woman in my 
                         life.

                                     NUKE
                         Maybe you do.
                              (quick beat)
                         Y'know I'm starting to like this 
                         game -- baseball's a helluva good 
                         way to make a living.

               Crash speaks with quiet passion, from his soul.

                                     CRASH
                         It's the best, Nuke... the absolute 
                         fucking best.

                                     NUKE
                         Yeah, thanks for everything.

               They shake hands, and Nuke heads out the door.

                                     CRASH
                         Nuke --
                              (Nuke stops)
                         Good luck.

                                     NUKE
                         You too... Meat.

               Nuke smiles. A little arrogance and fear.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DURHAM STADIUM -- CONTINUOUS DAY

               NUKE TOSSES HIS BAG in the Porsche and motions to Annie.  
               They step away from the others.

                                     ANNIE
                         Well I guess this is it.

                                     NUKE
                              (smiles)
                         I won't be needing these anymore.

               NUKE PULLS ANNIE'S RED PANTIES from his jacket pocket.

               The frilly, silk lace is tattered. The panties have been 
               through the mill. She accepts them graciously.

                                     ANNIE
                         Neither will I.

                                     NUKE
                         I think I'm ready for the Show.

                                     ANNIE
                         Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh -- don't 
                         think too much.

                                     NUKE
                         Don't worry.

               They look at each other awkwardly, sweetly, and:

               NUKE KISSES ANNIE GENTLY ON THE LIPS -- They hesitate, and 
               Nuke heads for his Porsche.

               CRASH ARRIVES IN THE DOORWAY to watch. Nuke bids farewell to 
               his father and climbs into his car.

                                     NUKE
                         I gotta go now, Dad.

                                     FATHER
                         I was thinking I could fly up and 
                         spend a week in the Big Leagues with 
                         you -- help you get comfortable.

                                     NUKE
                         No. If I screw up, I wanta do it 
                         alone. I'll call.

                                     FATHER
                         We'll be praying for you.

                                     NUKE
                         Dad -- if my curveball is hanging, 
                         God ain't gonna help me.

                                     FATHER
                         We'll pray anyway.

                                     NUKE
                              (kindly)
                         If it makes you and mom feel better, 
                         go for it. I gotta run --

               They shake hands, and:

               CRASH'S P.O.V. -- NUKE ROARS AWAY in his Porsche, leaving a 
               trail of dust in the Stadium parking lot.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. DURHAM STADIUM -- DUSK

               MILLIE AND JIMMY'S WEDDING -- A formal wedding on the 
               pitcher's mound. Millie in white. Jimmy in his uniform. Skip 
               is the best man, also in uniform, and several players and 
               groupies are the attendants, Annie as the Bride's Maid.

               Organ music plays the wedding march.

               JIMMY LIFTS MILLIE'S VEIL and kisses her. The stands are 
               full of fans.

               JIMMY LEADS MILLIE DOWN THE "AISLE" towards home plate.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. DURHAM STADIUM -- GAME IN PROGRESS -- NIGHT

               CLOSE ON SCOREBOARD -- Ninth inning. Durham is leading by a 
               score of 1 to 0. Two outs.

               JIMMY IS PITCHING -- He delivers. The batter rockets a line 
               drive up the alley. A PENINSULA RUNNER races from first, 
               rounding third, trying to score. A relay.

               CRASH WAITS AT THE PLATE -- Here comes the runner. Here comes 
               the throw. A close play. A terrible collision.

               Crash goes rolling. The umpire waits -- and in a cloud of 
               dust, Crash holds up the ball.

               THE CROWD ROARS -- Jimmy jumps victoriously in the air.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE LOCKER ROOM -- NIGHT

               The air of victory. The mood is up and goofy. Beer cans are 
               squirted at Jimmy, the groom.

                                     JIMMY
                         I wanta thank everybody and the Lord 
                         for the victory, it's a wonderful 
                         way to celebrate my marriage -- and 
                         I guess we're all back on a winning 
                         streak, he? A few raucous "Fuckin 
                         A's" from the team.

                                     TONY
                         Hey, Jimmy -- we chipped in and kind 
                         got a little gift for ya of a special 
                         wedding cake from the Durham Bulls.

               DEKE CARRIES OUT AN WEDDING CAKE -- It's X-Rated. The 
               decorative Bride and Groom are fucking. Jimmy's embarrassed 
               but it's all good natured.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CRASH COMING OUT OF THE SHOWER -- Toweling off, watching the 
               innocent, vulgar fun. He sits down in front of his locker, 
               drying his hair, when the CLUBHOUSE BOY approaches:

                                     CLUBHOUSE BOY
                         Hey, Crash -- Skip wants to see ya.

               CRASH RISES AND HEADS FOR SKIP'S CUBICLE -- Wearing only a 
               towel and his shower shoes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INSIDE SKIP'S OFFICE -- Skip and Larry sit in postgame 
               routine, checking charts, smoking, half dressed.

               CRASH ENTERS as he's still drying off.

                                     CRASH
                         Yeah, Skip, you wanted to see me?

                                     SKIP
                         Crash, shut the door.

               And it hits him. Crash looks at Skip, who looks down at the 
               floor, unwilling to face Crash who then looks at Larry, who 
               also looks away nervously.

               CRASH SHUTS THE DOOR -- The party rages beyond.

                                     SKIP
                              (heartfelt)
                         This is the toughest job a manager 
                         has...

               CLOSE ON CRASH -- He's been in the game too long to be 
               surprised; nonetheless, he's surprised. And hurt. His stoicism 
               is professional.

                                     SKIP
                         The organization wants to make a 
                         change... now that Nuke's gone they 
                         wanta bring up some young catcher...

                                     LARRY
                         Some kid hittin' .300 in Lynchburg... 
                         probably a bust.

                                     SKIP
                         I put in a word for you with the 
                         organization -- told 'em I thought 
                         you'd make a fine minor league manager 
                         someday... Might be an opening at 
                         Salem next year --

               EXTREME CLOSE UP ON CRASH -- His eyes are moist.

                                     SKIP
                         Helluva year, Crash -- you know how 
                         it is.

               Silence.

               Crash stands there nearly nude. He just nods slightly. Without 
               rancor or bitterness, he turns and re-enters the raucous 
               locker room.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STREETS OF DURHAM -- NIGHT

               CRASH WALKS THE STREETS ALONE -- Crash stops in front of a 
               window and takes his batting stroke, studying the reflection.

               AND HE KEEPS WALKING INTO:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT/INT. CHEAP BAR IN DOWNTOWN DURHAM -- NIGHT

               CRASH DRINKING ALONE at the end of a bar.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STREETS OF DURHAM -- NIGHT

               CRASH WANDERS ALONG into the residential neighborhoods.

               HE STARTS ACROSS A QUIET INTERSECTION Stops. Looks at the 
               street signs. He CHANGES DIRECTION, walks on.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ANNIE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

               The windows glow. After midnight.

               CRASH STARES AT THE HOUSE -- Hesitates, then walks up the 
               porch stairs. Knocks at the door. Moments later:

               ANNIE OPENS THE DOOR -- She looks beautiful. Almost as if 
               she was expecting him. At first, silence. Then:

                                     CRASH
                         I got released.

                                     ANNIE
                         I heard already.

               SHE OPENS THE DOOR -- Crash enters Annie's house.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ANNIE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

               ANNIE PUTS ON her favorite Piaf record.

               ANNIE POURS A DRINK for both of them.

               CRASH PUTS A HAND ON HER HIP -- Annie closes her eyes, a 
               tiny gasp. He kisses her forehead. She kisses his neck. A 
               tiny smile from Crash. The same from Annie.

               SHE KISSES HIM on the corner of his mouth. Her hand finds 
               the back of his head and she runs her fingers through his 
               hair.

               CRASH RESPONDS -- They kiss slowly, deeply.  As --

               HIS HAND ON HER HIP PULLS UP HER SKIRT -- By degrees, the 
               skirt is raised up her stocking covered leg. At last exposing 
               the beloved BLACK GARTER SNAPS -- Crash's hand expertly holds 
               up the skirt and effortlessly UNSNAPS THE GARTER with a 
               minimum of effort.

               FLICK, FLICK, FLICK -- The garter snaps are free.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh my...

               THE BEDROOM -- Crash carries Annie to the bed.

               ANNIE'S FOOT KICKS OVER A LAMP onto the floor.

               ANNIE'S BLOUSE FRONT -- Flick, flick, flick. Crash unbuttons 
               it with one hand in seconds. Even Annie is startled with the 
               speed and ease of Crash's hand.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               HIS HAND SLIDES UP UNDER HER panties.

               A FULL EMBRACE ON THE EDGE OF THE BED -- Remnants of clothes 
               cover parts of their bodies.  They tumble out of control to 
               the floor.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               ANNIE'S HAND GRABS ONTO A DRESSER LEG -- A carved oak antique, 
               her hand holds on tight and shakes the dresser.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               THE DRESSER TOP SHAKES -- Makeup bottles and pictures and 
               dozens of Annie's special things rattle and fall

               ANNIE'S READ RESTS ON CRASH'S STOMACH -- Post coital, they 
               lie on the floor blissfully as Piaf finishes.

               THE KITCHEN -- ANNIE AND CRASH eat an after mid after sex 
               snack. Crash eats a bowl of Wheaties. They each wear one of 
               her robes.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               Annie sits, munching a carrot and rolling a joint of marijuana 
               she keeps in a Victorian jewel box.

                         ...so you see in a former lifetime 
                         I'm sure that I was Alexandria, the 
                         Czarette of Russia? What do you think?

                                     CRASH
                         How come in former lifetimes, 
                         everybody was someone famous?
                              (beat)
                         How come nobody ever says they were

                         It doesn't work like that.
                              (stares at him)
                         God, you're gorgeous. Want to dance?

               THEY KISS AGAIN -- And fall gradually onto the table top.

               ANNIE SITS ON TOP OF CRASH lying on the kitchen table.

               He stretches out a leg and:

               KICKS THE BOWL OF CEREAL to the floor. It smashes -- ceramics, 
               milk, cereal go everywhere. As:

               THEY START MAKING LOVE AGAIN in the glaring kitchen light.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               CRASH AND ANNIE DANCE in her living room.

               THE BEDROOM -- Crash is handcuffed to the bed. He seems 
               perfectly happy as Annie reads Walt Whitman.

                         ...wrist and wrist joints, hand,

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               CRASH AT ANNIE'S RECORD COLLECTION -- He thumbs through it 
               quickly, puts on a new record.

               The Dominoes sing "Sixty Minute Man".  And...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               THE BATHROOM -- Candlelight around the bathtub. All we can 
               make out is two heads, two bodies, sloshing wildly In the 
               dim glow. Water splashes, dowses some candles.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               CRASH AND ANNIE IN BED READING -- Each with a copy of a Thomas 
               Pynchon novel. Crash tosses it aside. And disappears under 
               the sheets, playing with her as she struggles to keep reading.  
               She puts down the book.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               ANNIE APPLYING EYE MAKEUP TO CRASH -- Who doesn't resist, 
               seems even amused. He kisses her deeply, slowly. She kisses 
               him back. They fall onto the bed.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               P.O.V.  OUT THE KITCHEN WINDOW -- Dawn. A bird chirps.

               And we hear a record skipping, repeating endlessly.

               PAN ACROSS THE KITCHEN -- Overturned chairs, spilled and 
               broken cereal bowls, liquor bottles.

               PAN ACROSS THE BEDROOM -- A disaster. Clothes scattered across 
               the floor, overturned lamps, the bed lies at a cockeyed angle.  
               Annie and Crash lie face down -- asleep, utterly spent.

               CRASH WAKES UP SLOWLY -- Reaches up and pulls his underwear 
               off of a lampshade, pulls them on, and gets slowly out of 
               bed. He staggers across the bedroom floor, stumbling a bit, 
               into:

               THE LIVING ROOM -- He stumbles across the trashed room.  
               Record album covers, more liquor bottles, pillows, cushions, 
               pictures hanging crookedly on the wall.

               CRASH TAKES THE SKIPPING RECORD off the player and breathes 
               a sigh of relief. He sees his pants lying on the floor and 
               pulls them on.

               CRASH OPENS A DRAWER -- Pulls out a piece of paper and a 
               pencil. He starts writing...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. THE BEDROOM -- LATER

               Sun streams in. Annie opens her eyes. Rubs them. Reaches 
               over for Crash. Her hand hits a note. She whirls. He's gone. 
               Only a note.

               SHE SITS UP WITH A START and reads the note.

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         Crash said he had to get an early 
                         start to drive to Asheville in the 
                         South Atlantic League where he heard 
                         they might need a catcher to finish 
                         out the season...

               ZOOM IN EXTREME CLOSE UP OF NOTE -- "Love, Crash".

               INT. ANNIE'S KITCHEN -- DAY

               ANNIE SCRUBBING HER KITCHEN FLOOR -- Down on her hands and 
               knees, picking up the broken cereal bowl.

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         The house smelled like sex for days. 
                         It was wonderful. The only real 
                         cleaning I did was on the kitchen 
                         floor 'cause who likes to walk on 
                         spilt cereal?

               SHE FINDS A BIT OF A JOINT on the floor as she's cleaning.  
               She picks it up, sits on the floor under the table, and lights 
               the tiny joint.

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         The funny thing is, I stopped worrying 
                         about Nuke. Somehow I knew nothing 
                         would stop him. Crash was right --
                         Nuke had a gift.

               NUKE IN STREET CLOTHES IN THE DUGOUT of an empty stadium. 
               50,000 seats. Slick. Awesome. He's being interviewed by a 
               BIG LEAGUE REPORTER, who has a small tape deck and has stuck 
               mike in Nuke's face.

                                     NUKE
                              (like a big leaguer)
                         Y'know, I'm just happy to be here 
                         and hope I can help the ballclub. I 
                         just want to give it my best shot 
                         and good Lord willing, things'll 
                         work out... gotta play 'em one day 
                         at a time, Y'know...

               THE BIG LEAGUE REPORTER nods attentively as Nuke knowingly 
               delivers the clichés like a veteran.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               In sharpest contrast to the Big League stadium, a rickety 
               old wooden grandstand, carved into the pine covered hillside.

               CRASH STEPS TO THE PLATE -- In a uniform we've never seen 
               him in, of course. The Asheville Tourists. He picks up some 
               dirt, rubs it on his hands. He's as intense as ever. Still 
               playing for keeps.

                                     CRASH

               fastball right down the pipe.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM -- AFTERNOON

               ANNIE LIES IN BED READING -- She suddenly jerks up.

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         I was reading in bed when Crash hit 
                         his 247th home run. I knew the moment 
                         it happened...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ASHEVILLE STADIUM -- DAY

               CRASH UNLOADS A MONSTROUS HOME RUN deep into the trees. He 
               stands at home plate watching it... like Reggie or the Babe.

               And doesn't move. For several seconds he indulges himself 
               uncharacteristically -- until...

               THE OPPOSING CATCHER SHOVES HIM toward first.

                                     CATCHER
                         Get your ass in gear...

               CRASH SMILES and takes the home run trot slowly. As he heads 
               toward first, HE RAISES A CLINCHED FIST for a brief moment, 
               a tiny gesture of triumph. And then, routinely, he just 
               circles the bases.

               A HUNDRED FANS APPLAUD ROUTINELY as he circles the bases.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ANNIE'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

               SHE LIGHTS A CANDLE for the home run. Above the candles, 
               displayed in the shrine, are her RED PANTIES.

                         I lit a candle for Crash's dinger... 
                         and tried to root the Durham Bulls 
                         home to a pennant.

               the stadium. Umbrellas go up all around, as:

               THE RAINS COME -- The players huddle-in the dugouts.

               IN THE DUGOUT Skip and Larry reading copies of "The Tantric 
               Yoga of Sex". And spitting tobacco.

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         The Kid from Lynchburg wasn't good 
                         enough to hold Crash's jockstrap if 
                         ya ask me, and Nuke's replacement 
                         had a fastball that I coulda hit
                              (beat)
                         We had a three game lead with two 
                         weeks to go when the rains came.

               THE GROUND CREW DRAGS TARPS over the mound and the plate.

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         It rained and rained and I thought 
                         of driving down to Asheville to see 
                         Crash but then I thought "No, what 
                         you pursue, eludes you". I had to 
                         trust Quantum Physics and the Church 
                         of Baseball.
                              (beat)
                         It ain't always easy being this 
                         religious...

               ANNIE AND JACKSON POP OPEN THEIR UMBRELLAS and walk out of 
               the ballpark towards home.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DURHAM NEIGHBORHOOD -- DAY

               ANNIE AND JACKSON UNDER UMBRELLAS -- He turns down one street, 
               she heads toward home.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ANNIE'S HOUSE -- DAY

               AS SHE APPROACHES -- She stops. Looks up. Crash's beat up 
               car in the driveway.

               P.O.V.  CRASH SITTING ON THE PORCH SWING Still raining.

               CLOSE ON ANNIE -- She hesitates, and smiles.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh my...

               ANNIE SITS DOWN on the porch owing next to Crash.

                                     ANNIE
                         What happened?

                                     CRASH
                         I quit. Hit my dinger and hung 'em 
                         up.

               A moment of silence over the significance of him quitting.

                                     ANNIE
                         I'm quitting too. Boys, not baseball.

                                     CRASH
                         There might be an opening for a 
                         manager at Salem next spring.

                                     ANNIE
                         Salem, Massachusetts? Where all the 
                         witches were?

                                     CRASH
                         Yeah... you a witch?

                                     ANNIE
                         Not yet. It takes years of practice...

               He smiles slightly and takes her hand.

                                     CRASH
                         You think I could make it to the 
                         Show as a manager?

                                     ANNIE
                         You'd be great, just great...
                              (rattling quickly)
                         'Cause you understand non-linear 
                         thinking even though it seems like 
                         baseball is a linear game 'cause of 
                         the lines and the box scores an'  
                         all -- but the fact is that there's 
                         a spacious-"non-time kind of time" 
                         to it...

                                     CRASH
                              (interrupting)
                         Annie --

                                     ANNIE
                         What?

                                     CRASH
                         I got a lotta time to hear your 
                         theories and I wanta hear every damn 
                         one of 'em... but right now I'm tired 
                         and I don't wanta think about baseball 
                         and I don't wanta think about Quantum 
                         Physics... I don't wanta think about 
                         nothing...
                              (beat)
                         I just wanta be.

                                     ANNIE
                         I can do that, too.

               He rises, takes her hand, and they head inside.

               And as the rains fall on Durham...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ANNIE'S HOUSE -- DAY

               THE SHRINE GLOWS -- Candles everywhere. Rain pours down on 
               the windows outside. And...

               ANNIE AND CRASH SIT ON THE COUCH together, in silence.

                                     ANNIE
                         Walt Whitman once said -- "I see 
                         great things in baseball. It's our 
                         game -- the American game
                              (beat)
                         He said "it will repair our losses 
                         and be a blessing to us"...
                              (beat)
                         You could look it up....

               The music -- Dave Frishberg sings "Van Lingle Mungo".

          TITLE SEQUENCE OVER MUSIC
          A series of tight CLOSE-UP shots of dancers moving in high
          energy fast paced sexy choreography. Very provocative. Legs.
          Arms. Butts. Boas. Sequins. Costumes. High heels. A
          kaleidoscope of images and colors.

          END TITLES ON A BLACK SCREEN
          FADE IN sounds of PEOPLE TALKING -- GLASSES CLINKING -- all
          the BACKGROUND SOUNDS of a BUSY, HIP NIGHTCLUB. SUDDENLY.. .a
          loud DRUM ROLL.
          CAMERA is low, moving through BACKSTAGE, passing CURTAINS and
          the WINGS, flying out onto a shiny black STAGE awash in
          light. PUSH IN on FOOTLIGHTS which are now blinding us,
          blasting into camera as they form the word...

                         BURLESQUE
          DRUM ROLL ends with a CYMBAL CRASH. The SCREEN goes BLACK.
          Then we hear an opening MUSIC "INTRO", a bawdy QUARTET.
          EXTREME CLOSE UP: RED LUSCIOUS LIPS... speaking directly into
          CAMERA in a smoky, sultry voice.

                         TESS
          Once upon a time ...a long, looong
          time ago... there was a good little
          girl...and they called her...
          REVEAL ...TESS. A stunner with impossibly long lashes,
          theatrical make-up and a sequined, skin-tight band-aid of a
          dress. She works the tight stage of the club, toying with
          the AUDIENCE.

                         TESS (CONT'D)
          Burlesque.
          MUSIC BLARES from a HOT YOUNG BUMPER BAND -- sax, drums, bass
          -- wearing bowler hats, suspenders and lots of ink. The
          crowd HOOTS. Lame streamers EXPLODE from the stage.

                         TESS (CONT'D)
          Some say she up and died-of
          neglect. Abandonment.

                         (WHISPER)
          .old age.
          The club's red booths are about half-full with a hip crowd.
          Walls cluttered with photos. Celebrities tucked in shadows.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.

                         TESS (CONT'D)
          But I say...no matter how hard you
          try, you can't keep a good girl
          down. And I've got a bevy of 'em.

          INT. BACKSTAGE DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          A DOZEN gorgeous, leggy GIRLS fight for the mirror. Miles of
          skin. Heavy make-up. Lashes. Boobs. Butts. Fishnets.
          Boas. And SEQUINS. Oceans of them. It's definitely
          decadent. Completely cabaret.

          TESS (O.S.)
          Come to think of it, none of them
          are all that good, which isn't all
          that bad...
          SEAN (31), a cute gay guy with an armful of accessories
          pushes his way through the girls and in a blur, tightens a
          corset, tosses a boa, adjusts a garter just so.

          TESS (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Eight shows a week. Sixteen
          gorgeous girls. Thirty-two towers
          of luscious legs...

          BACK ON TESS --
          Behind her, our GIRLS slink onto the stage one by one.

                         TESS (CONT'D)
          Say hello to Scarlett. Jesse.
          Anna. Coco-puff. And Georgie-Girl.
          The girls gather at the edge of the stage, lit by footlights,
          moving in place to the beat of the INTRO MUSIC. Hips sway.
          Fingers snap. Tess weaves playfully between them.

                         TESS (CONT'D)
          All of them the creme-de la creme.

                         (CYMBAL CRASH)
          De la creme.
          The girls strike nasty, (but funny) provocative poses, etc...

                         TESS (CONT'D)
          Each one a bastion of bodacious...
          (Coco bends over, peers
          between her legs)
          Elegance.
          TWO GIRLS upside down on chairs NAIL aerial splits.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         TESS (CONT'D)
          Not to mention their other...
          (smacks Coco on the ass)
          Ass-ets.
          Coco raises a brow, moves her butt to a LOUD BUMP-AND-GRIND.

                         TESS (CONT'D)
          Welcome to the Burlesque Lounge,
          dead smack in the center of the
          Sunset Strip-- did I say "strip?"
          (cat calls from audience)
          I meant TEASE...
          FOOTLIGHTS FLARE, UPLIGHTING THE GIRLS. They shift their
          weight, hitting the beats with risque moves and hip-thrusts
          as they MOVE DOWNSTAGE suggestively toward the audience to
          the MUSIC...

          EXT. MAIN STREET, GRUNDY, IOWA - NIGHT

          A small, grime-streaked steel town, hanging on by the skin of
          its teeth. Boarded-up storefronts, a run-down A&P. CAMERA
          MOVES past an old sign: WELCOME TO GRUNDY!!! and lands on
          a broken neon sign that reads "DWIG 'S BAR" It flickers so
          you can read the name: DWIGHT'S. Then goes back to DWIG.

          INT. DWIGHT'S BAR - SAME

          Chipped paint. Old beer posters. A few pathetic customers.
          Beer on tap. Pinball standing lonely in the corner.
          A REGULAR drains his beer, tosses down a quarter and starts
          to leave. Someone stops short at the table.

                         ALI
          Uh, excuse me? You forgot
          something.
          He turns. Sees:
          ALI ROSE. One hand holding a bar rag, the other planted on
          her hip. Ali has a look that's all her own: short shorts,
          white platform sandals, hair piled up high, more make-up than
          the rest of Grundy's women combined. She's young -- 22 --
          but has a confidence that's got nothing to do with age.

                         REGULAR
          No, that's your tip.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

                         ALI
          Huh. See, now that's interesting --
          you and I must do math completely
          differently, cause me? I start with
          the six beers I brought you, add
          the four spills I cleaned up, the
          five times I refilled your peanuts,
          plus the three times you
          "accidentally" touched my ass, then
          I tack on lying to your wife when
          she called looking for you, twice,
          and I come up with a sum that's a
          hell of a lot more than twenty-five
          cents.
          Before the Regular can respond, Ali is joined by LORETTA --
          30's wearing every one of those years hard.

                         LORETTA
          She's just teasing, Ike. You go on
          home now, and tell Kay I said hi.
          The Regular leaves. Loretta picks up the quarter.

                         LORETTA (CONT'D)
          It's better than nothing.

                         ALI
          Nothin's cheap. A quarter's an
          insult.

                         LORETTA
          It'll cover half a load down at the
          Spanky Clean.

                         ALI
          There's only one thing a quarter is
          good for.
          Ali takes the quarter and heads to the back of the room,
          passing a GEEZER who's sitting by himself, drinking alone.

                         LORETTA
          Oh no, hon, now you know how Dwight
          feels about that.

                         ALI
          Dwight isn't here.
          Ali stops in front of the rinky-dink karaoke machine.

                         LORETTA
          He could come back any minute.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

                         ALI
          Tough. I'm not working here for the
          tips Loretta.
          She pops the quarter into the machine and chooses a song.
          She picks up the microphone and, after a few opening beats,
          starts singing ETTA JAMES'S "SOMETHING'S GOT A HOLD ON ME".

                         ALI (CONT'D)

          OOOOOOOOOH, SOMETIMES I GET A GOOD

          FEELING, Y-E-A-H
          And now we see where the confidence comes from. She's got a
          voice that's way too big for this town-- the kind that
          reaches way down inside you and rattles things loose.
          WE HEAR the same song continue as we INTERCUT with:

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - ON STAGE - NIGHT

          The Girls undulate at the footlights as they sing the chorus:

                         BURLESQUE GIRLS

          YEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAHHHHHH...

                         WE INTERCUT:
          IN DWIGHT'S BAR, Ali is belting now. Loretta is torn between
          enjoying listening and watching the door for Dwight.

                         ALI

          I GET A FEELING THAT I NEVER,

          NEVER, NEVER HAD BEFORE, NO, NO ...
          ON THE BURLESQUE STAGE the Girls belt out a raucous chorus.

                         BURLESQUE GIRLS

          YEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAHHHHHH...
          As other ENTERTAINERS appear onstage:

                         TESS
          The insatiable La Puccini Triplets!
          Death-defying daredevils Missy and
          Kitten DeVille! The Countess of
          contortion, Eva Destruction! And
          how about a little love for those
          bad boys of burlesque, our naughty-
          bawdy bumber band!
          THE TATTOOED BAND blares as the troupe kicks in unison

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.
          IN DWIGHT'S BAR, Ali sings, with a powerful vocal quality
          reminiscent of Etta James, Sarah Vaughn, Billy Holiday.

                         ALI

          I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU RIGHT NOW,

          THAT, OOOH ...
          ON THE BURLESQUE STAGE, the GIRLS and the BAND, loud and
          bawdy.

                         BURLESQUE GIRLS

          OOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHH!!
          IN DWIGHT'S BAR, Ali, letting loose now. Wailing.

                         ALI

          I BELIEVE, I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT

          SOMETHING'S GOT A HOLD ON ME,

          YEAH.
          ON THE BURLESQUE STAGE, the BURLESQUE GIRLS move in a line
          toward the audience, confident, sexy. The BARTENDERS,
          WAITRESSES and people working at the club sing along.

                         ALL

          OH ... IT MUST BE LOVE!

                         BARTENDERS

          BA-DA, BA-DA, BA-DA:
          IN DWIGHT'S BAR, Ali, letting it rip. The Geezer sips his
          beer, unmoved.

                         ALI

          I'VE GOT A FEELING, I FEEL SO

          STRANGE. EVERYTHING ABOUT ME SEEMS

          TO HAVE CHANGED, STEP BY STEP, I

          GOT A BRAND NEW WALK, EVEN SOUND

          SWEETER WHEN I TALK. I SAID, OH.
          ON THE BURLESQUE STAGE, The Girls.

                         BURLESQUE GIRLS

          OOOOH.
          IN DWIGHT'S BAR, Ali.

                         ALI

          OOOH. HEY BABY, IT MUST BE LOVE!
          ON THE BURLESQUE STAGE, The Girls form a line.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.

                         BURLESQUE GIRLS

          YOU KNOW IT MUST BE LOVE.
          IN DWIGHT'S BAR, Ali sings.

                         ALI

          YOU KNOW IT WALK LIKE LOVE. IT TALK

          LIKE LOVE. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

          NIGHT, MAKE ME FEEL ALRIGHT:
          IN THE BURLESQUE LOUNGE, The Girls, Tess, the other
          Entertainers, Busboys, Waitresses, Bartenders and entire
          company do a BIG FINISH.

                         ALL

          BA-DA, BA-DA, BA-DA, BA-DA!
          IN DWIGHT'S BAR, Ali finishes the song. Loretta CLAPS. The
          Geezer, unimpressed, gets up and leaves.

                         LORETTA
          People around here wouldn't know
          talent if it bit 'em in the
          Danglies. Where you gotta go is Des
          Moines. They got karaoke bars
          where you can win a hundred bucks a
          night.

                         ALI
          Loretta-- when I get out of this
          butt-hole of a town, I sure as shit
          won't be heading for Des Moines.
          She hops up onto the bar, spins around on her butt, one leg
          up in the air like a Varga girl, then hops down on the other
          side then gets back to work.

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

          The audience is still applauding as the Performers crowd into
          the backstage area, squeezing past the Puccini Triplets
          preparing their act.
          Tess comes off stage and bumrushes Sean.

                         TESS
          Where the hell is Nikki?

                         SEAN
          Rehab, if there's a God.
          The BACKSTAGE DOOR BURSTS OPEN revealing--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.

                         NIKKI
          I heard that.
          Nikki, a stunning, feisty brunette, sashays in--

                         TESS
          Jesus, Nikki, you're later than
          Georgia's period! Where were you?

                         NIKKI
          Weave, wax, paws and claws.
          She drops her bag, quickly peels her clothes off, holds out
          her arms as Sean slips her corset onto her--
          Tess eyes Nikki's body--

                         TESS
          Hold it right there. Weigh in.
          Nikki unwillingly steps on the scale. Tess shakes her head.

                         TESS (CONT'D)
          Put on five pounds or I bump you.
          Nikki protests as Sean double-takes at Georgia -- who FLITS
          BY with a slightly protruding belly.

          EXT. TRAILER PARK - IOWA - NIGHT

          Ali winds her way through the trailers, carrying a bag of
          take-out, with a swing in her step -- moving to music playing
          in her head. She reaches a double-wide, lets herself in.

                         ALI
          Nanna? Got your pot roast here!

          INT. ALI'S TRAILER - NIGHT

          TV noise. She comes in, kicks off her heels.

                         ALI
          They were out of steak fries, so I
          got you some of those...
          Then she stops in her tracks. Nanna -- 80's, housecoat,
          oxygen tank -- is slumped in her chair. The TV remote is on
          the floor. "ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT" is blaring.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          Nanna?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

          EXT. CEMETERY - IOWA - DAY

           Loretta and Ali, at the grave with a MINISTER who looks to be
          about 17. A CEMETERY WORKER is nearby, picking his teeth
          with a toothpick.

                         YOUNG MINISTER
          Dear Lord, we gather here today not
          to mourn, but to celebrate the life
          of Alison Rose.

                         ALI
          Arlene.

                         YOUNG MINISTER
          What?

                         ALI
          She's Arlene. I'm Alison.

                         YOUNG MINISTER
          Oh, shit.
          (then, befuddled)
          Can I start over?
          Ali rolls her eyes.

          LATER,
          The Minister and the Cemetery worker walk away, leaving Ali
          and Loretta alone.

                         LORETTA
          You were real good to her, Ali.

                         ALI
          No, she was good to me.
          She rearranges the flowers resting on the plot, fixing it up.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          And she wasn't even my real Nanna.

                         LORETTA
          What...?

                         ALI
          Foster care. She took me in for the
          checks. When I turned eighteen, the
          money stopped coming. She could've
          kicked me out, but she didn't.

                         (BEAT)

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          She had a lot of pain at the end.
          Nothing she talked about, but I
          could tell.

                         LORETTA
          Well, then I guess this is a
          blessing. Now she's free.
          ON ALI, thinking realizing:

                         ALI
           (talking about herself)
          Yeah. I guess she is.

          INT. ALI'S TRAILER - DAY

          Nanna's clothes - mostly flowered housedresses -- are folded
          in paper bags. Her belongings are stacked up in the corner.
          CLOSE ON ALI'S MATTRESS, as she pulls a WAD OF CASH out from
          under it.

          HEAR MUSIC OVER: "HONEY ROCK."

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - ON STAGE - NIGHT

           Nikki leads a GROUP OF GIRLS in a raucous routine to "HONEY
          ROCK". Very Moulin Rouge.

                         BURLESQUE GIRLS

                         HONEY:::
          In the wings, Tess watches with Sean.

                         TESS
          Girls look good tonight.

                         SEAN
          Amazing what a pink spotlight can
          do. Hides more cellulite than a
          burka.

                         BURLESQUE GIRLS

          GO, HONEY, GO!..'

          INT. ALI'S TRAILER - DAY

           MOVE IN ON ALI, as she counts the money. Shit. Not enough.
          Then she looks around the trailer and realizes - tough shit.
          Stuffs the money in a pocket, then pulls out a suitcase.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - ON STAGE - NIGHT

          The Burlesque Girls tease the crowd.

                         BURLESQUE GIRLS

          GO, HONEY, GO!..'

          INT. ALI'S TRAILER - DAY

          THE SUITCASE, as Ali throws in her belongings. When it's
          full, she grabs a stack of records -- Jazz and Soul -- tries
          to fit them into the suitcase, but it won't close. She picks
          one: ETTA JAMES. She sticks it in the suitcase and zips it
          up.

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT


                         BURLESQUE GIRLS

          OH, HONEY!

          INT. ALI'S TRAILER - DAY

          Ali reaches into a drawer, pulls out a FRAMED PHOTO of A
          YOUNG WOMAN, 20's, short dress, heavy make-up, holding hands
          with a 7-year-old girl. Ali slips it into the suitcase
          pocket. She takes one last look around the trailer.

          BURLESQUE GIRLS (O.S.)

          GO, HONEY, GO!..'

          EXT. GRUNDY MAIN STRIP - DAY

           CLOSE ON ALI'S WHITE PLATFORMS, strutting down the street.

          INT. DWIGHT'S BAR - DAY - MUSIC FADES OUT

          Ali enters. DWIGHT is at the bar: 50's, beer gut, humorless.

                         DWIGHT
          You're three days late.

                         ALI
          I had a death in the family.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.

                         DWIGHT
          And what, people stop drinking
          cause your grandma died? Get your
          apron and get to work.

                         ALI
          I'm not here to work. I'm leaving.

                         LORETTA
          You are?

                         ALI
          Yeah.

                         (TO DWIGHT)
          I just came for my back pay.

                         DWIGHT
          Payday's the end of the month.

                         ALI
          But, I won't be here then. And you
          owe me for three weeks.

                         DWIGHT
          I don't owe anyone anything till
          the end of the month.
          Ali sets down her suitcase and marches over to him.

                         ALI
          You know what, Dwight? Contrary to
          what you've been told, there's no
          law in Grundy that says you have to
          spend every waking minute being a
          tight-fisted, cheap-ass prick --

                         LORETTA
          (trying to intercede)
          Ooh, hon, I'm not sure that
          particular approach is gonna --

                         ALI
          I've spent three years of my life

                         HERE--

                         DWIGHT
          --And you'll probably spend another
          three. You want to quit? Good
          riddance. I'll replace you before
          you hit the county line, but I sure
          ain't gonna pay for the privilege.
          He walks out the back door, slamming it behind him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.
          ANGLE ON: THE CASH REGISTER. Ali opens the drawer, pulls out
          a wad of cash. Peering out back to make sure Dwight isn't
          coming in, Ali counts out some money.

                         LORETTA
          What are you doing?

                         ALI
          I'm only taking what he owes me.

                         (THEN)
          How much was that bike you been
          wanting for little Keith?
          Ali STUFFS a few TWENTIES into Loretta's apron-- pockets the
          rest.

                         LORETTA
          Ali-- where are you gonna go?

                         ALI
          Somewhere I can breathe. Now gimme
          a hug, I gotta get out of here
          before he gets back.
          Loretta hugs her tight, then looks Ali in the eye, concerned.

                         LORETTA
          You can't just head off into the
          sunset without a plan.

                         ALI

                         (RESOLUTE)
          Watch me.
          Ali gives her one more hug, then grabs her bag and leaves.

          MUSIC BACK UP: "HONEY ROCK"

          EXT. DOWNTOWN GRUNDY - DAY - CARRY MUSIC

          Ali takes off down the street. She passes TWO OLDER WOMEN
          waiting for a bus. A beat as they watch her pass. Then:

                         OLDER WOMAN
          She'll be back.
          As Ali heads off, we HEAR:

                         BURLESQUE GIRLS

          GO, HONEY, GO!..'

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.

          INT. GREYHOUND BUS STATION - GRUNDY, IOWA - DAY

          Ali is at the ticket counter.

                         ALI
          How much to Los Angeles?

          TICKET BOOTH GUY
          One way or round-trip?

                         ALI
          You're kidding, right?

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - ON STAGE - NIGHT - CARRY MUSIC

          Cabaret chairs as they DROP FROM THE CEILING. The girls
          CATCH them, SPIN them around, SLAM them down and LAND ON THEM

          IN VARIOUS LAYOUTS.
          IN THE WINGS, Tess hands Sean her corset as she slips into a
          slinky dress. He takes her cigarette holder and grips it
          between his teeth as he zips her in.

                         SEAN
          They're loving you tonight.

                         TESS
          They're loving you.

                         SEAN
          Oh, shucks, I just tell myself I'm
          writing for a big old drag queen.

                         TESS
          Eat me.
          As he heads off with her discarded costume:

                         SEAN
          A big old foul-mouthed drag queen!
          Tess looks in a mirror. As she makes the necessary
          adjustments, VINCE SCALI appears. 35, scruffy-handsome.

                         VINCE
          Good show tonight.
          She glances up, sees him. Gets icy. Goes back to primping.

                         VINCE (CONT'D)
          Too bad the club's half-empty.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         TESS
          Half-full.

                         VINCE
          I got another call from Marcus
          Gerber.

                         TESS
          And you told him we weren't
          selling.

                         VINCE
          He wants to raise his offer. I
          told him we'd hear him out.
          Tess spins around, looking him in the eye for the first time.

                         TESS
          Vince, I don't care what the number
          is; the only way Marcus Gerber will
          get this club from me is by prying
          it out of my cold, dead, heavily-
          jeweled fingers.
          She pivots away and sweeps into the club.

                         BURLESQUE GIRLS

          OH, HONEY!!.
          Big finish, the number on stage ends.

          INT. GREYHOUND BUS - NIGHT

           Ali's on the bus, in a seat by herself. A LITTLE GIRL in
          front of her is peering over the chair, watching Ali. Ali
          smiles at her. The Little Girl's mother notices, gets the
          girl to sit down by tickling her.
          Ali unzips the pocket on her suitcase, takes out the FRAMED
          PHOTO of the mom and girl, looks at it. Then she looks out
          the window and watches America fly by as DAY TURNS TO NIGHT.

          EXT. CITY FREEWAY - DAY - THE BUS - SPEEDING BY

          Over which we HEAR someone channel surfing radio static--

          INT. BUS - SAME

          Ali sits with her radio headset, searching stations as...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

                         RADIO
          102.7 KIIS FM. Broadcasting from
          Hollywood and Vine...
          Ali perks up-- looks out the window as the bus rounds a bend
          and... THE HOLLYWOOD SIGN comes into view. NEW MUSIC UP:

          EXT. STREET - HOLLYWOOD BLVD. DAY - CARRY MUSIC

          The rush of tourists and traffic. Through a sea of people
          moving down the crowded sidewalk we FIND ALI as she emerges
          through the crowd, carrying her bags. Looking around at this
          exciting city. She SPOTS a SHITTY HOTEL with a sign: "$49.00
          a night." She looks up at it. Then heads across the street--

          INT. ALI'S HOLLYWOOD HOTEL ROOM - DAY

          Cramped, dingy carpet, chipped paint. Key in the door. The
          MIDDLE-EASTERN HOTEL MANAGER -- 40's -- leads Ali in,
          pointing out the features of the room, speaking fast in an
          impossibly thick Kurdish accent. Ali nods along, not
          understanding a word. When he stops:

                         ALI
          Okay!

                         (THEN)
          Well. Good luck with that.
          He drops her suitcase on the bed and stands there. Waiting.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          Oh, hang on.
          She digs into her purse. All she has is twenties. She peels
          one off and holds it out.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          If I could just get a little --
          But before she can finish, he pockets it, nods and leaves,
          closing the door behind him. To the closed door:

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          -- change.
          She pulls open the blinds, they fall off the wall with a
          CRASH! Ali stares at them. Then she opens the window. The
          SOUNDS OF HOLLYWOOD pour in.
          She digs out her cash, sticks it under the mattress. Then
          she reconsiders.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.
          She removes the money, takes a Ziploc bag full of make-up
          from her purse, dumps the make-up onto the bed, seals the
          money up in the Ziploc, and takes it into:
          THE BATHROOM. She lifts the lid of the back toilet tank and
          slips the Ziploc of cash under it, catching the bag in the
          lid as she sets it back down, so it won't fall in.
          She goes back into the main room to find a CALICO CAT sitting
          on the window sill. It MEOWS, hops into the room.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          Hey. I thought this was a single.
          The cat curls up next to her. She checks his junk.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          Typical. First guy I meet is
          neutered.

                         (THEN)
          You don't happen to know anyone in
          the music business, do you?

          CLOSE ON "BACKSTAGE WEST" MAGAZINE,
          Ali sips coffee from a paper cup as she reads TRADES and WANT
          ADS spread over the floor. She refills the lid of the cup,
          which the cat laps up.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          Singer/Actress... Singer/Songwriter
          .Singer/Scuba diver? Perfect.
          ON ANOTHER AD: It says: "SINGER/WAITRESS WANTED." MUSIC UP:

          EXT. THEME RESTAURANT - DAY

          Ali cruises toward the address, dressed in her Iowa best,
          full of confidence. She rounds a corner and sees:

          A LONG LINE OF 165 GORGEOUS, IMPECCABLY GROOMED GIRLS.
          Ali stops in her tracks. Tougher competition than she was
          expecting. She heads for the back of the line, passing girls
          doing vocal warm-ups. One girl is belting out a riveting
          "SOMEWHERE OVER THE RAINBOW". Just as Ali gets in line, the
          door opens and a SKINNY GUY sticks his head out.

                         SKINNY GUY
          Sorry, ladies, that's all the
          applications we're taking today.

          Ali circles the ad, sips coffee. Looks at the cat.

                         ALI
          I can dance.

          INT. SEEDY NIGHTCLUB - AFTERNOON

          Ali breezes in-- SEES ...a bunch of stripper poles, seedy
          drunk guys in the audience. She PIVOTS, and walks right back
          out. As she leaves, a DRUNK GUY turns to A SEEDY GUY.

                         DRUNK GUY
          She'll be back.

          CLOSE ON: A FLYER, BEING SNATCHED OFF A BULLETIN BOARD:

          Ali enters, full of energy, as 65 hot LATINA and AFRICAN-
          AMERICAN girls in butt-baring, hootchie, hip-hop garb, turn
          in unison and eye her, in her denim shorts and white
          platforms. Not her crowd.

          CLOSE ON: A PEN CIRCLES: "SINGER/DANCERS WANTED FOR TOUR."

          Ali, eyeing the ad, sips a cup of coffee. Looks at the cat.

           EXT. EDGE DANCE STUDIO - DAY

           Ali, dressed like the girls at the video audition: hootchie,
          street -- opens the door to find 30 CLASSICAL BUN-TOPPED
           BALLERINAS stretching, warming up. A Degas painting. They
          turn in unison and eye her. Again, not her crowd.

          EXT. THE CAPITOL RECORDS BUILDING - HOLLYWOOD - DAY

          Gleaming in the California sunshine. Ali stares up at the
          glittering shrine to recording. Takes in the whole swirling,
          crazy scene around her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.

          EXT. SUNSET STRIP - NIGHT

          Ali wanders down the sidewalk chugging an iced latte. The
          Strip hums with SLICK NIGHT LIFE. Expensive cars pull up to
          valets. Hipsters swish past velvet ropes. Ali moves through
          the throngs, alone, anonymous, invisible.
          She passes a CONSTRUCTION SITE for a 15-STORY-TALL BUILDING,
          all lit up, guys working at night. A BUS pulls out, spewing
          exhaust. As the smoke clears, Ali sees, across the street:
          A BEAUTIFUL, STATUESQUE GIRL standing on the landing of a
          fire escape under a street lamp beside a NONDESCRIPT CLUB.
          Ali catches glimpses of her as the Sunset traffic whizzes by:
          full make-up, spangled burlesque costume, impossibly high
          heels, awesome. This is Coco. Coco makes the dirty
          streetlight look like a movie-quality Kleig. Everything about
          her shimmers.
          Intrigued, Ali looks for a break in the traffic and crosses
          the street. As she nears the club, she hears a MAN'S VOICE:

                         ALEXIS
          Like I said, LOOK BUT DON'T TOUCH!
          ALEXIS, drag queen/door whore, also in full costume and make-
          up, TOSSES a GUY out the front door onto the street, then
          heads back inside--
          Ali smiles to herself. Then turns back to look at COCO who
          disappears inside a BACK DOOR as...NIKKI walks out. Lights a
          ciggie. She has on full make-up. Lacquered lips. Lashes like
          peacock feathers. She sees Ali staring.

                         NIKKI
          Didn't your Mama tell you it's not
          polite to stare?

                         ALI
          Sorry, you're just -- so DAMN
          beautiful.

                         NIKKI

                         (WARMING)
          In that case, screw your Mama,
          stare away.
          Nikki strikes a pose, campy, showing Ali her best side. They
          both laugh.

                         AL I
          No one would ever guess.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.

                         NIKKI
          What?

                         ALI
          That you're a dude.
          Nikki's face turns to stone. Her eyes widen in horror. Ali
          sees the mistake she made. She's mortified.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          Oh, shit.

                         NIKKI
          "Shit's" right, you little half-wit

                         TWAT--
          Nikki is about to unleash when the stage door opens.

                         SEAN
          Bitch! You're on!
          Sean grabs her and drags her inside. As he does, a STRAND OF
          CRYSTAL BEADS comes off her costume, falls to the ground.

                         ALI
          I'm really sor--
          The stage door slams shut. Ali picks up the strand of beads.
          Holds them up in the light, watching them shimmer.
          She goes to the front of club, where a smattering of L.A.
          HIPSTERS enter. There's a GLASS DISPLAY CASE full of photos
          of the acts. Ali looks at the pictures of the Girls in their
          elaborate costumes and provocative poses.
          She's unintentionally made her way to the front door. Black
          curtains obscure her view inside. She peers in. HEARS cool
          music emanating. The sounds of a nightclub. Intriguing. She
          ventures inside...

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT

          Ali MOVES down a DIMLY LIT HALLWAY. More beautiful photos of
          women in elaborate costumes, drawings, sketches, paintings
          clutter the walls. Ali follows the photos down the hallway.
          MUFFLED SOUNDS penetrate the darkness: people talking over
          each other, glasses clinking. 1930's Berlin style music.

                         ALEXIS

          I.D.?
          Alexis sits on a stool, glaring down at her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.

                         ALI
          What is this place? A strip club?

                         ALEXIS
          Strip club? Honey, I ought to wash
          your mouth out with Jaegermeister.
          The only pole you'll find in here
          is Natasha the shot girl.
          Ali looks back at the photos.

                         ALEXIS (CONT'D)

                         (IMPATIENT)
          Babycakes, shit or get off the
          throne, I got a club to fill here.
          Ali digs her ID out, hands it over. Alexis scans it --

                         ALEXIS (CONT'D)
          Twenty bucks.
          Ali looks in her wallet. Sees one lone twenty inside. She
          hands it to Alexis. He nods for her to go ahead. Ali
          descends a staircase INTO THE CLUB...
          .and is BOMBARDED by: colors, chaos, laughter, scandal --
          all shimmering, as if someone dunked the place in glitter.
          And over it all, an incredible mash-up of old music with a
          contemporary beat tying it all together.
          Ali ENTERS, rounds a pillar, staring out into the room as a
          SPOTLIGHT finds the stage where half a dozen OSTRICH FANS

                         PART REVEALING--

                         TESS
          Smoother than honey and twice as
          sweet. Each girl lovelier then the
          next. Gentlemen, hold onto your
          hats. Ladies, hold on to your
          gentlemen. We may not have
          windows.. .but we DO have the best
          view on the Sunset Strip!
          MUSIC KICKS IN AS LIGHTS FLARE from the back of the stage,
          where Three Girls stand, backs to the audience, Fosse-style.
          Coco, Georgia, and Nikki strut downstage. Behind them, Girls
          MOVE AND DANCE on cabaret chairs. Totally raunchy, completely
          timeless.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.
          The girls hit the beats, turning upside-down on cabaret
          chairs, arched backs, legs reaching upward, bending over,
          asses to the audience, bodies writhing in air-tight
          choreography: thrusting hips, whipping heads, stomping feet.
          Ali watches, exhilarated, as the music builds and SWELLS to a
          full on performance with the entire ensemble--

                         JACK
          Get you a drink?
          She turns. A bartender is watching her watch. JACK - 25,
          punky, dark hair, eyeliner, one arm half-sleeved with tats.

                         ALI
          Only if you're buying.

                         JACK
          (slides her a beer)
          Welcome to L.A.

                         ALI

                         (DISAPPOINTED)
          Is it that obvious?

                         JACK
          You still have that new-car smell.

                         ALI
          Not brand new. But still under
          warranty.

                         JACK
          Where you from?
          She looks back at the stage, mesmerized.

                         ALI
          Iowa.

                         JACK
          Oh, yeah? Kentucky. We're
          practically related.

                         ALI
          I thought you looked familiar.
          He smiles. As Ali sips her free beer, Jack stacks drinks on a
          tray for a DITSY WAITRESS. He slides the tray to her. She
          doesn't notice. He barks at her:

                         JACK
          Hey_. Go.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.
          The Waitress picks up the tray -- almost spilling the drinks -
          - then heads off. Ali looks around the place-- wowed...

                         ALI

                         (TO HERSELF)
          Damn...

                         JACK
          They don't build 'em like this in
          Iowa, huh?

                         ALI
          Hell no. I wouldn't have left.
          She stares up at the stage, marvels at the dancers.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          So tell me -- who does a girl flirt
          with to get from here...
          (points to the stage)
          to there?

                         JACK
          Is this you flirting?

                         ALI
          With someone wearing more eyeliner
          than me?
          He laughs. Points across the club to A DOOR leading
          backstage.

                         JACK
          Ask for Tess. She's your guy. Flirt
          away.
          As she heads off--

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Hey, Iowa-- use my name.
          He hands her a card. She looks at it:

                         ALI
          Thanks, Jack.
           She smiles, slips it in her cleavage and heads for the door.

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

          Ali enters into a frenzy. Legs, costumes, boobs, heels,
          eyeliners -- all flying around like a flock of birds.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.
          In the middle of the maelstrom sits Tess, at a mirror,
          quietly applying lipstick.

                         ALI
          Excuse me. I'm looking for Tess.

                         TESS
          (glued to the mirror)
          So am I. And sometimes, when the
          lights are dim, and I squint my
          eyes ...I can still see her.
          She switches to mascara. Sean, arms heavy with corsets,
          catches eyes with Ali, nods toward Tess: "that's her." Ali
          steps closer to Tess.

                         ALI
          Hi. I'm a friend of Jack's, and I'm-

                         TESS
          New in town.

                         ALI
          Yes, and I'm--

                         TESS
          Looking for a job.

                         ALI
          Yes, and I--

                         TESS
          Want to perform here.

                         ALI
          Yes.
          Tess glances at Ali in the mirror. Then goes back to her
          mascara, unimpressed. Silence.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          I'm a singer. A good one.

                         TESS
          This is a dance show.

                         ALI
          I can dance.

                         TESS
          (a quick glance)
          Really? You a professional?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.

                         ALI
          I'm a quick study.

                         TESS
          Not on my dime.
          Tess stands, a final check in the mirror. Ali sees her chance

                         SLIPPING AWAY--

                         ALI
          Okay, I get that you're busy so I
          won't waste any more of your time--
          but this place-- I've just never
          seen anything like it before and I
          know I belong here. So, how can I
          be a part of it?

                         TESS
          Twenty bucks at the door can make
          all your dreams come true.
          Tess strides out, not looking back. Ali sees the Girls
          trading glances, amused. She turns and leaves.

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT

          The Bumper Band plays as Ali makes her way back toward the
          bar, dejected. Across the room, the Ditzy Waitress, holding
          an empty tray, flirts with a table of YOUNG HIPSTER GUYS.
          Ali sees ANOTHER TABLE OF CHIC CLUBSTERS trying to get the
          waitress's attention. The Waitress ignores them.
          Ali sees the trays on the end of the bar. She grabs one, goes
          to the TABLE OF CLUBSTERS, clears their empties, takes their
          order. She finds Jack at the bar, unloads the empties.

                         ALI
          One Dewar's neat, one shot of
          Patron, and get this, tough-guy in
          the hat? He wants a Cosmo.
          Jack looks at her, surprised. Impressed.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          One night. If I'm not 20 times
          better than boobs-for-brains over
          there, you don't have to pay me.

          MUSIC UP: WAGON WHEEL WATUSI

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

          ON ALI'S WHITE PLATFORM SANDALS,
          weaving their way through the tables. WIDEN to see she now
          wears a Burlesque Lounge Cocktail Waitress get-up. She
          delivers a heavy tray to a table.
          She heads back to the bar with empties, eyes glued to the
          stage, where Coco and the GIRLS are dancing to "Wagon Wheel
          Watusi." As Ali hits the bar, Coco nails a stunning kick.

                         ALI
          Her leg went behind her head!

                         JACK
          Yeah, Coco's the real deal.

                         ALI
          I want to do that.

                         JACK
          She used to dance with the Joffrey
          Ballet. Nikki sang opera. Eva
          performed with Cirque. Everyone
          here's a pro.
          (slides a tray of drinks)
          And you're on!

          BACKSTAGE,
          Nikki, lined up with the other girls, peers between the
          curtains, spots Ali serving the drinks to a table.

                         NIKKI
          What's she doing here?!

                         (POINTS)
          I want that bitch out. Now.

                         SEAN
          What'd she do to you?

                         NIKKI
          She thought I was a drag queen!
          Stifled giggles from the girls.

                         SEAN
          Can't be the first time THAT'S
          happened.
          Nikki is about to haul off on Sean when the CURTAIN OPENS,
          and WHOOMP!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.
          she turns, flashing her best stage smile as she joins Coco
          and the Girls onstage in the sexy, high-energy Fosse-style
          "Wagon Wheel Watusi."
          From the floor, Ali serves drinks, takes care of customers,
          all the while watching the spectacle on stage, mesmerized.

          INT. ALI'S HOLLYWOOD HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          The door opens. Ali enters, exhausted, but on Cloud 9,
          singing "TOUGH LOVER" to herself.

                         ALI
          When he kisses me I get a thrill...
          The Cat MEOWS and slinks out from behind the bed. Ali pulls
          the crystal beads out of her pocket

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          And when he does that wiggle I
          can't keep still
          (ties the beads around the

                         CAT'S NECK)
          Cause he's a tough lover.. .

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - ON STAGE - NIGHT

          "Prince Nez" by Squirell Nut Zippers plays as Eva
          Destruction, dressed as a naughty-sexy ballerina, does a
          bawdy -- and technically flawless -- ballet number on a
          cabaret chair, on pointe.
          ON THE FLOOR, Ali delivers a tray of drinks to a table of
          MUSIC-INDUSTRY GUYS. One of them drops a bill on her tray.

                         ALI
          Thanks.
          She heads back to the bar. As Jack loads her tray up, she
          stuffs her tips into her pocket-- SEES Sean, looking her up
          and down.

                         SEAN
          Okay, girl, time for Sean to give
          you a real tip.
          He ties her shirt up higher, undoes the top few buttons...

                         SEAN (CONT'D)
          You got lips that could suck the
          chrome off a Peterbilt, but that
          matte is about as sexy as a bedpan.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.
          As Sean wipes off Ali's lipstick, then whips out a tube of
          lip gloss and paints away, Jack and Ali share a smirk. Sean
          steps back, assesses his work. Pleased.

                         SEAN (CONT'D)
          Now baby, go show 'em what you got.
          He heads off. While Eva performs onstage, Ali delivers the
          drinks to a table of SCENESTERS as Eva winds up her act in a
          flurry of fierce ballet moves, finishing to APPLAUSE as...
          Ali notices someone waving her over. MARCUS GERBER. 31,
          boyishly handsome in jeans and a ringer tee. Gold Rolex,
          status sneakers. Charming. Charismatic.
          When Ali gets to him:

                         MARCUS
          Dewar's on the rocks for me.
          Bottle of Dom for the table and--
          (tosses a black AmEx on
          her tray, noticing her)
          --And tell Nikki I'm here.
          Ali starts away, then--

                         ALI
          And you are?

                         MARCUS
          (nods toward the card)
          A member since 1991.
          Oh-kay. He smiles, wickedly handsome. Ali pivots and heads
          back to the bar. Before she can tell Jack the order:

                         JACK
          Dewar's rocks, bottle of Dom, keep
          it coming.

                         ALI
          So Asshole's a regular?

                         JACK
          Marcus Gerber. Real estate guy.

                         ALI
          He's with Nikki?

                         JACK
          This week.
          Vince goes over to Marcus's table, shakes hands, joins him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.

                         ALI
          Who's that with him?

                         JACK
          Technically your boss: Vince Scali.
          Tess's partner. And ex...
          Jack is about to lift the AmEx off the tray, when Sean swoops
          by and intercepts it.

                         SEAN
          A black AmEx! The backstage pass to
          life!
          He sees Coco walking by, swipes the AmEx in her cleavage.
          She shudders, then turns around and tips her ass up at him.
          He swipes the card again.

                         COCO
          Access denied!

                         SEAN
          Now there's a first!
          Jack sees Ali laughing at their banter. She heads off with
          the tray of Dewar's and Dom as the "Prince Nez" number ends.

                         ON STAGE
          LIGHTS UP on TESS, CENTER STAGE as she begins a new number,
          "Long John Blues." A singing/spoken hilarious interlude. The
          Girls back her up.

                         TESS

          I GOT A DENTIST, HE'S OVER SEVEN FEET TALL.

          HIS NAME IS DR. LONG JOHN,

          AND HE ANSWERS EVERY CALL.

          I WENT TO LONG JOHN'S OFFICE,

          I SAID, "DOCTOR, THE PAIN IS KILLIN' ME."

          HE SAID, DON'T WORRY BABY,

          IT'S JUST YOUR CAVITY, NEEDS A LITTLE FILLIN'.. .
          As she continues...
          ON THE FLOOR, Nikki is sitting in Marcus's lap, nibbling his
          neck. Vince sits down beside Marcus. Marcus pats Nikki on the
          butt, excusing her. As she heads off:

                         VINCE
          She's on the verge.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

                         MARCUS
          That's what you said last time.

                         VINCE
          She has no choice. We owe a balloon
          payment of 100 grand on the first,
          she took out a second to buy me out
          of the condo. And she just got
          turned down for another loan today.

                         MARCUS
          There's a handful of these clubs
          around town, I could buy one of
          them tomorrow.

                         VINCE
          But it wouldn't be in the heart of
          the Sunset Strip.

          ON STAGE TESS AND THE GIRLS TOYING WITH THE AUDIENCE...

                         TESS

          .HE TOOK OUT HIS TRUSTY DRILL,

          TOLD ME TO OPEN WIDE.

          HE SAID HE WOULDN'T HURT ME,

          THEN HE FILLED MY HOLE INSIDE.

          LONG JOHN, DON ' T YOU EVER GO AWAY.

          CAUSE YOU THRILL ME WHEN YOU DRILL ME,

          AND I DON'T NEED NO NOVOCAINE TODAY.

          HE SAID IF IT EVER STARTS A'THROBBIN',

          COME BACK AND SEE OL' LONG JOHN,

          AGAIN, AND AGAIN, AND AGAIN AND AGAIN:1:
          A RIM-SHOT and BLAST from the band as the audience laughs.
          From the stage, Tess notices Vince shake Marcus's hand and
          leave. A flicker of irritation-- nothing anyone in the
          audience would notice -- but it's there.

          AT THE BAR,
          Ali brings a tray of empties over. Sean is there.

                         ALI
          She's funny.

                         SEAN
          Thanks. My lines. Our secret.
          Jack gives Sean his drink. He walks off. MUSIC UP: An
          insanely cool version of Sly and Family Stone "Everybody Is A
          Star" mashed up with a Fosse-esque Burlesque rap.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.
          Jack notices Ali watching the stage... she lights up and
          melts, enraptured by the girls as they vamp to choreography
          in a tight group.

                         BURLESQUE GIRLS

          (WHISPER RAP A'LA FOSSE)...
          Song CONTINUES over a SERIES OF SHOTS:
          IN ALI'S HOTEL ROOM, Ali plops down a bunch of BOOKS, OPENS
          The Golden Age of Burlesque", lays on her bed, petting her
          cat with her foot. She locks in on a photo of 20's-era
          Burlesque dancers over which we HEAR--

          - pokes her way through the scruffy street folks that hang
          out by her hotel.

          The cat watches her, yawns and slinks away.

          different costumes in a BUSBY BERKELEY cluster, AS CAMERA
          BOOMS DOWN ON THEM and they separate to reveal:
          ALI, center stage, belting UP AT CAMERA:

                         ALI

          EVERYBODY IS A STAR::::

          SLAM CUT TO --
          FIND Ali, in her waitress outfit, watching the girls on
          stage, lost in her fantasy. She catches herself, then moves
          along serving drinks while the Girls work the stage.
          The Burlesque Girls continue their Burlesque Rap. When the
          girls thrust out their hips in unison, Ali does too,
          unconsciously dancing along with them.
          AT THE BAR, Jack notices. Watches. Tries to focus on pouring
          drinks, but his eyes keep drifting to Ali's hips.
          NEARBY, Sean notices Jack noticing. Looks from Jack to Ali.
          Eyebrow goes up. Interesting.

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

          Backstage mayhem. Girls scurry, Sean fusses, Tess sits at the
          mirror, applying a fake eyelash as WE HEAR a surprisingly
          good woman's voice BELTING a SONG! It's Nikki. Late again.

                         TESS
          Nikki, do you even own a watch? Or
          do you measure time in Patron
          shots?
          Ali enters with a tray of drinks. Nikki swipes one.

                         ALI
          Hey, no, that's for --
          Nikki opens a bottle, pops 3 pills in her mouth, washes them
          down with the drink, and sets the empty glass on Ali's tray.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          You, I guess.
           Nikki turns to the mirror and starts getting to work. As Ali
          hands out the other drinks:

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          Tess? Do you have a second?
          Tess doesn't answer. But a slight glance at Ali in the
          mirror shows she's half-listening.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          I was thinking -- see, I grew up
          listening to all this music, I'd
          play the records over and over --

                         TESS
          Fast-forward, babe. I gotta rebuild
          Rome in the next two minutes--

                         (CALLING OUT)

          --SOMEONE TALK TO DAVE ABOUT THE

          VOCALS ON THE NEW TRACKS!!!

                         ALI
          Now see-- that's what I've been
          thinking about. There's one thing I
          don't get.

                         TESS
          Just one?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

                         ALI
          It's the vocals. You have the
          girls lip-synching. which is fine,
          I guess, but wouldn't it be so much
          better if they actually sang?
          The Girls trade looks, knowing Ali's overstepping here. Ali
          doesn't feel the vibe-shift, surges ahead.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          I've been reading up on it, and
          back when burlesque started, that's
          what they did.
          Silence. Nobody moves. All eyes on Tess.

                         SEAN
          Oh, no she didn't?
          Tess slowly spins around in her chair to face Ali. Peers at
          her with a supercilious gaze.

                         TESS
          "When burlesque started"? Which
          was...when?

                         ALI
          (searching her memory)
          Oh. Well... this book said it came
          after...

                         TESS
          Vaudeville -- is the word you're
          looking for. Derived from the 15th-
          century French expression "voix de
          ville" -- "voice of the city".
          Popular songs of the time that were
          strung together into stage shows.
          Which, over time, gave birth to
          another kind of show in which
          talented girls showing a bit more
          skin danced, did skits, and, _ yes,
          sang. In addition to being
          raunchier, these shows were
          funnier, hence the new name.
          "Burlesque": "comical" in French.
          Ali sees the Girls enjoying this dressing-down immensely.
          Tess stands, peers down her nose at Ali.

                         TESS (CONT'D)
          Dance major. Juilliard. I did my
          thesis on Burlesque.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.

                         ALI
          Oh. Ok. It's just-- It's just
          that ...I CAN sing and--

                         TESS
          We can all sing. But they don't
          come to hear us sing. They come to
          see the best dancers in town backed
          by the greatest singers in history.
          (then, condescending)
          But tell you what: when you find
          someone with better pipes than
          Sarah Vaughn, Billie Holiday and
          Etta James-- you let me know.
          She sashays out leaving Ali standing there with what's left
          of her dignity and an empty cocktail tray. The Girls launch
          back into prepping for the show.

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Ali pushes in, pissed off, and hears the sound of PUKING.
          She sees Georgia's BOOTS sticking out from under the stall.

                         ALI
          Georgia? You okay in there?
          A FLUSH. The stall door opens. Georgia comes out shakily
          with mascara-smudged eyes, sweet as ever.

                         GEORGIA
          I don't know why they call it
          morning sickness when it hits at
          every freakin hour of the day.
          She rinses her mouth out at the sink.

                         ALI
          There aren't many women who could
          dance the Charleston on a chair at -
          - what are you, three months?
          Georgia turns sideways to the mirror, inspecting her bump.

                         GEORGIA
          Four. Can you believe my boyfriend
          hasn't noticed yet?

                         ALI
          You haven't told him?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

                         GEORGIA
          I guess as long as he doesn't know,
          I can still imagine he'll be happy
          about it.
          (looks in the mirror)
          Oh my God, look what the cat
          dragged in.
          She gets to work wiping away her smudged mascara.

                         ALI
          You look pretty hot to me.
          Georgia reaches into her corset, yanks one breast skyward,
          then does the same to the other.

                         GEORGIA
          Yeah, well -- you take what Mother
          Nature gave you and milk the hell
          out of it, right?
          Coco enters carrying a glass of tonic for Georgia.

                         GEORGIA (CONT'D)
          Thanks, Coco.

                         COCO

                         (TO ALI)
          Shouldn't you be on the floor?

                         ALI
          I had to pee. Is that okay with
          you?

                         COCO
          Not when you're blocking my mirror
          it's not.
          Ali sees she's in the way. As she steps aside:

                         COCO (CONT'D)
          (re. the music)
          That's us. You okay, or are you
          gonna puke on me during the number?

                         GEORGIA
          I can't make any promises.
          Coco drags her out, leaving Ali alone. Ali looks at herself
          in the mirror. Reaches into her shirt and does the boob-hoist
          that Georgia did. Looks again. Better.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

          INT. ALI'S HOLLYWOOD HOTEL BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Ali trudges up the stairs, tired. Suddenly, TWO YOUNG THUGS
          barrel down the stairs, past her, almost knocking her over.

                         ALI
          Hey!
          They tear past her. She shakes her head, reaches her
          landing, heads down the hall toward her room, then sees:
          HER HOTEL ROOM DOOR, ajar. The lock broken.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          No. No!
          She runs down the hall.

          INT. ALI'S HOLLYWOOD HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          Ransacked. Ali rushes in, goes straight into:

          INT. ALI'S HOLLYWOOD ROOM - BATHROOM - NIGHT

          The lid is off the toilet tank. Her Ziploc of money is gone.

                         ALI
          No!!! God damn it!!!
          She looks out the window, SEES the ROBBERS running off,
          disappearing down the street. She kicks the trash can. It
          flies across the room.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          Damn it! Damn it, damn it, damn
          it, damn it, damn it!
          She sees the cat watching her from behind the bed.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          A lotta help you were.
          The cat creeps out, slinks around her legs. Ali plunks on
          the bed.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          Shit.
          Then she sees, on the floor, the PHOTO she took from Nanna's.
          She picks it up. The glass has cracked, tearing the picture.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.
          She takes the picture out of the broken frame, smooths it out
          -- then looks around her trashed room. Fighting despair.

          EXT. WEST HOLLYWOOD STREET - NIGHT

          FOLLOW a motorcycle up the street. The DRIVER has a KEYBOARD
          on his back. He parks, gets off, takes off his helmet. It's
          Jack. He heads for his apartment, but slows when he sees:
          ALI, sitting on his steps, her bags at her feet. Head low.

                         JACK
          Ali? What's wrong? You okay?
          She tries to speak, but can't -- so she just nods.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Really? Cause, in my experience--
          when you're on someone's doorstep
          surrounded by everything you own,
          there's usually a not-so-good story

                         THAT--

                         ALI

                         I-- WAS--
          And as she expected, as soon as she talks, she starts to cry.

                         ALI (CONT'D)

          --RO-0-0-0-OBBED.

                         JACK
          Shit. No way!

                         ALI
          (halting, gaspy sobs)
          Came in -- busted the lock-- and
          stole all my MO-NEY-EY-EY-EY!!!
          She sobs--trying to talk, with high-pitched SQUEAKS only
          heard by birds. Jack winces, trying to follow--

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          (more gaspy sobs)
          And there's no way I-- sleep there--
          with-- like that-- the manager said-
          - not till Monday-- and I don't--
          anyone else-- but then-- so I
          remembered I had...but it went
          straight to...so I...
          She reaches in her pocket, pulls out a card. It's Jack's that
          he gave her in the club. It has his address on it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.

                         JACK
          Okay. I have no idea what you just
          said, but come on in here and we'll
          get it sorted out.
          She looks at him. Wiping her tears. He picks up the heaviest
          of her bags and leads her to:

          INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Tiny one-bedroom. Very "done." Floral sofa. Curtains that
          match the area rug. Candle groupings.

                          JACK
           Have a seat. I'll get us BOTH a
           drink. Here --
          He hands her his phone. She looks at it.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          -- call whoever you want, long-
          distance, whatever--

                         ALI
          I can't.

                         JACK
          Sure you can. Go ahead.
          Her chin starts quivering all over again.

                         ALI
          I.. .don't ...have anyone.

                         JACK
          What do you mean?

                         ALI
          To call.

                         JACK
          No parents?
          (she shakes her head)
          Siblings? Aunts? Uncles?

                         (NO AGAIN)
          Friends?

                         ALI

                         (THROUGH TEARS)
          No one! No one, okay? Do I have
          to spell it out for you? I am --
          completely -- alone!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.
          Jack susses out the situation.

                         JACK

                         (REALIZING)
          So...you're not here to use my
          phone.
          She starts to cry again.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Okay. Wait. No, stop, stop, stop,
          it's okay, it's fine. You'll crash
          here. No problem. Just, please --
          no more crying.
          She nods. He grabs a bottle of Tequila and a couple of
          glasses. Pours them a couple. They both take a drink.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Better?
          She nods.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Okay. Good.
          She wipes her eyes.

                         ALI
          Just for one night, I swear. Just
          till it's light outside and I can
          figure out my next move.

                         JACK
          Deal.
          Then she opens her small bag and the cat strolls out.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Whoa, whoa, you didn't say anything
          about a cat.

                         ALI
          What? You don't like cats?
          It slinks around his leg. He shakes it off.

                         JACK
          I hate cats.

                         ALI
          How can you hate a cat?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

                         JACK
          It's easy, I'll show you.
          The cat bolts into the bedroom.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Where's it going? If that thing
          pees on my bed --

                         ALI
          He goes outside. We just have to
          open a window. He's very
          independent.
          She opens the window. The cat scurries back in, leaps onto
          the ledge. Ali pets him. Looks at Jack, smiles.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          I don't have a name for him yet.
          It purrs. Jack eyes it warily.

                         JACK
          One night?

                         ALI
          One night.

          INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - LATER

          IN THE LIVING ROOM, the lights are low. Ali's on the couch,
          under covers, cat at her feet. INTERCUT WITH:
          THE BEDROOM. Jack at his keyboard, playing from sheet music,
          learning a song. When he pauses, from the living room:

                         ALI
          You're good.

                         JACK
          Thanks.

                         ALI
          Why don't you play at the club?

                         JACK
          Make more money bartending.

                         ALI
          You in a band?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.

                         JACK
          Was... Guitarist moved to Reno,
          Drummer went to med school, bassist
          is in rehab. I'm subbing around
          town till I regroup. This is for a
          punk fusion band -- their
          keyboardist is a flake, so they
          call me a lot.

                         ALI

                         (SARCASTIC)
          A flaky punk-rock-fusion
          keyboardist? No way.
          He smiles. Continues playing.
          HIGH ANGLE, seeing both of them on either side of a wall.
          Her listening, him playing. After a few measures:

                          ALI (CONT'D)
          Hey...
          He stops playing again.

                          ALI (CONT'D)
          Why'd you leave Kentucky?

                         JACK
          Why'd you leave Iowa?

                         ALI
          Cause I looked around and realized
          there wasn't one person whose life
          I wanted.

                         JACK
          Exactly.
          A beat. Then as he starts playing again:

                          ALI
           Hey Jack?
          He stops again.

                          ALI (CONT'D)
          Thank you. I'm really glad I'm not
          alone tonight.
          He smiles.

                         JACK
          Get some sleep.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.
          He continues playing. She closes her eyes.

          INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING

          Light rain on the window.
          CLOSE ON: THE CAT'S FACE, staring right into camera.
          REVERSE ON: Jack, waking up. As his eyes open, the Cat licks
          him on the mouth.

                         JACK
          Aauuuugggghh.
          He hurls the cat away and bolts out of bed, disgusted.

          INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Jack straggles in, wiping his mouth. The sofa's made up,
          blankets folded. Ali is making breakfast, her back to him.
          He can't help but notice she's only wearing a tiny tank top
          and undies. She hears him clear his throat.

                         ALI
          Morning. Coffee?

                         JACK

                         (NODS)
          Black. Like my soul.
          She pours him a cup. Sees a picture of a BEAUTIFUL GIRL on
          his fridge.

                         ALI
          She's pretty. Your sister?

                         JACK
          My fiancee. Natalie.

                         ALI
          Fiancee? You're straight?

                         JACK
          Of course I'm straight. You
          thought I was gay?

                         ALI
          Yes?

                         JACK
          Why?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.

                         ALI
          I don't know, the...make-up?

                         JACK
          It's a look.

                         ALI
          Okay.

                         JACK
          A straight look.

                         ALI
          Okay.

                         (THEN)
          And the floral couch...?

                         ALI/JACK
          Natalie.
          As Ali realizes she's barely dressed in front of a straight
          guy.

                         ALI
          I should put on pants.

                         JACK
          Probably.
          She bolts out to the living room, starts digging through her
          bag, bent over. She's in the doorway, so from the kitchen,
          all he can see is her cute little ass sticking out.

                         ALI
          Where is she?

                         JACK
          New York. Doing a play.

                         ALI
          For how long?

                         JACK
          Six more weeks.
          She can't find pants. She shifts, so now her ass is facing
          him directly. He tries not to look--

                         ALI

                         (KEEPS DIGGING)
          Oh, God, now I feel bad about this.

                         I'M SORRY--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

                         JACK
          For what?

                         ALI
          I don't know. Now that you're
          straight and engaged, it feels
          weird that I came here.

                         JACK
          Well, you did, and it was fine.
          Aha! Pants. She pulls them out, starts putting them on. He
          looks out. Her foot is caught in the pants leg. As she hops
          around, trying to untangle it--

                          JACK (CONT'D)
           Or at least it will be as soon as
           you get dressed.
          She tumbles out of view, thumps against some furniture.
          She appears in the doorway, pants on, pulling on a sweater.
          She slips her feet into her shoes.

                         ALI
          Alrighty then-- I'll get outta your
          hair now...

                         JACK
          Wait, where're you headed?

                         ALI
          Oh, don't worry about me. I've got
          a plan.
          (scoops up the cat)
          Come on, cat.
          She zips the cat into the bag he came in.

                         JACK
          Hang on, let me at least spot you
          some cash. I'm a little strapped,
          but I could --

                         ALI
          No, I'm good, if you could just
          She nods at the door. He opens it for her.

                          ALI (CONT'D)
          Thank you. For everything. You
          are my knight in shining...
          eyeliner.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          (out the door)
          I'll see you at the club.

                         JACK
          Cool.
          She leaves. He closes the door behind her. Stands there.

          EXT. JACK'S APARTMENT - DAY

           Ali looks at the rain. Then marches out into it, lugging her
          stuff. Goes about 15 yards in one direction, then stops.

          INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - SAME

           Jack watches her out the window as she marches 15 yards in
          another direction, then stops. Pondering. She sees a bus
          stop across the street. She crosses to it and sits.

          EXT. BUS STOP - DAY

          Ali peers down the street for the bus. Jack appears beside
          her, getting soaked in the rain.

                         JACK
          So, this plan of yours?

                         ALI
          .was to sit here at the bus stop
          and come up with a plan.

                         JACK
          Come back inside.

                         ALI
          No, Jack, I--

                         JACK

                         ALI--

                         ALI
          I'll figure it out, this is not

                         YOUR PROBLEM--

                         JACK
          It's pouring!

                         ALI
          It's only water for chrissakes--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.

                         JACK

          GOD DAMN IT! GET YOUR ASS BACK IN

          MY HOUSE! NOW!

                         ALI
          Jack-- you've done enough and--
          In ONE MOVE he SCOOPS HER up as she lets out a WHOOOOP!

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          Jack-- No! Stop it!
          He grabs her bags and carries her back across the street--

          INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - DAY

          The DOOR KICKS OPEN-- they ENTER, Jack carrying Ali, dripping
          wet.

                         ALI

          PLEASE PUT ME DOWN--
          He sets her down--

                         JACK
          Look, you have nowhere to go, I
          have a couch. You may as well stay
          here for a few days.

                         ALI
           You really don't need to do that.
          I'll be fine --

                         JACK
          You'll be homeless. You always have
          this much trouble saying yes when
          someone is trying to help you?

                         AL I
          It's never happened before.
          The Cat jumps up on the back of a chair, all wet, and SHAKES,
          splattering them with wet cat smell.

                         JACK/ALI
          Aaaaargh!
          As his PHONE RINGS.

                         JACK
          There's a towel in the bathroom--
          dry yourself and that damn cat off.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.
          Ali collects the cat-- heads for the bathroom. Jack checks
          his phone. Answers.

          Hey, baby, how's it going?...
          Really? That's awesome...

          DO YOU HAVE A BLOW DRYER?

                         JACK

          That...? Just this person from work
          What? No, she's just a friend,
          I'm helping her out. Nat, it's
          nothing.

          CLOSE ON A HEAVILY MADE-UP GIRL as she screams and drops out
          of the shot in a flying split. Behind her, a ROW OF DANCERS
          do the same. Typical, fantastic, old-school can-can.
          WIDEN to see Tess and Sean, on the floor, auditioning them.
          The club is brightly lit, none of its evening aura.
          Scattered around the club are other HOPEFULS in groups,
          waiting for their turn.

          MUSIC CONTINUES OVER:

          Ali and Jack enter as the auditions are under way. As they
          set up the bar, Ali watches the stage, intrigued.
          MONTAGE: the dancers auditioning, in small groups. All
          shapes, sizes. Ali watching. Finally only a few are left.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.

                         TESS
          Okay, front row, thank you very
          much.
          They walk off stage, dismissed. Tess turns to Sean.

                         TESS (CONT'D)
          What happened to all the great
          dancers in L.A?

                         SEAN
          They're busy "Dancing with the
          Stars."
          (to the waiting dancers)
          Last group, please.
          HALF A DOZEN DANCERS move to the stage. Ali watches from
          behind the bar, thinking. Then, on her face, we see: an idea
          forming.
          ON THE FLOOR, Tess and Sean check their clipboards,
          organizing for this next set. They look up and start in:

                         TESS
          All right, ladies, and five, six,
          seven -- whoa.
          There, in the back row, is Ali, in her white platform shoes.

                         TESS (CONT'D)
          What the hell do you think you're
          doing?
          Coco and Georgia ENTER-- surprised to see Ali on stage.

                         ALI
          Trying out.

                         TESS
          I don't think so.

                         ALI
          Tess, I've been singing and dancing
          my whole life and--

                         TESS
          The girls here have years of
          training and experience. This stage
          is for serious and professional

                         DANCERS WHO--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.

                         ALI
          (angry, interrupting)
          Hey_. This is your club and you can
          be as rude as you want--but don't
          you dare tell me I'm not serious.
          Sean's eyebrows reach for the ceiling as Nikki enters, SEES
          Ali on stage.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          I may not have been to a
          professional dance school, but I
          have a lot of talent and I came to
          this town to do something with it.
          And the only reason I've been
          putting up with all the bullshit
          "attitude" I get from you is cause
          I want to do it here.

                         (BEAT)
          For the first time in my life, I
          don't want to be someplace else. So
          you're gonna give me MY shot. Right
          here. Right now.
          Everyone in the club just stands there. Jaws dropped. Tess
          just looks at her, blinks, incredulous.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          One song. You don't like it, I'll
          quit and do us both a favor.

                         (BEAT)
          Your call, lady. I know every
          number in the show.
          Sean, eyes big as saucers, looks from Ali to Tess, then back

                         AGAIN--

                         TESS

                         (DOUBTFUL)
          You know every number.

                         ALI
          Which one do you wanna see?
          Tess looks at her in disbelief.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          I said, which one do you wanna see?
          Ali just stares at her. Calling her bluff, Tess yells up to
          DAVE in the sound booth--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.

                         TESS
          Tough Lover!
          Tess plops down in a booth-- crosses her arms indignantly.
          ON STAGE, the music starts. Ali readies herself, starts to
          dance. Behind a beat to two. She's got the steps right, but
          it isn't clicking. She's thinking too hard. No personality.
          After a few measures, Tess has seen enough.

                         TESS (CONT'D)
          Okay then, next?

                         ALI
          Hang on.
          (to Dave in the booth)
          Start it again, please?
          As Dave resets the music. Ali regroups: takes her hair down
          and shakes it loose.
          Nikki ENTERS, SEES Ali on stage--

                         NIKKI

                         (TO GEORGIA)
          What the hell's going on?

                         COCO
          Shhhh.
          On stage, Ali takes a beat; inhales, breathing in attitude.
          Then she looks up at the booth again.

                         ALI
          Anytime.
          The MUSIC starts in again. And this time, Ali comes alive.
          She may not have perfect technique or the best extension, but
          she exudes an ambition and sexuality no one has seen from her
          before. It's like she becomes a woman before our eyes. She
          misses a step or two, but who the hell cares?
          On the floor, Sean gapes, eyes popping. Tess is poker-faced.
          Coco and Georgia's expressions turn from dubious to
          respectful. Nikki's eyes narrow.
          At the bar, Jack freezes, a huge rack of glasses in his arms -
          - unable to tear his eyes away.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.
          As the SONG CLIMAXES, Ali finishes with an alluring toss of
          her ass, then lands in a sexy layout on a chair, owning the
          stage. The music ends. A stunned silence. The only sound
          is Ali's heavy breathing.
          Then Georgia jumps up, APPLAUDING EFFUSIVELY.

                         NIKKI
          What are so you happy about, that's
          your replacement.

                         GEORGIA
          Yeah, but she's really good.
          Tess and Ali are in a stare down.

                         TESS
          I want so badly to say something
          bitchy, but nothing's coming.

                         SEAN
          There's a first.
          Tess sighs, not wanting to give Ali any props.

                         TESS
          You were off the whole second half.

                         ALI
          So, I was spot on the first half?
          Tess narrows her eyes at Ali. Then looks over at Nikki, Coco
          and Georgia. Georgia gives an effusive THUMBS UP-- then
          suddenly becomes overcome by nausea, covers her mouth and
          RUNS to the bathroom to puke--
          Tess rolls her eyes, looks back at Ali.

                         TESS
          Oh, you're gonna be such a pain in
          my ass.
          Ali tries hard not to beam--

                         ALI
          Do I have the job, or not?

                         TESS
          You're not great. What you are is
          lucky. Because I need someone
          tonight.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.

                         ALI
          And I know all the routines.
          As Tess turns and leaves--

                         TESS
          Even in those shoes that time
          forgot.

                         SEAN
          Theeeere's bitchy.
          Nikki watches Tess go-- turns and pours herself a shot.

                         NIKKI
          Well-- this totally sucks ass.
          Sean jumps up on the stage.

                         SEAN
          Congratulations. The last time
          someone showed Tess balls like
          that, she married him.
          (looks Ali over)
          You look like a checker at a Mal
          Wart in Wichita. Just tripled your
          salary. Get a new look.

                         ALI
          Hey, I happen to like the way I
          look.

                         SEAN
          Really? That's a fascinating story.
          And then what happens?

                         (ALL BUSINESS)
          Backstage in five.

                         (WALKING OFF)
          Welcome to the family.
          Ali jumps off the stage, runs to the bar, where Jack is still
          standing, slack-jawed. She throws her arms around him.

                         ALI
          Sorry for the short notice, I quit!
          (plants a big kiss on him)
          But hey-- with my raise I'll be off
          your couch in a week.
          She squeezes him tight-- then heads backstage leaving him
          standing there, really turned on.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - DAY

          Sean swings open A DOOR, revealing a room packed to the gills
          with costumes: feathers, sequins, fishnets, corsets, jammed
          up against each other. Sean tosses her clothes in a blur.

                         SEAN
          First number, second number, third
          number...
          She catches the clothes. He dumps shoes on top of them,
          holding them up as he tells her what they go with:

                         SEAN (CONT'D)
          With the sequined bustier. With
          the shorts and garters. With the
          beaded number. And those --
          (points to hers)
          I never want to see again.

                         (REMEMBERING)
          Oh! And --
          He hands her a prop GOLD MACHINE GUN.

                         SEAN (CONT'D)
          For "Miss Otis Regrets". Just be
          sure you don't --
          Ali pulls the trigger. BOOM -- GLITTER SPLATS all over Sean.

                         SEAN (CONT'D)
          Pull the trigger.

          MUSIC UP: "RICH MAN'S FRUG". CARRY MUSIC OVER:

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - ON STAGE - NIGHT

          The chic audience watches the Girls doing a swingin' sixties
          shimmy and shake number. CAMERA MOVES ACROSS the girls'
          faces as drums roll and their heads turn to each drumbeat.
          The last face to turn is ALI'S. In FULL STAGE MAKE-UP, she
          looks like a gorgeous classic burlesque dancer. The girls,
          in 20's revealing bathing suits and stilettos, kick and dance
          downstage in a line. Ali struggles a little to keep up
          A WAITER CROSSES FRAME and we WIPE TO:
          - ANOTHER NIGHT. SAME MUSIC, different costumes. Ali's
          dancing is improving. WAITRESS CROSSES FRAME and we WIPE TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.
          - ANOTHER NIGHT. SAME MUSIC, yet another set of costumes.
          Ali's as good as anyone else up there. AN AUDIENCE MEMBER
          crosses frame and we WIPE TO:
          - ANOTHER NIGHT. SAME MUSIC, another set of costumes. Ali
          knows the steps now, she's not thinking about them. She's
          all performance, vamping to the audience, selling like crazy.
          She NAILS a final layout on a chair, it's flawless.
          Tess and Sean are watching from the wings. They notice the
          extra whip in Ali's head, the bump in her grind.

                         SEAN
          Admit it. You like her. It kills
          you, but you like her.
          Tess meets his eye, then walks away. The number ends. The
          girls rush offstage and peel their costumes off.

                         ALI
          My tits are up around my ears, my
          thong's about a mile up up ass,
          this corset is so tight, I haven't
          breathed since Tuesday and these
          lashes are thick enough to kick up
          a stiff wind.

                         SEAN
          It's fun being a girl, huh?

                         ALI

                         (BIG SMILE)
          Yeah.
          She hands him the last bits of her costume.
          FOLLOW Ali as she heads to the dressing room. As she grabs
          her T-shirt and jeans:

                         JESSE
          I'm starving, who wants to go grab
          some pizza before the next show?
          A general chorus of "Yeah?" and "I'm in."
          FOLLOW Ali to the bathroom as she throws on her clothes and
          washes off her make-up, humming "Rich Man's Frug" to herself.
          She heads back out to the dressing room to find:
          EVERYONE IS GONE. She looks around. Feels like an fool.
          She plunks down in a chair. Drops her bag on the floor.
          Looks at herself in the mirror.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.
          She sees a picture of A CLASSIC BURLESQUE BEAUTY taped to the
          mirror. Notices her eye make-up -- strong, thick eyeliner.
          Ali picks up a brush, dips it in eyeliner, and tries to
          duplicate the look on her own eye. After a first try:

          TESS (O.S.)
          Your brush is for shit.
          She turns and sees Tess in the doorway. Tess comes over,
          takes Ali's brush. Looks at it.

                         TESS (CONT'D)
          Where'd you get this, the 99 cent
          store?
          She chucks it in the trash.

                         ALI
          Hey.

                         TESS
          Make-up is like wine. The good
          stuff costs a fortune but is worth
          every penny. Where is everyone?

                         ALI
          All the girls went out for pizza.

                         TESS
          Aren't you one of the girls?

                         ALI
          Apparently not.
          Tess reads her like a book. Knows what went down. She turns
          to leave, then pauses at the door. Turns back.

                         TESS
          Don't take it personally. Their
          love's the kind you gotta earn.
          Ali meets her eyes in the mirror. Then Tess grabs a brush
          from her own station, tosses it to Ali.

                         TESS (CONT'D)
          Dip it in water first, or you'll
          never get a clean line.
          She leaves Ali alone.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

          INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY

          Jack enters in boxers, kicks them off, opens the shower, then
          freezes.

                         JACK

          ALI!!!

          INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Ali is just waking up.

                         JACK
          Your stupid cat peed in the tub!

                         ALI
          What...?
          (sees the window closed)
          You closed the window, what do you
          expect?

                         JACK
          Your cat pees in the house, and
          it's my_ fault?!
          Ali scoops the cat up.

                         ALI
          Awwww. Poor guy, you must have been
          desperate.

                         JACK
          Goddamn cat. And you used my towel
          again.
          (then, pointed)
          How's that apartment hunting
          coming?
          He GRABS the newspaper and tosses it in front of her-- she
          glares at him, then glances at the paper--

                         ALI

                         (EYES WIDENING)
          A thousand bucks for a studio?

                         JACK
          Can you really put a price on
          privacy? Freedom? Your own
          bathroom? With clean towels?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

                         ALI
          Okay, Jack-- I get it--
          His cell phone rings. As he checks who's calling:

                         JACK
          Natalie.
          (then, into phone:)
          Hey, baby, how are you?
          He heads into the bedroom, closes the door. Ali shakes her
          head, begins to peruse the classifieds.

          INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY

          Ali, in pajamas, is at the table, combing the classified
          apartment ads. The cat is beside her.

                         ALI
          Guest studio, Hollywood, $900, with
          a yard, and -- oh. No pets.
          (to the cat)
          Screw them.
          She scans the ads some more. Finds a good one.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          Ooh?
          Jack walks in. Looks like he's got something on his mind.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          I think I found my new place.
          Where's Pomona?

                         JACK
          Go to Hell, turn left, it's three
          miles down on the right.

                         ALI
          Really. How's Beachwood Canyon?

                         JACK
          Great, if you have a car.

                         (BEAT)
          Truth is, you should get a car
          first. This is L.A. You don't
          exist without a car. Plus, you
          can't really afford a decent place
          yet.

                         (THINKING)
          Tell you what.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         59

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          I'm gonna suck it up and let you
          stay here a little longer. Just
          throw in a little something for
          rent.
          She looks at him, curious.

                         ALI
          What about the "God damn" cat?

                         JACK
          Hey, I don't like the cat. And I
          don't like my towel being wet. I
          don't like the lack of privacy. But
          you're in a jam -- and I'm the kind
          of guy, if a friend's in trouble, I
          help. It's just who I am.

                         ALI

                         (SUSPICIOUS)
          What did Natalie have to say?

                         JACK
          Nothing, you know just... hi.
          She narrows her eyes at him. He concedes.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          And...her play got extended three
          more months, so since she has to
          pay rent there, she can't also keep
          up her part of the rent here.

                         ALI
          Ah-hah.

                         JACK
          So if you could stick around and
          chip in, it would --

                         ALI
          Save your ass?

                         JACK
          -- help.
          Ali looks down at his shoes.

                         ALI
          Well, will you look at that? The
          shoe, on the other foot!

                         JACK

                         OKAY --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.

                         ALI
          One minute I'm a freeloader with a
          God damn cat, the next, I'm the
          only thing standing between you and

                         EVICTION --

                         JACK
          Just -- yes or no?

                         ALI
          What's the proposal, exactly?
          Jack looks at her-- realizes he's screwed.

                         JACK
           The bedroom, with private bathroom
          access, for 600 a month, including
          utilities.

                         ALI
          Closet?

                         JACK
          Half .
          Ali picks up the paper, reads an ad.

                         ALI
          Ooh, look! Hot tub!

                         JACK
          Fine. The closet, too.
          She weighs it. Makes him suffer. Then:

                         ALI
          Okay.

                         JACK
          Thank you.

                         ALI

                         (MOCKING HIM)
          Hey, I'm the kind of girl, if a
          friend's in trouble, I help. That's
          just who I am.
          We HEAR an AUDIENCE laugh O.S. as we...

          EXT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT

          Small crowd outside.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.

          TESS (O.S.)
          So I said to the sailor, I may not
          be as good as I once was...

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT

          Through a transparent scrim, the Puccini Triplets perform a
          sexy harem scene in silhouette, casting larger than life
          shadows-- Tess walks behind the scrim playfully, in and out
          of view. The Bumber Band plays off to the side.

                         TESS
          But you can bet your sweet ass I'm
          better ONCE than I ever was...
          The crowd laughs. Tess points to a woman who isn't laughing.

                         TESS (CONT'D)
          Drink up, sister! You're a tad
          behind.
          (to a waiter, re: woman)
          Be a dear and bring Mommy over
          there another scotch.
          The crowd chuckles as the Bumper Band kicks in and the harem
          scene evolves into a sexy tongue-in-cheek silhouetted dance.

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

          Tess comes off stage. Sean bustles up to her.

                         SEAN
          The distributor's holding back the
          booze unless we cut him a check.

                         TESS
          Ply him with drinks, send Scarlett
          over to flirt, and try to finagle
          him down to a half.

                         SEAN
          How's a third?
          He produces a check, all filled-out, for her to sign.

                         TESS
          Have I told you lately that I love
          you?

                         SEAN
          Got any brothers?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.
          He bustles off with the check. Scarlett, Coco and Nikki
          approach the stage wearing leather, strappy Gaultier corsets
          with gloves and fishnets --post-modern Germanesque -- Nikki
          is carrying a glass of tequila. Tess eyeballs her--

                         TESS
          Drinking already?

                         NIKKI
          Yes, Mommie.

                         TESS
          You're drunk.

                         NIKKI
          No. But I'm working on it.
          Nikki totters a little. Tess looks her over.

                         TESS
          I'm pulling you from this number.
          Go home, wring yourself out, and
          come back tomorrow.

                         NIKKI
          You can't pull me--
          Tess SPOTS Ali heading for the dressing room--

                         TESS
          Ali! Take Nikki's spot.

                         NIKKI
          WHAT?! That bitch can't dance my
          part!

                         TESS
          Ali-- get dressed NOW!
          Ali looks at Nikki-- who GLARES at her--

                         ALI
          But, wait-- Tess-- that's always
          been Nikki's number.
          Tess looks at her-- she's really had it with these girls--

                         TESS
          But this is MY club, and now it's
          your number.
          Ali looks between the two of them, Nikki glaring at her--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

                         TESS (CONT'D)
          Is there a problem? You said you
          know the whole show.

                         (CHALLENGING HER)
          You can do anything, right?
          Tess just looks at Ali. Nikki stares at Tess, livid, then
          storms off.

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - SAME

          Marcus ENTERS the club and joins Vince at a table. A LOUD

          DRUM ROLL. MUSIC UP.

                         THE STAGE
          Ali and the other dancers hit the stage and start in on the
          vampy "TOUGH LOVER."
          AT THE BAR, Jack is busy mixing drinks. He glances at the
          stage, then DOUBLE-TAKES on Ali, looking crazy gorgeous. She
          vamps forward with the girls, they rotate singing into the
          prop mic.

                         JESSE

                         (LIP-SYNCHING)

          WELL, I WANT A LOVER WHO MOVES ME

                         SO_

                         COCO

                         (LIP-SYNCHING)

          WHO SURE KNOWS HOW TO ROCK N ROLL--

                         ALI

                         (LIP-SYNCHING)

          I WANT A TOUGH LOVER--

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - SOUND BOOTH - NIGHT

          DAVE, the sound guy, looks up as Nikki comes in.

                         NIKKI
          Tess needs you. She said it was
          urgent.

                         DAVE
          I can't leave here now --

                         NIKKI
          Fine, but don't say I didn't warn
          you...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

                         DAVE
          Shit, okay --
          He checks his sound board -- then bolts from the room. Nikki
          watches him go LOOKS DOWN onto the STAGE as ALI STEPS to

                         THE MIC--

                         ALI

                         (LIP-SYNCHING)

          WHEN HE KISSES ME I'LL GET A

          THRILL, AND WHEN HE DO THAT WIGGLE--
          Nikki reaches out and FLIPS A SWITCH.
          THE SOUND DROPS OUT. THE PLAYBACK STOPS. The girls freeze
          in awkward poses, unsure of what to do.
          MURMURS in the room as the audience looks around, confused.
          BACKSTAGE, Tess looks up at the sound booth, sees it's empty.
          Dave appears at her side.

                         DAVE
          You wanted to see me?
          ON STAGE -- Ali looks at flustered Tess...the girls...the
          audience. Panic.
          On the floor, Nikki watches with satisfaction as she makes
          her way over to Marcus. Enjoying the train wreck she caused.
          Then -- in a flash, Ali turns to the audience, and SINGS
          a'capella from the TOP OF THE SONG.

                         ALI

          OH--OH--OOOOOOOOOOH.
          She looks around. Silence. Mouths agape. Tess approaches in

                         THE WINGS--

                         TESS
          (to a stage hand)
          Close the Goddman curtain!

                         SEAN
          Hold on...
          Ali starts to sing again, her version, slow, and sexy...

                         ALI

          WELL I WANT A LOVER TO MOVE ME SO,

          WHO SURE KNOWS HOW TO ROCK N

          ROLL...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.
          Tess looks at Ali, you could knock her over with a feather.
          Sean looks at Tess. Scarlett looks at Coco. Jack stares at
          the stage. Everyone stunned by the sound coming out of this
          girl. And now the song really takes off!
          SUDDENLY, one of the BAND BOYS grabs his sax and plays. Ali
          jumps in, seamless, as the guys on Bass and Drums join in.
          Ali picks up the choreography. The girls fall in with her.

                         ALI (CONT'D)

          I WANT A TOUGH LOVER, YEAH, YEAH. I

          NEED A TOUGH LOVER. WHOOO. I WANT A

          TOUGH LOVER. YEAH-YEAH. TOUGH

          LOVER. UH-HA...
          Coco and Scarlett chime in on back-up. Hearing them, Jessie
          and Anna join in as well. Ali takes off, holding nothing
          back. The girls feed off her confidence, and soon all of
          them are hitting the backs of their cabaret chairs, stomping
          their feet to the music. The girls singing back-up.
          In his seat, Marcus sits up a little straighter -- suddenly
          paying more attention. Unable to take his eyes off Ali.
          The BAND plays along. The BARTENDERS accompany them with
          hand-claps. All except Jack, who's too spellbound to move.

                         ALI (CONT'D)

          WHEN HE KISSES ME I'LL GET A THRILL

          AND WHEN HE DO THAT WIGGLE, I WON ' T

          KEEP STILL ...
          ON THE FLOOR, Nikki watches, aghast, as the crowd engages
          like we've never seen them.

                         ALI/GIRLS

          I WANT A TOUGH LOVER, YEAH, YEAH. I

          NEED A TOUGH LOVER. WHOOO. I WANT A

          TOUGH LOVER. YEAH-YEAH.

                         BARTENDERS/GIRLS

          TOUGH LOVER. UH-HA...
          The girls come alive, finally able to sing a song they've
          been faking for so long

                         ALI

          THE SEVEN SISTERS GOT NOTHING ON

          HIM, I 'M TALKING ABOUT A LOVER

                         BARTENDERS/GIRLS

          TOUGH LOVER. UH-HA::!
          The room ERUPTS IN APPLAUSE, knowing they caught a once-in-a-
          lifetime performance. Marcus stands, clapping, whistling.
          Ali basks in it, jubilant, rapturous. She glances to the
          wings and sees Sean, clapping and jumping in place. Then she
          sees Tess beside him, stone-faced.

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

          The Girls exit the stage in a flurry, everyone congratulating
          Ali -- a whirlwind of hugs, kisses. Ali reaches Tess.

                         ALI
          Tess, when the music stopped--

                         TESS DAVE
          Why didn't you tell me you I have no idea what happened.
          could blow like that?

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          I did.
          Tess spots a TATTOOED BAND GUY in the door.

                         TESS
          Do you boys know all the music?

          TATTOOED BAND GUY
          Hell, yeah.
          Nikki wanders in, drink in hand. Tess looks at them all.
          Plants her hands on her hips.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

                         TESS
          Okay, then. Tomorrow night, Ali
          sings lead, everyone else is back-
          up. Questions?
          Ali can't keep from beaming as she shakes her head, no!

                         TESS (CONT'D)
          Good.
          The Girls file into the dressing room. Tess heads out, past
          Nikki.

                         NIKKI
          "People don't come to hear us
          sing."

                         TESS
          No. But they'll come to hear her
          sing. Dry out and maybe you can
          back her up.
          She leaves. Nikki scowls. Sean grabs Ali.

                         SEAN
          Bitch, you SANG that damn song!
          He heads off to the dressing room, too, leaving Nikki and Ali
          alone together. Their eyes meet.

                         NIKKI
          One of us has clearly
          underestimated the other.
          She tosses her glass in the trash and leaves Ali alone.

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT

           Ali trots out from backstage, spots Jack behind the bar. She
          heads over to him. Before she gets there:

                         MARCUS
          Where'd you learn to sing like
          that?
          She turns. Marcus is there. Handsome, charming and devious as
          ever.

                         ALI
          You can't learn to sing like that.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.

                         MARCUS
          Well, you're too good to be singing
          here.

                         ALI
          I just got into the show and
          suddenly I'm too good for it?
          Shrugs, "but, you are" then--

                         MARCUS
          How about a drink?

                         ALI
          Sure. Jack's at the bar. Tell him I
          sent you. It's on me.

                         MARCUS
          But I hate lines.
          AT THE BAR - Jack looks up, SEES Ali and Marcus talking.
          BACK ON MARCUS who looks Ali up and down.

                         MARCUS (CONT'D)
          Seriously. You sound even better
          than you look. Which is saying a
          lot.

                         ALI
          Talk about a "line."
          She smiles, amused, and heads away from him, toward the bar.
          He watches her go. Tess intercepts Ali.

                         TESS
          What did he want?

                         ALI
          Directions to the bar.
          As Ali heads off. Tess glances back at Marcus, mistrustful.

          INT. EMPTY BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT

          After hours. The club is closed. Jack, Ali, Coco, Sean and
          Georgia are sitting around the bar as Jack closes up.

                         JACK
          You blew me away! Who knew you
          could sing like that?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.

                         COCO
          Who knew any white chick could sing
          like that? You channeled that shit.

                         SEAN
          How the hell do you do that, girl?

                         ALI
          I don't know, I can't explain it.
          It's like -- I start singing, and
          something starts to move inside me.
          It's in my hands, my feet, my gut,

                         MY THIGHS
          She runs her hands over her body as she describes it. Jack
          watches her -- holy smokes. Sean notices his gaze on her.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          and it just builds and builds
          till I feel like I'm gonna explode.

                         GEORGIA
          Trust me, I know what that feels
          like. I have to pee. Again.
          She hops off the stool and scurries to the back. Coco
          stands, to leave. Looks at Ali.

                         COCO
          Wanna grab something to eat?
          Ali looks back at Coco -- validated. Accepted. At last.

                         ALI
          Yeah. Lemme get my bag.
          Ali moves off. Coco goes to get her coat. Sean sees Jack
          still watching Ali as she walks across the room.

                         SEAN
          Well, will you look at that.

                         JACK
          What?

                         SEAN
          You looking at that girl the way I
          looked at you all those years.
          Only difference: you actually stand
          a chance with her.

                         JACK
          I have a fiancee.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

                         SEAN
          Three thousand miles away.

                         JACK
          We talk every day.

                         SEAN
          Let me guess what about: her, her
          and...oh! Her.
          Jack shoots him a glare.

                         SEAN (CONT'D)
          All I'm saying is, this one's
          beautiful on the inside too. And
          she won't be on the shelf forever.
          Ali comes back, ready to go. Feels them stop talking and
          look at her.

                         ALI
          What?

                         SEAN
          I was just explaining to Jack that
          even opportunity has a shelf life.
          Jack grabs a trash bag and takes it out back. Sean looks at
          Ali more closely. He brushes her hair out of her face. Then
          he holds it off her shoulders and raises that gay eyebrow.
          - INT. SALON - DAY - Ali sits in front of a mirror while Sean
          gives the HAIRDRESSER very specific instructions.
          - INT. JACK'S APARTMENT, AT HIS KEYBOARD, Jack plays a high-
          energy style piano which runs over a QUICK SEQUENCE: It's the
          instrumental music to: "BUT I'M A GOOD GIRL."
          - INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - The Burlesque Girls dance on stage,
          performing a high-energy tap dance, coupled with a European
          slap-dance, with the slapping of each other's bodies and
          faces integrated with tapping and music. It's very cabaret,
          but modernized with contemporary STEPPING. CARRY MUSIC:
          - INT. SALON - LATER - The HAIRDRESSER spins the chair
          around. Ali's her hair is platinum blonde, with bangs and a
          Louise Brooks bob that frames her face beautifully. Her
          smoky eyes pop like never before. Ali studies herself:

                         ALI
          Where have I been all my life?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

          - INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT - CAMERA MOVES OVER THE

           AUDIENCE, the brass section kicks in giving the piano a
          BIGGER, BAWDY, SHOW-STOPPING BOISTEROUS SOUND as Ali APPEARS
          with her new look. Amazing. Like Helmut Newton meets Carnaby
          St. circa 1965. As she begins this HIGH ENERGY SONG-- Jack is
          looks up from the bar. Totally blown away.

                         ALI (CONT'D)

          WHAT?. I AM A GOOD GIRL.
          Ali finishes the song to big applause. Takes her bow. Makes
          her way off the stage and ACROSS the club to...
          JACK AT THE BAR - he turns to see Ali.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          Hiya, big boy.
          She spins herself around on a bar stool, so he can see all
          angles. Jack likes plenty. Way too much.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          What do you think?

                         JACK

                         (FLUSTERED)
          It's...I think-you look...I mean,
          yeah... do you like it?
          Not the reaction she was looking for.

                         ALI
          Jack. It's okay for you to think I
          look hot. We're friends for
          chrissakes. It's not like we're
          brother and sister.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.
          She rolls her eyes, gets up, and heads backstage. Jack
          watches her go--

                         JACK

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          No. We certainly are not.

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

          The Burlesque Girls are prepping for the show.

                         NIKKI
          Why the hell is everyone having a
          conniption over her? She's just a
           tacky, pushy girl from a --
          Ali -- sexy, sophisticated, gorgeous -- enters.

                          NIKKI (CONT'D)
          -- fly-over state.
          Ali pretends she didn't hear. She sits at her mirror. The
          girls stare at her, mouths agape. Ali picks up her mascara
          wand, looks down the mirror at Nikki's reflection.

                         ALI

                         (FAUX INNOCENT)
          What's a fly-over state?
          Ali takes a deft stroke of her wand over her lashes, then
          bats them at Nikki. Nikki walks out. Coco smiles with
          appreciation. Whistles long and low. The girls all laugh.

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT

          Tess glad-hands guests, then spots Vince, waving at her. She
          starts over, then sees Marcus in the booth with Vince. She
          turns and walks the other way. Vince catches up to her.

                         VINCE

                         TESS --

                         TESS
          Vince, if I were going to sell, I'd
          have sold to those idiots building
          that monstrosity across the street.
          I said no.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

                         VINCE
          Which made Marcus bump his offer up
          again. It's obscene, what he wants
          to give us. At least hear him out.

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - TESS'S CLUTTERED OFFICE - NIGHT

          Tess, at her desk, reads a contract. Marcus and Vince sit
          across from her, watching.

                         MARCUS
          It's very simple. I buy you out
          and pay you a million off the top.
          (motions to Vince)
          Five hundred grand each.
          Tess looks up from the contract, squints at Marcus.

                         TESS
          Why do you want this club so badly?

                         MARCUS
          Best view on the Sunset Strip.

                         VINCE
          Do you know what you could do with
          that money, Tess?

                         TESS
          Do you know what you can do with
          that money, Vince?

                         VINCE
          Be reasonable. We're rolling
          vendors ninety days out.

                         MARCUS
          The club's not even worth what you
          paid for it. You've got a second
          mortgage, you can't get a third.
          Tess looks at Vince, betrayed.

                         TESS
          Did you also tell him about the
          tattoo on my ass?

                         VINCE
          It's business, Tess. Not personal.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

                         TESS
          My business. Which I built from
          the ground up.

                         MARCUS
          You're not gonna get another
          opportunity like this.

                         TESS
          Exactly.
          She looks at a photo on her wall: the Burlesque Girls, in all
          their glory.

                         TESS (CONT'D)
          Which is why I'll never let it go.
          She gets up, opens the door, ushering them out. Marcus
          shoots Vince an angry look as they head downstairs.
          IN THE STAIRWELL, Vince reassures Marcus:

                         VINCE
          Don't worry. The balloon payment's
          due on the first. She doesn't have
          the money. She has to sell.
          IN TESS'S OFFICE, Tess stands in the doorway, having heard.
          Then she walks back to her desk and sits, dejected. Head in
          her hands. For the first time ever, looking worried and
          defeated. Something she'd never show anyone. A beat. Then:

                         SEAN
          Well. We've had a pretty good run.
          She looks up. Sean is in the doorway.

                         SEAN (CONT'D)
          Maybe it's time to just.. .hang it
          up. Let it go. Call it a day.
          Tess's eyes go steely with determination.

                         TESS
          No. You cannot say that to me. I
          can eat these "sky is falling"
          dipshits for breakfast, lunch, and
          dinner, but not YOU. You cannot be
          that person. I've scoured dirty
          flea markets for costumes, stayed
          up all night sewing till my fingers
          bled, painted and repainted every
          goddamn wall of this place myself.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.

                         TESS (CONT'D)
          I choreographed every step of every
          number. I've played nursemaid,
          sister, mother and shrink to every
          girl who's ever danced here. I've
          hocked every keepsake I've ever
          owned to keep this place afloat.
          Because this club is the last of
          it's kind, and if it goes away, one
          day there won't be anything like it-
          - and THAT would be a tragedy. So
          you cannot say that to me. Because
          now someone's gotta believe in me,
          Goddamnit. And I need that person
          to be you. So don't you ever let me
          hear you say that again. I will
          never let this club go. Never.
          Sean looks at her...a wry smile.

                         SEAN
          There she is. Thought I'd lost you
          for a minute.
          Tess just looks at him, and smiles. He grabs a boa, throws it
          around his neck and exits. When he's gone, Tess's smile
          fades.
          IN THE CLUB, the place is empty. Jack is wiping down the bar
          cleaning up. He starts stacking some chairs in the house
          as..SEAN CROSSES the floor.

                         SEAN (CONT'D)
          Night, Jack.

                         JACK
          Night.
          Sean EXITS as Jack carries a stack of chairs to the side of
          the room, sets them down near the piano. STOPS, grabs a chair
          for himself and sits down. Begins to play an original song.
          ACROSS THE ROOM, Ali ENTERS from backstage. Her dance bag
          over her shoulder. She HEARS the piano, peers around a
          column, SEES Jack playing. She stays in the shadows and
          watches as he sings and plays a beautiful song. (TBD)
          The song ends. Ali applauds slowly. Impressed. Jack looks up,
          surprised that she is there.

                         ALI
          Beautiful. You write that?

                         JACK
          Just some sentimental crap. Ready?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.
          She smiles at his modesty. Nods. He crosses to her. Grabs her
          dance bag and they EXIT together.

          INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON

          Jack enters, unloading his keyboard from his back. He hears
          Ali in the bedroom. He quietly moves over to the ajar
          bedroom door -- peeks in and sees:
          ALI, in bra and undies. She hums the song he played the night
          before in the mirror as she gets dressed.
          ON JACK, watching, mesmerized. His eyes travel her body.
          She moves out of view. He leans against the wall to try to
          keep seeing her -- and steps on the CAT. It MEOWS. He
          flattens against the wall. Ali looks up.

                         ALI
          Jack?
          Jack zips back to the door, opens it quietly, then SLAMS it.

                         JACK
          Hey! Just got home!
          Ali grabs a dress from her bed, slips into it.

                         ALI
          In here! Can you zip me up?
          In a nanosecond-- Jack enters the bedroom.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          Hey. Where you been?

                         JACK
          Rehearsing. I'm playing a late
          show tonight.
          As he zips up the back of her dress, he sees the PHOTO
          propped against the lamp on the bedside table.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Who is that?
          She picks up the picture. Looks at it.

                         ALI
          Me and my mom on my 7th birthday.
          She died just a few weeks later.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

                         JACK
          She was so young.

                         ALI
          24. There was so much she never
          got to do. Sometimes I feel like,
          if I make the most of my life, part
          of her will get to live a little
          more, too.

                         JACK
          Wow. You must miss her.
          She puts the photo down. Turns back to him. They're close.

                         ALI
          Every single day, something happens
          I want to tell her about.

                         JACK
          What was today's?
          A beat. Their eyes connect.

                         ALI
          Don't know. Hasn't happened yet.
          They stand there, close to each other. Jack sees a strand of
          hair caught in the earring. He pulls it away, freeing it.
          His fingers move through her hair. She closes her eyes,
          feeling his fingers against her neck.
          Then she opens her eyes, looks at him. He looks back, unable
          to look away. Until:
          His CELL PHONE RINGS. Breaking the mood. He pulls it from
          his pocket. Checks who's calling. Looks back at Ali.

                         JACK
          I should... it's... Natalie.
          Ali steps away from him, disappointed. He answers the phone.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Hey, babe, how are you?
          Ali watches him walk away from her, falling into the
          conversation with Natalie.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Yes, she's still here-What do you
          want me to do, it's not like you're
          here helping out, you know...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.
          Ali grabs her bag and jacket, heads for the door.
          MUSIC UP: An incredibly sexy saxophone which takes us to:
          FULL CLOSE UP: ALI steps into frame, starts singing.

                         ALI

          A GUY WHAT TAKES HIS TIME...
          PULL BACK to reveal she's on stage at the club with the
          BURLESQUE GIRLS. Finger waves and 1920's sexy clothes.

                         ALI (CONT'D)

          I'LL GO FOR ANY TIME. I'M A FAST

          MOVIN' GAL WHO LIKES THEM SLOW.

          GOT NO USE FOR FANCY DRIVIN', WANT

          TO SEE A GUY ARRIVIN' IN LOW. I'D

          BE SATISFIED TO KNOW A GUY WHAT

          TAKES HIS TIME...

          THE SONG CONTINUES OVER:
          - INT. JACK'S LIVING ROOM - Ali lies on her stomach on the
          floor perusing a Fashion Magazine. Across the room, Jack sits
          on the couch, PLAYING HIS KEYBOARD--UNDERSCORING THE SONG. He
          looks at Ali. Watching her. Without looking up, she takes a
          pencil, gathers her hair, and puts it up expertly. A few
          strands fall back onto her neck. Sexy. Ali feels his stare.
          Looks up at him. Smiles. He smiles back. She goes back to her
          magazine. ON JACK. Loving that she's there.
          - INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - DRESSING ROOM - Ali, the Girls and
           Sean getting ready. Georgia bursts into the room, showing off
           an ENGAGEMENT RING. Everyone jumps up, congratulates her.
          - INT. BURLESQUE STAGE - The GIRLS and Ali vamp, singing:

                         ALI (CONT'D)

          A GUY WHAT TAKES HIS TIME, I'D GO

          FOR ANYTIME. A HASTY JOB REALLY

          SPOILS A MASTER'S TOUCH ...
          AT THE BAR, Jack watches as he pours drinks.
          - EXT. STREET. AFTERNOON - Ali on the back of Jack's
          motorcycle, puts her arms around his waist. Jack revs the
          engine. Weaving through traffic on the Strip. The wind in
          their hair. Her scarf tears away, lifting into the air...
          - INT. BURLESQUE STAGE - Ali and Burlesque girls continue...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

                         ALI (CONT'D)

          I DON'T LIKE A BIG COMMOTION, I'M A

          DEMON FOR SLOW MOTION OR SUCH. WHY

          SHOULD I DENY, THAT I WOULD DIE, TO

          KNOW A GUY WHAT TAKES HIS TIME ...
          - INT. JACK'S LIVING ROOM - Ali, Sean, Tess, Scarlett, Anna,
          Georgia, DAMON (her fiance), hanging out in the living room,
          decorated with party gear. The lights dim and Jack and Coco
          enter with a birthday cake. They set it in front of Ali.
          Ali looks around at her friends, drinking it in. She locks
          eyes with Jack -- then closes her eyes and BLOWS.
          - INT. BURLESQUE STAGE - Ali, still singing her song.

                         ALI (CONT'D)

          I CAN SPOT AN AMATEUR, APPRECIATE A

          CONNOISSEUR IN HIS TRADE, WHO WOULD

          QUALIFY, NO ALIBI, TO BE THE GUY,

          WHO TAKES HIS TIME...
          PULL BACK to reveal A PACKED HOUSE. The audience goes nuts.
          Marcus is at his table, clapping, whistling, her biggest fan.

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - AT THE BAR - LATER

          Ali walks up to the bar.

                         ALI
          Hey -- when can you cut out? I'm
          about to fall asleep standing up.

                         JACK
          I have that gig, remember? In
          fact, I gotta head out or I'm gonna
          be late.
          (checking his watch)
          I can maybe swing you home before.

                         ALI
          No, that's okay, you go. I'll grab
          a ride with Coco.
          He grabs his jacket from under the bar. As he heads out:

                         JACK
          By the way -- you killed.

                         ALI
          (looks at him, smiles)
          Thanks.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.
          He disappears out the back exit. Ali turns around and finds
          herself face to face with Marcus.

                         MARCUS
          You ready?

                         ALI
          For what?

                         MARCUS
          I'll drop you off.

                         (BEAT)
          Coco left five minutes ago.
          She realizes he was listening to her conversation.

                         ALI
          Excuse me?

                         MARCUS
          Sorry-- I was coming to talk to you
          and caught the end of your
          conversation.

                         ALI
          (putting on her coat
          reaching for her bags)
          Talk to me about...?

                         MARCUS
          Dinner. With me. Gimmie that.
          He swoops down and GRABS her dance bag and purse, turns and
          heads out.

                         MARCUS (CONT'D)

                         (WALKING AWAY)
          If you ever expect to see this bag
          alive again... you'll come with me.

                         ALI
          Hey...! Come back here...!

          INT. MARCUS'S BENTLEY - NIGHT

          ON Ali, looking out the window with her arms crossed. WIDEN
          to REVEAL, she's in car with Marcus, zipping along Sunset.

                         ALI
          Where are you taking me?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.

                         MARCUS
          I told you-- to dinner.

                         ALI
          Dinner? What about Nikki-- What's
          up with you and Nikki?

                         MARCUS
          We're friends.

                         ALI
          Where I'm from friends don't chew
          each other's earlobes.

                         MARCUS
          Aren't you glad you left?
          (then, remembering)
          Oh, damn!

                         ALI
          What?

                         MARCUS
          I just remembered I have to make a
          quick appearance at a party.

                         ALI
          You just remembered.

                         MARCUS
          It's on the way. We'll be quick.
          Ten minutes, tops. Do you mind?

                         ALI
          And if I do.

                         MARCUS
          Then you've been kidnapped.
          He turns off Sunset and heads up into the hills.

          EXT. MODERN HOUSE - HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT

          Sprawling 60's modern. Walls of glass. Jetliner views.
          Valets running around out front.

          INT. MODERN HOUSE - HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT

          Fabulous party underway. Packed with glitterati. Music
          blares, caterers weave through the hip crowd. Marcus leads
          Ali in and guides her through the crowd.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.

                         ALI
          Wow. Nice house.

                         PARTY GUEST
          Hey, Marcus --

                         MARCUS
          Hey, how you doing?
          He shakes the guy's hand and moves on through the party.
          Someone else calls out to him.

                         ANOTHER GUEST
          Marcus!

                         MARCUS
          Hey, let me get a drink, I'll be

                         BACK --
          Marcus pulls Ali in the opposite direction, avoiding another
          GROUP trying to greet him. He grabs two wine glasses off a
          tray, gives one to Ali, then pushes through a door into:

          INT. MODERN HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Bustling, food and booze everywhere. Marcus spots several
          trays of hors d'oeuvres. He picks up two of them.

                         ALI
          Marcus -- you can't just take that.

                         MARCUS

                         SHHH --
          He hands her one tray, sticks a bottle of wine in one pocket,
          throws an opener in another.

                         ALI
          They're gonna throw us out of here.

                         MARCUS
          Not if we sneak out first, come on.
          He kicks open a back door.

          EXT. MODERN HOUSE - BACK YARD - NIGHT

          A sky full of stars, hovering over an expansive back yard.
          Music from the party drifts out. Marcus looks around, up --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.

                         MARCUS
          Up there.
          He starts up some steps to an outdoor gazebo. Ali follows.
          They pass AN INCREDIBLY WELL-DRESSED COUPLE coming down.

                         GUY
          Hey, Marcus --

                         MARCUS
          Hey, Guys. Greg, Marla, this is
          Ali.
          They exchange hellos. Ali notices:

                         ALI
          Ooh. Killer shoes.

                         MARLA
          Aren't they? Louboutins.

                         GREG

                         (TO MARCUS)
          Great party, as always.

                         MARCUS
          Glad you could come.
          Ali stares at Marcus. He smiles, takes her hand, keeps
          leading her up the stairs.

                         AL I
          You had to make an appearance at
          your own party?

                         MARCUS
          Would've been rude not to, right?
          You'd like those guys. Greg's the
          entertainment editor at the Times,
          and Marla's a designer.
          Ali glances back at Marla again, locks in on her shoes.

                         AL I
          I'm gonna dream about those shoes.

                         MARCUS
          Thousand dollars a pop.

                         AL I
          Jesus. Who can afford that?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.

                         MARCUS
          I can.

                         ALI
          Hey, I saw them first.
          He laughs as they reach the top of the stairs and a
          BREATHTAKING PANORAMIC VIEW OF THE ENTIRE CITY is revealed.
          Ali pauses, taking in the glittering, massive view of L.A.

                          ALI (CONT'D)
          Whoa. L.A. looks one hell of a lot
          prettier from up here.

                         MARCUS
          It should. That view cost me three
          times what the house did.

                         (POINTING)
          See that strip mall down there?

                         ALI
          You own that too?

                         MARCUS
          No. I own everything above it.

                         ALI
          There is nothing above it.

                         MARCUS
          Exactly.

                         ALI
          You own...air?

                         MARCUS
          Air rights. The guy who owns the
          strip mall was having money issues
          and almost had to sell. Whoever he
          sold to would have put in a huge
          tower. So I bought the air rights.
          Now no one can ever build above one
          story.

                         ALI
          Aren't you the sly puss.

                         MARCUS
          Mall guy gets to keep his property.
          I get to keep the second best view
          in L.A.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.

                         ALI
          What's the first?
          He gazes at her. She rolls her eyes.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          How many girls have you used that
          on?

                         MARCUS
          None who ever called me on it.
          He smiles. Looks at her. Then...

                         MARCUS (CONT'D)
          What do you want, Ali? In life.
          Girl like you, gives up everything,
          gets on a bus heading for total
          uncertainty-- she's got a dream. I
          want to know what it is.

                         ALI
          Why?

                         MARCUS
          Because you're talented enough to
          get whatever you want. And I'm
          smart enough to help make it
          happen. So? What do you want?
          A beat. She thinks about it. Looks him in the eye.

                         ALI
          I want to be the best singer I can
          be. I want to give as much joy as I
          get when I perform. And I want to
          die knowing I made the most of
          every opportunity life gave me.

                         MARCUS
          That's ...so beautiful.

                         AL I
          There wasn't a dry eye in the house
          when I said it at the Grundy County
          Junior Miss Talent Show.
          His eyes narrow.

                         MARCUS
          Why do you women always take
          advantage of nice boys?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

                         ALI
          Oh, please. You are SO not a nice
          boy.
          He clinks her glass. Smiles at her. Devilish and sexy.

          INT. MARCUS'S HOUSE - WEE HOURS - NIGHT

          Party's over. Lights low. Ali walks through the almost-
          empty house, passes a COUPLE making out on a couch, a GUY who
          holds out a joint. She motions "no thanks", heads into the:
          LIVING ROOM, where Marcus is asleep on a Bertolli chair,
          drink in hand. An OLDER GUY is playing the piano quietly.
          Ali takes the drink from Marcus's hand, sets it on the table.
          She hears the pianist start a new song: (TBD). She smiles.
          Goes over to him.

                         ALI
          Ooh, I love this song.
          The Piano Player scoots to make room. She sits beside him. He
          starts humming along. She does too. Then he sings a line.
          She sings one back. And they fall in together. Not vamping,
          not performing. Just feeling the beauty of the music in the
          middle of the night.

          INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CARRY MUSIC

          Jack quietly lets himself in. He sets his keyboard down, then
          sees the bedroom door cracked, the light on.

                         JACK
          Ali?
          He looks in. Empty. He checks the clock: 4:45. He hears a
          "meow", and sees the cat. He picks it up, turns out the
          light, and leaves the room.

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

          Sean, Coco, Nikki, Jesse, and the rest of the girls in early
          stages of getting ready. Ali enters.

                         COCO
          Someone has a package!
          Ali sees A GIFT BOX at her station. She reads the card: "You
          saw them first." She opens the box and sees the Louboutins.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.

                         JESSE
          Ooh. Faboo.
          Nikki picks one up -- checking their authenticity.

                         NIKKI
          Who's the sucker?
          All eyes turn to Ali. She's saved by Tess entering.

                         TESS
          Coco-puff, shake a leg, you're on
           in five, Georgie-Girl, Ali-Cat --
          move, move, move --
          Tess exits.

                         ALI
          Ahh. My Nanna used to call me her
          Ali-Cat.

                         SEAN
          Yet another fascinating story.

                         NIKKI
          Why doesn't Tess have a nickname
          for me?

                         COCO
          Oh, she does.
          A knowing look amongst the girls.

                         NIKKI
          She never uses it.

                         SEAN
          Sure she does.

                         NIKKI
          When?

                         SEAN
          Just after you leave the room.
          Nikki gives him the finger and walks out. A beat. Then:

                         GIRLS TOGETHER
          Coke-whore.
          They crack up. CUE MUSIC: "STRANGE THINGS HAPPENING"

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - ON STAGE - NIGHT

          Ali and the Burlesque Girls vamp forward and perform "STRANGE
          THINGS HAPPENING", a decadent, rockin' dance/singing number.
          Scantily-clad girls pose and dance on chairs with images
          projected onto them -- a rock fantasy with burlesque moves
          (like Bob Fosse's "All That Jazz")

                         ALI

          WELL I STAY OUT LATE AT NIGHT. I

          DON'T TREAT MY BABY RIGHT. THERE'S

          STRANGE THINGS HAPPENING EVERY

          DAY...

          MUSIC CONTINUES OVER:
          - INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - Jack, playing his keyboards. Ali
          comes in, wearing the Louboutins.

                         JACK
          You were out late last night.

                         ALI
          I got a ride home with that guy--
          Marcus-- we went to a party. It was
          fun.

                         JACK
          Marcus the Asshole?

                         ALI
          Yeah. Turns out he's not so bad.
          She heads past him, toward the kitchen. He notices:

                         JACK
          New shoes?

          - INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - ON STAGE - NIGHT

           Ali, singing. Marcus in the audience, watching her.

                         ALI

          THE LOVE THAT YOU REFUSE, SOME

          OTHER GUY CAN USE, STRANGE THINGS

          ARE HAPPENING EVERY DAY ...

          - INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT

           Ali performing. Marcus watching from his table. With him is
          GREG (from the party). Jack watches from the bar.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

          ALI (O.S.) (CONT'D)

          OOH EVERY DAY ...
          All the Bartenders sing, except Jack, who keeps his eyes on
          Marcus.

                         BARTENDERS

          HAPPENING EVERY DAY ...

          - INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - DAY

           Ali getting dressed to go out. She's wearing the Louboutins,
           crossing back and forth in front of Jack, who's on the sofa.

                         JACK
          There's only one reason a man buys
          a woman shoes, you know.

                         ALI
          So what if I'm getting a little
          male attention.

                         JACK
          You get a lot more than a little.

                         ALI
          Not from anyone who matters.

                         JACK

                         (CLEARLY IRRITATED)
          I just think that you should be
          careful.
          Ali stops in front of him. Hands on her hips.

                         AL I
          And I just think that -- if you
          really feel the need to tell a girl
          what she should and shouldn't do,
          you should pick up the phone and
          call your fiancee.

          - INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT

          Ali continues to sing.

                         ALI (CONT'D)

          WELL, I'D NEVER MISS MY WATER,

          UNTIL MY WELL RUNS DRY...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.
          AT THEIR TABLE, Greg leans into Marcus and whispers
          something, impressed. Marcus nods back: "Told you."

                         ALI (CONT'D)

          STRANGE THINGS HAPPENING EVERY DAY.

          - EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT

          Marcus drives Ali up the windy roads, into the hills.
          They're talking animatedly.

           ALI (O.S.) (CONT'D)

          Marcus leads Ali through a party, introducing her to
          everyone, making sure she knows people and is known by them.

          ALI (O.S.) (CONT'D)

          WELL YOU THOUGHT I WAS A FOOL, BUT

          I GOT NEWS FOR YOU ... STRANGE

          - INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT

          Nikki watches from the wings, seething, as Marcus delights in
          Ali's performance.

          - INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Wee hours. Ali comes in, shuts the door as quietly as she
          can, then tiptoes past Jack, asleep on the couch.

          ALI (O.S.) (CONT'D)

          AND I THINK IT'S THROUGH WITH

          YOU...
          After she passes... Jack's eyes open.

          - INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT

          Ali, owning the stage and the room.

                         ALI (CONT'D)

          The SONG ENDS in a flourish. There's a CAMERA FLASH!
          FREEZE FRAME on the image: ALI, belting onstage, with the
          Burlesque Girls striking a pose behind her.
          WIDEN to see it's a photo on the front page of the L.A. TIMES
          Calendar section. The headline: "BURLESQUE HAS A VOICE:".

          INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - MORNING

          Jack, sleepy, in boxers, stares at the newspaper, bewildered.

                         JACK
          Hey. Have you seen this?

                         ALI
          What?
          Ali wanders out of the bathroom, brushing her teeth. He
          shows her the paper. She SCREAMS.

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - AFTERNOON

          The Burlesque Girls (minus Ali) crowd around the paper.

                         NIKKI
          That's bullshit.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

                         SCARLETT
          No. That's major.

                         NIKKI
          (pointing to photo)
          Look again. The only thing major is
          the size of your ass.
          Nikki walks off-- Scarlett pick up the paper, looks closer--
          Ali enters, dance bag over her shoulder, running late. The
          Burlesque Girls and Sean all APPLAUD (except Nikki) Ali
          smiles. Embarrassed. She curtsies sarcastically.
          Coco points to a BOUQUET OF ROSES at Ali's station.

                         COCO
          From Monsieur Louboutin, I presume.
          Ali reads the card: "To the best view in L.A. - M". Sean
          shoves her down in her seat, pulls her coat off.

                         SEAN
          Shake your tail, Alicat, you still
          got a show to do.

          EXT. THE BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT

           A PACKED LINE of chattering hipsters snakes down the block.

           MUSIC UP: "JUNGLE FEVER" BY THE CHAKACHAS. (REVAMPED BERLIN

                         MUSIC)

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - ON STAGE - NIGHT

          Daredevils Missy and Kitten DeVille, in striped stockings,
          corsets, and tons of cleavage, swing on a trapeze over the
          audience. Playing the comedy, grabbing each other in all the
          right places. Classic Burlesque, unusually bawdy. Equally
          suggestive, funny, and skillful.
          Tess, all dolled-up, weaves through the tables, greeting,
          welcoming, reveling in the crowd.
          FIND Ali as she strides over to Marcus's booth. He stands,
          hands her a glass of champagne.

                         MARCUS
          To the girl of the hour.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.

                         ALI
          I'm starting to think you'll go to
          any length.

                         MARCUS

                         (INNOCENTLY)
          I just made a call to Greg at the
          Times.

                         ALI
          Well-- I appreciate the kudos.
          (re: crowded room)
          And Tess appreciates the business.

                         MARCUS
          This has NOTHING to do with Tess.
          This is about you. And me.

                         ALI
          You are so full of it.
          He laughs-- takes her arm--

                         MARCUS
          I've got another friend I want you
          to meet.
          She sees HAROLD SAINT sitting in the booth. He's in his
          60's, still dressing like Robert Evans in his heyday.

                         MARCUS (CONT'D)
          Ali Rose, Harold Saint.

                         ALI

                         (SHOCKED)
          Harold Saint? Shut up. You worked
          with Etta James.

                         HAROLD
          Her, she chewed me up and spat me
          out, that one. But with her voice,
          I forgive her everything.

                         (THEN)
          You got a set of pipes on you, too,
          little girl. I like your sound.

                         ALI
          Thank you.

                         (SMILES)
          I like yours.

                         HAROLD
          You ever recorded?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

                         ALI
          Not yet.

                         HAROLD
          We should do something about that.
          He stands. Turns to Marcus.

                         HAROLD (CONT'D)
          See you round, kiddo.
          He points his finger, gun-style, which would seem cheesy, but
          he's old school, so instead it's weirdly cool. He leaves.

                         ALI
          Holy shit. Harold Saint.
          AT THE BAR, Jack watches Ali and Marcus talking excitedly.
          Not liking what he sees. Sean breezes by, grabs a drink.

                         SEAN
          You snooze, you lose, pretty boy.

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

          Sean grips the drink in his teeth as he bustles through the
          backstage, gathering costumes. He passes Tess going the other
          way.

                         TESS
          Can you believe this crowd?
          He dumps the costumes in her arms.

                         SEAN
          'bout time. These poor babies are
          begging for your glue-gun.
          Tess walks off with the armful of clothes, so happy, humming
          to herself, passes her OFFICE-- OPENS the door to SEE--
          VINCE is sitting at her desk. He flinches at the sight of her-

                         TESS
          Can you believe the crowd out
          there? Never thought I'd see-
          She stops in her tracks, spotting Vince's PANTS on the FLOOR,
          and a TRAIL OF WOMEN'S CLOTHES to...
          THE NEW COCKTAIL WAITRESS, peering out, half-dressed, from
          behind the curtains--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

                          TESS (CONT'D)

                          (DISGUSTED)
           In my god damn office?
           She shakes her head-- GRABS HER PURSE-- and walks out.

          EXT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Tess, pissed off, carries the damaged costumes out to her
          car. Nikki is behind her, following her out.

                         NIKKI
          Tess. We need to talk.
          Tess rolls her eyes, doesn't slow.

                         TESS
          Not now, Nikki.

                         NIKKI
          Yes, now. I've been here since the
          beginning. We built this club
          together. And then some girl shows
          up out of nowhere-- who hasn't even
          paid her dues--

                         TESS
          I'll get her to write a check
          tomorrow.

                         NIKKI
          And suddenly it's her show?

                         TESS
          No, it's not her show. It's my
          show. But people want to hear her
          sing. She's bringing them in off
          the streets. You better believe I'm
          building a show around her!

                         NIKKI
          I can sing too! And you know it.
          But you don't give a shit. You
          always say this is a dance troupe,
          now suddenly it's not?

                         TESS

                         NIKKI--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.

                         NIKKI
          And you expect me to dance behind a
          girl who struts in with a new pair
          of shoes she got for sleeping with
          Marcus Gerber?

                         TESS
          (unlocking her car)
          Nikki, you're wasted. Go home.

                         NIKKI
          I won't be upstaged by some slut
          with mutant lungs!
          Tess hurls the costumes in the trunk of her car, furious.

                         TESS
          So don't be! Leave! If you don't
          want to be a part of what's
          happening here, then I don't want
          you around.

                         NIKKI

                         (AGHASST)
          You'd destroy our friendship and
          break up the group over some girl
          you barely know?

                         TESS
          Since when do you care about
          friendship? Or this group? You're
          a trainwreck, Nikki! You put
          tequila on your breakfast cereal!
          I'm struggling to survive here, and
          you show up too drunk to dance!
          You call that loyalty?
          Nikki just looks at her--

                         NIKKI
          Okay, then. I quit!
          Nikki stomps off. Tess sighs --

                         TESS

                         NIKKI-- WAIT--

                         NIKKI
          Marcus says you're losing the club
          anyway!

                         (MOCKING HER)
          "They don't come to hear us sing"

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.

                         NIKKI (CONT'D)

                         (SOTTO)
          Stupid bitch.
          Nikki flips her off and keeps walking. Then turns once more:

                         NIKKI (CONT'D)
          By the way: I slept with Vince the
          day after your honeymoon.
          Tess's eyes narrow. She grabs a HIGH-HEELED PUMP and HURLS
          it. It flies through the air and hits Nikki in the back of
          the head. Nikki SCREAMS, whips around, incredulous, to see:
          TESS, running right at her. Nikki bolts, heading for her
          car. She jumps in, locks the door just as Tess SMASHES her
          fist on the window and KICKS the door. Nikki starts the car.

                         NIKKI (CONT'D)
          You crazy bitch!
          Nikki screeches off, leaving Tess alone in the parking lot.
          Tess stands there a moment, then HEADS back into the club.

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT

          The club is totally empty. Everyone is gone. Tess ENTERS,
          GRABS her bag as she spots a cabaret chair lying on it's side
          on stage. She crosses onto the stage. Picks up the chair
          as...

          DAVE (O.S.)
          Night, Tess.
          Tess looks up, Dave is closing up the sound booth.

                         TESS
          Night, Dave.
          Dave FLIPS a big lever, and almost all the lights go OUT,
          leaving one shaft of light across the stage. We HEAR Dave
          leave, as the street door closes shut. Tess alone on stage.

          BEGIN TESS SOLO SONG NUMBER. TO BE WRITTEN.

          INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Ali enters quietly, all dressed up. She slips off her heels
          and tiptoes to the bedroom. She slowly opens the bedroom
          door, then stops when she sees:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.
          JACK, asleep in the bed. Ali looks at him, then looks at the
          couch. Empty. She closes the door, fluffs the pillow, lies
          down on the couch, and pulls the blankets up over her.
          She lies in the darkness. PUSH THROUGH the wall to see Jack,
          lying awake in the bed, the cat on his lap.

          EXT. LOS ANGELES - WIDE PANORAMA - MORNING


          THE SOUND OF A COFFEE GRINDER

          INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - MORNING

          CLOSE ON Ali, sleeping on the sofa-- abruptly wakes to the
          deafening grinding of coffee. She gets up, drags herself to
          the kitchen. Sees Jack, grinding the coffee way longer than
          is necessary.

                         ALI
          You really need to do that at 6 in
          the morning?
          He turns, sees her.

                         JACK
          Little overdressed for breakfast.

                         ALI
          My pajamas were in my bedroom.
          Which was occupied.

                         JACK
          Well, you're never here so... it's
          stupid for me to crash on the couch
          every night when there's a
          perfectly good empty bed.
          Jack grinds the coffee beans again. Ali winces.

                         ALI
          So -- you want the bedroom back?
          Is that what you're saying?

                         JACK
          The bed should be used by someone.

                         ALI
          Hey, I'm home every night. Maybe
          not when you think I should be, but
          last I checked, you were my
          roommate, not my mother.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          However, since it's an issue, what
          the hell, take the bed, I'll sleep
          on the sofa. I don't care.

                         JACK
          Fine.

                         ALI
          Fine.

                         JACK
          You'll have to move all your shit.

                         ALI
          I realize that.

                         JACK
          Cause the room's a total mess --

                         ALI
          I'll move my stuff, God --

                         JACK
          Clothes, make-up, shoes, hair
          things.

                         ALI
          Jesus, Jack, what is your problem?
          Ever since I started hanging out
          with Marcus, you've been acting
          like a class-A prick. Is there
          something you want to say?

                         JACK
          What? No. What do I care? You're
          ambitious, he can make things
          happen, go ahead, make a deal with
          the devil, what's it to me?

                         ALI
          First of all: He's not the devil.
          He's a smart businessman. And oddly
          enough-- a gentleman.

                         (JACK SCOFFS)
           Second: I'm gonna take the couch,
           and you're gonna 86 the attitude.
           Or I'm finding another place to
           live.
          She storms out of the kitchen, tripping over the cat-- a LOUD
           MEOW! as the cat scurries away, Jack intercepting him--

                         JACK
          And try not to kill the cat!

           CLOSE ON: A DIAMOND RING as it's placed on the hand of A
          VERY PREGNANT GEORGIA. Wearing an adorable mini-skirt
          maternity wedding dress. She looks at DAMON with devotion.
          Ali, Tess, Coco, Sean and Jack, all watching the ceremony.
          Ali looks over at Jack. He looks at her, then away.

          EXT. SUNSET TOWER HOTEL - NIGHT - CARRY MUSIC

          The reception is underway. GUESTS are drinking, dancing with
          the iconic backdrop of Hollywood behind them. Ali, Sean,
          Coco and Tess stand together drinking, overlooking the city.
          ACROSS THE TERRACE, Jack is talking on his cell phone.

                         JACK
          What do you mean, you're still in
          New York? ...So you just -- decided
          not to come? You think you
          might've wanted to, I don't know,
          let me know??? We haven't seen each
          other in six months.
          ACROSS THE TERRACE, Ali sees Jack yelling into his phone.
          Sean sees her watching.

          BACK ON JACK

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          .why does every conversation we
          have end up being about YOUR
          future...
          Jack looks across the terrace at Ali. Moonlight on her
          shoulders. A breeze in her hair.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          .you know what, you're right. We
          both should be thinking about our
          futures. And I might just be
          looking at mine right now. Break a
          leg baby.
          Jack hangs up with finality and marches toward the bar-- His
          cell phone immediately rings again.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         101
          He sees it's Natalie, sends it to voicemail, and shuts off
          his phone. As he PASSES Sean and Coco--

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          I guess Natalie's not coming after
          all.

                         SEAN
          Oh, please, that girl? Show up at
          a party where she's not the center
          of attention?
          AT THE BAR - LATER - Jack drains one drink and orders
          another, getting very drunk. Ali sidles up to the bar.

                         ALI

                         (TO BARTENDER)
          Shot of Patron.
          Jack raises his brow. Ali drinks the shot, and without
          looking at him--

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          Lookin' kinda lonely.

                         JACK

                         (BOOZEY)
          No. Not lonely. Liberated, yes.
          Libated, absolutely. But never
          lonely. Cheers, baby--
          He raises his glass-- she rolls her eyes, walks off-- he
          follows her, playfully PUSHING her from behind.

                         ALI
          Hey-- what're we, in junior high?

                         JACK
          You still mad at me, Iowa? C'mon.
          Bring it on.
          She starts to say something as-- THE SHIRELLES start to sing
          "BABY IT'S YOU"-- Jack turns to the DJ, points both fingers
          at him and YELLS:

                         JACK (CONT'D)

          I LOVE THIS SONG, MAN!!!
          Everyone stares at the drunk guy. Ali rolls her eyes and
          walks off-- Jack swings her around, PULLING her close-- she
          just looks at him. Starts to laugh at how drunk he is-- Jack
          wraps her in his arms and starts to sing quietly in her ear.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          .Many many many nights go by, I
          sit alone, at home and cry, over
          you...

                         ALI
          Well, you're quite the crooner.
          He looks her in the eye.

                         JACK
          I'm sorry for being a class A
          prick.
           Ali smiles, surprised at his candor. He breathes a sigh of
          relief.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          And as of about...
          (bleary look at his watch,

                         CAN'T FOCUS)
          .some time ago, I am officially a
          single man.

                         ALI
          You and Natalie split up?

                         JACK
          That we did. So. That explains what
          I'm doing here all alone. What are
          you doing here all alone?

                         ALI
          Do I look alone to you?
          They share a look. Then he spins her around in his arms. She
          laughs.
          AT THE BAR, tipsy Sean and Coco stand side-by-side. Coco is
          watching the DJ spin. The DJ glances down at them.

                         COCO
          That DJ's hot.

                         SEAN
          You think?

                         COCO
          He keeps looking at me.
          Coco smiles up at him, flirty. The DJ smiles back.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.

                         COCO (CONT'D)
          Hmmm...I think he's cuckoo for Coco-
          puffs.
          They look at each other, then crack up like giggling
          schoolgirls.

          EXT. JACK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON: A KEY TRYING TO GO INTO A LOCK. Then it disappears
          from view. We hear it CLANK to the ground. Then giggles.

          ALI (O.C.)
          Whoopsie daisy --
          PULL BACK to find Jack and Ali, drunk, staring at the keys on
          the ground.

                         JACK
          Whoopsie daisy?

                         ALI
          My Nanna used to say that all the
          time. That and upsie jumpsie.

                         JACK
          Upsie jumpsie?
          (running it together)
          Upsie jumpsie, whoopsie daisy,
          upsie jumpsie, whoopsie daisy,
          upsie jumpsie --

                         (ABRUPTLY STOPS)
          When would she say that?

                         ALI
          When she wanted her dog to get on
          the bed with her. That is --

                         (DRUNKEN WHISPER)
          when she was alive.
          Their eyes meet. A connection. Then, staring into her eyes:

                         JACK
          (trying to be serious)
          The dog, or Nanna?
          Ali bursts out laughing. So does Jack, as he pushes the door
          open, and they fall into the apartment.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.

          INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Jack and Ali stumble in, Jack knocks the lamp over trying to
          turn on the light. It BREAKS. Ali giggles as she plops down
          on the couch, struggling to take off her leather boot. No
          luck. She holds her legs out.

                         ALI
          Help me.
          Jack gets the lamp to standing, then grabs one of Ali's
          boots, slides it off, dumps it. Then he tries the second --
          it sticks -- he pulls harder -- the boot pops off and he
          careens backwards, crashing into the lamp, knocking it over
          again. Ali cracks up. He turns to the lamp.

                         JACK
          (like to a dog)
          Stay.
          He turns back to Ali, regains composure, bows

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Good night.
          He backs away, into the bedroom. Ali looks confused.

                         ALI
          Oh. Okay.

                         (BEAT)
          Good night.
          Jack disappears into the bedroom and closes the door. Ali
          stares at it, surprised. Then resigned. Oh, well. She
          undoes her bra, threads it through her top and out the arms.
          Then Jack's door opens. He stands in the doorway in matching
          "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" pajamas, leaning against the
          doorframe like Hugh Hefner in his finest silk smoking jacket.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          Cute jammies.

                         JACK
          A gift from my mother. Never worn
          them.

                         ALI
          Go figure.
          Jack walks past Ali, toward the door.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.

                         JACK
          Forgot to lock up.

                         (HE DOES)
          Okay. Night.

                         ALI
          Night again.
          He walks back into the bedroom and once gain shuts the door.
          Ali smiles to herself, plumps her pillow. The door flies
          open again -- Jack's there in just the pants, no top.

                         JACK
          Water. No hangover.
          He stumbles past Ali to the kitchen, drinks from the tap.
          After a moment he returns to the bedroom, nodding to Ali.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Night.
          Ali just nods. He closes the door. Ali smiles, waiting.
          After a beat, the door opens again. Jack is there, in boxers.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Hungry.
          He walks past her to the kitchen, opens a box of cereal,
          pours it into his mouth. Grabs some milk from the fridge,
          pours it into his mouth, too. Returns to the bedroom,
          crunching. He closes the door. Then -- very quickly -- he
          opens it again and walks out.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          I know I forgot something else, but
          I just can't remember what...

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          Door locked, water, food...
          He wanders out into the room, past Ali, and we see from
          behind he is butt-ass naked. She cracks up.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          What's so funny?
          She covers her face. He glances down.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Well I never!
          He strides back to the bedroom, shutting the door. After a
          moment, he comes back out dressed in an old, flowered
          bathrobe and fur-lined orange hunting cap.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          I remembered what I forgot to do.

                         ALI
          What?

                         JACK

                         (SERIOUS)
          Kiss you goodnight.
           He crosses to her, takes her in his arms, and kisses her.
           She kisses back, making up for all their lost time.
           MUSIC UP: "PRISONER" a big, soulful ballad.

                         JACK
          I've been wanting to do this since
          you first walked in the club.
          She cocks an eyebrow at him.

                         ALI
          Sure got a funny way of showing it.
          He smiles at her.

                         JACK
          I'll show you an even funnier way --

          pulls on one fishnet stocking. Jack watches, mesmerized.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          So, what about Natalie...?

                         JACK
          Natalie who?
          Ali smiles. Rolls the stocking up over her shapely thigh,
          then slowly takes it off. Looks at Jack. He strikes his
          chest, struck by cupid--

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Do it again.

          Jack and Ali, twisted up in the sheets, their respective
          eyeliners smeared. Ali's platinum bob sticks up in all
          directions. Half of a fake eyelash stuck on her cheek.

          EXT. JACK'S APARTMENT - THE FRONT DOOR - DAY

          CLOSE ON THE LOCK as a key is inserted. The door opens.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          109.

          INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - DAY

           A PAIR OF WOMEN'S HEELS enter the apartment and pick their
           way over last night's discarded clothes and head for:

          INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY

           Where Jack and Ali are sleeping, entwined. The heels stop at
          the base of the bed. A beat. Then, enraged:

                         NATALIE

          I KNEW IT!
          Jack bolts up in bed. Stares.

                         JACK
          Natalie!
          Ali blinks awake. Confused.

                         ALI
          Natalie?
          Jack scrambles for something to put on.

                         NATALIE
          YOU are a LIAR. You're a sneaky,
          pathetic LI-AR!

                         ALI
          (quiet, to Jack)
          What 's she doing here:

                         JACK
          I don't know!

                         NATALIE
          I LIVE HERE, you bleached out
          tramp, what the hell are YOU doing
          here?!!

                         ALI

                         (TO JACK)
          You were engaged to this woman?

                         JACK
          (finds his boxers)
          Nat, can we talk about this in the
          living room --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.

                         NATALIE
          I can't BELIEVE I bought your
          bullshit: "It's nothing, she's just
          this chick from work, she's
          nothing."

                         (TO ALI)
          That's what he called you.
          "Nothing. She's not even pretty.
          (sizing Ali up)
          Well, at least you were honest
          about one thing--

                         ALI JACK
          You said that? No, I didn't --

          NATALIE (CONT'D) JACK
          He most certainly did! Nat-- shut the fu--

                         ALI NATALIE
          Jack?!? Don't even say his name!
          As Ali grabs for a shirt--

                          JACK
           Listen, Ali-- let me just-- would
          you mind --

                         ALI
          What?!?

                         JACK
          Giving us a little privacy?

                         AL I

                         (OFFENDED)
          You want me to leave?

                         NATALIE
          Yes you! I'm the fiancee. You're a
          booty call. You go.

                         JACK
          Natalie, Jesus, STOP IT!
          Ali grabs some pants from the floor, pulls them on.

                         ALI
          Fine, I'm out of here--
          (seething to Jack)
          You said you split up!

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         NATALIE
          In one phone call? Please, you
          don't dump a girl like me on the
          phone.

                         JACK
          Both of you-- STOP IT!
          As Ali quickly grabs a few things--

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Ali-- I'm really sorry-- I--

                         ALI
          So am I.
          She gathers up more things, really pissed--

                         JACK
          Wait-- do you need money for a
          Motel or...
          Ali stifles him with an incredulous glare-- can't believe how
          this is going down. She looks at him, so incredibly hurt.
          Grabs her suitcase and brushes past him, stuffing her
          belongings into it. Jack goes after her--

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          Ali, wait a second-- don't--
          (as the door SLAMS)
          --go.

                         (BEAT)
          Shit.
          Jack looks at Natalie. She folds her arms.

          EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT - MORNING

          Ali knocks on a door, suitcase in hand. A beat. Then a good-
          looking guy, who's obviously just woken up, answers with a
          blanket wrapped around him. He is the DJ from the wedding.

                         ALI
          Oh. I'm sorry. I think I have the
          wrong apartment. I'm looking for
          Sean?
          (off his blank look)
          Brown hair? 5'10n? Early 30's?

                         DJ
          Oh, Sean! I thought he said John.
          He's asleep. Come in.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          112.
           The DJ shuffles inside. Ali follows as he leads her to the
          bedroom. He points to Sean in the bed.

                          DJ (CONT'D)
          That him?
          Ali nods. Sean's eyes pop open, confused to see her.

                         SEAN
          What are you doing here?

                         ALI
          Long story.
          Sean notices the guy in the blanket.

                         SEAN
          Ali, this is Mike.

                         DJ
          Mark.

                         SEAN
          Mark???

                         (THEN)
          Oh. Anyone want coffee?

                         ALI
          I'll make it. You two get
          acquainted.

          INT. SEAN'S KITCHEN - DAY

          Ali makes coffee, looking out the window at Hollywood. Her
          phone rings. She answers right away, thinking it's Jack.

                         ALI

                         HEY--

          MARCUS (OVER PHONE)
          Hey gorgeous.

                         ALI
          Oh. Marcus.

                         MARK

                         (WANDERING IN)
          Is the coffee ready?

          MARCUS (OVER PHONE)
          Who's that?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          113.

                         ALI
          Mark. Or Mike. Jury's still out.

          MARCUS (OVER PHONE)
          Should I be jealous?

                         ALI
          Only if you had your eye on Sean.

          MARCUS (OVER PHONE)
          You okay? You sound down.

                         ALI
          Mmm. Maybe a little.

          MARCUS (OVER PHONE)
          I know just the cure.

                         ALI
          What's that?

           MARCUS (OVER PHONE)
           Me. But you turned me down.
          She thinks for a moment. Then:

                         ALI
          Haven't you heard? No is the new
          yes.

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - ON STAGE

           A curtain lifts revealing a black box, FIVE GIRLS from behind
          seem to be floating in blackness, their curves illuminated.
          They begin to move to the music (think WABASH BLUES, CRAZY
          HORSE SALOON) The group turns toward us--

                         ALI

          WHAT DO YOU KNOW, HOW DO YOU DO, I

          LIKE THE WAY YOU LOOK AT ME WITH

          THOSE EYES, CONFIDENTLY WISE...

          EXT. JACK'S APARTMENT - DAY


          ANOTHER SLAMMING DOOR.
          NATALIE'S HEELS storm away from the apartment. Carrying her
          bags, really PISSED, she kicks a big, fat rose blossom off a
          bush, and continues on.

          INTERCUT WITH THE SPOTLIT STAGE

                         

                         

                         

                         

          114.
          The girls continue the number. Post modern Gaultier bondage
          cages on top, bowler hats and black shorts. A HUMONGOUS moon
          hangs at the back of the theatre, the black stage awash in
          golden light.

                         ALI

          PLEASURE I'M SURE, I ' VE MET YOU

          BEFORE, BUT MAYBE NOT HERE, MAYBE

          IT WAS, SOME OTHER TIME. THIS AIN'T

          NO KIND OF PLACE FOR YOU, YOU

          BETTER MOVE ALONG...I MET A GOOD

          OLE' BOY WHO CAN. 00000, DON'T

          FOLLOW ME DOWN. IT'S A RUSE...

          EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT - DAY - CARRY MUSIC

          Marcus is waiting in his Bentley. Ali gets in. Marcus looks
          at her. She forces a smile. The Bentley rounds the corner as
          we HOLD and see JACK'S MOTORCYCLE thunder up. He gets off,
          runs to the building.

          EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT - STAIRWELL - DAY

          Sean and Mark exchange awkward good-byes.

                         SEAN
          Well. Bye.

                         MARK
          You... Take care. Sean.
          Mark turns, heads down the stairs as Jack rushes up, calling:

                         JACK
          Is Ali here?

                         MARK
          Just left.
          Mark continues down. Jack whips around, looks at him, then up
          at Sean, who nods.

                         JACK
          Where'd she go?

                         SEAN
          With Marcus.

                         JACK
          What?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          115.

                         SEAN
          I told you, opportunity doesn't
          knock forever.
          Jack burns, frustrated, then heads slowly down the stairs.
          Sean shakes his head and turns to go back inside. Then
          pauses, noticing:
          Mark, looking up at Sean's apartment, hesitating. Then he
          opens his car to get in. Sean stands there, realizing he's
          doing the same thing. He steps onto the stairwell. Calls out:

                         SEAN (CONT'D)
          Hey! You!

                         MARK

                         (LOOKS UP)
          It's Mark.

                         SEAN
          Mark. You wanna have breakfast?
          Off Mark's smile:

          INT. MARCUS'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

          Ali follows Marcus through the kitchen, to the fridge.

                         MARCUS
          My mother always said there's only
          one thing to do when you're feeling
          blue...
          He opens the fridge and pulls out a bottle of CHAMPAGNE.

                         ALI
          She was a poet.

                         MARCUS
          And a drunk.
          Ali smiles. Marcus pops the cork, fills two glasses, hands
          her one. Clinks.

                         MARCUS (CONT'D)
          To your new place.

                         ALI
          What new place?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          116.

          INT. MARCUS'S HOUSE - GUEST HOUSE - DAY

          A lavish, 1000-square-foot guest house. Marcus ushers Ali in.

                         MARCUS
          All yours.
          (off her look)
          Unpack. Move in.

                         ALI
          Marcus, I can't just--

                         MARCUS
          Sure you can.
          Marcus plops her suitcase on the bed.

                         MARCUS (CONT'D)
          Unpack. You're home.

                         ALI
          It's not even on the bus route.

                         MARCUS
          Okay, that is the first and last
          time the term "bus route" will be
          spoken in this house.
          (motions out window)
          Four cars. Which do you want?

          EXT. MARCUS'S GAZEBO - SUNSET

           Ali lies on a chaise overlooking the panoramic view of L.A.
          against a fiery red sky. Marcus comes out of the house, with
          a bottle of wine. Crosses and sits next to her on the chaise.
          Marcus refills their wine glasses. An empty bottle already
          there. She sips as she leans back and relaxes.

                         MARCUS
          Better?

                         ALI

                         (SMILES)
          Better.
          She looks out at a giant billboard at eye level.

                         MARCUS
          You're gonna be on one of those
          someday.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          117.

                         ALI
          Yeah, right.

                         MARCUS
          Sooner than you think, too. Harold
          Saint called me today. You made
          quite an impression on him.

                         ALI
          Really? What'd he say?

                         MARCUS
          He wants to make a demo with you.

                         ALI
          Are you serious? When??

                         MARCUS
          He found a little studio time on
          Tuesday.

                         ALI
          This Tuesday?

                         MARCUS
          Too soon?

                         ALI
          No! Oh my god, no, that's amazing.
          You're amazing.

                         MARCUS
          I like making you happy. Your whole
          face lights up.
          Their eyes meet. He pushes some hair out of her face.

                         ALI
          I think you're way too nice to me.

                         MARCUS
          And that's a problem because...

                         ALI
          I've had a lot to drink. And my
          judgment is off.
          He touches her face, their chemistry palpable.

                         MARCUS
          Hey, I'm a gentleman. Which means
          I'd never kiss a lady when she's...
          vulnerable.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          118.
          She looks at him.

                         ALI
          Liar.
          She leans in and impulsively pulls him into a kiss.

          INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - DAY

          Jack, alone now, collects the clothes Ali left behind. He
          reaches under the couch and sees the PHOTO of Ali and her
          mother. He picks it up, smooths out the cracks. Traces 7-
          year-old Ali's face with his fingertips.

          INT. MARCUS'S HOUSE - GUEST HOUSE - DAY

          Ali lies in a tangle of 1000-thread-count sheets. Her eyes
          blink open. She sits up alone, getting her bearings.

                         ALI
          Where am I?
          She sees a Warhol-esque PRINT OF MARCUS on the wall. She
          raises her brows then sees her disheveled reflection in a
          huge mirror: smeared mascara, hair askew.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          Who am I?
          She sees her and Marcus's clothes in a trail on the floor and
          bites her lip, remembering last night.

          INT. MARCUS'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING

          Ali, freshly showered, enters, a stranger in a strange land.
          STAFF is milling around. She HEARS a SPLASH. Looks out the
          glass windows, sees Marcus swimming laps. The HOUSEKEEPER
          passes her, nods "morning". Ali smiles.
          Then she notices a long table full of miniature MODELS of
          BUILDINGS. She takes them in, pausing at a tall, sleek MODEL
          of a glass HIGH-RISE, towering over the other models.
           She runs her finger lightly over it, intrigued. Then she
          sees the address marker: 7800 Sunset Blvd.
          Ali stares, stunned. Marcus enters, toweling himself dry.

                         MARCUS
          Morning.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          119.
          He comes up behind her, nuzzles her neck.

                         ALI
          What is this?

                         MARCUS
          Now it's a model. But when it
          grows up, it'll be a mixed-use
          space: retail and residential.

                         ALI
          This is the address of the
          Burlesque Lounge.
          Marcus shrugs, dries his hair.

                         MARCUS
          Best view on the Sunset Strip, with
          no windows. When I'm done with it,
          it'll have a thousand.

                         ALI
          You can't tear down the club.

                         MARCUS
          Actually, I can.

                         ALI
          But what about the history? That
          place is a landmark.

                         MARCUS
          Not according to the city.

                         ALI
          Does Tess know about this?

                         MARCUS
          What Tess knows and doesn't know
          isn't a big concern of mine.

                         ALI
          What makes you think she would ever
          sell the Lounge?

                         MARCUS
          She has no choice. She's going
          under.

                         ALI
          But that club is her life!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          120.

                         MARCUS
          Oh, come on, you get this. It's
          business. It's not personal.

                         ALI
          Not personal? It's pretty god damn
          personal for Tess! And Coco and
          Sean and Alexis. And what about
          Jesse? And Dave the lighting guy?

                         MARCUS

                         ALI --

                         ALI
          And what about me? It's pretty God
          damn personal to me.
          She turns to leave.

                         MARCUS
          Where are you going?

                         ALI
          To the club. Where I work.
          She marches out of the room, resolute--

                         MARCUS
          Ali-- wait!!!
          At the door she turns back and looks at him. As he starts to
          speak, she SLAMS the door shut as we HEAR "THAT'S LIFE".

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - ON STAGE - LATE AFTERNOON

           Eva Destruction does a sexy contortionist number on stage as
          the Tattooed Bumper Band plays "THAT'S LIFE" with her.
          CLOSE ON - a LINE OF SHOT GLASSES. Tequila is poured. The
          Bartenders behind the bar, Jack sits on a stool on the other
          side, his bags packed beside him. They all pick up their shot
          glasses, toast and drink as they begin to sing "THAT'S LIFE"
          in a rousing, fun, guys number.

          THE BARTENDERS AND JACK

          THAT ' S LIFE, THAT ' S WHAT ALL THE

          PEOPLE SAY.

          YOU'RE RIDING HIGH IN APRIL,

          SHOT DOWN IN MAY

          BUT I KNOW I'M GONNA CHANGE THAT TUNE,

          WHEN I'M BACK ON TOP, BACK ON TOP IN JUNE.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          121.

          EXT. PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON - CARRY MUSIC

          Tess pulls into the lot-- gets out of her car dressed to the
          nines in a tailored business suit, hair up, professional. She
          HEADS into the club--

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - SAME

          As Eva performs and the Bartenders and Jack sing, SEAN looks
          up at Dave, and MOTIONS for the SPOTLIGHT on Jack. Dave nods,
          and SWINGS the SPOTLIGHT hitting JACK. The Bartenders push
          Jack up onto the bar as he TAKES THE LEAD--

                         JACK

          .I SAID THAT'S LIFE, AND AS FUNNY

          AS IT MAY SEEM

          SOME PEOPLE GET THEIR KICKS,

          STOMPIN' ON A DREAM

          BUT I DON'T LET IT, LET IT GET ME DOWN,

          'CAUSE THIS FINE OL' WORLD IT KEEPS

          SPINNING AROUND...

          I'VE BEEN A PUPPET, A PAUPER, A

          PIRATE, A POET, A PAWN AND A KING.

          I'VE BEEN UP AND DOWN AND OVER AND

          OUT AND I KNOW ONE THING:

          EACH TIME I FIND MYSELF, FLAT ON MY

          FACE, I PICK MYSELF UP AND GET BACK

          IN THE RACE...
          The whole club is with him now, as Jack channels Sinatra,
          standing on the bar-- the Bartenders sing back-up.

                         JACK (CONT'D)

          THAT'S LIFE. THAT'S LIFE AND I

          CAN'T DENY IT. MANY TIMES I THOUGHT

          OF CUTTING OUT, BUT MY HEART WON'T

          BUY IT. BUT IF THERE ' S NOTHING

          SHAKIN' COME THIS HERE JULY...

          I'M GONNA ROLL MYSELF UP IN A BIG

          BALL AND DIE. MY, MY.
          Applause, hoots and hollers. Jack high-fives and fist pumps
          his buddies, hugs Sean, grabs his bag and suitcase and EXITS
          out the back as...
          Tess ENTERS. SEES Sean is at the bar. He looks up--

                         SEAN
          How'd it go?
          (sees her face)
          Oh, shit.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          122.
          She grabs a bottle of Tequila and a glass, turns to walk off.

                         SEAN (CONT'D)
          What are you gonna do?

                         TESS
          Right now? Get really drunk.
          THE FRONT DOORS OPEN, and Ali ENTERS, spots Tess, rushes over
          to her.

                         ALI
          Tess! I have to talk to you!
          Tess keeps walking.

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          Marcus Gerber is trying to buy the
          lounge, and he's gonna tear it down
          and build a twenty-story
          skyscraper!
          Tess stops. Slowly turns and stares at Ali, who's suddenly
          embarrassed to admit...

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          I just saw the plans.
          Tess looks at Ali. Stunned. Ali stands there, breathless,
          waiting for her reaction. But Tess just turns, continues up
          to her office, and shuts the door. Ali turns to Sean-- then
          starts after her--

                         ALI (CONT'D)
          She has to do something! She can't
          just let him --

                         SEAN

                         (STOPPING HER)
          Let it go, girl. She just got
          turned down for another loan. It's
          either foreclose, or sell to
          Marcus.

                         ALI
          So that's it? It's over?

                         SEAN
          The circle of life, baby. All good
          things must come to an end.

                         ALI
          But she can't just give up!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          123.

                         SEAN
          She's not giving up. She's going
          down with her ship. With dignity.
          Ali sits on a barstool, in disbelief.

                          SEAN (CONT'D)
          I've got something for you.
          He pulls out the photo of Ali with her mother. It's in a new
          frame.

                         ALI
          Where'd you get this?

                         SEAN
          Jack. He dropped it off on his way
          to the airport.

                         ALI
          Where's he going?

                         SEAN
          New York on the red-eye.

                         ALI
          To be with Natalie?

                         SEAN
          Pedal faster, baby, he and Natalie
          are over. You're the one he's been
          looking high and low for.

                         ALI

                         (TOUCHED)
          Really...?

                         (THEN:)
          Then why's he going to New York?

                         SEAN
          (duh!)
          Get your ass over to LAX and ask
          him yourself!
          Ali nods, jumps up from her stool, and races for the door,
          then stops, realizing:

                         ALI
          I don't have a --
          Sean tosses her his CAR KEYS.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          124.

                         SEAN
          American to JFK. Go!
          Ali catches the keys and TAKES OFF.
          - EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT - Ali (in a Prius) peels out of
           the lot, weaving through traffic as she lifts her cell.
          - INT. AIRPORT - NIGHT - CLOSE SHOT: a CELL PHONE in a
           plastic bowl moves through a security X-ray machine.

                         JACK'S VOICE
          This is Jack. Leave me a message.
          FIND Jack on the other side, as his belongings come down the
          conveyor belt. He grabs them, turns off his cell.
          - EXT. STREET - NIGHT - ALI skids through a light, veers past
          cars.
          - INT. CONCOURSE - NIGHT Jack reaches gate 43, sees a long
          line. Gets in back.
          - INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - NIGHT - Ali bolts through the
           front door, frantically checks the DEPARTURES MONITOR.
          Finds: NEW YORK JFK, GATE 43: NOW BOARDING.
          - INT. TERMINAL - NIGHT - Ali races up the escalator,
          approaching SECURITY.

                         SECURITY GUY
          Boarding pass?

                         AL I
          I have to talk to someone, he's --

                         SECURITY GUY
          No one's allowed past this point
          without a boarding pass.

                         ALI
          But I have to speak to him!

                         SECURITY GUY
          I'm sorry, miss.

                         ALI

          I HAVE TO GET TO GATE 43!

                          SECURITY GUY
          There's Gate 43, right over there.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          125.
          He points. It's the first gate beyond Security. Ali sees
          Jack, in line, about to board the plane. He's wearing his
          iPod headset, deaf to the world.

                         ALI

          JACK! JACK! JACK!
          ALL HEADS TURN to look at her, except Jack, who can't hear.
          A PLUMP WOMAN in front of him looks at Ali. Ali points to
          Jack. The woman taps Jack and points. He looks to see:
           ALI, on the other side of Security. Jack takes his earphones
           off and smiles. He crosses over to her, carrying his bag.
          They are separated by several feet of security ropes.

                         JACK
          What are you doing here?

                         ALI
          Sean told me you're going to New
          York. Please don't go!

                         JACK
          I have to. I got an offer from that
          band -- the Punk Fusion group. They
          want me to tour with them.

                         ALI
          Really?

                         JACK
          They finally had it with the flaky
          keyboardist. I'll be back in five
          weeks. Will you be here?

                         ALI
          Yes! Yes. Absolutely.

                         JACK
          What about Marcus?

                         ALI
          .Marcus who?
          They share a smile, separated by the ropes.

                         JACK
          I'm trying to figure out if I
          should kiss you now, or make you
          wait five weeks.

                         ALI
          Five weeks?! That's forever!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          126.
          ANGLE ON: A MALE AND FEMALE SECURITY GUARD, listening to the
          whole exchange.

          ATTENDANT (ON P.A.)

          FINAL BOARDING FOR FLIGHT 673 TO

          NEW YORK, JFK AT GATE 43

                         JACK
          I gotta go, that's me.
          He picks up his bags. It's killing Ali.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          I'll call you when I get there.
          Take care of Miles Davis.
          (off Ali's confusion)
          Our cat. I named him.
          They smile again. Neither wanting this moment to end. She
          waves. He nods. Then he turns and walks off to board. Ali
          watches him go.
          ON JACK, walking back to the gate-then -- he stops. Turns
          back to see Ali, but she's gone.

          FEMALE SECURITY GUARD
          Boy, you get out there and kiss
          that girl! Now!
          Jack looks at her, then quickly turns to walk past the Male
          Security Guard.

          MALE SECURITY GUARD
          Go ahead-- but you're gonna have to
          come back through Security again.

                         JACK
          But then I'll miss my flight!

          FEMALE SECURITY GUARD
          Martin! Don't you dare keep that
          boy from kissing his girl!
          Martin looks at Jack. Then:

          MALE SECURITY GUARD
          Ah, hell. Go ahead. Bag stays here.
          Jack drops his bag, takes a running JUMP over the ROPES and
          RUNS through the crowded concourse -- startling everyone.
          ON ALI, as she walks through the concourse, reliving her last
          sight of Jack. As she's about to get on the escalator:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          127.

                         JACK

          ALI!
          She turns. Jack is there. In one fantastically romantic move,
          he pulls her into his arms, kisses her deeply -- an epic kiss
          that makes passersby stop and stare.

          ATTENDANT (ON P.A.)

          FINAL BOARDING CALL FOR FLIGHT 673

          TO NEW YORK JFK AT GATE 43.
          Jack looks at Ali.

                         ALI
          Well, go get 'em, Jack.
          He smiles, then disappears into the crowd. Ali stands there,
          watching him, gobsmacked by the kiss.

          EXT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - LATE NIGHT

          Sean's car whips into the parking lot. Ali jumps out and
          heads for the front entrance. The CONSTRUCTION WORKERS from
          the towering building across the street HOOT and CAT-CALL at
          her. She waves to them and nods: that's right, boys.

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT

          Ali enters just as Tess, in a spotlight on stage, turns
          toward the audience. She looks fabulous. Only someone who
          knows her really well could tell she's dying inside.

                         TESS
          Smoother than honey and twice as
          sweet. Each girl lovelier then the
          next. Gentlemen, hold onto your
          hats. Ladies, hold on to your
          gentlemen. We may not have
          windows.. .but we DO have...
          (motions to the girls)
          .the best view on the Sunset
          Strip.
          The audience hoots as the Burlesque Girls ENTER the stage
          dancing. (SONG TBD)
          ON ALI-- a lightbulb going on! As Tess exits the stage, Ali
          pushes through the crowd and races backstage.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          128.

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

           Tess is arriving in her office, defeated, as Ali bursts in
          behind her.

                         ALI
          Tess!

                         TESS
          You could knock-- this is still my
          office--at least for another 48

                         HOURS--

                         ALI
          But this is really, really --
          Tess holds up a hand.

                         TESS
          Not. Now.

                         ALI

                         BUT--

                         TESS
          I said -- NOT --

                         ALI
          Yes now! God damn, you are one
          stubborn mule of a woman. Anyone
          else in their right mind would have
          figured out by now, when I have
          something to tell you, you listen!
          I told you I could dance, did you
          listen? No. Big mistake. I told
          you I could sing, did you listen?
          No. Big. mistake. This time you are
          going to hear what I have to say if
          I have to tie you up with your
          corset strings and scream it in
          your God damn ear.
          For the first time someone silences Tess. Ali takes a breath.

                          ALI (CONT'D)
          Have you ever heard of air rights?

          EXT. LOFT BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY

          TWO SETS OF FIERCE HEELS and LEGS stride in unison down a
          sidewalk. PAN UP as Tess and Ali enter:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          129.

          INT. LOFT BUILDING - SALES OFFICE - DAY

          A smartly-dressed BUSINESSMAN sits at his mahogany desk deep
          in a phone conversation as WHAM! The door to his office
          flies open and Ali and Tess stride in, an overwrought
          assistant on their heels.

                         BUSINESSMAN

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Jim -- Jim -- hang on, I'm gonna
          have to call you back -- Jim!
          Damnit, Nancy, get him back.
          Assistant scurries out. Businessman turns to Tess.

                         BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
          Back with more noise complaints?

                         TESS
          You offered to buy my club a few
          years back. I said no.

                         BUSINESSMAN
          And now you've changed your mind.

                         TESS
          Not exactly.
          Tess smiles at him. Looks at Ali, who's not smiling. She
          elbows her. Ali starts smiling. Tess walks up to the desk and
          sits herself down. Ali does the same.

                         BUSINESSMAN
          I'm confused.

                         TESS
          Go with me, there's a good ending,
          I promise. How much will these
          condos you're building sell for?

                         BUSINESSMAN
          They start at one million and go
          up, depending on the view.

                         TESS
          What if I told you a twenty-story
          high-rise was going up where my
          club is?

                         (TO ALI)
          Would twenty stories block his
          view?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          130.

                         ALI
          Ten stories would. Twenty would
          decimate them. Leaving behind a lot
          of angry homeowners staring across
          the street at fluorescent light
          bulbs and dirty windows.

                         TESS
          So. Mr. ?

                         BUSINESSMAN
          Anderson.

                         TESS
          Mr. Anderson. Your pretty million-
          dollar ocean views are going away
          because I'm selling my building to
          a developer tomorrow who'll have
          his twenty stories all framed up by
          the time you start selling --

                         ALI
          Trying to sell--

                         TESS
          Trying to sell these condos.

                         (BEAT)
          Or. I can put you in a position
          where your buyers could be
          guaranteed their million-dollar
          views forever.

                         BUSINESSMAN
          I'm listening.

                         TESS
          As am I. As long as you're telling
          me you'll have a check to me by
          5:00 today.

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - EVENING

           The BUMPER BAND PLAYS. Vince sits with his POSSE. His
           cocktail waitress/girlfriend approaches with an empty tray.
          She whispers to him:

                         COCKTAIL WAITRESS
          Sorry, baby, they cut you off at
          the bar. Said you have to pay cash.

                         VINCE
          What? I co-own this goddamn place--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          131.
          Tess comes up behind him.

                         TESS
          Not anymore you don't. I'm buying
          you out.

                         VINCE
          You can't do that.

                         TESS
          Actually, according to page 4 of
          our contract, I can.

                         VINCE

                         (SCOFFING)
          In the next 48 hours?

                         TESS
          Why postpone joy?
          She hands him a CASHIER'S CHECK. Vince stares at it.

                         VINCE
          What the hell is this?

                         TESS
          I realize it's been a while since
          you've seen one, but it's called a
          check.
          He stares at it, stunned.Then at her.

                         VINCE
          Where'd you get this?

                         TESS
          Not your business anymore. And
          neither is the lounge.

                         (POINTS)
          I'm sure you know where the door
          is. It used to be half yours.
          (re. the waitress)
          And take HER with you.
          Tess turns and goes over to the bar, where Ali spins around
          on her barstool, having heard the whole thing.

                         ALI
          How'd that feel?

                         TESS
          Not half bad.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          132.
          Tess parks it next to her. Looks at Ali. Smiles, then breaks
          into a giggle. Ali smiles. Tess laughs even harder, tears in
          her eyes now. They are just two girls laughing hysterically
          at the bar, Tess keeps trying to say something, but can't get
          it out, until she looks Ali square in the eye...

                         TESS (CONT'D)
          It felt pretty God damn awesome!
          And they crack up again. Then...

                         ALI
          And to think, you didn't even want
          me around.

                         TESS
          Oh, Jesus, here it comes.

                         ALI
          .What was it you said to me that
          first night? "Twenty bucks at the
          door will make all your dreams come
          true." That was sweet of you.

                         TESS
          Are you finished?

                         ALI
          (loving needling her)
          Kinda ironic, when you think about
          it. I started off begging you to
          make my dreams come true, and here
          we are --

                         TESS
          All right already! You want me to
          say it, I'll say it.
          She looks at her.

                          TESS (CONT'D)
          This place is the love of my life.
          The only dream I've ever had. I
          don't know what I would have done
          if I had lost it.

                         (HEARTFELT NOW)
          Thank you.
          A moment between them... as Tess SPOTS NIKKI ENTER the club
          carrying her dance bag--a little fresher than we've seen her
          before, and sober. Nikki looks over at Tess... then
          approaches. Ali turns away on her bar stool, respectfully.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          133.

                         NIKKI

                         (SHEEPISH)
          I crossed the line.
          Tess crosses her arms, and with a smirk on her face--

                         TESS
          Again.

                         NIKKI
          Again, and I wanna come home--

                         TESS

                         AGAIN--

                         NIKKI
           Yes, again! Did you fill my spot or
           what...?

                          TESS
           What do you think?
          Tess and Nikki share a look.

                          TESS (CONT'D)
           Curtain's up in 20. Shake a leg.
           Nikki smiles, hikes her dance bag over her shoulder and heads

                         BACKSTAGE--
          Ali looks at Tess quizzically--

                         ALI
          Just like that?

                         TESS
          If I had a dollar for every time
          she's quit...

                         ALI
          Really?

                         TESS
          We all fight. Bitch. Love and hate.
          And then make up. Just like
          sisters.

                         ALI
          I never had a sister.

                         TESS
          Me neither. THANK GOD.

                         (THEN)

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          134.

                         TESS (CONT'D)
          Now get your cute little ass and
          big ole' voice up on stage, cause
          this is Burlesque, baby girl, where
          the women are always on top, and
          the men like it that way. Like I've
          always said --

                         ALI/TESS
          You can't keep a good girl down.

          BACKSTAGE DRESSING ROOM
          Ali walks into the dressing room. Sits down in front of her
          mirror. Across the room, Nikki is sitting at hers. Ali looks
          at Nikki in the reflection of her mirror. Their eyes meet.
          Then Nikki nods. And Ali nods back. For the first time, a
          mutual respect.
          All the other girls begin to pour into the dressing room.
          Chatting, gossiping, changing their clothes. The legs, boobs,
          fishnets, etc. Things back the way there were, and the way
          they'll always be.
          ON ALI. She looks at herself in the mirror. Picks up the make-
          up brush Tess gave her. Dips it in water. Then applies a line
          on her eye expertly. She smiles to herself. MUSIC UP: A heavy
          bass drumlin beat which takes us to...

          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT - CARRY MUSIC

          A SPOTLIGHT. MOVING down the smoke-filled shaft of light as--
          A FIGURE RISES into view at the back of the stage. Over the
          contemporary BEAT, we HEAR a beautiful classic opera
          (Carmen?) REVEAL...it's NIKKI! She sings a line or two in an
          amazing operatic voice that totally blows us away. Then ...a
          DANCE BEAT KICKS IN as COCO comes into view, and sings
          another line. Then Jessie. Then Scarlett. And FINALLY...
          Ali RISES into view, wearing a diamond studded Gaultier-type

          is a contemporary dance song about BURLESQUE with a vintage

          ON STAGE, ALI and the entire company explode in a surreal
          whirl of dancing. Turning. Kicking. Arched backs. Legs

           He is 20, normal looking, not too nebbish, punkish, bookish,
           or stylish. He is a high-strung guy, enjoying a rare moment
           of un-self-consciousness.
                         
                          MAX
           There's an old joke. It comes from "The
           Iliad," but I think it was popularized by
           Oscar Wilde. It goes like this:
           ...A bear's taking a shit, like, out in the
           woods one day. And he sees this rabbit,
           also taking a shit. The rabbit, wait, I
           mean, the bear, he's shitting up a storm,
           cuz he's been eating Mexican. The
           wiping's taking forever, and his shit
           keeps sticking to his fur. Wait, what
           happens next? Oh, right-- he asks the
           rabbit if he ever has trouble wiping. The
           rabbit says no, shit just slides right
           off him. So the bear picks the rabbit up
           and wipes his ass with him.
           (pause, as if for applause)
           Well, I never said it was a good joke.
           And see, that makes it perfect, because
           it's pretty much the story of my life.
                         
           We can now see that he's perched on a stool, wearing a REM t-
           shirt and old jeans. He gesticulates vaguely as he talks.
                         
                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Growing up, my parents were huge Woody
           Allen fans. Still are. Personally, I hate
           him. Same thing with the Beatles, such a
           part of my background that I must have
           been about 16 by the time I realized how
           useless it was to rebel by ignoring the
           Beatles or any other cultural artifact of
           their generation. Even if I did spend my
           childhood hearing my father go on and on
           about how, like, Nirvana would never mean
           anything because they're not the Beatles,
           blah-blah. I don't know, this is all
           starting to sound a little bit too
           angsty, you know, and that's about the
           last thing I'm going for here... Shit, I
           really got off track there, didn't I?
                         
           As Max shakes his head, a hanging RADIO MIKE comes into view.
           It has the call letters of a college radio station on it.

           High on the wall behind him, a glowing "ON AIR" light is
           revealed. The perspective is skewed, the studio appears
           cavernous and completely barren.
                         
          2 INT. MAX'S CHILDHOOD HOME ­ FLASHBACK ­ DAY 2
                         
           YOUNG MAX, about five, sits on the floor and watches BANANAS
           with his FATHER, a large, relaxed man with a mustache who
           reclines in a tacky 80's chair and smokes a cigar.
                         
           MAX (O.S.)
           Anyway, like the Beatles thing­ and this
           is the point of that whole long-winded
           example­ I was force-fed Woody Allen from
           a young age. I remember watching Bananas
           when I was about five. Of course, I hated
           it.
                         
           Young Max is laughing hysterically at the screen.
                         
           Max stands to the side, watching his younger self and his
           father. The radio mike hangs in front of him.
                         
                          MAX (CONT'D)
           This is my old house. We lived here, in a
           dull suburb of New York, until I was ten,
           when we moved to a different house in a
           different dull suburb of New York.
                         
           On TV, a woman is bit in the breast by a snake and is chased
           by a group of soldiers.
                         
                          YOUNG MAX
           Daddy, why are they running after her?
                         
                          FATHER
                          (KINDLY)
           Someday, you'll understand. Pay
           attention, you'll learn something.
                         
           Young Max turns back to the screen, wide-eyed.
                         
          3 INT. MAX'S SECOND HOME ­ FLASHBACK 3
                         
           In pajamas, ADOLESCENT MAX, 16, watches a newer TV in an
           identical family room. This time, ANNIE HALL is playing.
                         
           MAX (V.O.)
           Oh yeah. This wasn't the first time I saw
           Annie Hall, but it was the first time I
           actually appreciated it. I was flipping
           channels on a Saturday afternoon, and
           there it was, and I was stunned to find I
           loved it, more stunned to find that my
           parents may have had a point all along.

          4 INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY ­ FLASHBACK 4
                         
           Adolescent Max walks alone to class. Other students rush by
           in groups. He looks a little lost.
                         
           MAX (V.O.)
           Oh God, high school. I hated this place.
           I was a Junior when I gave up trying to
           fit in. Fortunately, being a social
           outcast is a lot easier when your school
           is filled with idiots.
                         
           A pair of GOTH POSERS pass. Max keeps his distance. From the
           other direction, a 6 FOOT TALL GIRL makes eyes at Max. He
           walks into a water fountain, drops his books.
                         
          5 INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM ­ FLASHBACK 5
                         
           Adolescent Max gets hit in the face with a volleyball.
           Everyone laughs at him, including the COACH.
                         
           Max stands to the side and winces.
                         
                          MAX
           There was something in Annie Hall I
           identified with. Maybe it was the style
           of humor, or the defeatist attitude, I
           don't know. All I know is, I kept going
           back. Different people are inspired by
           different things, and my source of
           inspiration became a 20-year-old movie
           about a failed relationship.
                         
           The volleyball rolls over and he picks it up.
                         
          6 INT. RADIO STATION -- PRESENT 6
                         
           From behind Max, we see the station as it really is: small,
           dark, cramped, and totally filled with crap. Max wears
           headphones, sits before a large console and audio gear.
                         
           He now holds a volleyball.
                         
                          MAX
           So after high school I ended up here.
           There was never really any choice, not
           going to college was not an option. Of
           course, I brought Annie with me. Good
           thing, too.

          7 INT. JEN'S ROOM ­ FLASHBACK ­ NIGHT 7
                         
           Max is with five friends in the double, and they all have
           lingering style-baggage from high school (eg. bad haircuts).
                         
                          MAX
                          (TO CAMERA)
           It was freshmen year when we started
           watching Annie Hall as a tradition.
                          (LOOKING AROUND)
           Jeez, this must have been the very first
           time. What's Amy doing here? I'm pretty
           sure Amy wasn't here.
                         
           AMY is attractive, bookish, and sitting on Max's bed.
           CHARLES, a skinny guy in a large chair, tries to get her
           attention by wiggling his eyebrows seductively.
                         
           Max puts the tape in the VCR, hits rewind, and moves to sit
           on his bed. He pauses when he sees how close he'll come to
           Amy. Finally, he climbs over her and awkwardly sits at the
           far end.
                         
           Amy watches, rolls her eyes, and looks at BETH, who shakes
           her head sadly. Beth is pretty in an earthy way, spunky and
           sad at the same time. She looks sympathetically at Max, who
           is trying not to act nervous (and failing).
                         
           The couple is SAM, who's short and charismatic, with a cool,
           slightly punkish personal style; and JEN, same height, cute
           and serious, conservative dress. They lie on the floor
           together.
                         
                          MAX (CONT'D)
                          (TO CAMERA)
           That's Sam and Jen. Sam was the alpha-
           male of our group, which tends to consist
           mostly of zeta-males. He had been going
           out with Jen a couple weeks and we were
           all waiting to see if she would change
           him...
                         
           Sam slides a pillow under her.
                         
                          SAM
           Are you comfortable, honey?
                         
                          JEN
           I'm fine, Sam. I was worried about you.
           Sure you don't want me to move over?
           5.

           Oh no, no, Jen, if you're happy, I'm
           happy.
                         
           Max and Charles exchange a look-- there they go again. Max
           makes a show of putting a pillow under a large Darth Vader
           doll. Beth laughs, Amy is amused. Sam looks back and is
           embarrassed. Jen rolls her eyes and gives Sam a look.
                         
                          JEN
           Are we gonna watch this movie or what?

           Wow, what a good movie.

                          (TO MAX)
           I can see why you like this so much. It
           reminded me of you.
                         
                          MAX
           Uh, thanks, I guess. Does that mean you
           liked it?
                         
           Max and Amy stand and face each other as the lights fade to

                          AMY
           I didn't say I liked it, I said it
           reminded me of you. It reminded me of
           what I didn't like about you, the
           cynicism, the neurotic insecurity, and oh
           yeah, when you started calling me every
           day. All the reasons we were never more
           than friends.

           Well, at least you're being honest.
                         
                          AMY
           Of course I'm being honest. This is a
           fantasy extrapolated from a flashback.
           How could I lie to you?

           Charles walks by, Amy takes his arm, and they disappear into

           ERICA bursts through the crowd. Erica is mad. Max follows
           behind her, placating.
                         
                          ERICA
           AND WHAT IS IT WITH JEWISH MEN AND THEIR
           PENIS ISSUES?!
                         
           Max freezes in place. The entire crowd of students turns to
           look at him. He manages a weak smile and turns back to Erica,
           but she's gone, out the doors into the night.
                         
           Max turns back to the crowd and shrugs, but the crowd turns
           away. Max suddenly sees someone: Beth, looking at him. He
           blushes, self-conscious, and hurries away.
                         
           MAX (V.O.)
           And even when it went right, it didn't.
                         
          11 INT. STACY'S ROOM -- NIGHT -- FLASHBACK 11
                         
           Max and STACY stumble in, inebriated, laughing.
                         
                          MAX
           ...And then I, then I, after I called the
           pizza place, I called an ambulance, and
           timed them.
                         
                          STACY
           Who won?
                         
                          MAX
           The pizza, of course. The paramedics took
           35 minutes to arrive.
           7.
                         
                         
                         
                          STACY
           I can't believe you! Did you get in
           trouble?
                         
                          MAX
           The Station Manager said I couldn't go on
           the air ever again.
                         
                          STACY
           So what'd you do?!
                         
                          MAX
           I gave him the pizza!
                         
           They collapse on the bed, laughing. Stacy rolls over and
           kisses Max on the lips. His eyes go wide and he frantically
           crawls backwards.
                         
                          STACY
           What? Don't you like me?
                         
                          MAX
           It would never work.
                         
                          STACY
           How would you know?
                         
                          MAX
           I know. I have a sixth sense.
                         
                          STACY
           You see dead people?
                         
                          MAX
           I see dead relationships.
                         
           Stacy sits up, frustrated, the mood ruined.
                         
                          MAX (CONT'D)
                          (TO CAMERA)
           That was all true, but there was
           something else, though. I mean, there I
           was, drunk, in a girl's bedroom, and the
           only thought running through my mind was...
                         
          12 EXT. CAMPUS QUAD ­ DAY ­ FLASHBACK 12
                         
           Max speaks to someone O.S.
                         
                          MAX
           ..."What about Beth?"
                         
           Max is talking to Beth. It's a beautiful Spring day.
           8.
                         
                         
                         
                          MAX (CONT'D)
           I mean, I know we're just friends, but
           you really mean a lot to me and we've
           been spending a lot of time together
           lately, and maybe... I guess what I'm
           saying is, maybe we could try going out
           on a date or something?
                         
                          BETH
           Max...
                         
                          MAX
           I mean, it wouldn't have to be, uh...
                         
                          BETH
           Sure.
                         
                          MAX
           We wouldn't have to... What?
                         
                          BETH
           I'd love to. How's tomorrow night?
                         
                          MAX
           Um, yeah, it would have to be after, or
           maybe... Yeah, tomorrow, uh, tomorrow
           night's fine.
                         
                          BETH
           Great. I know the perfect thing.
                         
           She splits, leaving Max befuddled at his change of fortune.
                         
          13 EXT. LIBRARY -- NIGHT 13
                         
           Max and Beth are walking through the night in overcoats.
                         
                          BETH
           Never?
                         
                          MAX
           Not until Sam and Jen.
                         
                          BETH
           A perfect record. Wow.
                         
                          MAX
           I don't get what the fuss is. I knew you
           and that Chris guy wouldn't last a week
           as soon as I saw you together.
                         
                          BETH
           But you can tell with everybody? I don't
           know if that's sad or incredible.
           9.
                         
                         
                         
                          MAX
           Or incredibly sad. I'm amazed I'm the
           only one who can tell. Take any couple.
           If it's not incompatible lifestyles, it's
           conflicting priorities. If it's not that,
           it's usually clashing levels of self-
           esteem. It's always something.
                         
                          BETH
           Living with you would be a nightmare. I'd
           be afraid to bring any boyfriends home.
           Oh, uh, sorry.
                         
          Awkward pause.
                         
                          MAX
           Well, just because I see it, doesn't mean
           I talk about it. I don't say a word to my
           suitemates.
                         
                          BETH
           You guys never talk about anything
           important anyway.
                         
                          MAX
           Oh, come on, we have philosophical
           discussions all the time.
                         
                          BETH
           Like whether Voltron could kill the
           Transformers?
                         
                          MAX
           To name one hot-button issue, yes. You
           want us to talk about girls? Sam is
           nearly married to Jen, Charles doesn't
           want his relationships to last, Tommy's
           girlfriends are located in online
           chatrooms across the country, and Scott,
           well... you know.
                         
                          BETH
           For such "close" friends, it just seems
           weird, that's all. I must admit, I'm a
           lot closer to you than any of them.
                         
          They are at the Library.

          14 INT. LIBRARY LOBBY 14
                         
           Max and Beth remove their coats, revealing formal wear. OTHER
           STUDENTS give them looks. An older female LIBRARIAN
           approaches.
                         
                          LIBRARIAN
           Ah, you must have the reservation for
           booth seven.
                         
                          BETH
           Yes, that's us.
                         
                          MAX
           What?
                         
                          LIBRARIAN
           Right this way, then.
                         
                          MAX
           "Reservation"?
                         
                          LIBRARIAN
           You'd be surprised how many of you
           lovebirds we get in here.
                         
           She winks and leads them to the elevator. Beth smiles shyly
           and looks at Max, but he is merely embarrassed. Her smile
           fades.
                         
          15 INT. LIBRARY MEDIA ROOM 15
                         
           Max and Beth are watching the opening credits of Annie Hall
           on a tiny TV in a cubicle. They are surrounded by other
           students in cubicles.
                         
                          BETH

           Well, this isn't exactly what I had in
           mind.
                         
                          BETH
           What do you mean?
                         
                          MAX
           For starters, I have a serious problem
           with spending any time in the library
           when I don't have to. I'm here once or
           twice a year as it is. Plus...

           What's the point of seeing this together

           Max and Beth leave the library. Their dispositions have
           switched: Max is perky while Beth is subdued.
                         
                          MAX
           I can't believe how many great lines
           there are. Even the little throwaways,
           like when she parks and he's like,
           "That's okay, we can walk to the curb
           from here."

           Beth stops him, and they sit on a bench. The night is cold.
           They sit close and lean in, speaking in hushed tones.

                          BETH
           Look, Max, this isn't going to work.
                         
                          MAX
           Wait a second.
                         
                          BETH
           Okay. No more jokes. Now. Tell me how you
           feel.
                         
                          MAX
           About what?
                         
                          BETH
           About me.
                         
                          MAX
           I, I...
                          (EXASPERATED)
           Why are you doing this? Since when have
           you gotten "serious" about relationships?
           Your last boyfriend dumped you after four
           days.
                         
          Beth sits up, pulls her jacket closed.
                         
                          BETH
           Well, that was intimate. Thanks, Max.
           13.
                         
                         
                         
                          MAX
           No wait, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, hold on.
                         
                          BETH
           Max, I don't think this is such a good
           idea. I mean, it would be really foolish
           to jeopardize our friendship.
                         
                          MAX
           No, it wouldn't!
                         
                          BETH
           We shouldn't have rushed into this. I'm
           sure you know it wouldn't have worked
           out.
                         
                          MAX
           I don't know that.
                         
                          BETH
           Please tell me we haven't hurt our
           friendship. You don't even know how much
           you mean to me.
                         
                          MAX
           I'm starting to get the idea.
                         
           He's dazed, slightly ill. Beth touches his arm gently and
           walks away. Max turns to us. A radio mike swings into view.
                         
                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Things weren't the same after. We quickly
           became the kind of friends who say Hi on
           the paths but don't stop walking. Then,
           she moved across campus and changed
           majors, and basically, except for the
           random phone call, I haven't seen her in
           ages.

           Max, speaking in the empty station, suddenly gets intense.
                         
                          MAX
           All these dates had one thing in common!
           And it took Charles, of all people, to
           point it out to me.

          18 EXT. CAMPUS QUAD ­ TODAY -- FLASHBACK 18
                         
           It's late January and the campus is showing signs of a
           temperamental winter.
                         
           MAX (V.O.)
           This morning, we were skipping class.
                         
           Max and Charles walk across the quad towards us. At first,
           they are only specks in the distance.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Max, you're insane.
                         
                          MAX
           It's ridiculous that even at a liberal
           school like this, I have to put up with
           anti-Semitism.
                         
                          CHARLES
           So you got a C minus! Don't you think
           you're getting carried away?
                         
                          MAX
           He couldn't just fail me, think about it.
           The paper was about my grandparents'
           experience in the Holocaust.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Your paranoia has always been out of
           control, but this is absurd.
                         
                          MAX
           You don't understand, you're not Jewish.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Neither are you!
                         
                          MAX
           But the professor probably thinks I am.
                         
                          CHARLES
           And wasn't that the paper that you handed
           in two weeks late?
                         
                          MAX
           You know what else? I think he might be
           German.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Professor Wang? Will you stop it...
                         
           We can now see that Charles has a fedora cocked back on his
           head, and is wearing incongruous "Vegas" clothes.
           15.
                         
                         
                         
           They walk past and into the University Center.
                         
          19 INT. UNIVERSITY CENTER -- CONTINUOUS 19
                         
           It's a low-traffic time of day.
                         
                          CHARLES
           So what do you want to do tonight?
                         
                          MAX
           I'm not sure. It is the beginning of the
           semester, it's time for our Annie Hall
           night.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Have you ever noticed that the more Annie
           Hall you watch, the less successful you
           are romantically? I think we'd do much
           better if we watched, say, Ocean's 11.
                         
                          MAX
           What are you talking about? If you're
           sick of Annie Hall, that's one thing, but
           don't blame our sad little lives on it.
                         
          20 INT. GENERAL STORE -- CONTINUOUS 20
                         
           Charles picks out breath mints.
                         
                          CHARLES
           No, I'm telling you, I was thinking about
           this over break. Ever since we started
           watching it, what has your love life been
           like? And mine? Every semester, we watch
           this movie, and then spend the semester
           alone.
                         
                          MAX
           Alone? Last semester you hooked up with
           like a dozen women.
                         
                          CHARLES
           You know actresses don't count.
                          (POIGNANTLY)
           I'm looking for a meaningful,
           sophisticated relationship. Like Frank
           and Ava. No more shallow dames for this
           cat.
                         
                          MAX
                          (AGITATED)
           Where did you get this grudge against my
           favorite film?
           16.
                         
                         
                          CHARLES
           I'm just kidding around, Max. We'll watch
           it tomorrow. Tonight, there's a party.
                         
                          MAX
           And anyway, your theory fails to account
           for our collective dorkiness and bad
           haircuts. Plus, look at Sam.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Sam hasn't seen Annie Hall since freshman
           year, and he's in his third year with
           Jen.
                         
                          MAX
           So look at what not watching can do to
           you.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Ouch. Why are you still on this? I said I
           was kidding.
                         
          21 INT. RADIO STATION -- PRESENT 21
                         
                          MAX
           What a nightmare. I dunno why I can't
           stop thinking about these things. I guess
           I've been a little restless lately, since
           getting back from winter break.
           Everything's been kind of weird lately.
                         
           He grabs a CD from a rack.
                         
                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Hope you enjoyed this week's Reggae
           Revelry Hour. This is Max filling in for
           Rasta Ronnie, taking you out with a
           little Bad Religion.
                         
           He puts in the CD, hits "Shuffle/Repeat," and leaves. The
           caller request lines blink furiously.

           Max's dormitory suite: four bedrooms off a common room, which
           has three battered couches, a coffee table, and in a corner,
           several small fridges and two televisions in a pile.
                         
           Christmas lights are still up. A neon `Guinness' sign dwarfs
           it all.
           17.
                         
                         
                         
          Max and Charles are here, standing, while Sam and Jen sit on
          one couch and SCOTT and AMANDA sit on the other.
                         
          Charles puts on his gloves and coat.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Max, you're coming and that's the end of
           it. When's the last time you went to a
           party?
                         
                          MAX
           Who cares? It's unnatural. If I went into
           a stranger's house and ate their food
           under any other circumstance, I'd be
           arrested.
                         
                          CHARLES
           I'm not taking no. With Sam on board,
           it's gonna be like old times.
                         
          He gestures at Sam, who stands. Unlike the hipster from
          freshman year, Sam now resembles a middle-aged accountant.
          There are bags under his eyes and square clothes on his back.
                         
                          SAM
           Yeah, I haven't been out with you guys in
           ages.
                         
          Jen looks up from her magazine with disapproval.
                         
                          JEN
           You're going out?
                         
                          SAM
           Aw, honey, just for a little while.
                         
                          JEN
           You know I have to work until midnight.
           It's not my fault the supervisor won't
           let me out of it.
                         
          She glares. He teeters between his friends and his
          girlfriend. His girlfriend wins. He sits back down, trying to
          hide his disappointment.
                         
                          SAM
           She has a point, guys. I should catch up
           on my chemistry reading anyway.
                         
          The guys roll their eyes, let down but unsurprised.
                         
          Across the room are SCOTT, perpetually poker-faced and
          reserved, and AMANDA, understated, with the subdued manner of
          a long-suffering wallflower.
           18.
                         
                         
                         
           She sits off to the side, sneaking looks at Scott. He's
           watching a golf-related infomercial.
                         
                          AMANDA
           So Scott... How come you're not going out
           with Charles and Max?
                         
                          SCOTT
           Can't go. Graphic design work.
                         
                          AMANDA
           Oh really? I have work, too, but it's
           okay, I got a lot done today. What do you
           have to do?
                         
                          SCOTT
           Graphic design work.
                         
           TOMMY enters. He's preppier than anyone else, conservative
           clothes capped off by a goofy smile and thick glasses.
                         
                          TOMMY
           What's up, all?

           lizard.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Yeah, what are you doing tonight?
                         
                          TOMMY
           Physics lab. Fortunately, the semester's
           just begun, so before the work piles up,
           I can party. That's why the beginning of
           the semester rules.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Great, so come party with me.
                         
                          TOMMY
           I can't, I have physics work.
                         
           He disappears into his room. Charles takes Max's hat from a
           hook, jams it on his head, and shoves him towards the door.
                         
          23 INT. COLLEGE APARTMENT ­ LATER 23
                         
           A typically lame college party, still early in the night. The
           furniture is "student budget modern" type. A jazz record
           plays quietly, while pretentiously-dressed PARTY-GOERS sip
           wine and eat cheese and crackers.
                         
           Max and Charles survey the room, drinks in hand.
           19.
                         
                         
                          MAX
           Cheers to a new semester, full of
           potential that will surely go to waste.
                         
          They toast.
                         
                          CHARLES
           This is it, I'm telling you. This is the
           semester I pass all my classes and meet
           the dame of my dreams.
                         
                          MAX
           Good luck, and may she have a sister.
                         
                          CHARLES
           More importantly, may she grant us our
           occasional freedom.
                         
                          MAX
           Ah, forget about Sam. I don't like it any
           more than you.
                         
                          CHARLES
           He's become a total non-entity. Freshman
           year, we were like Frank and Deano. Now
           it's like Frank and freakin' Peter
           Lawford.
                         
                          MAX
           Hey, he was one of my best friends. Now
           we share a room and he's like a stranger.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Hottie at 3 o'clock. Keep an eye on her
           for me so it doesn't look like I'm
           interested.
                         
                          MAX
           Yeah, right, then if you fail to sodomize
           her, you'll blame me. Me, or Annie Hall.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Look, all I said was, it would explain
           our lives.
                         
                          MAX
           The problem is, every crazy theory
           explains something. I took a class last
           semester with a professor who claimed
           that the planet is being destroyed by
           white, male, meat-eating capitalists.
                         
                          CHARLES
           So? Everybody knows that.
           20.
                         
                         
                         
                          MAX
           But she had a theory that explained how:
           apparently racism, sexism, socialism,
           environmentalism, and vegetarianism are
           all inherently linked. I brought a Big
           Mac to the first class, and I thought I
           was going to be the victim of a vegan-
           socialist uprising.
                         
          Sam walks in and makes a beeline for the guys. Excitement.
                         
                          SAM
           Hey! I made it!
                         
                          CHARLES
           I can't believe it.
                         
                          MAX
           Wow, the laws of nature have stopped
           working. Maybe I should try to meet some
           chicks after all.
                         
                          CHARLES
           How'd you get away?
                         
                          SAM
           I told her I was going to the lab. She
           doesn't mind if I'm working while she is.
           How's the party?
                         
                          MAX
           Sucks. Who are they trying to be, with
           this wine and cheese? What kind of party
           doesn't even have beer?
                         
                          CHARLES
           I can get into this. It's better than
           those frat parties. Check out the fox in
           the beret.
                         
                          SAM
           Man, it's so good to be out. Between Jen,
           homework, and labs, I hardly have time
           for anything.
                         
                          CHARLES
           You could always change your major. You'd
           have a lot more free time.
                         
                          SAM
           I feel the same way about science that I
           do about Jen. It's a lot of work, but
           it's worth it.

                          SAM (CONT'D)
           I have doubts about both, actually. But
           still, what could be dumber than changing
           your major for a girl?
                         
                          MAX
           Changing your girl for a major.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Would you do it?
                         
                          MAX
           It wouldn't be an issue.
                         
                          SAM
           Of course not, when has studying ever
           interfered with what's important, like
           video hockey or your radio show that
           nobody listens to.
                         
                          MAX
           I meant, I'd have to have a girl first.
           And lay off the radio show. There's a
           reason I took the 3am slot.
                         
                          SAM
           And every time I see you doing homework,
           you're taking a break. You're the best
           I've ever seen when it comes to
           procrastinating.
                         
                          MAX
           I should be, procrastination is one of my
           favorite hobbies. Isn't it funny that my
           two favorite hobbies rhyme?
                         
          Charles' expression turns sour as he looks across the room.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Oh, shit, Sara's here.
                         
          SARA, good-looking and excitable, arrives with a theatrical
          flourish. Her age and manner indicate, among other things,
          that she is a freshman.
                         
                          SARA
           Ta-daaa! Hey guys, what's going on?
                         
                          SAM
                          (DEADPAN)
           We were just talking about the mediocre
           resonations of sub-hybrid fields.
                         
                          MAX
           I can't believe you think they're
           mediocre. Those guys rock.
           22.
                         
                         
                         
                          SARA
           (doesn't get it, doesn't care)
           Oh. Well, I just wanted to stop by and
           say "hey" to my favorite guys. So hey!
           How was everyone's break?
                         
          She is clearly talking to Charles, who is scanning the room
          over her shoulder.
                         
                          SAM
           Good.
                         
                          MAX
           It could have been better but it could
           have been worse. For me, that's good.
                         
                          SARA
           Mine was great! I partied with my best
           friend Melanie, who I haven't seen in
           ages. Aren't these parties just the best?
           So much better than the theater group
           parties.
                         
                          MAX
           I dunno, it's a bunch of 21-year-olds who
           want the 18-year-olds to know how mature
           they are.
                         
                          SARA
           Hey, Charles, you going to the fraternity
           party after this?
                         
                          CHARLES
           Ugh, no.
                         
                          SARA
           You gonna be back at your suite then?
           Maybe I'll stop by.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Uh, yeah, we should be back in, uh, many
           many hours.
                         
                          SARA
           Okay then, I'll catch up with you guys
           later.
                         
          She tugs on Charles's shirt.
                         
                          SARA (CONT'D)
                          (STAGE WHISPER)
           I missed you.
                         
          She leaves.
           23.
                         
                         
                         
                          CHARLES
           Shit, I was hoping to avoid her for at
           least a few more days.
                         
                          SAM
           What do you have against her? She seems
           nice.
                         
                          CHARLES
           First, she makes my skin crawl. Second,
           if word gets out, it'll ruin my
           reputation in the freshman dorms.
                         
          Sam looks to Max for the real story.
                         
                          MAX
           Never hook up with people in your cast.
                         
                          CHARLES
           I am a world-class knucklehead.
                         
          A pretty girl approaches.

           I'm sorry to interrupt, I thought I heard
           one of you say "Max."
                         
                          CHARLES
           One of us is Max.
                         
                          JULIE
                          (TO CHARLES)
           Oh, great, just as I hoped. I just wanted
           to say, I heard your radio show last week
           and I thought it was great. Thoughtful
           and poignant and funny, too. You know,
           you look just like I imagined, too.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Thanks.

           I'm Max.

           Huh?
                         
                          MAX
           I'm Max.
                          (SUDDENLY STRUCK)
           Oh my God, you heard my show?
                         
                          JULIE
           You're Max? Then who are you?

           Charles. I'm an actor.
                         
                          JULIE
                          (TO MAX)
           You okay? You look like you're in pain.
                         
                          MAX
           You don't get it, I can't do my show if I
           even suspect someone is listening. Now I
           have to change time slots. Again.
                         
                          JULIE
           I'm sorry, I didn't realize I wasn't
           supposed to listen.
                         
                          MAX
                          (INCONSOLABLE)
           No, it's no good, the whole episode is
           ruined. This is a disaster.

           I work in theater a lot.
                         
                          JULIE
           Alright, listen. I was kidding. Your show
           actually kind of sucked.
                         
                          MAX
           What?!
                         
                          JULIE
           Just kidding! It was awesome.
                         
                          CHARLES
           I also direct.
                         
                          MAX
           Uh, when did you tune in? I need to know
           which episode you ruined.
                         
                          JULIE
           At one point you dialed a phone sex line.
           It was hilarious. It's not every day
           someone calls 1-900-4RIMJOBS to discuss
           politics.
                         
          Sam quickly pulls Charles away as he starts to comment.
                         
                          MAX
           And she hung up. "This isn't the place
           for that kind of talk..."
           25.
                         
                         
                         
                          JULIE
           Yeah, it's like, for four dollars a
           minute, you should talk about whatever
           you want. You know the country's in
           trouble when a phone sex operator thinks
           talking politics is beneath her.
                         
                          MAX
           Perhaps she'd been screwed by
           politicians. Phone sex is just pretend
           but politics... I know my ass is still
           sore.
                         
          He catches himself and falters. Julie notices something.
                         
                          JULIE
           Listen, I'm being flagged down by my over-
           protective friends. It was nice meeting
           you, though.
                         
                          MAX
           Wait, wait. How did you know about my
           show?
                         
                          JULIE
           Someone mentioned you.
                         
                          MAX
           Anybody I know? Oh, duh, I guess it would
           have to be someone I know.
                         
                          JULIE
           It was from a good source. I was told I'd
           like you, but to really know you, I
           should hear your show.
                         
                          MAX
           What, really?
                         
          She appraises him for a beat.
                         
                          JULIE
           It was Beth.
                         
          And with that, she leaves. Max watches her, loses her in the
          crowd. Something catches his eye across the room.
                         
          MAX'S POV: Sam is in a corner, trapped by an upset Jen. From
          his gestures, he is on the defensive.
                         
          Charles moseys over.
           26.
                         
                         
                         
                          CHARLES
           Check it. Jen traded shifts and got out
           of work, so she went to the lab to
           surprise Sam. He wasn't there, and
           then Tommy gave away that he was here.
                         
                          MAX
           Busted.
                         
                          CHARLES
           And how. Let's bail before the beheadings
           begin. Plus, The Rat Pack's on HBO later.
                         
           They put on their coats.
                         
                          MAX
           How can you stand that show?
                         
                          CHARLES
           I told you, it's research. It's why I got
           three phone numbers, Max, while you were
           talking to that cutie.

           "Cutie"?
                         
                          CHARLES
           That's right. You get her name?
                         
                          MAX
           We just met. I was working up to it.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Man, you're worse at picking up chicks
           than me. We are one sad couple of bozos.
                         
           Max looks at him like he's insane.

           Alone, he kicks snow off his boots as he sheds his winter
           layers. He taps the answering machine.
                         
                          BETH
                          (ON MACHINE)
           Uh, hi, Max. Guess who? It's Beth. Been a
           while, huh? Since that lunch last August
           that somehow never happened. Anyway, uh,
           just checking in, I guess. Hope your
           break was okay. Uh, and----
           27.
                         
                         
                         
           BEEEEEEEP. The machine cuts her off. Max sighs, picks up the
           phone, dials.
                         
                          MAX
           Hello? Beth?... Sorry... Hello...? Hey, how's
           it going?... Yeah, in person... Too long... So
           anyway, I just wanted to say hi, and
           also, stop telling people to listen to my
           show... Of course I'm serious... Stop
           laughing... Of course I haven't changed...

          26 INT. COMMON ROOM -- THE NEXT MORNING 26
                         
           Sara sleeps on a couch. Charles, wearing only boxers, hung
           over and mostly asleep, passes through the living room. He
           stubs his toe and crashes into the wall.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Ow! Shit! Ow!
                         
           He continues into the bathroom. Sara wakes up and looks
           around groggily. A FLUSH. Charles walks out of the bathroom
           and blinks at Sara with surprise.
                         
                          CHARLES (CONT'D)
           Jeeezzus! Shit, sorry you um...
                         
                          SARA
           It's all right, this isn't the first time
           this has happened. At least this time I'm
           not the naked one.
                         
                          CHARLES
           It's just that, I mean, I'm just
           surprised to see you here.
                         
                          SARA
           Hmm, yeah, I must have shown up after you
           came back, or something. I was planning
           to go home, but I guess I fell asleep.
                         
           She waits for something from Charles. He doesn't respond. She
           reluctantly gets to her feet.
                         
                          SARA (CONT'D)
           Anyway, I, uh, I've got a bunch of stuff
           to do. I'll see you later.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Bye.
           28.
                         
                         
                         
          As she leaves, Max comes in, still in last night's clothes.
                         
                          MAX
           You all right?
                         
                          CHARLES
           She's around all the time! I chose to
           live with my hombres, not her. She's got
           to realize that we're not right for each
           other and get on with her life.
                         
                          MAX
           No, I mean, I thought I heard you fall or
           something.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Oh, what? I just stubbed my toe.
                         
                          MAX
           That sucks. Bad way to start the day.
                         
                          CHARLES
           The toe's the least of it.
                         
                          MAX
           This is funny, in a way. Yesterday you
           were complaining about not having any
           girls. Now you're complaining because you
           have one.
                         
                          CHARLES
           I know. It's a shame. And I was attracted
           to her once, too. What happened?
                         
                          MAX
           Want me to tell you?
                         
                          CHARLES
           No! I think I've heard enough from the
           Nostradamus of failed relationships to
           last a lifetime.
                         
                          MAX
           Speaking of failed relationships, I was
           thinking about your Annie Hall theory.
           Specifically, I was thinking that you're
           insane.
                         
                          CHARLES
           I said I was joking, so why do you keep
           bringing it up?
           29.
                         
                         
                         
                          MAX
           It's like you insulted my religion. Like,
           "Hey, Cardinal, I think Jesus might be
           why you're not getting laid..."
                         
                          CHARLES
           Your attitude's too dour. You've gotta be
           more fun.
                         
                          MAX
           It's not my fault Annie Hall's honest
           about the futility of romance.
                         
                          CHARLES
           You're just a wuss. The very thought of
           not seeing that movie scares you. You're
           like a junkie, you need movie methadone.
           Like, from now on you can only see
           Manhattan.
                         
                          MAX
           Forget it, I hate Manhattan.
                         
                          CHARLES
           You think addicts like Methadone?
                         
                          MAX
           My Uncle Harry didn't seem to mind.
                         
                          CHARLES
           So what are we doing for lunch?
                         
           Scott enters.
                         
                          SCOTT
           You mean breakfast.
                         
                          MAX
           Actually, I'm supposed to eat with Beth.
                         
           He doesn't look excited at the prospect, but Charles does.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Beth? Wow. She hasn't been around in
           ages. Say hi for me.
                         
          27 EXT. FRANNIE'S ­ DAY 27
                         
           Max walks with Beth down the city street. She carries an
           umbrella and scans the skies.
                         
                          BETH
           Wasn't it supposed to rain?
           30.
                         
                         
                         
                          MAX
           I dunno.
                         
                          BETH
           Max, it's been ten minutes and we're
           still discussing the weather.
                         
                          MAX
           So? Think of all the people who've died
           in hurricanes. I bet they think it's a
           worthy issue.
                         
                          BETH
           I just feel like there are other things
           we could be talking about. You're the one
           person I could rely on to say something
           original.
                         
                          MAX
           Okay, okay.
                          (BEAT)
           So, what classes are you taking?
                         
                          BETH
           This was a mistake, wasn't it?
                         
                          MAX
           What? No.
                         
           They stop in front of Frannie's, a small greasy spoon.
                         
                          BETH
           Look, let's just call it a day. I was
           excited to hear from you, but I can't
           take you like this.
                         
           A COUPLE exit, the guy holds the door for them. They
           hesitate. Suddenly, from inside:
                         
           CHARLES (O.S.)
           Max! Beth! Come sit with us!
                         
                          MAX
           No, I'm sorry. Don't worry about it. To
           be honest, it's nice being with someone
           besides my suitemates for a change.
                         
           They look in and see...
                         
          28 INT. FRANNIE'S ­ CONTINUOUS 28
                         
           ...Charles, Scott, Amanda, Sam and Jen, seated around a huge
           table. They are waving them in. Beth enters, Max reluctantly
           follows.
           31.
                         
                         
                         
                          JEN
           Oh my, God, Beth! It's great to see you!
                         
                          AMANDA
           It's been so long!
                         
          Everyone scoots over to make room. Max is still stunned but
          has no choice. He sits.
                         
                          JEN
           How did we ever fall out of touch? We
           shouldn't let that happen again.
                         
                          BETH
           I know! I even miss this place. I live on
           the wrong side of campus now. You guys
           still come here? It's so dark and the
           menu is tiny.
                         
                          CHARLES
           It never changes, that's why.
                         
                          SAM
                          (TO JEN)
           What are you gonna get?
                         
                          JEN
           Maybe an omelet.
                         
                          MAX
           Do you have to get eggs? I'm allergic.
                         
                          JEN
           So don't get the eggs.
                         
                          MAX
           It's just that, it's the smell. It's the
           smell that bothers me.
                         
                          JEN
           Are you serious? How can you be allergic
           to the smell of my eggs?
                         
                          BETH
           Don't worry about it, Jen. He's just
           incredibly picky about food.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Even other people's.
                         
                          MAX
           Look, if you're going to have eggs, let
           me at least switch seats with Sam, so
           I'll be farther away from it.
           32.
                         
                         
                         
                          SAM
           Max, what's up with you today? Join a
           support group.
                         
                          CHARLES
           If it really bothers you, why don't you
           and Beth switch?
                         
           This would put Beth next to Charles. She looks at him and he
           smiles. Unable to help herself, she smiles back.
                         
                          SAM
           What about people at other tables? Should
           we ask the management to stop serving egg-
           products to people upwind of you?
                         
                          JEN
           Why can't you just get along with
           everyone for once?
                         
                          MAX
           Alright, alright, you win, we'll switch.
           Come on, Beth, get up.
                         
                          BETH
                          (JOKINGLY)
           What makes you so sure I'm gonna switch?
           I don't think I'm gonna move.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Don't give in, Beth. I've got your back.
                         
                          MAX
           You owe me. Remember when you threw that
           egg at me in the dining hall?
                         
                          BETH
           Okay, I'll get up. But I'm ordering an
           omelet.
                         
           She sits down next to Charles and they smile at each other.
                         
          29 EXT. ATM NEAR THEATER ­ LATER 29
                         
           Max walks down the street toward an ATM, where a long line of
           college students has formed. Next to the ATM is an arthouse
           theater. The marquee reads "Thru Valentine's Day: ANNIE HALL
           and CASABLANCA."
                         
           He joins the ATM line. A moment later, Julie walks by. She
           notices him and stops.
                         
                          JULIE
           Hi. Look at this line.
           33.
                         
                         
                         
                          MAX
           Oh, hey. Yeah, I hate coming here this
           time of day, but I need money. You know,
           gambling debts and all.
                         
                          JULIE
           Aren't ATMs great? They save so much
           time. Think about what life must have
           been like before them.
                         
                          MAX
           I can't support an acronym without
           knowing what it stands for. I once joined
           NAMBLA because I thought it was an animal
           rights group.
                         
          She laughs.
                         
                          MAX (CONT'D)
           So, are you a junior, too?
                         
                          JULIE
           I'm listed as a sophomore, but I've taken
           some time off.
                         
                          MAX
           What're you majoring in?
                         
                          JULIE
           Why is that always the first question?
                         
                          MAX
           It was my second question.
                         
                          JULIE
           And how would you answer it?
                         
                          MAX
           I'd be honest. Oh, wait. Media Studies.
           This week, I'm majoring in Media Studies.
           I used to be a double-major, Renaissance
           Footwear and Neurosurgery, but, ya know,
           it was just too hard to get course credit
           for watching movies.
                         
                          JULIE
           I bet. Me, I'm in Soc., but I'm leaning
           toward Business, or Psych. Or Art
           History.
                         
                          MAX
           Why don't you just be undeclared?
           34.
                         
                         
                         
                          JULIE
           Not my style.
                         
           Max's turn-- but he spots ANNIE HALL on the marquee.
           Impulsively, he turns Julie to face him, so that her back is
           to it. In doing so, he steps away from the ATM.
                         
                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           Are you okay? I thought you needed money.
                         
                          MAX
           Uh, I forgot, my bookie takes checks now.
                         
                          JULIE
           Seriously, is everything okay?
                         
                          MAX
           Actually, yes. But I need something from
           you.
                         
                          JULIE
           What?
                         
                          MAX
           Your name.
                         
                          JULIE
           It's Julie, no nickname. Don't even think
           of calling me "Jewel."
                         
                          MAX
           Okay, Julie with no nickname, I, um, I'll
           see you around?
                         
                          JULIE
           Probably.
                         
           She leaves. Max goes back to the end of the line.
                         
          30 INT. COMMON ROOM -- NIGHT 30
                         
           Lounging are Max and Charles, Sam and Tommy, and Scott and
           Amanda.
                         
           Charles pulls a bottle of vodka from a newsbox.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Come on, which of you cats is in?
                         
                          MAX
           It's only Monday.
           35.
                         
                         
                         
                          CHARLES
           Shit, it's only Monday? Now I really need
           a drink.
                         
                          SAM
           I'm in.
                         
          Charles takes two mugs off the floor, throws their contents
          into a plant, and pours.
                         
          Tommy is on one end of a couch, sneaking looks at Amanda, in
          the middle, who is sneaking looks at Scott, on the other end.
                         
                          AMANDA
                          (TO SCOTT)
           How was your day?
                         
                          TOMMY
                          (ANSWERING HER)
           My day sucked. I spent six hours in the
           lab and four hours in class. And tonight,
           I have to study for two tests.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Ouch.
                         
                          TOMMY
           It better be worth it when I get into
           grad school.
                         
                          AMANDA
           Scott, how's the design project coming?
                         
                          SCOTT
           Slowly. There are a couple problems.
                         
                          AMANDA
           Huh.
                         
          Scott gets up and leaves the room.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Listen, I have an extra ticket to this
           concert tomorrow night.
                         
          Charles, Sam, and Max look on with alarm: is he really going
          through with this, here, now? Amanda takes the bait.
                         
                          AMANDA
           The Ani DiFranco show? Awesome!
           That's been sold out for weeks!
           36.
                         
                         
                         
                          TOMMY
           It's not Ani DiFranco, it's better-- two,
           front row seats at the Campus Choir
           charity show.
                         
                          AMANDA
           Oh.
                         
                          TOMMY
           So do ya wanna go?
                         
                          AMANDA
           I dunno. Why don't you call me tomorrow
           during the day.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Okay, great.
                         
                          AMANDA
           It's getting late. See you guys later.
                         
           SAM - MAX - CHARLES
           Bye.
                         
                          TOMMY
           See you tomorrow.
                         
          Amanda exits.
                         
                          TOMMY (CONT'D)
           Wow, that went pretty good.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Using Ani DiFranco to get laid. I've
           gotta try that.
                         
                          SAM
           She'll never give up on Scott.
                         
                          TOMMY
           It's not like I expect anything, I just
           like to spend time with her.
                         
          Scott wanders back in with a copy of Wired magazine. Tommy
          stands.
                         
                          TOMMY (CONT'D)
           Scott, do you mind if I take Amanda to a
           concert tomorrow night?
                         
                          SCOTT
           Why would I?
           37.
                         
                         
                         
                          TOMMY
           I didn't think so, but not asking would
           be wrong.
                         
                          SCOTT
           No, it wouldn't.
                         
                          TOMMY
           But...
                         
                          SAM
           It's not even a date.
                         
                          TOMMY
           It's nothing serious, but it is a date.
                         
                          CHARLES
           But they're going as friends.
                         
                          SAM
           They are friends.
                         
                          MAX
           She probably won't even go.
                         
          Scott sits and reads his magazine. Tommy drops heavily into a
          chair.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Whenever you're done, someone please give
           me an update on my sex life.
                         
                          CHARLES
           How does "sex life" enter, if she might
           not be going, and if she does, it's just
           as friends?
                         
                          SAM
           Wait, can you be on a date with someone
           you're not dating?
                         
                          CHARLES
           Yes. No.
                         
                          TOMMY
           I didn't think it was such a big deal!
                          (TO SCOTT)
           I just wanted to make sure it didn't
           bother you.
                         
          Scott looks at him like, Are you kidding? and goes back to
          his magazine. Tommy looks frustrated.
           38.
                         
                         
                         
                          MAX
           This conversation is starting to bother
           me.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
           TITLE CARD: white on black: "TUESDAY"
                         
          31 INT. DARK ROOM ­ THE NEXT DAY 31
                         
           Max shakes a tumbler as Amanda keeps time.
                         
                          AMANDA
           Tired yet?
                         
                          MAX
           This is ridiculous. What other art form
           involves industrial toxins and complex
           chemical reactions? Nobody ever got
           cancer from dancing.
                         
                          AMANDA
           You're so paranoid.
                         
                          MAX
           I'm serious. Chemicals make me very
           nervous. Isn't this how the Unabomber got
           started?
                         
           He continues shaking.
                         
                          AMANDA
           Max, do I bother Scott when I'm around?
                         
                          MAX
           Uh, boy, this fixer smells delicious...
                         
                          AMANDA
           `Cuz, sometimes it seems like I do. I
           know he's not, like, interested, but
           then, sometimes it seems like he is. I
           just don't want it to be awkward. Please,
           tell me the truth.
                         
                          MAX
           I, uh, I mean, the truth is, it's not a
           topic. It doesn't bother him, or us. Or I
           mean, he doesn't talk about it.
                         
                          AMANDA
           So he never talks about me?
                         
                          MAX
           Yes, I mean, no, not with us, anyway.
           39.
                         
                         
                         
                          AMANDA
           I knew it.
                         
                          MAX
           Listen. All I'm trying to say is, you're
           not a topic that comes up very often.
                         
                          AMANDA
           So with all the time we spend together,
           none of you have any opinion of me?!
                         
          Amanda storms out of the room.
                         
                          MAX
           Well, that's not... what I meant. Oy.
                         
          Amanda returns, still upset.
                         
                          AMANDA
           It's time! To unroll the film.
                         
          Max, startled, fumbles open the tumbler.
                         
                          MAX
           Listen, Amanda. Scott likes you as much
           as we all do, so it doesn't leave much
           room for discussion. We mostly only talk
           about what we hate.
                         
                          AMANDA
           I know. It's just sometimes, I wish...
                         
                          MAX
           Yeah, I know.
                         
          Amanda takes the negatives, opens the door to a closet, hangs
          them from a clothespin, and leaves. Max takes his, selects a
          clothespin, and knocks several others to the floor. He tries
          to pick them up, and manages to step on them.
                         
           AMANDA (O.S.)
           Max? Are you coming?
                         
          He throws the crumpled negatives in the closet and grabs his
          bag. At the door, he notices one stuck to his shoe.
                         
                          MAX
           Shit!
                         
          He takes the negative off his shoe, almost knocking himself
          over, and hurries out.
           40.
                         
                         
                         
           AMANDA (O.S.)
           Why does it always take you so long in
           there?
                         
          32 INT. COMMON ROOM -- LATER 32
                         
           Max enters to find Sam playing video hockey.
                         
                          MAX
           Hey, remember the scene in Swingers when
           they play this? That was awesome. I love
           movie scenes I can relate to.
                         
           He sits down next to him.
                         
                          SAM
           Yeah. Wasn't there also a video hockey
           scene in Mallrats?
                         
                          MAX
           No, you're thinking of Chasing Amy.
                         
                          SAM
           Which one had all the comic book stuff?
                         
                          MAX
           They both did.
                         
                          SAM
           What about the Star Wars stuff?
                         
                          MAX
           Mallrats, Clerks, and Dogma.
                         
                          SAM
           What about the last one?
                         
                          MAX
           Doesn't count, it was just an ad for all
           his other films.
                         
                          SAM
           You gotta admit, it's fucking cheap for a
           movie to refer to other movies.
                         
                          MAX
           Why? We do it real life. We're doing it
           right now. What you're saying is, if this
           was a movie, it wouldn't be any good.
                         
                          SAM
           Yeah. Our lives would make an awful
           movie.
           41.
                         
                         
                         
                          MAX
           But if our lives were a movie, you'd
           never be able to say that. You'd be
           giving the critics the perfect quote to
           pan it with.
                         
                          SAM
           So fucking what? It's a shitty movie!
                         
           Sam drops his controller and gets up.
                         
                          MAX
           Are you okay?
                         
                          SAM
           How come you only play this one video
           game?
                         
                          MAX
           Video hockey is my game. Like a swan, I
           mate for life.
                         
                          SAM
           More like the loon.
                         
           Max looks him over.
                         
                          MAX
           Holy shit, you and Jen broke up.
                         
                          SAM
           Yeah. Your prediction finally came true.
           Come on, let's hit the bar. I need a
           drink.
                         
          33 INT. COFFEE BAR ­ DAY 33
                         
           A crummy collegiate dive. Sam and Max drink coffees.
                         
                          MAX
           Okay, so what happened?
                         
                          SAM
           We were just hanging out, and she told me
           she loves me. Completely out of the blue.
           She says things like that sometimes,
           things like "I love that you're my
           boyfriend," ya know? But usually when
           we're in bed or something. But this time
           it was different, all we were doing was
           watching TV.
                         
                          MAX
           Porn?
           42.
                         
                         
                         
                          SAM
           Almost. It was "our" show, the one we
           like to get romantic to...
                         
          34 INT. JEN'S DORM ROOM ­ SAM'S FLASHBACK 34
                         
           Sam and Jen watch "The X-Files." Max stands, observing. Jen
           can't see him.
                         
                          SAM
                          (TO MAX)
           I was just tired of trying to tell her
           what she wanted to hear all the time, so
           I tried to be honest.
                          (TO JEN)
           We've been together a long time and I
           really care about you, but I don't know
           if I love you. This is tough to say, but
           I think something might be missing from
           our relationship.
                         
                          JEN
           Something's missing?
                         
                          SAM
           Well, not completely... I don't know if I

           There are three things I look for in a
           girl: heart, body, and mind. And well,
           you've got the body.
                         
           Max is stunned and laughs. Jen is stunned, too, and runs out.
                         
                          MAX
                          (TO CAMERA)
           Jesus. You think you know someone pretty
           well and then they do something like
           this.
                         
                          SAM
           When she comes back, she slaps me in the
           face and makes me leave. Then she calls,
           crying, and asks me to come over. When I
           go back, she kicks me out and says she
           never wants to see me again.
                         
                          MAX
           Fifty bucks says there's a message on the
           machine when we get back.
                         
           Max sits, and the background DISSOLVES back TO:

           Is it really so bad? I couldn't lie to
           her.
                         
                          MAX
           Don't you know that no matter how often
           girls tell you they want honesty, they
           never really mean it? Nobody does!
                         
                          SAM
           Look, I fucked up, alright? I didn't know
           what to say.
                         
                          MAX
           It's too bad it ended like this. I'm
           really sorry.
                         
                          SAM
           Me too. It'll be hard to get used to, but
           at least we ended it early.
                         
           Sam throws some money on the table and they get up.

           Charles' theory?

           Come on, Max, I can only deal with one
           mid-life crisis at a time.
                         
                          MAX
           I can't believe you said that to her.
           That's so cool.
                         
                          SAM
           You think?
                         
                          MAX
           No.
                         
                          SAM
           Gee, at least I can hang out with my

           "New wave dance party" in The Pub, the small, grungy club on
           campus. A DJ plays something obscure from the 80s. Some
           people dance, while the rest, including Max, Charles, and
           Scott, sit at tables by the coffee bar in the back.
                         
                          CHARLES
           I was talking to Amanda the other day.
                         
                          SCOTT
           Was that Thursday? Because there was that
           half hour when she didn't call or visit.
                         
                          MAX
           Scott, why don't you go for her? You seem
           to get along well.
                         
                          SCOTT
           She follows me around now. If we slept
           together, I'd never get rid of her.
                         
                          MAX
           You're exaggerating.
                         
                          SCOTT
           Look at Sam and Jen.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Ouch.
                         
                          MAX
           Bad example: it could never get that bad.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Ouch.
                         
                          SCOTT
           Then look at Charles and Sara.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Okay, ouch for real this time.
                         
           Max looks O.S. and goes pale.
                         
                          MAX
           Shit, she's here.
                         
           Julie walks through the crowd in their direction, but stops
           at another table, talking to friends. Max exhales slowly.
                         
                          CHARLES
           That dame from History class?
           45.
                         
                         
                         
                          MAX
           No. She's, she's just a girl. I shouldn't
           have mentioned it.
                         
                          SCOTT
           But you did mention it.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Ohhh, that's the one from the party.
                         
                          MAX
           Yeah.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Get her name yet?
                         
                          MAX
           Yeah, it's "Julie"... Julie. She's cute,
           and she seems interesting, but I'm sure
           she has all kinds of horrible flaws I
           don't know about.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Uh-oh. This is bad.
                         
                          MAX
           What do you mean?
                         
                          CHARLES
           You're thinking about her. You're already
           making yourself nervous and you barely
           know her. You do this every time!
                         
                          MAX
           I wonder if maybe I should go say hi.
                         
                          CHARLES
           See, this is what I'm talking about.
           If you don't go hit on her, I will.
                         
                          MAX
           Do you know the guys she's talking to?
                         
                          SCOTT
           Yeah. The guy in the jacket is annoying.
                         
          Julie sees him. He freezes like a deer in headlights.
                         
                          MAX
           Shit, shit, shit, she's looking this way.
           Fuck. What should I...?
           46.
                         
                         
                         
                          CHARLES
           You have no choice. If you back away now,
           she'll never get to see the rest of your
           annoying personality traits.
                         
                          MAX
           You're right. I can't deprive her of
           that.
                         
          37 INT. THE PUB -- JULIE'S TABLE 37
                         
           Julie is with ANDY and MARK. Andy is your basic hippie,
           resplendent in a ridiculous green shag jacket. Mark has a cap
           and is wearing a J Crew long-sleeve shirt over a Dave
           Matthews Band t-shirt.
                         
           Max approaches.
                         
                          JULIE
           Max! What's going on?
                         
                          MAX
           Hey.
                         
                          JULIE
           Do you guys know Max? This is Mark...
                         
                          MARK
           Wassup.
                         
                          JULIE
           ...And Andy.
                         
                          ANDY
           Hey Max, how's it hanging, bud?
                         
                          MAX
           Fine. I, uh, really like your jacket. Is
           that real carpet?
                         
                          ANDY
           Yeah, man. I couldn't believe my luck
           when I saw it. This shade of shag is,
           like, so rare. I was like, woah...
                         
                          MARK
           Hey, are we gonna burn this or what?
                         
                          ANDY
           Yeah, man. Hey, you guys are like all
           invited, if you can handle some kind bud...
           "Maui wowey," you know?
           47.

          38 INT. ANDY'S APARTMENT ­ A LITTLE LATER 38
                         
           Mark, Julie, and Max sit around a wooden table in a small
           apartment's kitchen. Andy puts on a CD.
                         
                          ANDY
           Hey man, you like Zappa?
                         
                          MAX
           Dweezil or Moon Unit?
                         
                          ANDY
           Frank.
           (then gets it, laughs)
           Man, that isn't even funny. You should
           check out "Apostrophe" some time.
                         
                          MAX
           "Apostrophe"?
                         
                          MARK
           It's an album.
                         
                          MAX
           I thought he was correcting my grammar.
                         
                          MARK
           Can I get anyone beers? Julie?
                         
                          JULIE
           Sure.
                         
                          ANDY
           You know it.
                         
                          MAX
           Okay.
                         
           Mark distributes beers to everyone but Max.
                         
                          MARK
           Sorry, Max, we don't have enough.
                         
                          MAX
           Uh, yeah, sure.
                         
                          JULIE
           You want mine?
           48.
                         
                         
                         
                          MAX
           No thanks. I'm kinda picky about beer.
           I'm more into stuff like Guinness, Bass,
           Killians.
                         
                          MARK
                          (DISDAINFUL)
           That's so... British.
                         
                          MAX
           It's a coincidence, I swear.
                         
          Julie has trouble opening her beer. Mark rushes over with his
          keychain.
                         
                          MARK
           I thought Guinness was going to be cool,
           but it sucks. Made me nauseous.
                         
                          ANDY
           Dude, puking blows. That's why I smoke
           weed. You get high right away and no
           hangover!
                         
          Andy pulls out a baggie of marijuana, and rummages through
          the closet.
                         
                          MAX
           Yeah, I don't know. Giving me pot is like
           letting Richard Simmons smoke crack. I'm
           paranoid enough as it is.
                         
                          MARK
           Yeah, well, some people just can't handle
           their bud.
                         
          Mark glares disparagingly at him while Max pretends to
          examine the ceiling. Julie pulls out cigarettes, lights up.
                         
                          JULIE
           Andy, what are you looking for?
                         
          Andy finds it: a gigantic bong made from a vacuum cleaner. He
          sets it up on the counter.
                         
                          MAX
           Wow. I bet you could use that for yard
           work.
                         
                          ANDY
           Julie, you don't smoke either, right?
                         
                          MARK
           Really?
           49.
                         
                         
                         
                          JULIE
          Yeah. I used to, but when it became my
          social life I knew I needed to stop.
                         
                          MAX
          Kind of like why I stopped playing
          Dungeons and Dragons. It was, uh, in
          sixth grade, but it was kind of similar.
                         
                          MARK
          Why don't we go smoke in the living room?
                         
                          ANDY
          Oh, Ampersand's crashing on the couch
          tonight.
                         
                          MAX
          "Ampersand"? What kind of name is that,
          Esperanto?
                         
                          ANDY
          Well, his name was Mike, but he couldn't
          cope. He thought it was, like, too
          square. He wanted a name that would tell
          people, here is a person that only the
          brave will understand! Here is a person
          living beyond the walls!
                         
                          MAX
          He must have been listening to
          "Apostrophe" at the time.
                         
                          ANDY
          Or Prince, cuz, like, Prince's name was a
          squiggly-thing. But Mike wanted something
          powerful, meaningful, and above all,
          something you could type. Therefore,
          "Ampersand." It's already on the keyboard
          and everything.
                         
                          MAX
          How much did that cost? Because I have a
          friend who wants to change his name to
          Not Bill.
                         
                          JULIE
          Is his name Bill?
                         
                          MAX
          No, Not Bill.
                         
                          JULIE
          What about originally?
           50.
                         
                         
                         
                          MAX
           Originally he wanted to change it to
           something else.
                         
          Mark steps forward and pushes up a sleeve.
                         
                          MARK
           Hey Julie, check out my new tattoo.
                         
          He's got an anchor on his right biceps. Max snickers.
                         
                          JULIE
           Gee, Mark, that's really cool.
                         
                          MARK
           I know it's not what you suggested, but I
           needed something more... masculine.
                         
          Max quietly whistles "Popeye the Sailor Man."
                         
                          MARK (CONT'D)
           You think you're pretty funny, huh?
                         
                          MAX
           C'mon, I thought hippies were mellow.
                         
                          MARK
           You just call me a hippie?
                         
                          MAX
           Sorry, Popeye, I guess I was thrown by
           the Dave Matthews merchandise.
                         
                          MARK
           I'm in a frat, geek.
                         
                          MAX
           Well shouldn't you be back there date-
           raping someone?
                         
                          MARK
           Julie, where did you find this creep?
                         
          Max and Mark both look to Julie-- she must pick a side.
          She pulls on her cigarette, then turns to Mark.
                         
                          JULIE
           Mark, lay off. Go take a hit off the
           Hoover and mellow out.
           (turning to Max)
           Max, I'm sorry.
                         
                          MAX
           Hey, it's okay. I'm cool.
           51.
                         
                         
                         
           He takes a beer from the table, fumbles, and drops it.
                         
                          JULIE
           Nah, it's time. It's getting late anyway.
                         
           She puts out her cigarette and grabs her coat.
                         
          39 EXT. JULIE'S DORM ­ NIGHT 39
                         
           Max and Julie approach Shelly Hall.
                         
                          MAX
           So you live here, huh? Does it bother you
           to be in an all-female dorm?
                         
                          JULIE
           No, well, a little, sure. But there are
           always men around. During fire drills,
           more guys come out than girls. Never the
           same ones either. They come and go.
                         
                          MAX
           I bet they do.
                         
           Julie catches herself and laughs. Max shares a smile with her
           in the doorway.
                         
                          JULIE
           I had a good time tonight, but next time,
           let's have some real fun.
                         
                          MAX
           Oh, fine, uh, next time I'll bring Jack
           Nicholson and a case of Schnapps.
                         
                          JULIE
           Good night, Max.
                         
           Julie enters the dorm. Max watches her through the glass.
                         
                          CUT TO:

          40 INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE RADIO STATION ­ DAY 40
                         
           Max reads the schedule on the door. His watch says 11am; he
           finds Wednesday 11am: "Julio's Death Metal Jamboree." He
           peeks behind the door-- the station is empty.
                         
           He starts to slip inside when...
                         
           BETH (O.S.)
           Max!
                         
           He whirls, closing the door guiltily. Beth comes down the
           hall, laden with books.
                         
                          MAX

           It was great running into your friends,
           but... you know... I feel bad about what I
           said. Do you want to get together later?
                         
                          MAX
           I don't know, I'm sure I have something
           to do that I've forgotten.
                         
                          BETH
           Come on, it's bad enough we fell out of
           touch, but we can't even have lunch?
                         
                          MAX
           We had breakfast.

           you cancel.
                         
                          MAX
           You cancel on me, too.
                         
                          BETH
           I'm sorry. Things have been a little, you
           know, awkward.
                         
                          MAX
           Look, the whole thing was my fault. Let's
           drop it, okay?
                         
           Beth throws up her hands, turns away.
                         
                          MAX (CONT'D)

           a hard time.

           Guilt is a powerful force. Just be glad
           it's on our side for once.
                         
                          BETH

                          MAX
           Awful, just like every other time of day.
           Their food is just birdseed prepared
           fancy.

           The Fabulous Diner, then. Friday at noon?

           Fine.
                         
           She leaves. Max finds his old slot on the schedule and
           crosses it out. Then he slips into the station.
                         
          41 EXT. CVS 41
                         
           A shitbox pulls up. Sam drives, Max rides shotgun. Scott and
           Amanda are in back.
                         
                          AMANDA
           And then I got to thinking, you know, I
           really think I like vanilla.
                         
           Sam turns off the car.
                         
                          SAM
           I'll be right back.
                         
                          MAX
           Me too.
                         
           They get out and go into the store.
                         
          42 INT. CVS 42
                         
           They enter an aisle and Sam grabs various items as he talks.
                         
                          SAM
           Jen called yesterday, while we were at
           the bar.

                          SAM
           Yeah. I went over there to talk again
           today. She's taking it hard.
                         
                          MAX
           Imagine that.
                         
                          SAM
           We're having dinner tonight. Wanna come?
                         
                          MAX
           Don't put me in the middle of this. Are
           you definitely broken up? Because it
           seems a little up in the air.
                         
                          SAM
           Yeah, we're definitely broken up. I guess
           sometimes it seems like we're sliding
           back into our old patterns.
                         
          He takes some Vaseline from a shelf. Max looks horrified.
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           It's not what you think. I need a
           petroleum jelly for the polymers class
           I'm TA-ing.
                         
          Suddenly a rack of condoms catches his eye. Max sees it too.
                         
                          MAX
           Don't even think of it.
                         
                          SAM

          He takes a box. His arms are totally full now.
                         
                          SAM (CONT'D)
           I need a basket. Hold this.
                         
          He dumps his pile of stuff into Max's arms, the Vaseline and
          condoms on top, and disappears around a corner. Max sighs,
          turns around... and bumps into Julie.
                         
                          JULIE
           Hello... Big night?
                         
                          MAX
           Um, it's for a friend.
                         
                          JULIE
           I would hope so.
           55.
                         
                         
                         
                          MAX
           No, seriously, I just got a job at a
           petting zoo.
                         
                          JULIE
                          (LAUGHING)
           Oh, of course.
                         
                          MAX
           And the best part is, it's work study. I
           think the Psych. department's involved.
                         
                          JULIE
           Hey, that's my new major. I got so sick
           of Soc.
                         
                          MAX
           So, uh, got any plans tonight?
                         
                          JULIE
           Well, there's a great local band playing
           the Pub. You should come.
                         
                          MAX
           Um, sure. Might be cool to catch a band
           before success ruins them.
                         
                          JULIE
           Great. I'll see you there.
                         
          She leaves with a wave. Sam turns the other corner.
                         
                          SAM
           No baskets.
                         
                          MAX
           I can't believe what you just did to me!
                         
                          SAM
           What?
                         
                          MAX
           Julie was just here!
                         
                          SAM
           Who's Julie?
                         
          Suddenly, Scott arrives.
                         
                          SCOTT
           Hi. I need socks.
           56.
                         
                         
                         
                          MAX
           What were you doing sitting in the car
           then?
                         
                          SCOTT
           Nothing.
                         
          43 EXT. CVS ­ FLASHBACK 43
                         
           The car pulls up.
                         
                          SAM
           I'll be right back.
                         
                          MAX
           Me too.
                         
           They leave.
                         
           Amanda and Scott are alone in the back. Amanda looks tense.
                         
                          AMANDA
           Scott, can I ask you something?
                         
                          SCOTT
           Okay.
                         
                          AMANDA
           It's just that, sometimes, you're really
           cool and other times you act like I'm not
           even here. Or like you don't want me
           around.
                         
                          SCOTT
           Yeah.
                         
                          AMANDA
           Well, I was wondering if... never mind.
                         
                          SCOTT
           Okay.
                         
           A moment passes.
                         
                          AMANDA
           All right, look, I'm just going to come
           right out with it. I think I like you. I
           think I, I really like you.
                         
                          SCOTT
           I know.
                         
           As she opens her mouth, Scott opens the car door and exits.
           57.

           So where are the socks?
                         
          45 INT. PUB ­ THAT NIGHT 45
                         
           An absurd metal band plays on-stage. The room is packed, and
           the crowd is mostly one big mosh pit.
                         
           Max wades through the slamdancers, freaked. He makes it to
           the coffee bar. Julie soon appears, sweaty. She's been here
           awhile.
                         
                          JULIE
           Hey!
                         
                          MAX
           Oh, hey! It's good to see you.
                         
           The surging crowd shoves Max into Julie. They fall against
           each other. Max is near panic but Julie's laughing, getting
           off on the energy of the room.
                         
           The SINGER smashes the mic against the wall, then brandishes
           the stand menacingly at the crowd, who step back in alarm.
                         
                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Who are these guys?
                         
                          JULIE
           They're Anhedonia. They're "sludge-core."
                         
                          SINGER
           You're all a part of the conspiracy!
           You're all human! Every one of you wore
           diapers! You're all full of shit!
                         
           The singer storms off. The band follows. The crowd applauds
           with some confusion. Julie whistles loudly and claps.
                         
                          JULIE
           That's their trademark. They insult the
           crowd at the end of the set. Sometimes he
           breaks the mike two songs in. We were
           lucky: they played for almost 40 minutes.
                         
                          MAX
           Luck had nothing to do with it.
           58.
                         
                         
                         
                          JULIE
           Look, the mike's not even broken. They
           were just tired of playing, but they
           wanted to give us something to remember.
           Now that's showmanship.
                         
                          MAX
           You have to wonder about any band whose
           highlight is their exit.
                         
                          JULIE
           It worked for The Who.
                         
                          MAX
           I'm sorry, the who?
                         
                          JULIE
           Ha ha. Come on, is that the kind of a
           joke a celebrity DJ would make?
                         
                          MAX
           I still can't believe you tuned in. It's
           like an invasion of privacy.
                         
                          JULIE
           You're a riot. Let's get out of here.
                         
           She pulls him away.
                         
          46 INT. STUDY LOUNGE ­ UNIVERSITY CENTER ­ MINUTES LATER 46
                         
           The lounge is empty. Julie sits on a couch. Max sits next to
           her, but seems uptight about getting too close.
                         
                          MAX
           So, uh, I'm sorry about that thing with,
           uh, Chip was it?
                         
                          JULIE
           Oh, Mark. He's been following me around
           for years. He's easily threatened.
                         
                          MAX
           He's lucky, I, uh, almost pulled a Jackie
           Chan on his ass, but, you know, my kung-
           fu's gotten rusty since I left the Hong
           Kong military.
                         
                          JULIE
           Don't worry about him, he isn't a threat.
           You're far more interesting.
           59.
                         
                         
                         
                          MAX
           Right. Asking me not to worry is like
           asking a bear to use toilet paper.
           There's this joke that sums it up for me...
                         
          Julie leans in and looks at him with intensity.
                         
                          JULIE
           You're not fooling me, you know. I can
           see right through this aloof image.
                         
                          MAX
           What?
                         
                          JULIE
           It's not an insult. I get the sense that
           there's this whole other side of your
           personality.
                         
                          MAX
           I hope he's a better dancer.
                         
                          JULIE
           See, this is the side you show, playing
           everything off as a joke whenever things
           gets serious. But there's more to you.
                         
                          MAX
           Did I ever tell you about the bear and
           the rabbit in the woods--?
                         
                          JULIE
           Quick. Now. Tell me something about
           yourself, something I never would have
           guessed. And don't even try to come up
           with some witty retort.
                         
          Max, agape, is on the spot, helpless. Julie grabs her coat.
                         
                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           I should get going.
                         
          She stands.
                         
                          MAX
           Wait.
                         
          She sits.
                         
                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Okay. Okay.
           (a deep breath)
           We barely know each other, but you're all
           I think about.
           60.
                         
                         
                         
                          JULIE
           (off-balance, covering)
          I said something I never would have
          guessed.
                         
                          MAX
          Oh, thanks. I bare my soul and now you're
          the funny one.
                         
                          JULIE
          Sorry. That wasn't quite what I was
          looking for.
                         
                          MAX
          Now it's your turn, right?
                         
                          JULIE
          Let's see. Okay, here's one: I have a
          boyfriend.
                         
                          MAX
          Fuck. I sure hadn't guessed that.
                         
                          JULIE
          Okay, well, not anymore. Eric and I were
          together in high school, but we broke up
          over break.
                         
                          MAX
          Since high school, wow.
                         
                          JULIE
          Yeah. He's kind of a jerk. It was all a
          waste of time. Sometimes I, I, I don't
          know, Max, why don't you have a
          girlfriend?
                         
                          MAX
           (on the spot)
          Uh, I have a friend who says it's because
          I watch Annie Hall too much.
                         
                          JULIE
          That's crazy.
                         
                          MAX
          Exactly. That film practically raised me.
                         
                          JULIE
          And it has a very positive message, too.
          I wish more guys were into it.
                         
                          MAX
          Be careful what you wish for.

                          JULIE
           You don't know what I'm wishing for.
                         
                          MAX
           Snowtires?
                         
                          JULIE
           Max, there are a lot of girls that would
           go for a guy like you.
                         
                          MAX
           Know any?
                         
                          JULIE
           This is one of those moments, in a movie,
           when a character has a chance to say
           something, and of course they do, and
           it's perfect, and it becomes a movie
           moment.
                         
           Julie starts to lean in. Suddenly, the BUILDING MANAGER walks
           in. He's a dead ringer for Woody Allen. Max starts violently.
                         
                          MANAGER
           Building's closing. Everyone out.
                         
           He exits. Max is beside himself. Julie sees that the moment's
           over and gets up.
                         
                          JULIE
           Are you hungry at all?
                         
                          MAX
           Sure. I know this place. Their food is
           bad, but they compensate by being
           overpriced.
                         
                          JULIE
           Sounds perfect.
                         
           They walk out.
                         
                          MAX
           Say, did that guy look like...?
                         
                          JULIE
           Ernest Borgnine? Yeah, I noticed that
           too.
                         
          47 INT. JULIE'S CAR -- NIGHT 47
                         
           Max is relaxed and chatting while Julie drives.
           62.
                         
                         
                         
                          MAX
           I've been able to do it since high
           school.
                         
                          JULIE
           That's a scary gift. I mean, even if
           people are destined to break up, the will
           to stay together is very powerful.
                         
                          MAX
           That's the real tragedy. Look at all the
           unhappy couples in the world.
                         
                          JULIE
           I don't know if your gift is really that
           special, Max. I mean, we break up with
           everyone we ever date... Until the one we
           stay with forever.
                         
                          MAX
           See how ridiculous dating is?
                         
                          JULIE
           How did you get this attitude if you love
           Annie Hall?
                         
                          MAX
           What do you mean? That's what Annie's all
           about.
                         
          Julie looks dubious. Max flicks on the radio.
                         
                          DJ
           ..."college radio for the masses," and
           that's it for me.
           (sound of CDs falling)
           Whoops! Anyway, next up is Verbal
           Diarrhea, with Todd Duke.
                         
                          MAX
           Why is your radio set to the campus
           station?
                         
                          JULIE
           Actually, it's stuck on it. It's how I
           first heard your show.
                         
                          MAX
           I thought Beth told you about me.
                         
                          JULIE
           It doesn't matter, Max. Now that I've met
           you, your show's not important.

          48 INT. PRETENTIOUS CAFE ­ A LITTLE LATER 48
                         
           The kind of place that's perfect for Parents Weekend. At this
           late hour, it is filled with young professionals. There's a
           dance floor, where couples dance to the standards. Max and
           Julie are at a table in the corner, looking out of place.
                         
                          JULIE
                          (SMIRKING)
           This is a nice place. Ritzy. Interesting
           mix of people here, you've got these men
           with their suits, taking their waitress
           girlfriends out to impress them into bed,
           because they can't get them any other
           way. Really, as if a fast car can ever
           make up for a small dick.
                         
                          MAX
           If it did, do you think I'd be here? I'd
           be down at the Porsche dealer with a ski
           mask and an Uzi.
                         
                          JULIE
           Guys, always obsessed with dick size.
                         
                          MAX
           Well, sure, there's that, but it would
           also be nice to have a car with a heater.
                         
                          JULIE
           Let's guess which couples are destined to
           break up. How about them?
                         
           Indicates a COUPLE dancing.
                         
                          MAX
           No, I can't tell just by looking. I need
           some info.
                         
           Their waitress, DONNA, arrives.
                         
                          JULIE
           Hi! Do you have a boyfriend?
                         
           Max is aghast. Donna stares a beat.
                         
                          DONNA
           Yeah.
                         
                          JULIE

           Uh, just a description.
                         
                          JULIE
           Describe him for us. It's okay, I'm a
           psyche major.
                         
                          DONNA
           Well, he's tall... ish. Brown hair. Funny.
           Very friendly. Fixes cars. Close with his
           brother. Uh, what else? Believes in God.
           Has a sweet tooth. Uh...
                         
                          MAX
           That's plenty.
                         
                          DONNA
           So can I take your order?
                         
                          JULIE
           We're not ready, thanks.
                         
          Donna puts her pad away.
                         
                          DONNA
           So what was that all about then?
                         
                          JULIE
           Max here thinks you're going to break up
           with your boyfriend.
                         
                          DONNA
           What?
                         
                          MAX
           Sorry. It's all in there. You qualified
           "tall" so as not to make him appear too
           handsome, said "friendly" like a
           euphemism, chose "fixes cars" instead of
           the more dignified "auto mechanic," and
           finally, mentioned his brother á propos
           of nothing, like you're threatened by
           him.
                         
          The waitress looks like she's been slapped. After a pause,
          she turns her back and walks away.
                         
                          JULIE
           Hey! Don't shoot the messenger!
                         
                          MAX
           I'm such an idiot. She's going to shit in
           our food now. I can't believe you asked
           her that.

                          JULIE
           Hey, we're all people here, right? If you
           want to talk to someone, talk to them. I
           don't spend my time trying to justify
           talking to people or whatever. You limit
           yourself if you do that. If you spend too
           much time worrying, you don't spend
           enough time living, right?
                         
                          MAX
           What are you, a fortune cookie?
                         
                          JULIE
           You have to keep yourself open to
           possibilities in life. I'm the first one
           in my family to go to college. Sometimes
           I can't believe I'm here, at a semi-
           prestigious university getting a halfway-
           decent education-- this has always been
           my dream. How did you end up here?
                         
                          MAX
           I had a coupon.
                         
                          JULIE
           I know what you mean, financial aid is a
           bitch. And the university experience
           itself is kind of disappointing. All
           those rich students with no idea how
           lucky they are. But I don't think about
           them. I think about me, I think about
           where I want to be someday: a world
           traveler, running some huge company, or,
           you know, doing some fantastically
           important work. And when the day comes
           that I can relax, I'm going to charter a
           boat, sail around the world, and see the
           Seven Wonders.
                         
                          MAX
           I thought they broke up when Stevie left.
                         
                          JULIE
           Come on, aren't you curious about the
           world? Doesn't the sheer scope of life
           fill you with wonder?
                         
                          MAX
           Wonder, horror, it's such a fine line...
                         
                          JULIE
           Ah, Max...
                         
          But she's smiling at him, and he can't help but return it.

           Tommy sleeps while the TV proclaims golf products. Max comes
           in and quietly shuts it off. Tommy gurgles and rolls over.
                         
                          TOMMY
           ...swallowed a bug...
                         
           Max goes to his room. Sam's bed is empty. He shakes his head,
           picks up a key from his desk, and leaves.

           Max sits on a stool, as in the beginning, but this time we
           are PUSHING IN...
                         
                          MAX
           Sometimes I look around and wonder where
           the hell my friends came from.

           Tommy and Sam are in each other's faces, yelling. Tommy waves
           a book and Sam waves a newspaper.
                         
           MAX (V.O.)
           Like, the other night Tommy and Sam
           nearly got into a fistfight over whether
           the X-Files is based on a true story.
                         
          52 INT. BATHROOM -- FLASHBACK 52
                         
           Charles makes out with a GIRL in a stall covered in colored
           paper. She has a cigarette on a black holding stem, which
           brushes the paper.
                         
           MAX (V.O.)
           Before that, Scott covered the entire
           bathroom in multi-colored post-it notes,
           which Charles somehow set on fire, nearly
           getting us kicked out of housing.
                         
          53 INT. COMMON ROOM -- FLASHBACK 53
                         
           Max, Sam, Scott, and Tommy are there, reading fanclub
           newsletters: X-philes, Font-ain of Youth, Men Are From Mars
           Women From Venus. Charles walks in, arm in arm with a woman
           who is obviously a PROFESSOR, and escorts her to his room.
                         
           MAX (V.O.)
           They're great friends. I feel safer among
           them than among my own family.

           MAX (V.O.) (cont'd)
           They always know what not to say, how not
           to make things uncomfortable.
                         
           After a beat, the group resumes reading like nothing
           happened... except Max, who can't believe what he just saw.
                         
          54 INT. RADIO STATION (LIMBO) 54
                         
           Max in CLOSE-UP. Over his shoulder, images of Beth arguing
           with him from various moments in their history.
                         
                          MAX
           Even when Beth was part of the group, she
           didn't fit in. Like, she never just lets
           things be. She always has to know exactly
           what I'm thinking. It was sort of cute
           when we were friends, but now it's like a
           proctology exam.
                          (SIGHS)
           Hard to imagine a friendship going more
           wrong.
                         
           The image of Beth STOPS on a shot of her looking at him with
           undisguised disappointment. She DISSOLVES into a image of
           Julie, beaming.
                         
                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Ah, but Julie. Juliejuliejulie. She's
           smart, she's funny, isn't constantly
           hassling me. How she can stay such a
           dreamer is beyond me... Hey, I wonder if
           she's listening now.
                         
           The thought stops him cold. The image over his shoulder
           VANISHES, replaced with a plain cement wall.
                         
          55 INT. RADIO STATION 55
                         
           We ZOOM OUT fast. Max is back in reality, the station crowded
           and claustrophobic. He tries to regroup.
                         
                          MAX
           (taps the mike)
           Hello? Uh, Julie...?
           (clears his throat)
           So, uh, as I was saying... Um. My friends.
           Yeah. My friends are weird. Shit.
                          (LONG PAUSE)
           I think it's time for some music.
                         
           He grabs for a CD.

           Max and Charles stir their coffee.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Fuckin' hate this flavored shit. Anyway,
           I can't believe the cat in the shag
           jacket was Andy.
                         
                          MAX
           I don't want to talk about it.
                         
                          CHARLES
           When I knew him as a freshman, he was pre-
           law... Whew. Anyway, it sounds like things
           are going well between you and Julie.
                         
                          MAX
           Yeah. This is a real change of pace.
           Staying away from Annie Hall is like some
           kind of magic trick.
                         
                          CHARLES
           I was wondering about that. You seem
           different lately.
                         
                          MAX
           You know how when things are going badly,
           there are certain parts I like to watch?
                         
                          CHARLES
           Like how you spent your whole sophomore
           year watching that lobster scene on
           repeat?
                         
                          MAX
           I realized that I don't know what part to
           watch when things are going well.
                         
                          CHARLES
           You know, I actually regret mentioning
           that theory. In fact, Sam and I were
           thinking of watching it tonight. You in?
                         
                          MAX
           Are you on crack? I meet a girl I really
           like, that I may actually have a chance
           with, and you want me to put it all in
           jeopardy?
                         
                          CHARLES
           Come on. Watching it without you would be
           weird. Unnatural. That film is you, Max,
           face it.
           69.
                         
                         
                         
                          MAX
           But it's ruining my life.
                         
          Charles drinks his coffee and shakes his head.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Listen, Max. I have to tell you
           something. I scored last night.
                         
                          MAX
           See? The theory works for you, too.
                         
                          CHARLES
           With Beth.
                         
          Max drops his coffee, thunderstruck.
                         
                          MAX
           What?!
                         
                          CHARLES
           It wasn't premeditated.
                         
                          MAX
                          (ANGRY)
           How could you sleep with Beth?
                         
                          CHARLES
           Look, nobody knows about it. It won't
           happen again.
                         
                          MAX
           Happen again? Of course not! That might
           constitute a relationship!
                         
          Max is at a loss. The CASHIER looks over suspiciously.
                         
                          CHARLES
           I'm sorry, Max. I wasn't sure if you'd
           care.
                         
                          MAX
           I don't care! Oh God, this is my fault!
           If only I hadn't called her...
                         
                          CHARLES
           What do you want me to say? I'm sorry,
           man. Let me pay for your coffee.
                         
                          MAX
           You've gotta be kidding.
                         
          He starts to leave.
           70.
                         
                         
                         
                          CHARLES
           Going back to the suite?
                         
                          MAX
           I dunno where I'm going.
                         
          57 EXT. CAMPUS THEATER ­ DAY 57
                         
           Max, distressed, passes the campus theater, where someone is
           tacking up a poster for Annie Hall. Max sees it and averts
           his eyes.
                         
          58 EXT. KIDNEY BEAN -- DAY 58
                         
           He walks past the Kidney Bean. Something catches his eye
           through the window. He changes direction and enters.
                         
          59 INT. KIDNEY BEAN -- DAY 59
                         
           Max sees Beth eating alone at a table, reading a Tom Robbins
           book. He walks over. Beth isn't thrilled to see him.
                         
                          BETH
           Max? What are you doing here? A sudden
           craving for bird-seed?
                         
                          MAX
           Yeah. I figured I'd had enough actual
           food this week.
                         
                          BETH
           Well, be careful, someone in the corner
           is eating egg salad.
                         
           Max sits down across from her. After an awkward pause:
                         
                          BETH (CONT'D)
           Are you okay?
                         
                          MAX
           Yeah, why?
                         
                          BETH
           No reason. Something about you sounded
           different.
                         
                          MAX
           What? Now?
                         
                          BETH
           No, actually, last night on the... Oh no,
           he's here.
           71.
                         
                         
                         
                          MAX
           But I just left him in the General Store...
                         
          But she isn't talking about Charles: she's looking across the
          room at STEVE, a good-looking guy who is talking to a GIRL.
                         
                          BETH
           Who is he with? He never calls me
           anymore. I think he might be seeing
           someone. Have you heard anything?
                         
                          MAX
           I don't even know him. What's so special
           about this guy, anyway? I mean, are you
           and he...?
                         
                          BETH
           Sort of. Well, no, I guess not.
                          (DISTRACTED)
           I know something's going on. I'm such a
           fool. Why are we always attracted to
           people that are completely wrong for us?
           Is it because they excite us?
                         
                          MAX
           I guess so. You know, we should try to be
           more exciting. Like the other day, I
           waited until the last minute before
           returning a video. And next time, I swear
           I'm not going to rewind.
                         
                          BETH
           I can be a rebel too. The other day I
           went to bed without flossing.
                         
                          MAX
           Boy, are we pathetic.
                         
                          BETH
           Okay, it's pathetic, but we're okay, you
           know? But sometimes, I feel like...
                         
                          MAX
           Yeah. Me too.
                         
          She puts on her coat and gathers her things on her tray.
                         
                          BETH
           I'm glad you're here, Max. I didn't
           realize how much I missed you.
           72.
                         
                         
                         
                          MAX
           I feel the same way about the Sex
           Pistols. Missing them is far cooler than
           having them around.
                         
                          BETH
           That's not what I meant, Max.
                         
           She heads for the exit.
                         
          60 INT. COMMON ROOM -- EVENING 60
                         
           Sam looks dubiously at Max, who waves his arms and shouts.
                         
                          MAX
           What do you mean, you saw Julie with
           someone?
                         
                          SAM
           Just that. Nothing more.
                         
                          MAX
           So what are you saying?
                         
                          SAM
           Nothing. They were having lunch.
                         
                          MAX
           Who was he? What did he look like?
                         
                          SAM
           You're over-reacting.
                         
                          MAX
           How could she see someone else?
                         
                          SAM
           You're not even dating!
                         
                          MAX
           But we might be! I can't handle
           competition, Sam, I'm not the competitive
           type.
                         
                          SAM
           It was just lunch in the cafeteria. He
           looked completely normal.
                         
                          MAX
           I can't compete with that!
           (he fumbles with his coat)
           Man, it's all gone so wrong, so fast.
                         
           He rushes out the door.
           73.
                         
                         
                         
          61 INT. DORM HALLWAY ­ SHELLY HALL 61
                         
           Max knocks on the door to Julie's suite. Nothing. He paces,
           frustrated. Suddenly, JUDY comes out of a stairwell.
                         
                          JUDY
           Hello? Can I help you?
                         
                          MAX
           Yeah, do you know where Julie is?
                         
                          JUDY
           Hey! Are you Max?
                         
                          MAX
           Yeah...
                         
                          JUDY
           Oh wow! You're just like she described.
           Hi, I'm Judy. I'm sure she mentions me
           all the time.
                         
                          MAX
           Oh, yeah, Judy. Right.
                         
           Judy unlocks the door and holds it open.
                         
                          JUDY
           Come in, come in. Make yourself at home.
                         
                          MAX
           Uh, thanks.
                         
          62 INT. JULIE'S SUITE 62
                         
           Max enters cautiously. The common room couldn't be more
           different than his own, clean and tasteful.
                         
           Judy hangs her coat up.
                         
                          JUDY
           This may be completely inappropriate, but
           can I ask you something? The tattoo­ did
           it hurt?
                         
                          MAX
                          (THINKING FAST)
           Uhhhh... No! I mean, not much.
                         
                          JUDY
           Why didn't you use your frat's logo?
           74.
                         
                         
                         
                          MAX
           Well, uh, the guy said it's too hard to
           draw two grown men kissing. Say, which
           one is Julie's room?
                         
                          JUDY
           On the left. She's got the single.
                         
          Max pushes Julie's door open with one hand while keeping an
          eye on the front door.
                         
                          MAX
           So...! Uh, do I come here often, would you
           say?
                         
           JUDY (O.S.)
           What?
                         
          The front door opens and Julie enters.
                         
                          JULIE
           Max! What are you doing here?
                         
                          MAX
           Judy let me in!
                         
          Judy comes out of her room.
                         
                          JUDY
           You know, I think I'm going to get a
           tattoo, too.
                         
                          JULIE
           Judy, Mark has the tattoo. This is Max.
                         
                          JUDY
           What? You're Max?
                         
                          JULIE
           Yeah, isn't he great?
                         
                          JUDY
           Sure.
                         
          Glaring at him, she goes into her room and closes the door.
                         
                          JULIE
           What a surprise! What brings you here?
                         
                          MAX
           I was, uh, in the area and thought I'd
           pop in. Find out how your day went.
           75.
                         
                         
                         
                          JULIE
           It was excellent, how was yours?
                         
                          MAX
           Great. I had lunch with a dear, dear
           friend.
                         
                          JULIE
           Yeah? Anyone I know?
                         
                          MAX
           Probably not. She's a foreign exchange
           student. Spends a lot of time modeling.
                         
                          JULIE
           Really?
                         
                          MAX
           Yeah, the agencies won't leave her alone.
           We had, uh, quite a lunch. Lots of
           shellfish, and wine. And, uh, rhino's
           horn.
                         
                          JULIE
           For lunch?
                         
                          MAX
           Well, yeah, uh, she's on the kosher meal
           plan. Look, I gotta go. Nice seeing you
           again.
                         
           He splits, leaving Julie wondering what that was all about.
                         
          63 EXT. JULIE'S DORM ­ NIGHT 63
                         
           Outside, Max beats himself in the forehead several times.
           Then, a picture of misery, he trudges off--
                         
          64 INT. RADIO STATION 64
                         
           He walks in on someone doing a show. He leaves dejectedly.
                         
          65 INT. COMMON ROOM 65
                         
           He goes back to his suite, where Sam and Jen sit like
           statues, watching "The X-Files." He makes a quick exit.
                         
          66 EXT. JULIE'S DORM ­ NIGHT 66
                         
           Passes by Julie's dorm again.
                         
          67 EXT. UNIVERSITY CENTER ­ NIGHT 67
                         
           Eventually finds himself approaching the University Center.
           76.
                         
                         
                         
          68 INT. THE PUB ­ NIGHT 68
                         
           A ska band plays "These Boots Were Made For Walking" before
           two small lines of skanking rude boys.
                         
           Charles is alone at the bar. Max sits down beside him.
                         
                          MAX
           I just made an ass of myself.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Oh, is it the weekend already?
                         
                          MAX
           Ha-ha.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Don't worry about it. Your troubles don't
           compare. Sara blew up at Stacy and nearly
           destroyed our first rehearsal.
                         
                          MAX
           Yeah, you've got real problems. Do you
           have time to talk?
                         
                          CHARLES
           Uh-oh, here she comes.
                         
                          SARA
           Charles! Can you believe Stacy at
           rehearsal?!
                         
           She jumps on the stool next to him. Charles turns to Max for
           help but he's already gone.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
           TITLE CARD: white on black: "FRIDAY"
                         
          69 INT. COMMON ROOM -- THE NEXT MORNING 69
                         
           Max plays video hockey. Charles comes in.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Studying for a test?
                         
                          MAX
           You shouldn't talk, theater major.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Hey, I have a test on lighting next week
           that'll make your hair go grey.
                         
           He sprawls on the couch.
           77.
                         
                         
                         
                          CHARLES (CONT'D)
           Thanks for bailing on me last night. I
           had to hear Sara gab for an hour.
                         
                          MAX
           Why didn't you just leave? At least you
           can escape your problems.
                         
                          CHARLES
           What do you mean?
                         
                          MAX
           I just got my textbooks for this term.
                         
          Max holds up a thick book, Post-Modern Semiology. The entire
          cover is a still from Annie Hall.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Holy shit.
                         
                          MAX
           When the gods give you a sign like that,
           there's only one thing to do.
                         
          He passes a controller to Charles and they play.
                         
                          CHARLES
           By the way, I saw Julie last night.
                         
                          MAX
           Was she alone?
                         
                          CHARLES
           Not if you count this huge purse she had.
           She was rummaging through it and finally
           had to dump the thing out. I swear, I'm
           surprised Kennedy's brain didn't fall out
           of that thing. Anyway, it made me think
           of Annie Hall.
                         
                          MAX
           Oh, great.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Although Julie dresses better.
                         
          Max slowly lowers his controller.
                         
                          MAX
           What are you saying, I like her because
           she's like Annie Hall?
                         
                          CHARLES
           I didn't say that.
           78.
                         
                         
                         
                          MAX
           Oh my God, I think you're right.
                         
                          CHARLES
           I didn't say that.
                         
                          MAX
           I don't want to like someone because she
           reminds me of someone in a movie. Now I'm
           wondering why I like her. Maybe I don't.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Good Lord, Max. Take some harder classes.
                         
           Sam returns, sees what they are playing.
                         
                          SAM
           Look at you two. Wouldn't something else
           be fun for a change? How about Goldeneye?
                         
                          CHARLES
           Great game.
                         
                          MAX
           No. I don't know how to play it.
                         
                          SAM
           Lucky for you, I actually have time to
           teach you. Normally I would be having
           lunch with Jen.
                         
                          MAX
           Oh, shit, I forgot about lunch!
                         
           Max gets up and runs out. Charles and Sam exchange a look.

           Beth is alone, working on a salad. Max runs up and jumps into
           the booth.
                         
                          BETH

                          BETH
           Yeah, a little. This semester isn't
           shaping up too well. It's tough getting
           back into the groove of things and, you

                          MAX
           God, I'm such an idiot! That film is
           finding more and more ways to ruin my
           life.
                         
          Max pounds his head against the table but Beth is amused.

           Jeez, she's not like Annie when the film
           starts, she's like Annie at the end. Or
           maybe, the Millennium Edition.

           Well, I must admit, it would be... Annie

          Beth snorts, then laughs.

           sense of smell is?
                         
                          SAM
           Come on! What about touch? Missing the
           smell of rotting milk is hardly equal to
           not being able to enjoy sex.
                          (SEEING THEM)
           Oh, hey, Max.
                         
                          MAX
           Hey. Guys, um, this is Julie. Julie, this
           is my roommate Sam, and that's Tommy, who
           also lives here.
                         
                          JULIE
           Nice to meet you guys, but I was just
           leaving.
           85.
                         
                         
                         
                          MAX
           What?
                         
                          JULIE
           I have work to do before class tomorrow.
                         
                          MAX
           But the movie is... Okay. Do you want me to
           walk you home?
                         
                          JULIE
           Sure, all right. Boys, nice to meet you.
                         
           Max leaves with Julie.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Bye.
                          (TO SAM)
           Okay, so what about body odor, then?
                         
          74 INT. JULIE'S ROOM 74
                         
           Max and Julie collapse onto the pillows, exhausted from sex.
           Her room is extremely disorganized, decorated in an
           idiosyncratic mix of punk rock icons and nature scenery.
                         
                          JULIE
           I wish I had a cigarette.
                         
                          MAX
           I wish I smoked.
                         
                          JULIE
           Me too. It's strangely sexy when guys
           smoke.
                         
                          MAX
           Yeah, and it's the only thing between me
           and my dream of becoming Steve McQueen.
                         
           They lie in each other's warmth, under the blanket.
                         
                          JULIE
           So. You and Beth are pretty close, huh?
                         
                          MAX
           You call that pillow talk?
                          (SHRUGS)
           We used to be. There were times I would
           have been lost without her. Other times,
           it was like the lost leading the lost.
                         
                          JULIE
           She really cares about you.
           86.
                         
                         
                         
                          MAX
           We tried something once, but it was a
           disaster.
                         
                          JULIE
           It's great that you're still friends.
                         
                          MAX
           Sometimes I'm not sure if I have a say in
           it. On a campus this small, it's like
           she's everywhere.
                         
                          JULIE
           Sometimes this place annoys me. There's
           so much bullshit. My semester off was the
           right idea. What happened to old-
           fashioned hard work?
                         
                          MAX
           That's what summers are for. The school
           year is for reckless debauchery.
                         
          Max looks at the clock.
                         
                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Jesus, I have to get going. I'll never
           get my homework done if I sleep all
           weekend. Ah, fuck it, who cares.
                         
                          JULIE
           Why not just set your tuition on fire?
                         
                          MAX
           This, coming from the girl who thinks
           college is bullshit.
                         
          Max just lies there, comfortably resting with a small smile.
                         
                          JULIE
           So, get on up, lazy.
                         
          Max sits up and puts one foot on the floor before realizing
          he'll be naked if he stands. He tries to grab his jeans with
          his toes. Julie observes him dryly.
                         
                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           How can you be shy, after, you know...?
                         
                          MAX
           It's different. Some things aren't quite
           as impressive in the light of day.
                         
                          JULIE
           You have a problem with nudity.
           87.
                         
                         
                         
                          MAX
           Of course not. I'm a big fan of it.
                         
           Max picks up his pants. Julie taps him on the shoulder and
           flicks the sheet up to flash him. He starts and drops them.
           She laughs.
                         
                          JULIE
           It's too easy.
                         
           Max puts his jeans on, shoves his underwear and socks in his
           pocket.
                         
                          MAX
           What are you doing tomorrow?
                         
                          JULIE
           A double-shift, I get out at five. This
           week's gonna suck. I have homework that
           can't be avoided.
                         
                          MAX
           The worst kind.
                         
           Max is dressed. They smooch. Max leaves. Julie lies in bed,
           thoughtful.
                         
           Nick Cave begins to croon "Into My Arms"...

           Max leaves the building and stops to look at the winter
           sunrise.

           Students work in the library as light refracts through
           icicles in the window.
                         
           But if I did
           I would kneel down and ask Him

           onto the snow.

           The phone RINGS. Max snaps out of his reverie and stares at
           it in horror. After several rings, he answers it.
                         
                          MAX

           Nice try, Max. I thought you had homework

           What's the point? I have to be up in 15

                          MAX
           I didn't sleep either, but for some

           Sam considers him.
                         
                          SAM
           I don't believe you. Just last week you
           told me the happy should be quarantined.
           I don't know you anymore.
                         
                          MAX
           Still down about Jen, huh?
                         
                          SAM
           We broke up for good last night.
                         
           He gets out of bed and starts dressing.

           Oh, man, I'm sorry.
                         
                          SAM
           I thought I knew what I was doing. Ever
           since she became my girlfriend, I've felt
           more and more constricted. Like I was
           trapped under the weight of the label.
           "My girlfriend." "Her boyfriend."
                         
                          MAX
           You guys were together a long time.
                         
                          SAM
           Yeah, we were.
                         
                          MAX
           Have fun in Saturday lab.
                         
                          SAM
           Ah, eat shit and die.
                         
          86 INT. COMMON ROOM -- HOURS LATER 86
                         
           Max is alone, playing "Goldeneye" with a dopey smile on his
           face. Charles comes in, rolls of blueprints under his arm.
                         
                          CHARLES
           What's this, "Goldeneye"?
                         
           Charles sits and they play against each other.
                         
                          MAX
           Yeah...
                         
                          CHARLES
           Have you been here all day?
                         
                          MAX
           Yeah, this game's so much fun.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Max, gotta tell you, you're really
           creeping me out.
                         
           Tommy comes out of his room, dressed in a shirt and tie.
                         
                          MAX
           Sam said the same thing. He's still
           depressed.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Still can't believe he broke up with Jen.
           I saw her yesterday and she looked sad.

                          CHARLES (CONT'D)
           I asked her how she was doing, and she
           said "Fine," and asked me why I was
           asking.
                         
                          MAX
           A non-denial denial. I invented that.
           She's learned from the best.
                         
                          TOMMY
           I saw her, too. She didn't seem upset to
           me.
                         
          Charles kills Max with a rocket launcher.
                         
                          CHARLES
           I was hanging with Sara. That girl pisses
           me off! She'll say the dumbest things,
           like, the Breeders are better than the
           Beatles.
                         
                          MAX
           Happiness is a warm gun.
                         
                          CHARLES
           I wouldn't go that far. She's just a
           daffy dame, that's all. Now, Stacy's
           foxy, but she's too serious.
                         
                          MAX
           What about Beth?
                         
                          CHARLES
           What about her?
                         
          Sam comes in, totally morose. Silently, he joins them in
          three-player mode, then quickly kills himself with a rocket
          launcher.
                         
                          MAX
           You just came from Jen's, huh?
                         
                          SAM
           Yeah, we just broke up for good.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Oh, man, I'm sorry. Was it you or her?
                         
                          SAM
           Me. Us. Both. It was just time, I guess.
           (puts down the joystick)
           I have to go, uh, mail a letter or
           something.
                         
          He puts on his coat and leaves. Charles, Tommy, and Max
          exchange looks. Max turns off the game.

           Well, that took the wind out of my sails.
                         
                          CHARLES
                          (NOTICING TOMMY)
           What's up with you? Got another date with
           Amanda?
                         
                          TOMMY
           It wasn't a date.
                         
                          CHARLES
           A no-show, huh?
                         
                          TOMMY
           Yeah, but it's okay. Today's her
           birthday, and she invited me out for
           dinner at a nice restaurant.
                         
                          CHARLES
           She invited all of us.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Oh? Well, that's cool, too.
                         
                          MAX
           It's barely lunch, why are you dressed
           up?
                         
                          TOMMY
           I don't want to wait til the last minute
           to pick out my clothes.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Are you really wearing that tie?
                         
                          TOMMY
           Damn, I knew this was the wrong one!
                         
           He runs into his room. Charles laughs at him.
                         
                          MAX
           I don't wanna go to a birthday party. I'm
           broke, and I wanna hang out with Julie.
                         
                          CHARLES
           So take her. And pray Sara's not there.

           Max and Julie walk through the snow together, toward a
           parking lot. She's taking deep drags off a cigarette.

                          JULIE
           This has been some crazy week. I still
           have a six page paper due Monday.
                         
                          MAX
           Six pages? That's nothing. Triple spaced,
           in 14 point type, that's only like 500
           words. If a picture's worth a thousand
           words, that's like a bad photocopy.
                         
                          JULIE
           Don't worry about it, I needed a break.
           Good to get out and enjoy the weather.
                         
                          MAX
           What are you, from Maine?
                         
                          JULIE
           No.
                         
                          MAX
           Phew, because I don't know if I'd be able
           to handle something like that. That's a
           hard thing to drop on a person.
                         
                          JULIE
           I'm from northern Vermont. Not too far
           from Canada.
                         
                          MAX
           Shit, I'm sorry.
                         
                          JULIE
           It sucked but I managed. Read a lot. Had
           a few close friends. That's all you need.
           It's quiet up there, dull but nice.
                         
                          MAX
           It sounds it.
                         
           They get to her car, and he surprises her by kissing her. She
           responds, after a hesitation.

           She drags on her cigarette.
                         
                          MAX
           This is going to be fun. All my friends,
           meeting my girlfriend. It's going to be
           great.
                         
                          JULIE
           Did you just call me your girlfriend?
                         
                          MAX
           Uh, yeah...
                         
                          JULIE
                          (CONSIDERS)
           Ah well, I guess that's alright.
           Boyfriend.
                         
           She looks at Max and smiles.
                         
          89 INT. PRETENTIOUS CAFE -- EVENING 89
                         
           We PAN around a long table: Beth at one end, then Jen and
           Sam, Charles (looking annoyed) and Sara, Tommy at the other
           end, then Scott and Amanda, and two chairs. Everyone's
           talking and looking at menus.
                         
           Max and Julie enter. Max looks around, paranoid. He sees
           Donna the waitress glaring at him, and hurries after Julie,
           who is already at the table introducing herself.
                         
                          AMANDA
           Beth, I can't believe you're graduating
           so early.
                         
                          MAX
           What, really?
           96.
                         
                         
                         
                          BETH
           Yeah. I've spent my life learning how to
           be a student, and at the end of the
           semester it will all be useless.
           Everybody already wants to know what I'm
           going to do, and I have no idea. I
           started making up stories to tell people.
           An aunt asked me if I'm excited about
           Chicago, and I couldn't remember if I'd
           said I was moving to the city or going to
           see the band.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Something similar once happened to me,
           except I didn't know Nashville Pussy was
           a band.
                         
          Tommy laughs and blows tea out his nose.
                         
                          BETH
           I can't believe I'm graduating. My whole
           life, I've known what was next. But when
           I graduate, the next step is... something?
                         
                          JULIE
           Something that pays the bills.
                         
                          MAX
           My grandfather once told me that if you
           love your job, you'll never work a day in
           your life. He's 98 years old, addicted to
           C-SPAN, and had to be removed from a
           supermarket recently for shouting about

           Now I know where you get it from.
                         
                          AMANDA
           You should do whatever makes you happy.

           world as long as possible.
                         
          Sam and Jen sit close together and are both subdued.
                         
                          SAM
           I can't believe I'm graduating next year.
           I already have a recurring nightmare
           about it.
                         
                          JEN
           You have plenty of time, dear.
           97.
                         
                         
                         
          She rubs his arm soothingly. Behind her back, Charles rolls
          his eyes and sticks his finger down his throat. Sara sees it.
                         
                          SARA
           Come on, Charles, show a little dignity.
                         
          He whirls on her.
                         
                          CHARLES
           Dignity? You've been following me around
           like a lost dog since break, and you're
           talking about dignity?! You're always in
           my way, I can't get away from you!
                         
                          SARA
           What are you talking about?!
                         
                          CHARLES
           If they're making me sick, that's my
           business! Leave me alone already!
                         
                          SARA
           Fine!
                         
          She storms out. The table is aghast. Julie averts her eyes
          politely. Beth pokes Max, urging him to do something.
                         
                          JEN
           We make you sick? Sam, say something to
           him!
                         
                          SAM
           Why should I? We've made him sick for
           years.
                         
                          JEN
           How dare you!
                         
                          SAM
           It's true!
                         
          Beth smacks Max's leg: Do something! He begs off.
                         
                          JEN
           You think everything's okay if it's true,
           but some things are true and not okay!
                         
                          SAM
           When are you going to realize I'm a
           different person and entitled to my
           opinion? It's my goddamn life!
                         
          Jen turns away, glaring. Max anxiously looks at Julie, who
          stares above her menu.
           98.
                         
                         
                         
                          AMANDA
           Please, guys, it's my birthday. We're
           here to celebrate.
                         
                          SCOTT
                          (AS "CARTMAN")
           "Can't we all just get along?"
                         
                          AMANDA
           Goddamn it, Scott, I am so sick of you
           making fun of me! You are the meanest
           person I've ever met and I don't know why
           anybody even talks to you! You are such
           an asshole!
                         
          They lock gazes for a beat.
                         
                          SCOTT
           Sorry.
                         
          Sara comes back in and sits down, sullen. There is a long,
          uncomfortable silence.
                         
          A WAITER arrives.
                         
                          WAITER
           Are you ready to order?
                         
                          JEN SAM
           No. Yes.
                         
          Unsure, he turns to the next couple.
                         
                          CHARLES SARA
           Yes. No.
                         
          The waiter looks around, notices the tension.
                         
                          WAITER
           Why don't I come back?
                         
          He leaves. Awkward silence.
                         
                          BETH
                          (CLEARS THROAT)
           Ah... So... Julie. I heard you switched
           majors.
                         
                          JULIE
           Yes, I'm Psych now. I didn't like Soc.
                         
                          JEN
           I'm a Soc. major.

                          JULIE
           Oh sorry, I just meant, I needed
           something more, ya know, relevant.
                         
                          SAM
           Psych is relevant?
                         
                          JULIE
                          (SLIGHTLY DEFENSIVE)
           Well, look, I'm only in college for the
           degree. Most of the stuff they teach us
           is pointless anyway.
                         
          Julie looks at Max: Say something.
                         
                          MAX
                          (FEEBLY)
           Heheh, I bet that's why they call it
           "academic."
                         
                          JEN
           College is a great opportunity. It's
           about more than getting a job.
                         
                          JULIE
           Yeah, it's about avoiding the real world
           for as long as possible.
                         
                          CHARLES
           I work in theater, so this is great
           training for me.
                         
                          JULIE
           You call theater the real world?
                         
                          SARA
           Hey!
                         
          Now Julie is hitting Max's leg: Help me out here! But Max is
          petrified, watching his worst nightmare unfold.
                         
                          JEN
           Some of us work really hard to get
           through school.
                         
                          JULIE
           Look, my parents worked their whole lives
           to give me the opportunity to be here.
           But the truth is, private schools like
           ours make money by showing students a
           good time for four years. It's bullshit.
                         
                          AMANDA
           You think social work is bullshit?
           100.
                         
                         
                         
                          JULIE
           That's not what I--
                         
                          CHARLES
           This "bullshit" is going to put me in
           debt for the next forty years.
                         
           Julie punches Max in the thigh. He jumps, blinks.
                         
                          JEN
           Why don't you just drop out if
           everything's such bullshit?
                         
                          MAX
           So what's everybody going to order then?
                         
                          JULIE
           God. What a bunch of spoiled, whiny
           college brats.
                         
           Nobody has anything more to say. Everyone looks away. Max is
           shell-shocked.
                         
                          TOMMY
           I'm gonna work for NASA!
                         
          90 EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MAX'S DORM -- NIGHT 90
                         
           Julie's car pulls up. Her bumper sticker: "EAT ANIMALS, DON'T
                          `LOVE' THEM"
                         
           Max opens the door, gets halfway out, turns back.
                         
                          MAX
           Are you sure?
                         
                          JULIE
           No, it's okay. I just need a few hours to
           work.
                         
                          MAX
           It'll be fun, just the two of us.
                         
           Julie lights a cigarette off her old one.
                         
                          JULIE
           Okay, see you later.
                         
           She peels out.
                         
          91 INT. COMMON ROOM -- NIGHT 91
                         
           Max straightens up. Scott comes out of his bedroom.
           101.
                         
                         
                         
                          SCOTT
           If she stands you up, are we still not
           allowed in here? It's my time to watch
           "South Park."
                         
                          MAX
           Why would she do that?
                         
                          SCOTT
                          (SHRUGS)
           It's already past eleven.
                         
           There's a KNOCK on the door.
                         
                          MAX
           See?
                         
           Max gets the door. Scott exits, disappointed. Julie enters,
           smoking.
                         
                          JULIE
           Hey. Sorry I'm late. You wouldn't believe
           what cross-campus traffic was like.
                         
                          MAX
           That's the worst excuse I ever heard. I
           mean it. So... you wanna hit the video
           store?
                         
                          JULIE
           No, you've got something here that I've
           been looking forward to all week.
                         
           She grabs Annie Hall from the shelf.
                         
                          MAX
           Ah, shit, no.
                         
                          JULIE
           You must face your fears. Relax, it's a
           very positive film. You just have to know
           how to look at it. It's really
           refreshingly positive.
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:

           The closing credits are rolling. Max and Julie look somewhat
           disconcerted.
                         
                          MAX
           Boy, what an uplifting movie. Such a
           refreshingly positive message.
           102.
                         
                         
                         
          She doesn't respond.
                         
                          MAX (CONT'D)
           Right?
                         
                          JULIE
           You know, I think I prefer Manhattan.
                         
                          MAX
           How can you say that? Annie Hall is so
           uplifting!
                         
                          JULIE
           It's just deeper, more sophisticated, I
           guess. Listen, thanks for dinner and the
           movie tonight, but I should get going.
                         
                          MAX
           But it's still early.
                         
          Julie goes to the door. Max follows. He tries to kiss her.
          She pulls back.
                         
                          JULIE
           I don't know if this is a good idea right
           now.
                         
                          MAX
           Okay, how about right... now?
                         
          He tries to kiss her again. She ducks it, comes back into the
          room, sits down. Max stands, tense.
                         
                          JULIE
           Listen, since the other night, I've been
           doing some thinking...
                         
                          MAX
           There's your mistake. Mindless happiness
           is always better than thoughtful
           reservation. Unless you're talking about
           nude bungee jumping.
                         
                          JULIE
           I don't think that this is a good time
           for us to jump, or leap, or whatever, you
           know, together. Into a relationship.
                         
                          MAX
           But, but... we just saw a movie about how
           relationships are worth it, no matter
           what happens.
           103.
                         
                         
                         
                          JULIE
           Did we?
                         
                          MAX
           Yeah, I guess we really did.
                         
                          JULIE
           Well, you're right, Max, and this
           relationship was worth it.
                         
                          MAX
           Was? Is. Wait... Oh, shit!
                         
          Max covers his face, breathes deep.
                         
                          JULIE
           Are you okay? Will you please calm down?
           I like you very much, but I told you, I
           just got out of a serious relationship,
           and it ended really badly. We saw each
           other almost every day at the beginning,
           but by the end of the semester, I hadn't
           seen him in a month. He stopped returning
           my calls and stuff, and I mean, he
           basically avoided me, then I heard he was
           seeing one of my friends.
                         
                          MAX
           But that was him, not me.
                         
                          JULIE
           It's nobody's fault, I know. I mean, I've
           been trying but it's hard. Relationships
           are very difficult to maintain. There are
           so few successful couples.
                         
                          MAX
           What's successful? Like, my parents have
           been married thirty years, but--
                         
                          JULIE
           My parents are divorced.
                         
                          MAX
           Okay, bad example. But why think ahead?
           We're here, now. Can't we just enjoy our
           time together?
                         
                          JULIE
           Max, I did, believe me.
                         
                          MAX
           What was all this, I mean, was any of it­
           104.
                         
                         
                         
                          JULIE
           I don't know what I was doing. I didn't
           think about where this might lead until
           it was too late.
                         
                          MAX
           But it might lead to... happiness.
                         
          Tommy walks in, half asleep, in his pajamas. He turns on the
          TV and sits down. Max stares at him. Tommy suddenly realizes
          he isn't alone.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Uh, re-run.
                         
          He turns it off and quickly exits. Max tries to pull himself
          together.
                         
                          JULIE
           Say something. Are you okay?
                         
                          MAX
           I knew that damn film was cursed! Why did
           I listen to Charles instead of Annie?
                         
                          JULIE
           Jesus, Max. It's not an anti-relationship
           movie.
                         
                          MAX
           What are you talking about? It's a
           fucking textbook.
                         
          She stands.
                         
                          JULIE
           You're not listening to me, Max. Just
           like you're not listening to Annie. No
           matter what you think right now, this was
           worth it. Because I got to meet you, and
           got to be close to you.
                         
                          MAX
           I know. I don't know. I mean... Good-bye.
                         
          Julie leaves. The VCR whirs to a stop and Annie Hall ejects.
          Max stares at it, upset and thoughtful.
                         
                          CUT TO:

          93 INT. COMMON ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON 93
                         
           PAN left to right across people's chests: an X-Files shirt, a
           lounge shirt with a wide collar, a Stephen Hawking shirt, an
           Ani DiFranco shirt...
                         
           PULL BACK to reveal, l to r, Sam, Charles, Tommy and Amanda,
           sprawled on the couches, from Max's POV in the doorway.
                         
           They're drinking vodka out of coffee mugs. The TV is on but
           the sound is off. Everyone looks tired and sad.
                         
           Max sits. Sam thumbs a copy of Scientific American.
                         
                          SAM
           Why are humans smarter than chimps if we
           have 99% of the same genetic material?
                         
                          MAX
           Who says we're smarter?
                         
                          SAM
           Look who I'm asking. You think a red
           blood cell is a prison for a gang member.
                         
                          MAX
           Very funny, Mr. Wizard. If I learned
           anything useful in my classes, I'd be
           rubbing it in your face.
                         
           In Scott's usual spot is Amanda and Tommy.
                         
                          TOMMY
           So Amanda. Have a good weekend?
                         
                          AMANDA
           Yeah.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Mine was good too. Get any good birthday
           presents?
                         
                          AMANDA
           Yeah.
                         
           She gets up and leaves the room.
                         
                          SAM
           By the way, Max, what ever happened with
           that girl you were seeing?
                         
                          MAX
           She just ended a long relationship and
           she doesn't want anything serious.
           106.
                         
                         
                         
                          CHARLES
           Can't you have something that's not so
           serious?
                         
                          MAX
           No, it's dead. And the thing I don't get
           is, it was all going so well. There was a
           moment when we kissed, when it was more
           than a kiss...
                         
          His openness is making the other guys uncomfortable.
                         
                          MAX (CONT'D)
           It was like we broke through all our
           layers, you know, all the manners and
           defense mechanisms and daily crap, and I
           saw a flash of something, a glimmer of
           hope or happiness or whatever, something
           I inspired in her. But now it's over and
           I'll never see that part of her again.
                         
                          CHARLES
           I think you're upset about not seeing
           some other parts of her again.
                         
          The joke is half-hearted-- Max has made everyone reflective.
                         
                          CHARLES (CONT'D)
           She's a girl, Max. They'll always be a
           mystery. You'll never know why they love
           you and you'll never know why they don't.
                         
                          SAM
           Relationships are incredibly complicated.
           Like polypeptide strings. There's an
           attraction at first, but if the bonds
           don't form right away, nothing can make
           the connection work.
                         
                          MAX
           There's a metaphor we can all relate to.
                         
                          SAM
           It was like with Jen and I. But I know it
           was for the best.
                         
                          CHARLES
           I finally dropped out of the play I was
           directing, just to get rid of Sara. God,
           my career is in shambles.
                         
                          TOMMY
           Tough week all around, huh? How about
           some video hockey?
           107.
                         
                         
                         
           Max gets up and puts on his coat.
                         
                          MAX
           I think I prefer Goldeneye.
                         
           He leaves. Sam sighs and picks up the remote.
                         
                          SAM
           Wanna watch Sports Center?
                         
                          CHARLES
           Nah. I think I'm gonna call Sara...
                         
           He gets up and leaves as Sam registers this news. He puts the
           remote down.
                         
          94 EXT. CAMPUS GREEN ­ DUSK 94
                         
           It is moist and foggy as Max trudges across the deserted
           campus.
                         
           BETH (O.S.)
           Max!
                         
           Max stops in the middle of a path as Beth walks up.
                         
                          BETH (CONT'D)
           Hi there. Happy Valentine's Day.
                         
                          MAX
           Oo, witty.
                         
                          BETH
           Yeah, I hate Valentine's Day, too. If
           you're in love, you're in love. And if
           you're not, who wants to think about it?
           I want to be in love so badly, don't you?
                         
                          MAX
           You know, there's this joke...
                         
                          BETH
           Ah, forget it, Max.
                         
                          MAX
           You know the joke?
                         
                          BETH
           Does a bear shit in the woods?
                         
                          MAX
           Yeah, that's the one.
           108.
                         
                         
                          BETH
           You told it the night of our date. I hate
           that joke, Max. It's not a philosophy.
                         
                          MAX
           But I think I know what it means now.
                         
                          BETH
           Yeah, and it's dreary and depressing,
           right?
                         
                          MAX
           Not this time.
                         
                          BETH
           No?
                         
                          MAX
                          (INTIMATELY)
           Beth, I just want to say, before it's all
           over and I don't have the chance, that
           I'm sorry. For everything. Last semester
           and last year.
                         
          Beth is speechless; she never though she'd ever hear that.
                         
                          MAX (CONT'D)
           You mean the world to me, and I was an
           idiot to throw it away. You were right:
           if I can't be a friend to you, how could
           I be a boyfriend? I've done a lot of
           things wrong, and I've been confused as
           hell, but I think it's time for a change.
                         
          Beth looks him over, as if for the first time.
                         
                          BETH
           Really?
                         
                          MAX
           Really.
                         
                          BETH
           Then allow me to recommend a movie that
           you've never seen before. It's called
           Annie Hall.
                         
                          MAX
           I was going to see it tonight. Do you
           want to join me?
                         
                          BETH
           I would love to, but I think you need to
           do this alone.
           109.
                         
                         
                         
                          MAX
           No, you're right.
                         
                          BETH
           But I'll see you later?
                         
                          MAX
           Sure. After the movie, I'm doing my last
           radio show. It's going to be all
           requests. You should tune in.
                         
                          BETH
           The end of an era.
                         
                          MAX
           The start of a new one.
                         
          He smiles and walks away. The fog begins to obscure him.
                         
          Beth opens her backpack and removes a Walkman. She hits POWER
          and the LED changes from TAPE to RADIO.
                         
           MAX (V.O.) (cont'd)
           And that's how I let go of her. Although,
           it's probably more honest to say that she
           let go of me. Julie, Beth, and Annie.
           Three women in my life and I was
           desperate for one.
                         
          REVERSE ANGLE. Beth stands alone, watching him go. She snaps
          the headphones over her ears.
                         
           MAX (V.O.) (cont'd)
           Of course, I saw her again. It's a small
           campus. The last time was at a film
           festival. We're better friends now then
           ever, and there's always a chance we can
           have some kind of future together. So
           far, so good.
                         
          Finally, Beth turns and walks away.
                         
          CUT BACK TO: Max still walking, getting smaller and smaller.
          Soon all we see is fog.
                         
           MAX (V.O.) (cont'd)
           She'll always mean a lot to me, and it's
           nice to run into her and reminisce about
           what we, ya know, went through. It was a
           weird period of my life. I mean, shit, I
           really got off track there, didn't I?

           Celeste is a chronic overachiever and Jesse is sweet, goofy
           and funny. He makes her laugh. They are best friends but it's
           clear that Jesse wishes they were more.

          2 INT. TOYOTA PRIUS-DAY 2
                         
           It's a bright, clear Los Angeles Saturday afternoon. Celeste
           and Jesse, now 30, both sing along to "Love Rhino," the song
           heard under the montage. Jesse drives while Celeste is on her
           Blackberry. Jesse, boyishly handsome, wears an old tee and a
           hooded sweatshirt. Celeste is wearing all black workout
           gear. She is always wearing all black.
                         
                          JESSE
           I'm a Love Rhino...
                         
                          CELESTE JESSE
           Don't worry `bout me, I've Dont' worry `bout me, I've
           got a enough love for got enough love, for the two
           the...(her Blackberry rings) us. Oh please...
           oh shit, I gotta take this.
           Turn it down.
                         
           JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           ...I'm a Love...
                         
                          CELESTE
           Jess, turn it down, seriously!
                         
           She playfully slaps him. He turns it down. A little.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Hello? Hi. With Jesse, running
           errands. (to Jesse) Turn it down.
           More. (back to the phone) Yeah, I
           can do it now. No, it'll be fast,
           right? (To Jesse) Hey, I have to
           give a quick sound bite for the New
           York Times, so no noise please? For
           a second?
                         
                          JESSE
           Maybe. I may have an important call
           coming in too, so...
                         
           They both know he has no important call coming in.
                         
                          CELESTE
           (on the phone) Okay. Ready? This
           year all trends point towards
           simplicity and comfort.
                         
           Celeste is momentarily distracted by a bad driver in front of
           them.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Jess, just go around him! (To the
           phone) Sorry.
                          (MORE)

           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Consumers will be less likely to go
           out for entertainment.
                         
          While Celeste is dictating, Jesse is getting bored. He starts
          looking through the middle console. He finds something. A
          melted tube of Chapstick. Ew. Ooh, a cigarette. Jesse lights
          the cigarette, takes a drag. Celeste looks at Jesse and
          signals to him, "Can I have a drag?"
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Uhhh, things like Voodoo, casual
           wear and cookbooks will see a huge
           spike in the market.
                         
          He hands her the cigarette and she promptly chucks it out the
          window.
                         
                          JESSE
           What the shit??
                         
                          CELESTE
           (she whispers to Jesse) Shhh. Phone
           call.(back to her call) That's
           enough of a blurb, right?
                         
          Jesse is now checking out nose hairs in the visor mirror. He
          then looks at his teeth.
                         
                          JESSE
           Does this tooth look dark?
                         
          Celeste just glares at him.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Okay. Call me back if they need
           more.
                         
          Jesse looks at his tooth again in the rearview mirror.
                         
                          JESSE
           Like a little darker than the rest?
                         
          Celeste waves her hand to quiet Jesse.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Okay, thanks bye. (to Jesse) Can't
           you just sit still for two minutes?
           And we talked about this, no more
           smoking!
                         
                          JESSE
           I wasn't smoking, I just found it.
           4.
                         
                         
                          CELESTE
           Come on.
                         
           They drive by "Urban Light," Chris Burden's installation at
           the entrance of LACMA. They are rows of restored street
           lamps. Celeste sneers.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Really? Street lamps? No. Not doin'
           it. That is not art.
                         
                          JESSE
           I think it's beautiful.
                         
           A beat passes. Then, Jesse pulls over.
                         
                          CELESTE
           What are you doing? Why are you
           stopping?
                         
                          JESSE
           Well, your appointment is not until
           noon and this is that place with
           the deadstock vintage Italian
           fabric. I thought it would be good
           for the guest room windows.
                         
           Celeste is truly touched by the gesture.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Oh wow...you are so thoughtful.
                         
           Jesse smiles, proud of himself.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Thanks, Jess.
                         
           She gives him a kiss on the cheek. Jesse's phone rings, he
           answers.
                         
                          JESSE
           Whassup, muthafucka??
                         
           Celeste rolls her eyes and gets out of the car to look at
           fabric.

           Jess, that place is insane. They
           have tassels that were manufactured
           for Mussolini's mistress...
                         
                          JESSE
           (covering the phone) Sorry, I'm on
           the phone. It's important.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Okay then.
                         
          Celeste sits quietly while Jesse is on his call.
                         
                          JESSE
           Really? I just...don't know what to
           say. Thank you so much for calling
           me.
                         
          Celeste throws her hands up in silent celebration.
                         
                          CELESTE
           (whispers) Did you get the job??
                         
          Jesse signals with his finger, "one minute."
                         
                          JESSE
           Well, sometimes things are just
           meant to work out.

           Tucker gets up and leaves. Jesse and Celeste watch him leave
           and sip their wine quietly.

           Celeste drives and Jesse is in the passenger seat. He has a
           tube of Vaseline Lip Therapy. He is stroking it rapidly as if
           it were a penis. This is not the first time.

           Celeste looks at him. She joins in. She reaches over and
           pushes in on the tube. Vaseline comes out of the top. This
           looks a lot like a penis ejaculating.

           is living in her guest house.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Hey, it's kinda chilly tonight,
           how's the heat in there?
                         
                          JESSE
           Oh, it's fine. I'm fine.
                         
           He keeps walking. He turns again to Celeste.
           12.
                         
                         
           JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Sorry I'm still living here. Times
           are tough and money's tight so you
           know...
                         
                          CELESTE
           Jesse, please, you can stay here as
           long as you like. It's your
           studio. It's actually really nice
           to have you here.
                         
                          JESSE
           For me too.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Oh, don't forget, the contractor
           needs to get in there for
           measurements in the morning. So
           make sure your thingys, your
           sculptures, whatever...are out of
           the way.
                         
                          JESSE
           Got it.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Night.
                         
                          JESSE
           Night. Love you.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Love you too.
                         
                         
          8 INT. CELESTE'S HOUSE-MORNING 8
                         
           Celeste's morning symphony is under way. She sits in front of
           a bowl of oatmeal, a bowl of berries, a cup of coffee, 4
           neatly stacked newspapers, her laptop and the television
           tuned to CNN. She methodically eats, sips her coffee, reads
           the paper, watches TV, and surfs the internet. She is clearly
           a culture vulture. Jesse walks by outside his studio and does
           the "C and J" sign to Celeste. She does it back
           instinctively. Is it weird that we hang out so much? She
           shakes it off and titters. She's being ridiculous; it's fine.
                         
                         
          9 INT. COFFEE BEAN- MORNING 9
                         
           Celeste walks in, dressed impeccably. Again, in all black.
           She is in a rush, on her Blackberry, bombarded with a hefty
           pre-work crowd. People are in some semblance of a line,
           waiting to order.
           13.
                         
                         
          Celeste spots a man in a business suit, taking advantage of
          the confusion and cutting in front of a woman at the head of
          the line. He orders.
                         
                          BUSINESS MAN
           Large coffee, please.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Excuse me, sir?
                         
          The business man pretends to not hear her.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Sir? You?
                         
          She taps him on the arm. He turns around.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           You do realize that you just cut in
           front of a lot of people.
                         
                          BUSINESS MAN
           Oh. Sorry, I didn't know.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Did you not?
                         
                          BUSINESS MAN
           I'm in a rush.
                         
                          CELESTE
           So you did know. And everyone's in
           a rush, so...
                         
          Other people in line are now paying attention. Celeste wants
          to let it go, but she can't.
                         
                          BUSINESS MAN
           Well, she was looking at the
           pastries, I didn't think she was
           ready to order.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Well, it's not just her. It's
           everyone behind her too. So, if you
           want to ask all these people if
           it's okay to cut in front of them
           because you are late, be my guest.
           Just don't assume that your time is
           more important than everyone
           else's.
                         
          The business man gets his coffee.
           14.

           Have a nice day.

           Pop Form Headquarters looks like the future. No walls, just
           large glass slabs, separate the offices from each other.
                         
           Celeste is on camera, in the middle of conducting a live
           satellite interview for MSNBC.
                         
                          CELESTE
           American culture is dying. We have
           an unrelenting appetite for
           processed junk food, talentless pop
           stars like Riley Banks and recycled
           movie franchises like Transformers.
           The more we consume crap, the more
           we want crap.

          11 INT. MSNBC STUDIOS 11
                         
           Rachel Maddow is conducting the interview in studio.
                         
                          RACHEL MADDOW
           Sounds utterly hopeless. Is there
           an upshot?
                         
                          CELESTE
           I think there will be a groundswell
           movement towards simplicity.
           People will start to listen to
           their most rudimentary needs-- they
           will crave mental, spiritual and
           physical nourishment. It's back to
           basics.
                         
                          RACHEL MADDOW
           Wow, a lot to chew on. Well, thanks
           for being with us today. You're
           great, come back any time. For more
           on this gloomy but interesting
           subject, look out for trend

          12 INT. SCOTT'S OFFICE-AFTERNOON 12
                         
           SCOTT, 40, Celeste's partner, gay but very straight, sharply
           dressed and bespectacled, sits at his desk. Celeste enters.
                         
                          CELESTE
           So I had dinner with the drama club
           last night.
                         
                          SCOTT
           Who's that?
                         
                          CELESTE
           Tucker and Beth. They're such
           dicks. They left in protest because
           they think Jesse and I are being
           "unhealthy." So judgy, right? We're
           fine.
                         
                          SCOTT
           You're only done when you're done.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Spare me the spiritual platitudes,
           Scotty. If we were gay,(she motions
           to Scott) no one would even
           question us being friends!
                         
                          SCOTT
           You and Jesse are clearly not ready
           to let each other go. And there's
           nothing wrong with that.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Yeah there's nothing wrong with
           that. I mean, what do you think?
                         
                          SCOTT
           Well, to be honest...
                         
           Celeste looks at an e-mail her blackberry and interrupts.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Wait, we're signing Riley Banks??
           When were you going to tell me?? I
           just trashed her on Rachel Maddow.
           Great.
           16.
                         
                         
                          SCOTT
           Yeah, that's why I wanted you to
           come in. It's a huge account..
                         
                          CELESTE
           Scott, you and I built this company
           so we wouldn't have to take an
           account like Riley Banks.
                         
                          SCOTT
           Well, you and I may not have a
           company if we don't take Riley
           Banks. Recession, remember?
                         
                          CELESTE
           She's like a...soul-less hologram.
                         
                          SCOTT
           She is releasing a new album. She
           wants us to do the branding and
           merchandising. We need to take this
           account.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Ok. Fine. I'm gonna go eat lunch.
                         
          Celeste starts to heads out.
                         
                          SCOTT
           If you are looking for my opinion,
           I do think you should start dating.
                         
                          CELESTE
           I don't do dating. The right guy
           will show up. And I'm still on
           track for my 25 year plan.
                         
                          SCOTT
           No one has a 25 year plan. Except
           for my mortgage company.
                         
                          CELESTE
           First child at 33. Second at 35.
           Which means I will only be 56 at my
           eldest's college graduation. The
           bad news is that I may not be at my
           4th grandchild's high school
           graduation. But that's okay, I
           guess.
                         
                          SCOTT
           I'm fascinated with the mentally
           ill.

                          CELESTE
           I've got time. I'm not worried.
                         
                          SCOTT
           Well, do me a favor and get your
           fuck on before you meet the next
           guy.
                         
           Celeste looks at Scott in shock.
                         
                          CELESTE
           What are you doing?
                         
                          SCOTT
           Sorry, I was trying to be your
           saucy gay friend. It didn't feel
           good.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Yeah don't.
                         
                         
          13 EXT. YOGA YURT-AFTERNOON 13
                         
           Jesse and SKILLZ, 32, another man-boy, in hip-hop gear, wait
           in a very, very long line of very, very hip people at LA's
           trendiest new yogurt place.
                         
                          SKILLZ
           The economic climate is real bad,
           man. And I think my business is
           taking the hardest hit of all. It's
           brutal. And no one's talking about
           it.
                         
                          JESSE
           You sell pot.
                         
                          SKILLZ
           Not for long, dude. Have you been
           to those weed pharmacies? They're
           killing me. I gotta branch out.
           Maybe start working in
           methamphetamines? Or maybe teach
           pre-school. I always wanted to do
           that. I love kids.
                         
           Skillz is distracted by something.

           Sorry, I know this is serious talky
           time but would you look at the
           fucking seat on that girl?
           18.
                         
                         
          We see a girl's apple bottom butt stuffed into blue jeans.

           THAT is a party.
                         
          Jesse does not laugh. He looks like he is in pain.
                         
                          JESSE
           I don't think it's over.
                         
                          SKILLZ
           What? Her butt? No, it will never
           be over. It goes on forever. It's
           like space. So great.
                         
                          JESSE
           No, Celeste and I. I think she's
           just confused and overwhelmed right
           now about everything. But she'll
           come around. She always does.
                         
                          SKILLZ
           Uh oh. It's been a while now. I
           think it's over, bro. It may be
           time to accept that and move on.
           Call that dime Veronica.
                         
          Jesse looks uncomfortable.
                         
                          JESSE
           That was a one time thing, a couple
           months after Celeste and I broke
           up. Celeste does not know about
           that. And we will keep it that
           way.
                         
                          SKILLZ
           Didn't know that was a hit and run.
           Sounded like you liked her.
                         
                          JESSE
           Well, she's not Celeste. It's
           always been Celeste. I'm not ready
           to give up.
                         
                          SKILLZ
           Okay, but remember, you can't re-
           heat a souffle.
                         
                          JESSE
           Huh?
           19.
                         
                         
                          SKILLZ
           Also, there's Bettys everywhere.
           It's LA. Maybe it's good to remind
           Celeste that you can pull wool.
           Make her sweat a little bit.
                         
                          JESSE
           It definitely wouldn't hurt to...go
           out with somebody.
                         
           They reach the front of the line.
                         
                          YOGURT GIRL
           Do you know what you want?
                         
                          JESSE
           Yeah, I want to not be a quitter. I
           don't want to start all over again.
           I want everything that I believed
           to have been true to be true. I
           also want a goji berry/green tea
           swirl with yogurt chips and Fruity
           Pebbles. Please.
                         
                          SKILLZ
           (to Yogurt Girl) Hey, you should go
           out on a date with my friend here.
                         
                          YOGURT GIRL
           Um, wait, where's your wife? You
           guys are here like everyday
           together.
                         
                          JESSE
           Well...we're separated.
                         
                          YOGURT GIRL
           Oh. Cool. I mean, bummer. But okay.
           I'll go.
                         
                         
          14 INT. LACMA-LATE AFTERNOON 14
                         
           Celeste and Beth wander amidst the modern art. They stop to
           take in a Cindy Sherman photo.
                         
                          BETH
           It's so...grotesque.
                         
                          CELESTE
           But kind of beautiful. In a
           grotesque way.
           20.
                         
                         
                          BETH
           Ugh, let's keep moving. Too many
           feelings.
                         
          Celeste and Beth wander to the wall and stare at a Damien
          Hirst collage.
                         
           BETH (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           I need to say this and then I'll
           never bring it up again. I'm sorry
           I wigged on you guys the other
           night but I don't know what you're
           doing. I think it's stupid that
           you're not together. You are best
           friends and that's the hard part.
           Nothing else matters.
                         
          Celeste and Beth stand in silence. Then:
                         
                          CELESTE
           Beth, the reality is I love Jesse
           dearly but he doesn't have a
           checking account. Or dress shoes.
           The father of my children will have
           a car. But...Jesse will always be
           my best friend.
                         
                          BETH
           Okay fine. I've said my peace. It's
           your life. But I definitely don't
           think he should be living in your
           guest house. I think you're kind of
           breaking his heart. Slowly.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Jesse is fine.
                         
                          BETH
           Can I show you something?
                         
                          CELESTE
           Sure.
                         
          Beth suddenly pulls Celeste into a corner. With no art.
                         
                          BETH
           Okay. Look.
                         
          She points to her neck.
                         
                          CELESTE
           What am I looking at?
           21.
                         
                         
                          BETH
           It's a hair. On my NECK.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Ewww. Will you get that thing
           lasered off, please? What the fuck?
                         
                          BETH
           I can't because it will pop up
           somewhere else where I can't keep
           my eye on it.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Are you serious? That's the
           craziest thing I've ever heard.
           It's not a turnip.
                         
                          BETH
           Trust me, I know my body. It's a
           cruel land mine.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Okay, well at least pluck it for
           Chrissake.
                         
                          BETH
           I should, at least before my
           wedding, right?
                         
                          CELESTE
           What is wrong with you?
                         
          Celeste grabs the hair and pulls it out.
                         
                          BETH
           (in pain) AHHHHHHHHHH!
                         
          A security guard heads for them.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Sorry sir, my friend has a really
           strong emotional reaction to modern
           art.
                         
                          BETH
           That was fucking rude.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Had to be done.
           22.
                         
                         
          15 EXT. JESSE'S STUDIO-EARLY EVENING 15
                         
           The studio is beautifully, magically chaotic. There are
           large canvasses everywhere, paint rags, spray cans, common
           household items turned into sculptures (buttons, clothespin,
           hangers) and mobiles. Celeste walks in. Jesse is on a
           mattress on the floor, he's clearly been sitting there for a
           while. He is fist-deep in a huge bag of Cheetos and he's
           watching the 2008 Beijing Olympics on Tivo. He is watching a
           short feature about Olympian Matthias Steiner, a gold
           medalist in weight lifting.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Hey...you're not working? Are you
           watching the Olympics? Again? And
           crying? Again?
                         
           Jesse blows his nose.
                         
                          JESSE
           Yeah.
                         
                          CELESTE
           God, you really love that, don't
           you?
                         
                          JESSE
           Matthias' wife died in a car
           accident last year.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Well, three years ago now but...
                         
                          JESSE
           And he dedicated his gold medal to
           her. The human spirit
           is...unbreakable.
                         
           Jesse is choked up, can barely speak.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Uh huh. Hey, did you finish that
           artwork for the Pop Form website?
                         
                          JESSE
           Huh? Oh yeah, I'm almost done. I'm
           working on it. I think you'll
           really like it.
                         
                          CELESTE
           I'll like it more when I have it
           because I needed it yesterday,
           so...
           23.
                         
                         
          Jesse turns off the television, takes a deep breath, wipes
          his eyes and recovers.
                         
                          JESSE
           Celeste, can you sit down for a
           minute? I have something really
           important to tell you.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Oh. Okay. Does it have something to
           do with the work you owe me?
                         
          Celeste sits. Jesse sits next to her. Again, he has tears in
          his eyes.
                         
                          JESSE
           I don't know how to tell you this
           but...I have a date tonight. I'm
           gonna start dating. People.
                         
                          CELESTE
           A date? Really? That is so great.
                         
                          JESSE
           It is? You don't...
                         
                          CELESTE
           Yeah! Don't cry. Good for you,
           Jess.
                         
                          JESSE
           That doesn't bother you? Wow, okay.
           Well, it's actually the Yogurt
           Girl. From Yoga Yurt?
                         
                          CELESTE
           Really? Yogurt Girl, huh. She's
           cute! But so young, right?
                         
                          JESSE
           Super young. Her body is all-time.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Okay, no need for that. But this is
           good! You gotta crawl before you
           walk. I mean she's definitely not
           gonna be wifey number two, right?
           Ha.
                         
                          JESSE
           Well, it's just a date.
                         
          She hugs him in an unconsciously patronizing way.
           24.
                         
                         
                          CELESTE
           Big move. I'm proud of you.
                         
          Jesse looks confused and slightly hurt.
                         
                          JESSE
           Thanks?
                         
                          CELESTE
           Can I get up now?
                         
                          JESSE
           Huh? Yeah, sure.
                         
          Celeste gets up and is immediately fixated by his hair.
                         
           JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Yeah, Skillz kinda made me do it
           and from the get go, she was way
           into...what are you looking at?
                         
                          CELESTE
           No, nothing. Are you gonna wear
           your hair like that?
                         
                          JESSE
           What? Oh. I don't know, is it
           weird?
                         
                          CELESTE
           Not weird, just different from how
           it looks best.
                         
          She walks over and starts messing with his hair as he
          continues.
                         
                          JESSE
           Anyway, this is what we're doing
           right? We're getting divorced and
           we're friends and we're also dating
           people? That's what we're doing?
                         
          She is satisfied with her work. She steps back.
                         
                          CELESTE
           There. Better. You'll be great. You
           don't even need to be great. Just
           be you. Take her somewhere nice.
                         
                          JESSE
           Okay mom.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Call me after?
           25.
                         
                         
          16 INT. HATFIELD'S RESTAURANT-NIGHT 16
                         
           Jesse is on a date with Yogurt girl. It's clear he's hasn't
           been doing a lot of talking.
                         
                          YOGURT GIRL
           So I was in school but then I
           dropped out because I really wanted
           to work in fashion but it's really
           hard to find a paid internship? So
           I went back to school and now I
           work at Yoga Yurt part time but I'm
           really looking to make money doing
           something I love? But I'm sure the
           universe is looking out for me and
           when the time is right, the right
           thing will come along, you know?
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          17 INT. CELESTE'S BEDROOM- NIGHT 17
                         
           Celeste is in bed on the computer. She hears noise from the
           outside. She listens more intently and hears Jesse... and a
           woman, giggling and talking loudly. Then, the studio door
           shuts. Is Yogurt Girl sleeping over? He wouldn't do that.
           Would he?
                         
                         
          18 EXT. CELESTE'S GARDEN- NEXT MORNING 18
                         
           Again, with the morning symphony. Celeste drinks coffee, eats
           breakfast, surfs the internet and flips through magazines.
           This time, she's also listening to a song from Riley Banks'
           new album. It's exactly what she thought it would be.
           Overproduced, auto-tuned and meaningless. She nods her head,
           "yeah, I get it." She turns it off.
                         
           Celeste can't stop herself from constantly looking over at
           the studio to see if Yogurt Girl is still in there. Finally,
           a sleeping Jesse stirs for a minute and changes position. He
           is alone. Phew.
                         
                         
          19 INT. BORDER'S BOOKS-LATER THAT DAY 19
                         
           Celeste, Beth, Tucker and Jesse browse as a foursome for
           books.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Where is it? They told me it would
           be in new releases...
           26.
                         
                         
          Celeste searches frantically for her book. She peeks around a
          corner at a very obscured aisle with a sign reading "More New
          Releases." Three copies of her book, "Shitegeist" appear in
          the very bottom row, barely visible. She is disappointed.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           That's what I call placement.
                         
          She grabs a copy of her book and briskly walks back to the
          front of the store.
                         
                          BETH
           Well you probably shouldn't steal
           it. Even if it is yours.
                         
          Celeste marches to the Oprah's Book Club table and swiftly
          replaces the center display book with her own.
                         
                          CELESTE
           There.
                         
                          BETH
           But you don't have the "O" on your
           cover, you can't do that!
                         
                          CELESTE
           Yes I can.
                         
          Jesse and Tucker arrive and see the book.
                         
                          JESSE
           There you guys are...you're on
           Oprah's Book List?? That's so
           great!
                         
          Something catches Celeste's eye.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Some people are browsing my book.
           Guys, come with me to eavesdrop ...
                         
          Celeste, Tucker and Beth head off. Then:
                         
           GIRL (V.O.)
           Jesse?
                         
          Jesse turns to see VERONICA, 26, stunning and European.
                         
                          JESSE
           Veronica?
                         
                          VERONICA
           Yeah, hey. How are you?
           27.
                         
                         
                          JESSE
           Good, good. You look great.
                         
                          VERONICA
           Thanks, you too. How's your clothes
           pin collage going?
                         
                          JESSE
           Slowly, but it's going.
                         
                          VERONICA
           Well, don't give up. Your work is
           really unique. And beautiful. I
           hope that doesn't sound...
                         
                          JESSE
           No, that's means a lot, thank you.
                         
          They looks at each other for a beat.
                         
           JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           I had so much fun...that night. I'm
           so sorry I didn't call you. My life
           is just...
                         
                          VERONICA
           I had a lot of fun too.
                         
          There is silence, as Beth, Celeste and Tucker arrive and
          stare at her. Who is this creature??
                         
                          JESSE
           Oh sorry, Veronica, this is Beth
           and Tucker and Celeste.
                         
          Veronica notices Celeste's name on the book.
                         
                          VERONICA
           Oh, this is your book? I read an
           excerpt online, it's really
           compelling.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Wow, thank you. That is so nice.
                         
                          VERONICA
           Well, nice to see you.
                         
                          JESSE
           Oh you too. Take care.
                         
          She turns and leaves.
           28.
                         
                         
                          CELESTE
           What is that?
                         
                          JESSE
           That was uh...Veronica.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Story?
                         
                          JESSE
           No story. Just this girl I met a
           while ago.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Huh. She's pretty.
                         
           Celeste changes focus again and turns to a Border's employee
           to loudly and unconvincingly act out "Interested Reader" for
           other shoppers to hear.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           EXCUSE ME SIR? WHERE CAN I FIND
           MORE COPIES OF THIS BOOK
           "SHITEGEIST" FOR MY FRIENDS? I

           He looks at her like she's crazy and keeps walking. And so do
           her friends.
                         
                         
          20 EXT. TROUBADOR THEATER-NIGHT 20
                         
           Jesse and Skillz are exiting a Bizmarkie concert, surrounded
           by older hip-hop fans and young hipsters who weren't alive
           when the Biz dropped his first album. They are trashed.
                         
                          SKILLZ
           Oh baby youuuuuuuu, you got what I
           neeeeeed...
                         
                          JESSE
           And you say he's just a friend, and
           you say he's just a friend....
                         
                          JESSE SKILLZ
           Oh baby youuuuu.... Oh baby youuuuu....
                         
           Jesse's iPhone rings. A very flirty picture of Celeste comes
           up.
                         
                          SKILLZ
           No, no, no. Ignore for sure.
           29.

           Uh, I just need to...(picks up)
           Hey.
                         
                          SKILLZ
           (whispering) Nooooo!
                         
                          JESSE
           (talking to Celeste) Uh huh. Okay.
           Okay. No, I'm not busy. (hangs up)
           Uh, I'm gonna go home.
                         
                          SKILLS

                          JESSE
           There's an Ikea dresser that she
           needs me to "build."
                         
           Skillz takes this in. He is impressed.
                         
                          SKILLZ
           Huh. Really, cowboy? Are you
           guys...
                         
                          JESSE
           I told you pal, I know what I'm
           know I'm doing. She just needed
           time.
                         
                         
                         
          21 INT. CELESTE'S HOUSE-NIGHT 21
                         
           Celeste is in a corner with a glass of wine and a HUGE bag of
           nuts and bolts. She had a fight with a dresser and the
           dresser won. Jesse uses his key and enters.
                         
                          CELESTE
           I'm in here! Fuck Sweden!

           Oh baby youuuuu....
                         
                          CELESTE
           It was definitely easier to build
           the Brooklyn Bridge, I think.
                         
                          JESSE
           Well, how hard can it be? It's a
           dresser, right?

           Jesse is drunker than before and sitting where Celeste was
           earlier. Crying, frustrated. He's covered in sawdust and nuts
           and bolts.
                         
                          JESSE
           Fuck me!!! Do you think they
           intentionally pick a random piece
           of furniture to make totally
           unbuildable, just to fuck with
           you??!
                         
                          CELESTE
           Thank you!

           We see Jesse and Celeste admire their "dresser" as they drink
           wine.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Perfect.
                         
                          JESSE
           Fucking lay-up.
                         
           We reveal that they are looking at a small, mangled, Swedish
           robot constructed from the nuts and bolts and wood panelling
           that should have been the dresser. They both slide to the
           floor in satisfaction. They look at their "artwork." They
           laugh; they are pretty drunk.

           Yeah. He's a vegan, you know.
                         
                          JESSE
           Cherish. That is so cute.
                         
           They share a laugh.

           You're cute.
                         
           Celeste looks at him. She kisses him. He kisses back. It gets
           hotter. They fall back.

          24 INT. CELESTE'S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING 24
                         
           Celeste and Jesse are in bed. Celeste is asleep. Jesse wakes
           up and gently kisses Celeste all over her face. This wakes
           her up. She is hungover and confused.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Hey. What are you doing?
                         
                          JESSE
           I love you.
                         
           Celeste does not respond. She pops up out of bed.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Okay...
                         
                          JESSE
           We should talk about this.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Yeah. Whoa, we were drunk. What a
           bad idea. I'm sorry.
                         
                          JESSE
           Don't be sorry. It was nice. And I
           love you.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Oh Jess, I don't...come on, we were
           drunk, and the dresser and I
           thought...you're dating other
           people!
                         
                          JESSE
           Only to...god, I'm so stupid.
                         
           He realizes how pathetic it sounds.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Oh no, I thought...
                         
                          JESSE
           You thought what?
           32.
                         
                         
                          CELESTE
           Well, clearly I wasn't thinking. Or
           I wouldn't have let it happen. Come
           on Jess, we're not getting back
           together, you didn't think...
                         
           Celeste realizes he did think...Jesse is crushed. He gets up
           and leaves. He turns.
                         
                          JESSE
           You know, there's a guy that you
           can call, from Ikea, that will
           build you're dresser. You should
           call him. Hell, he'll probably fuck
           you too. I'm a fucking idiot.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Jess! No, I didn't..Jess!
                         
           Celeste collapses back in the bed.
                         
                         
          25 INT. EQUINOX GYM-MORNING 25
                         
           A bunch of Los Angeles hipsters file out of a yoga class.
           Everyone is sweaty and a little out of it. Celeste heads out
           as she towels off. She heads towards the shoe cubby holes.
                         
                          PAUL
           Hello.
                         
                          CELESTE
           What?
                         
                          PAUL
           I said hello.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Oh. Hi.
                         
           Celeste keeps walking briskly. PAUL, 35, short but handsome,
           tries to keep up with her.
                         
                          PAUL
           (a little too loud) How was your
           practice?
                         
                          CELESTE
           My practice?? It was...wait,
           what?...it was fine. (who is this
           guy?)

           I see you in class a lot. You have
           a great warrior two. Are you
           single?
                         
          Celeste puts on her shoes.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Are you really doing this right
           now? You're really doing this right
           now.
                         
          Paul realizes that his game is wack. Oh well.
                         
                          PAUL
           Yeah, I can't believe it either. I
           don't do this, it's just happening,
           I can't stop...it...what do you do?
                         
                          CELESTE
           Just gonna jump right in there.
           Wow, Captain Conversation.

           Look, you're really pretty. I'm not
           good at this. Help.
                         
          He smiles nervously.
                         
                          CELESTE

                          PAUL
           Not really. It's not cool. Did
           you ever tell me what you did for a
           living?
                         
                          CELESTE
           No, no I didn't.
                         
          There is a pause in conversation. Celeste continues to put
          her shoes on.
                         
                          PAUL
           Well, will you? I'd love to know.

           I'm a trend forecaster. I forecast
           trends.
                         
           Paul scoffs at the notion that this is a real career.
                         
                          PAUL
           Trend forecaster. Really? Huh.
                         
           They have reached the parking lot. Celeste turns to him with
           purpose.
                         
                          CELESTE
           You traded in your Porsche for an
           Audi because the economy is tanking
           and you're afraid you'll lose your
           job soon. You bought a Samsung cell
           phone because you think it makes
           you seem more "business-oriented,"
           unlike the iPhone which is for
           teenage girls. You go to yoga
           because you went to a sub Ivy
           League college, spent the last ten
           years working long weeks and
           drinking all weekend and you feel
           like it's time to do something
           "spiritual." Nice to meet you,
           (looks at the card) Paul.
                         
           Celeste walks away. Paul remains where he is, flummoxed.

           Celeste enters through her side gate. She has some Chinese
           takeout in her hand. She heads for the studio. She sees that
           Jesse is not there. Neither is any of his shit. It's
           completely empty and sterile now. He's gone.

                          CELESTE
           No, just make sure the San Fran
           focus group has a little more
           diversity than last time. It was
           like a rave. Without drugs. Okay.
                         
           She hangs up and pauses. Then dials again.

           We see Celeste having lunch with a group of eight teenagers.
           She asks questions, they share laughs, she engages with them.
           She is good at this. She excuses herself to make a phone
           call.

           calling. He presses "Ignore." We see that he is sitting with

           gay?
                         
                          JESSE
           No, not gay.
                         
           He takes a really deep breath.

           JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Um, you're not gonna believe this
           but...
                         
                          CELESTE
           (playfully) Oh no, did you go on
           another date?
                         
                          JESSE
           I'm having a baby.
                         
                          CELESTE
           I don't understand.
                         
                          JESSE
           I'm having a baby.
                         
          Celeste is still busy, putting away groceries. She is half-
          listening.
                         
                          CELESTE
           What do you mean?
                         
                          JESSE
           I am having a baby.
                         
          Celeste opens the pantry and puts away cereal.
                         
                          CELESTE
           With another person?
                         
                          JESSE
           Yes. With another person.
                         
          Celeste takes out cold cuts from the bag and opens the
          fridge.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Um. What? Sorry, I'm confused.
           Wait, what? What the fuck? With
           whom?
                         
                          JESSE
           With Veronica.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Veronica?? What's a Veronica?
                         
                          JESSE
           You actually met her. That day at
           the book store.
           38.
                         
                         
                          CELESTE
           Huh. But that's not even
           physically possible, that was two
           weeks ago.
                         
                          JESSE
           Well, the truth is, I slept with
           Veronica three months ago. It was
           just a one night thing. But she's
           pregnant.
                         
          Celeste rearranges the fruit bowl.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Whoa. Okay. Shit. Didn't know about
           that. But that's not important
           right now. This is not good.
           Alright. Okay. You and I are gonna
           deal with this. We will, we'll just
           have to. What do you need me to do?
                         
                          JESSE
           No, you don't have to do anything.
                         
                          CELESTE
           But you don't even know this
           person, right?
                         
                          JESSE
           Yeah I know her. I mean, I'm
           getting to know her. And I really
           want to make it work with her.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Make it work?? You slept with her
           once! What are you talking about?
                         
                          JESSE
           I've actually been seeing her,
           well, a lot, recently. And I think
           I really like her.
                         
                          CELESTE
           So what you're saying is you got a
           girl pregnant and now you think you
           like her because she's pregnant?
           Or...I'm really confused.
                         
                          JESSE
           The universe is fucking weird,
           Celeste. I slept with her months
           ago and never called her after.

                          JESSE (CONTD)
           But we started hanging recently and
           she told me she was pregnant with
           my child. I know it's crazy, but
           it just feels...right. It was like
           this really weird retroactive gift.
           I don't know...
                         
                          CELESTE
           Can you excuse me for a second?
                         
           Celeste gets up and walks slowly to the bathroom. She gently
           shuts the door. She looks around, not knowing what to do with
           herself. She focuses on a crack in the wall, she looks closer
           and then grabs the wall, thinking she might faint. She
           silently begins to sob, mouth open, eyes shut tight. She
           collapses on the wall. She is in silent turmoil. Is this
           really happening?

           Jesse is sitting, waiting. He checks his cell phone. He hears
           the toilet flush. A moment goes by. Celeste re-enters,
           having pulled it together. But her face is still wet with
           tears.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Sorry about that. I had something
           in my eye.
                         
                          JESSE
           Right. Look, I know this is so
           sudden. And so weird. I've been
           holding on to us, this idea of us,
           for so long. And I know you've
           wanted me to let go. So I'm sorry.
           You were right, we're friends. We
           will always be friends. And I need
           that now.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Of course.
                         
                          JESSE
           Thank you. Love you.
                         
           Jesse gives Celeste a big, long hug.
                         
           JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Wait, you had something to tell me
           too. Sorry...

           She forces a smile.

           in.

           It's Sean Comb's Twitter page.

                          SCOTT
           I don't know what to say. I am so

                          SCOTT
           Well, it's great that you're so
           resolved about this but it's also
           okay for you to have feelings. It's
           very sudden.
                         
          Celeste pauses to consider this.

           love with him anymore. It kind of
           makes it easier.

           Celeste, in workout clothes, is cleaning up her house
           maniacally. She is walking past her office. The Ikea robot
           she built with Jesse catches her attention for a moment. She
           keeps walking.

           dinner. They have just ordered.

           My foot actually pronates. And my
           I.T. band is strained when I run,
           which really hurts. So Dr. Ozar
           recommended a foot specialist who
           made these customized orthotics for
           me and it's amazing how much better

           bar, by himself, watching tv. She is not prepared for this.

           did. He's coming over. Oh god,

           Celeste immediately scarfs down her salad which has just

           around her: traffic, honking, speeding, Celeste listens to

           joyfully runs across the street.

           Celeste flops on the couch full prostrate. A saleswoman
           approaches.
                         
                          SALESWOMAN

           Yes. Shower. Who's the date?

           Rupert Bates? The Gap model?? Oh my

           22. Skillz set me up. He's about
           to be a huge star. He's filming
           "20,000 B.C.?" It's the prequel to
           "10,000 B.C."

           Fuck, I LOVED that movie.

           I loved that movie too! It really

           RUPERT BATES, 22, very handsome, British, wearing a leather
           jacket, sporting tousled actor hair is playing a hideously
           earnest original song on the guitar. He sings with passion.
           He looks up at Celeste and winks.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
           Celeste,on the couch, looking slightly mortified. She smiles
           tepidly at him.
           50.
                         
                         
           Rupert finishes the song, closes his eyes and hangs his head.
           A beat of silence. Celeste musters up a short and slow round
           of applause.
                         
                          CELESTE
           That was so...good.
                         
                          RUPERT
           I wrote that for my mum.

           He provides me with the happy smoky
           green treats.

           Celeste cringes. What a dork. Rupert slides next to Celeste
           and is all of a sudden right in her face. He touches her
           hair. He kisses her, deeply. He pulls away and takes her in.
                         
                          RUPERT
           Hello, Special One.

           People file out of the conference room. Celeste walks down
           the hall quickly to the bathroom.
                         
                         
          46 INT. POP FORM BATHROOM 46
                         
           Celeste enters a stall. Then, she hears two girls enter the
           bathroom. RILEY, 19 and SAVANNAH, 22, are chatting and
           primping. Celeste goes quiet and listens.
                         
                          RILEY
           Ugh. My hair is so dry. It looks
           like straw.
                         
           Savannah quickly pops a pill. Then offers one to Riley.
                         
                          SAVANNAH
           Here. Do you want an Adderall?
           51.
                         
                         
                          RILEY
           No, that shit makes me feel like a
           robot. Speaking of robot, who the
           hell designed this place? It's
           like Spock and his eyebrows are
           about to walk around the corner.
                         
          Celeste takes this opportunity to flush and come out of the
          stall.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Hi Riley, I'm Celeste, I'm a
           partner at Pop Form.
                         
                          RILEY
           Hey. Wow, you're pretty.
                         
          Riley looks closer at her skin and picks at it.
                         
           RILEY (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Why am I breaking out?
                         
                          SAVANNAH
           Too much sugar? Coffee? Alcohol?
                         
                          RILEY
           Ugh, maybe it's my skin regime.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Um...it's actually regimen?
                         
                          RILEY
           Sorry?
                         
                          CELESTE
           Regime is a system of government.
           It's a "skin regimen."
                         
          Riley and Savannah glare at Celeste.
                         
                          RILEY
           Thanks, Scrabble. Nice to meet you.
                         
          They leave.

           The Riley Banks branding strategy meeting is under way.
           Slides are being shown, Scott is giving a presentation on
           design ideas. Celeste is distracted and on her Blackberry.
           We see an INSERT of Celeste's Blackberry on Dictionary.com,
           looking up "regime: a mode or system of rule or government."
                         
                          SCOTT
           Celeste has some ideas for the logo
           which are looking really great.
                         
           He looks to Celeste who is not paying attention. She is busy
           learning that she was right and Riley was wrong. Celeste
           looks up and shoots a patronizing smile at Riley. Riley
           catches her and looks away uncomfortably.
                         
           SCOTT (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Celeste? Do you wanna...

           Scott has an idea.

           laugh.

           Wow. That is incredible. I think

                          NICK
           He is. I think the piss stain
           running down my jeans made him
           laugh.

           Nick and Celeste are kissing. It's passionate but tender.
           They stop and their foreheads rest against each other's and
           they take a deep breath. They speak in hushed tones.

           They continue to kiss. Celeste notices that she and the couch
           are vibrating. She looks down. Oh no. Nick is masturbating.
           Can he really be masturbating?

           Shhhhh.
                         
           Celeste pulls away slowly, shaking her head, "no." Nick keeps
           going. Eyes closed.
                         
           NICK (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Watch me. I'm almost there.

           Nick recovers from his climax and looks around to realize

           Celeste runs really hard, listening to her Sunny Levine's
           "Glass Jaw" on her iPhone. She stops suddenly. She sees
           Jesse's number, she hits "Ignore." She starts running again
           with purpose.

           Hey, so, I'm glad you can meet up.
           4pm is good. There's this little
           place by me, Vegan Vittles on
           Elysian Way, kinda hard to find,
           call me if you get lost.

           Celeste enters and sees Jesse sitting at a table in a small,
           folksy restaurant. Celeste is on the phone. She waves at
           Jesse and gestures "one second."
                         
                          CELESTE
           No, I don't want to do a video
           chat. Yeah. Just tell her she needs
           to get to L.A. tomorrow. Okay. (she
           hangs up, now on the Blackberry)
           Sorry, one second, I just have to
           send this e-mail.
                         
           Jesse sits there and wait for several seconds for her to
           finish her e-mail.

           sign those papers.

           Well, Jesse, I've been busy with
           work. Because some people work for
           a living. So I haven't really been
           focused on what I can do to help

           What makes you think you are even
           suitable to be a dad?? You don't
           even know how to read the electric
           bill. How are you going to support
           yourself? Have you even thought
           this through?
                         
                          JESSE
           I guess I'll have to figure it out.
           Veronica is really supportive of my
           work.
                         
                          CELESTE

           supportive, I don't know what is.
                         
                          JESSE

           to thrash the robot torso all over the room as, slowly,
           pieces of wood flail in every direction. She's angry and out
           of control. She stops to catch her breath and sees what she
           has just done. She falls to the ground in tears.

           Celeste is drilling Car Bombs with 5 guys. She's keeping
           pace.

           Snow White is silent. Celeste points to her trash bag.

           Paul (from yoga) enters to grab some ice from the freezer. He
           is wearing a black shirt covered in mini cereal boxes with
           plastic knives through them. Celeste is mid-Car Bomb and
           wasted.

           My husband of six years wants a
           divorce so he can marry the woman
           who's carrying his child. That's
           the deal with you and me.

           Well do you want to be right or do
           you want to be happy?
                         
                          CELESTE
           Listen, Yoga, I don't WANT to be
           right, I AM right. People will let
           you down. I've accepted that fact,
           but unfortunately, most of the
           time, knowing that does keep you
           from being happy. But at least
           it's real.

           righteous monologue wearing only a
           trash bag. Except for maybe the
           homeless guy outside my dry
           cleaners.

           Celeste is going through papers on her desk. She's cleaning
           house. She sees the envelope from the divorce lawyer. She
           quickly tosses it aside. Then she comes across one of Jesse's
           old notebooks. She flips through it. She reads a couple of
           sweet passages about her, it makes her smile. She grabs the
           phone.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Hey, it's Celeste. You know, I
           still have a bunch of your stuff in
           the office. You should probably
           grab it at some point. Okay.
                         
           She hangs up. She makes a decision. She grabs a box and
           starts throwing everything and anything in it that belongs to
           Jesse.

           Celeste carries a box of Jesse's stuff to his front door.
           She doesn't knock. She leaves the box by the door. But she
           decides to keep the one journal with the sweet passages for
           herself; she deserves it and he'll never know. She starts to
           walk away when she notices, it's trash day.

           Three trash cans-green, brown, and blue-are lined up in the
           driveway. A huge box is protruding from the blue can.
           Celeste considers. So much to be learned from the trash. She
           slowly walks over. She peeks in at the box; it has a big
           picture of a fancy stroller on the side of it. Crushing.

           Belgian bride.
                         
          All of a sudden, her diamond bracelet slips off her wrist and
          plunks to the bottom.

          She drops Jesse's journal to the concrete and crawls into the
          trash can, still reaching for the bottom, not quite getting
          there. The trash can falls over with her in it. Just then,
          Jesse's car pulls up and headlights shine on Celeste half-way
          in the trash can. She fumbles and then:

           Ow!!! Shit!
                         
          A piece of glass from the can has sliced her face. She
          immediately wiggles out of the trash can, stands it back up
          again. She looks for a place to run. It's too late. She picks
          up the journal and hides behind the trash cans but Jesse and
          Veronica have been watching her whole opera from the car.
          Jesse approaches a crouching Celeste.

          holding Jesse's journal close to her chest.

           It's over now.
                         
          Jesse and Veronica just stare at Celeste for a long beat.
                         
                          JESSE
           You've met Veronica, right?

           NO. No, don't. It's fine, just a
           little cut.
                         
                          VERONICA

           this.
                         
                          CELESTE

           Celeste and Beth eat lunch in the zen garden outside the Pop
           Form building. Celeste is picking at the end of her sandwich,
           recounting the waking nightmare of last night. The cut on her
           face is neatly bandaged.

           It was a disaster. But you should
           have seen the sweater. So great.
           Beth, am I losing my mind?

           your life.
                         
           Cherry and Lucky enter, the masseuses. They all exchange
           quiet hellos and head nods. Cherry and Lucky get to work.
           Lucky takes Celeste's leg and pushes it all the way over her
           head, not the most comfortable position.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Ahhhhh.(responding to the stretch)
           Wow, this is a unique place to take
           a date.

           elbow into his shoulderblade.

           But how do you feel?
                         
           Celeste takes a beat to see how she feels.

           Celeste takes in the atmosphere for a moment. She is happy to
           be out. She takes her hair down, puts her hands through it,
           trying to look a little better.

           Hey!
                         
           Paul is on the dance floor, with two beers. Celeste meets
           him, takes her beer, and downs a third of it. Celeste looks
           up and Paul has started to dance. He looks at Celeste with
           jocular seduction. He's actually not a bad dancer. Maybe he's
           good? Okay, no, he's great. Paul pulls Celeste in and they
           dance together. She's sort of embarrassed but she's having
           fun. Paul pulls away in a little spin and goes into a James
           Brown splits move.

           Celeste is into it now. She dances around him, other people
           watch them. Paul pulls Celeste in close. Celeste kisses Paul
           quickly, to his surprise.
                         
                          PAUL

           having a baby. (beat) How's
           Celeste?
                         
                          SKILLZ
           She's...oh-kay. I'm fine-tuning her
           cannibus levels right now, just
           trying to find the right balance.
                         
                          JESSE
           Celeste doesn't smoke pot.
                         
                          SKILLZ
           She does now. She loves it.
                         
          Jesse takes this in. Tucker changes the subject.
                         
                          TUCKER
           How's Veronica? She's so sweet.
                         
                          JESSE
           Yeah, less sweet pregnant but it's
           probably just hormones.
                         
                          TUCKER
           But are you into it?
                         
                          JESSE
           Yeah, I really like her. She seems
           great. For someone that I don't
           really know that's having my baby.
                         
          "California Love" by Tupac (or whatever song we clear) comes
          on and the cheerleaders start a routine.

           MY JAM!
                         
          Skillz stands up and starts breaking it down. He's not that
          good. Committed though. Jesse and Tucker continue to talk.
                         
                          TUCKER
           Are you scared?
                         
                          JESSE
           A little. Yes.
                         
                          TUCKER
           That's great. You should be. Just
           keep saying "yes." I'm really proud
           of you.

           Skillz looks at his cell phone. He shows Jesse a text from
           Celeste that reads, "I need green. Now."
                         
                          SKILLZ
           She's like my top client now.
                         
                         
          71 INT. CELESTE'S HOUSE-LATE NIGHT 71
                         
           Celeste is home from her date with Paul and is now obsessing
           on Jesse's Facebook page. His status reads "in a
           relationship." She's drunk and this makes her sad. Oh,
           there's a video. It's of Jesse and Veronica. Jesse presents
           Veronica with a cake, she laughs and blows out the candles.
           They kiss. Crushing. Confusing. Her doorbell rings.

           The door opens to reveal Skillz. He holds up a bag of weed.
                         
                         
                          SKILLZ
           Step out of the shadows and into
           the light. Are you crying?
                         
                          CELESTE
           I don't know what I'm doing. Dating
           is stupid and all of a sudden, my
           ex-husband bakes cakes? It's
           probably fucking gluten-free.
                         
                          SKILLZ
           What?
                         
                          CELESTE
           Nothing. Can you just roll a joint
           please?
                         
           Skillz rolls a tight joint.
                         
                          SKILLZ
           Day by day, C. You need not trip.
                         
           Celeste takes a drag.
                         
                          CELESTE
           What are they like together?
                         
                          SKILLZ
           Who? Jesse and Veronica?

                          CELESTE
           Yeah.
                         
                          SKILLZ
           You know, they're oh-kay. Jesse is
           trying. It's not all rainbows and
           unicorns but...
                         
                          CELESTE
           So he's not happy.
                         
                          SKILLZ
           I didn't say that.
                         
                         
          73 INT. POP FORM CONFERENCE ROOM-NEXT DAY 73
                         
           Pop Form employees file out of a Riley Banks meeting. Riley
           approaches Celeste.
                         
                          RILEY
           I really like the logo.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Oh, thank you. Yeah, I think it's
           perfect.
                         
                          RILEY
           The I.M. Pei influence is pretty
           cool.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Wow, yeah, there is a little of
           that happening. I.M. Pei. Huh.
                         
                          RILEY
           Are you mocking me?
                         
                          CELESTE
           No, I'm just impressed that you
           know anything about architecture.
                         
                          RILEY
           Why, because I'm a pop star? You
           know what your thing is? Contempt
           prior to investigation.
                         
                          CELESTE
           I'm sorry?
                         
                          RILEY
           You're convinced you're smarter
           than everyone and THAT is your
           dark little prison.
           77.
                         
                         
                          CELESTE
           Are you...?? How dare you...
                         
           Riley smiles at Celeste, turns and leaves.
                         
                         
          74 INT. CELESTE'S PRIUS-LATER 74
                         
           Celeste is still reeling from Riley's verbal undressing.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Dark little prison?? Bitch, what
           does she know. You know what's a
           dark little prison?? Having to wear
           midriffs for a living. What does
           she...
                         
           Celeste is pulling into her driveway and notices...Jesse,
           sitting on her porch, smoking a cigarette.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           What the fuck.
                         
                         
          75 EXT. CELESTE'S HOUSE-A MOMENT LATER 75
                         
           Celeste cautiously walks up to her front door. Before she can
           speak, Jesse does.
                         
                          JESSE
           I started smoking again.
                         
                          CELESTE
           I can see that. That must go well
           with your pilates.
                         
           Jesse looks sad and confused.
                         
                          JESSE
           I don't know what the rules are and
           I'm sure I'm breaking them
           but...god, I really miss you.
                         
           Celeste tries to digest this.
                         
                          CELESTE
           You want to come in?

           They are in her living room on the couch, have a drink.
           78.
                         
                         
                          JESSE
           Veronica is friends with the
           assistant gallerist there and he
           just really loved my stuff. I
           don't know, we'll see...
                         
                          CELESTE
           Jesse, that's great. I'm so happy
           for you.
                         
                          JESSE
           Yeah, yeah. It's great.
                         
           Why doesn't he seem happier? He knocks back the rest of the
           drink.
                         
           JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           I should probably get home.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Yeah. It's really nice to see you.
                         
           He hugs her. Tight. They breathe together. They hug
           tighter. He pulls away, looks at her and kisses her for one
           second, very tenderly. She pulls away.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           You should go.
                         
                          JESSE
           Can we just...lay here for a bit?
                         
           Celeste lays down and Jesse spoons behind her on the couch.
           They hold each other. There's a long drag of silence.
                         
           JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           I can't believe I'm having a
           baby...and it's not with you.
                         
           We see Celeste's face but Jesse doesn't. She's crying.

           The phone rings. It's early. Celeste, still in her clothes
           from the night before, wakes up. Jesse is gone. She fumbles
           for the phone.

           INSERT of a large, magnified version of Riley's "RB" logo. It
           is pretty clear what the image looks like. Scott stares at
           Celeste, waiting for her to freak out.

           You can't be serious. (points to
           the logo) There's the penis. And
           there's the penis going into the
           butt.
                         
                          CELESTE

           Well, it's not a stretch, Celeste.

           Oh. Oh my God. Oh wow, I totally
           see it now. WOW. Ha. Haha.
           Hahahahaaha.
                         
           Celeste starts laughing uncontrollably. It's the funniest
           thing she's ever seen.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           It's a cock in a butt!!!
           Hahahaahaaa!!
                         
                          SCOTT
           (fuming)Stop it. Stop laughing.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Scott, come on...
                         
                          SCOTT
           No, this is not a joke. Our
           company's in serious danger.
                         
                          CELESTE
           You're being dramatic.
                         
                          SCOTT
           Get out. I can't, with you, right
           now. I have to deal with this. I'll
           call you soon.
                         
           Her laughter fades and she exits the conference room.
                         
                         
          79 EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD.-LATER THAT DAY-DUSK 79
                         
           Bon Iver's "Skinny Love" plays as Celeste walks slowly
           amongst the celebrity impersonators, tourists and drunks on
           the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
           81.
                         
                         
           It is intercut with a montage of Super 8 footage of Celeste
           and Jesse in the past: At a seaside house, Jesse is
           reluctantly cutting a head off a fish to cook it, Celeste is
           repulsed but laughing. Celeste and Jesse cuddle in a sleeping
           bag, fighting off the cold. Celeste and Jesse take cover in a
           torrential New York City rain. They stand under an awning and
           she smiles as she runs her hand through his wet hair. Celeste
           is abruptly shaken out of her memories by a giant Chewbacca
           hugging her before she has a chance to stop him.
                         
                          CELESTE
           No...okay.
                         
                         
          80 INT. THE WELL BAR-EARLY EVENING 80
                         
           We see Jesse sitting at the dive bar. Celeste enters and
           sits next to Jesse. She is happy to see him.
                         
                          JESSE
           Hey.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Hey.
                         
                          JESSE
           We gotta talk.
                         
                          CELESTE
           I know. That's why I called.
                         
                          JESSE
           Celeste...
                         
                          CELESTE
           Wait, let me say something. I
           don't know what happened last
           night. I don't know what's
           happening with your other
           situation. But I need to say this.
           For the record, I fucked up. I was
           cavalier about you. I took us for
           granted. And I know this may sound
           crazy but I'd be remiss if I
           didn't...if you were open to it...I
           think that I could do better. With
           you. With us. If there's a chance
           still...I'd like to know.
                         
           Jesse can't even look at her.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Jesse?
           82.
                         
                         
                          JESSE
           I'm sorry. I can't.
                         
           Jesse gets up and leaves.
                         
                         
          81 EXT. THE WELL BAR-EVENING 81
                         
           Jesse walks out of the bar. He takes a deep breath and starts
           walking. A beat later, Celeste tears out of the bar, walking
           quickly after Jesse.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Hey!
                         
           Jesse pauses for a moment. He turns.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Why did you come to my house last
           night?
                         
                          JESSE
           I don't know.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Oh no, I think you do.
                         
                          JESSE
           I made a mistake.
                         
                          CELESTE
           And?
                         
                          JESSE
           I shouldn't have come.
                         
                          CELESTE
           You're a fucking coward.
                         
                          JESSE
           I'm just trying to do the right
           thing with Veronica. I'm trying to
           change.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Well, you never changed for me.
                         
           Jesse pauses.
                         
                          JESSE
           To be honest, you didn't really let
           me.
           83.
                         
                         
                          CELESTE
           Wow. All I did was wait for you to
           grow up! I rooted for you, I
           fucking paid for everything, I did
           everything for you!
                         
                          JESSE
           Yeah, and I was never your equal.
           And you know what? I think you
           preferred it that way.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Right. Well, I know my success was
           never easy for you.
                         
                          JESSE
           And how do you define success,
           Celeste? Because you don't look
           very successful right now.
                         
                          CELESTE
           And you are? Pretending to be a
           father? Pretending to be an adult?
                         
                          JESSE
           What do you want?
                         
                          CELESTE
           I just want you to admit that
           you're wrong!
                         
                          JESSE
           Wrong? Wrong about what? What did
           you want me to do? Wait for you to
           meet someone first? Is that how you
           saw it happening?
                         
          Celeste doesn't respond.
                         
           JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           I didn't expect to meet someone so
           fast, but I did. And I think we
           have a chance to be happy together.
           I don't want to blow that.
                         
                          CELESTE
           You know what, Jesse? You
           definitely will blow it.
                         
          Jesse takes a beat. It stings.
                         
                          JESSE
           I feel really sorry for you. You
           might be alone forever.
           84.
                         
                         
           He starts to walk away. Celeste call after him.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Don't ever call me.
                         
                          JESSE
           Don't worry about it.
                         
           Jesse walks away.
                         
                         
          82 EXT. CELESTE'S GARDEN-NIGHT 82
                         
           Skillz and Celeste sit in her backyard and watch the last
           scene from "Dirty Dancing." The image is being projected onto
           her garden wall. There is no sound. Instead, Bob Marley's
           "Kaya" plays over the speakers. Celeste is ripping an
           enormous bowl from a four-foot bong. Skillz is on his knees,
           bracing the bong, looking at Celeste with admiration. Celeste
           watches the movie.
                         
                          CELESTE
           She's so sad.
                         
                          SKILLZ
           Is she? I don't think so.
                         
                          CELESTE
           No, she's sad. I can tell. I went
           to dance camp.
                         
           We see Jennifer Grey elevated above Patrick Swayze, looking
           elated. Celeste exhales a huge billow of smoke.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           That's the first good thing that's
           happened to me in months.
                         
                          SKILLZ
           Shit'll get better.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Will it? You don't know that.
                         
           Celeste grabs a handful of Cheetos from an economy-sized bag.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           How could he do this to me?

           Celeste is sitting alone, wearing sunglasses, and
           uncharacteristically colorful clothes that don't match. Like
           a crazy lady jumpsuit. She is going to town on a HUGE plate
           of food: chicken wings, fries, burger, hot dog, coleslaw, egg
           salad and a beer. She attacks it like it's her last meal
           ever. She's also trashed. Celeste gets up and heads towards a
           group of people talking including, Beth's mom, Beth and a
           couple of her girlfriends.

           Do you have any more of that ranch
           dressing? It's the fucking
           booooooomb.
                         
           Beth is embarrassed. Celeste gives Beth's mom, CAROL, 60,
           very large, a big sloppy hug.

           Hi Carol! Beth's getting married! I
           was married, remember? These guys
           are in for a fucking dogfight,

           Beth pulls Celeste away from the bar and brings her into the
           house and plops her down on the couch.

           together ever since.
                         
           ALL THREE GIRLS
           We love you, Bethy!!
                         
           The audience applauds. Celeste rolls her eyes.
                         
                          GIRL #2
           And now we're gonna hear from
           Celeste, Beth's best friend in the
           world.
           93.
                         
                         
          A little more applause. Celeste has completely forgotten she
          was supposed to speak. Oh no. She gets up slowly and grabs
          the mike.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Thank you. Thanks a lot, girls,
           that was so...wow. There are no
           words. Well, this is gonna sound
           bad but I actually forgot that I
           was speaking tonight.
                         
          Beth looks at her, frozen.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           I don't where to start. Um...how do
           you get a nun pregnant? You fuck
           her?
                         
          Beth's father laughs uncontrollably. He's the only one
          laughing.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Thanks, Tom. Man, it was much
           longer than I thought to get to Big
           Sur from Los Angeles on a Friday
           afternoon. Stellar call on having a
           destination wedding the weekend
           before 4th of July. Busiest travel
           day of the year. So thanks for
           that, Mrs. Weinberg.
                         
          Wedding guests look uncomfortable.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           But the truth is, I would go
           anywhere for Beth. She's my best
           friend. And I'm so happy for her.
           Senior year of college, we had a
           tradition. Every Sunday, come rain
           or shine, Beth and Tucker would
           meet me and Jesse at the Bishop
           with a 12-pack of Miller High Life,
           the champagne of beers, and we
           would meet to talk about what was
           important in the world, you know,
           Heidegger's influence on hip-hop.
           Or the feminist duality on "Melrose
           Place." Life's big questions. Beth
           and Tucker were just friends then
           but there was always something
           there. Just an ease they had with
           each other. Jesse and I spent years
           trying to get them together,
           unsuccessfully.

           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           But we all remained friends and
           watched as Tucker dated the most
           slutty, vacuous and vile girls on
           the planet. For five long years.
                         
           Tucker flinches.

           Finally, he removed his head from
           his ass, and saw what was in front
           of him. And that was beautiful
           Beth. And none of us could be
           happier about it; they were
           perfect. At last. Love wins.
                         
           Wedding guests clap. They think it's over. It's not.
           Celeste looks at Jesse in the crowd. Veronica is next to
           him.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Um...Jesse and I are getting a
           divorce. So that's...yeah, our
           timing was not as good, I guess.
           Beth and Tucker, you are lucky to
           be best friends. Work hard and
           respect that. It doesn't come
           easily. Be patient, don't always
           think you're right. And if you are,
           it doesn't fucking matter anyway.
           Fight for it, everyday, I wish I
           had.
                         
                         
          93 EXT. RECEPTION TENT-AN HOUR LATER 93
                         
           Celeste is holding a small plate of food. Jesse sidles up to
           her.
                         
                          JESSE
           I know this may not the best time
           to talk about this...but...at some
           point, we will have to talk about
           Tucker's dance moves.
                         
           INSERT of Tucker dancing on the dance floor. It's
           unexplainable. It's shocking how terrible it is.
                         
                          CELESTE
           He is so special. Not as special as
           that poem. That those girls did?
                         
                          JESSE CELESTE
           Wow. Wow.
           95.
                         
                         
          He takes a beat.
                         
                          JESSE
           Your speech was really...beautiful.
           Thank you.
                         
                          CELESTE
           I meant it.
                         
                          JESSE
           I know.
                         
                          CELESTE
           You know what else is beautiful?
                         
                         
          Celeste picks up a baby gerkin from her plate and starts to
          jerk it off, as she and Jesse did earlier and as they have
          done many times.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Oh god, tug it.
                         
          Jesse starts to participate. He dips his finger in the creme
          fraiche and puts it on the top of the gerkin.
                         
                          JESSE
           Aw yeah! Fuck!
                         
          Jesse and Celeste are in hysterics. Just then, Veronica
          arrives.
                         
                          VERONICA
           Jesse?
                         
                          JESSE
           Hey.
                         
          Celeste and Jesse stop like two children who just got caught.
                         
                          VERONICA
           What are you doing?
                         
                          JESSE
           What? Nothing. We're just...
                         
          He looks at Celeste for cover. She is giddy, wasted and happy
          to explain.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Oh, Jesse and I do this thing where
           we find the littlest thing that
           resembles a penis and we just, you
           know...
           96.
                         
                         
           Celeste and Jesse demonstrate for Veronica. Celeste looks up
           and realizes how dumb this must seem.
                         
                          VERONICA
           I don't get it.
                         
           Celeste and Jesse stop.
                         
                          CELESTE
           It's stupid.
                         
           Veronica is looking at Celete's food.
                         
                          VERONICA
           Oh, the foods out. (to Celeste) See
           you on the dance floor? Watch out
           for Tucker though.
                         
                         
           They leave Celeste, standing alone, smiling. She bites into
           the carrot.
                         
                         
          94 INT. WEDDING TENT-LATER 94
                         
           We see a raucous wedding dance floor. Everyone's dancing:
           Beth, Tucker, their families, their friends, Jesse, Veronica,
           Scott, etc. They are doing wedding dances. Celeste sits at
           her table, watching with a smile. It is bittersweet for her.
           She drinks a martini. Alone.
                         
                         
          95 INT. PAUL'S CONDO-NIGHT 95
                         
           Celeste and Paul are playing scrabble and drinking wine.
                         
                          PAUL
           (keeping score on a notepad) So,
           that's 38 points plus 50 bonus

           Wait, wait, wait. I think I may

                          PAUL
           Are you challenging or not?

                          PAUL
           Well, I will tell you that Zooecia
           is a sac secreted by a compound
           organism but here you go. (he hands
           her the Scrabble dictionary) Look
           for yourself.
                         
           Celeste finds the word, reads the definition and silently
           accepts defeat.
                         
           PAUL (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Ha ha! I go again.

           Well, nothing lasts forever.

           Celeste and Paul are making out on the couch.
                         
                          PAUL
           I'm so sorry I beat you in
           Scrabble.
                         
                          CELESTE
           No you're not.
                         
                          PAUL
           You're right, I'm not.
                         
           The making out gets a little hotter. Celeste is aggressive.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Will you get a condom?

           Uh...I don't think we should...
                         
                          CELESTE
           No, you're using a condom.
                         
                          PAUL
           No, I don't think we should sleep
           together.
                         
           Celeste pulls away from him.
                         
                          CELESTE

           No, no believe me, I'm into it.
                         
                          CELESTE

           I really like you.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Right, I'm confused...why not sleep
           with me then?
                         
                          PAUL
           Because I think I might really like
           you.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Oh. (further realizing) Oh. Okay.
           Well, I like you too.
                         
           Celeste looks distant.

           Celeste is at a loud, trendy club. She sits next to Riley.
           They have to shout to be heard.
                         
                          RILEY
           THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE MOST
           EMBARRASSING SPEECH EVER! HOW WILL
           SHOW YOUR FACE TO YOUR FRIENDS EVER
           AGAIN?
                         
                          CELESTE
           ACTUALLY, WEIRDLY, I'M KINDA HAPPY
           I DID IT. I FEEL BETTER SOMEHOW.
                         
                          RILEY
           WELL GOOD FOR YOU THEN.
                         
           Celeste looks around at lots of men, grinding each other with
           whistles in their mouth and drinks in their hands.
                         
                          CELESTE
           THE GAYS REALLY KNOW HOW TO PARTY,
           HUH?

           WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
                         
          Celeste just looks at her like, "Oh you poor, sheltered
          Disney princess. Are you serious?"
                         
                          CELESTE
           THIS IS A GAY CLUB.
                         
                          RILEY
           IT'S OPENING NIGHT HERE. IT DOESN'T
           KNOW WHAT IT IS YET.
                         
          Still nothing from Riley.
                         
                          CELESTE
           RILEY, THE CLUB IS CALLED SWALLOW.
                         
          Riley looks around and takes it in. Aha, right. Celeste
          looks out amongst the crowd. Just then, two beefy, waxed,
          tanned, well-groomed gay men walk up to Celeste.
                         
                          GAY MAN
           Excuse me, can you please tell your
           friend Riley that we worship her??
                         
                          GAY MAN #2
           OMG, she's so pretty!
                         
                          CELESTE
           Sure...
                         
          Celeste notices that they are both wearing the Riley Banks t-
          shirts, made for pre-teens, with the cock-in-the-butt mistake
          in the logo. She points at it.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Wait, are you aware that the logo
           is...
                         
                          GAY MAN #2
           A dick in a butt? Yeahhh!
                         
                          GAY MAN
           It's amazing. All of our friends
           are rocking it. It's like the gay
           Izod.
                         
          The gay man points to a group of his friends on the dance
          floor, ALL wearing Riley Banks gear, some of them have even
          made their own t-shirts with the cock in the butt logo
          magnified.
           100.
                         
                         
                          CELESTE
           Wow, so, what, you just buy the
           biggest size they make?
                         
                          GAY MAN
           How dare you, I'm a size 10 in
           tween. I have a slight frame.
                         
           They walk away, offended. Celeste turns to Riley. She is
           being adored by gay men.
                         
                          RILEY
           I LOVE IT HERE!!
                         
           Celeste has a big idea.
                         
                         
          98 EXT. RUNYON CANYON-MORNING 98
                         
           Celeste is hiking alone on the phone, energized.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Tweens don't want her anymore. But
           the gays do! Ten percent of
           Americans are gay, Scott. You're
           gay, start thinking gay. Gay Izod.
           She could be Lady Gaga by the end
           of the year. Huge market.
                         
                          SCOTT
           Wow, you might have just turned the
           cock in the butt around.
                         
                          CELESTE
           We WILL make the cock in the butt
           work for us. The cock in the butt
           will be huge!
                         
           Just then, a mom and two small children walk by her, overhear
           her dirty mouth and glare at her. She waves at them self-
           consciously.

          99 INT. TARGET-AFTERNOON 99
                         
           Celeste is shopping for a dresser. She is talking to a
           salesperson.
                         
                          SALESMAN
           So, it comes with directions and
           it's actually really easy to
           assemble.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Look, you do not know me. I do not
           want to assemble. Trust me, you do
           not want me to assemble. Bad things
           happen. Could I just take the floor
           model? I'll hook you up.
                         
                          SALESMAN
           Lemme go ask my manager.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Thanks, dude.
                         
           Celeste is browsing and spots Veronica with a shopping cart
           filled with baby stuff. She approaches her.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Veronica? Hey, Celeste.
                         
                          VERONICA
           Of course, yeah, hi! What are you
           doing?
                         
                          CELESTE
           Oh, I'm getting a dresser. You?
                         
                          VERONICA
           Oh, you know getting...
                         
           VERONICA (CONT'D) CELESTE
           Baby stuff. Baby stuff.
                         
           VERONICA (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Beth is uh...throwing me a baby
           shower? So I have to register.
           102.
                         
                         
                          CELESTE
           She is?
                         
          Celeste swallows this.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           That's uh...really nice.
                         
                          VERONICA
           Very. And so helpful right now.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Of course. (laughs nervously) Well,
           looks like you're really organized.
                         
                          VERONICA
           Organized, terrified.
                         
                          CELESTE
           You'll do great.
                         
                          VERONICA
           Thanks. I hope so.
                         
          They share an awkward moment.
                         
           VERONICA (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Listen, I never got a chance to
           just tell you I'm so sorry about
           all this. Trust me, I didn't
           expect...
                         
                          CELESTE
           No, don't. Really. There's nothing
           to apologize for. I'm the one who's
           sorry. I mean, I dug through your
           trash.
                         
          Celeste laughs.
                         
                          VERONICA
           Look, I don't blame you. For
           anything. This has all been so
           weird. Everything happened really
           fast.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Yeah, it did. But everything will
           work out. I know it. Jesse's book
           is coming out...
                         
                          VERONICA
           He's so talented.
           103.
                         
                         
           A beat.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Yeah, he is.
                         
           An awkward silence.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Well, good luck. Nice to see you.
                         
                          VERONICA
           You too.
                         
           They both steer their carts towards each other in opposite
           directions but bump right into each other.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Oh sorry!
                         
                          VERONICA
           Oh, it's okay! Bye again.

           Celeste and Paul are in a private karaoke room. Paul is
           belting his heart out, singing Boyz II Men, "On Bended Knee."
           Celeste is loving it. She has her own mike and pipes in once
           in a while with a harmony.
                         
                          PAUL
           Can somebody tell me how to get
           things back the way they used to
           be...oh God give me a reason, I'm
           down on bended knee..ooohohhh ooooh

           Ooohh ohhh. Til you come back to
           me..
                         
                          PAUL
           I'm down on bended knee hee hee
           hee.
                         
           They finish with a huge applause for themselves and toast
           with beers.
                         
           PAUL (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           I think we're really good.
                         
                          CELESTE
           No, we ARE really good.

          Celeste punches in the numbers for the next song. It's
          "Islands in the Stream," made popular by Kenny Rogers and
          Dolly Parton.
                         
                          PAUL
           Aw shit!
                         
                          CELESTE
           Get ready. You're first.
                         
                          PAUL
           Baby when I met you, there was
           peace on earth, I set out get you
           with a fine tooth comb. I was soft
           inside. Soft inside? What the fuck?
                         
                          CELESTE
           Shhh come on. Focus.
                         
                          PAUL
           You do something to me, that I
           can't explain, hold me closer, and
           I feel no pain. Tender love is
           blind, it requires a dedication.
                         
          Celeste and Paul sing in harmony.
                         
                          CELESTE PAUL
          Honest love, we feel, needs Honest love, we feel, needs
          conversation. And we ride it conversation. And we ride it
          it together, uh huh... it together, uh huh...
                         
          Celeste slowly drops her mike. Paul is still singing.
                         
                          CELESTE
           (quietly) I can't.
                         
                          PAUL
           What? Come on, we're so good
           together. Islands in the stream,
           that is what we are. Get in there!!
           This is my favorite part!
                         
                          CELESTE
           No. I can't.
                         
                          PAUL
           I know I'm pitchy but I'm finding
           it. Sail away with me...
                         
                          CELESTE
           No. This. Us. I'm sorry.
                         
          Paul slowly drops his mike.
           105.
                         
                         
                          PAUL
           What do you mean?
                         
                          CELESTE
           I just...can't.
                         
                          PAUL
           Are you serious? Oh no. Why?
                         
          He sits down on the couch. The music is still playing in the
          background.
                         
                          CELESTE
           I think I need to be alone? I'm not
           ready. I'm having fun and I feel
           like I'm beginning to like you and
           I just don't think I'm ready for
           that.
                         
                          PAUL
           What? Really?
                         
          Celeste doesn't say anything.
                         
           PAUL (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Wow, you're breaking my heart.
                         
                          CELESTE
           I'm so sorry. You are so...great.
           But I'm getting divorced.
                         
                          PAUL
           Celeste, I know.
                         
                          CELESTE
           I think I need to go through this
           alone.
                         
                          PAUL
           Yeah. Yeah, okay. I respect that.
           Live by will, not by force.
                         
                          CELESTE
           What?
                         
                          PAUL
           You're only ready when you're
           ready, you know? Don't force it.
           It's just some yoga shit.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Thanks.
           106.
                         
                         
                          PAUL
           But I do like you. I like you a
           lot. And when you are ready, if
           you're ready, call me.
                         
                         
                         
          101 INT. STEIN, WEINBERG, STEINBERG & JIMENEZ LAW FIRM - 101
                          AFTERNOON
                         
           Celeste and Jesse sit across from each other with their
           respective lawyers. They are both dressed very well. The
           atmosphere is formal, tense. There is not a lot of talking
           but there is a lot of loud paper shuffling and ball point
           pens. CELESTE'S LAWYER, male, 40, speaks:
                         
                          CELESTE'S LAWYER
           Sign here. And here. And here.
                         
           Celeste looks up, makes eye contact with Jesse and smiles
           uncomfortably.
                         
           CELESTE'S LAWYER (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           And here. Here. Yup. Aaaaaand
           here. Here. Couple more. Here...
                         
           Celeste is still signing. She looks at Jesse again, who is
           straightening his tie.
                         
                          CELESTE
           I like that tie.
                         
                          JESSE
           Oh, thank you.
                         
                          CELESTE'S LAWYER
           One more here.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Is it made out of organic mung
           beans?
                         
           Jesse nods and chuckles.
                         
                          JESSE
           No, I actually found it digging
           through your trash.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Ohhh, I see. All right.
                         
           They've broken the tension. But it's still silent. Then
           Jesse chortles. It sounds like a baby pig. It makes Celeste
           laugh.
           107.
                         
                         
           Now, both Celeste and Jesse are silently cracking up, doubled
           over as their lawyers sit there, watching them, perplexed.
                         
                         
                         
          102 EXT. STEIN, WEINBERG, STEINBERG & JIMENEZ LAW FIRM - 102
           A LITTLE LATER
                         
           Celeste and Jesse walk out of the building.
                         
                          JESSE
           So...we're divorced!
                         
           They high five. What are you supposed to do when you get
           divorced.
                         
                          CELESTE
           We did it.
                         
                          JESSE
           You wanna walk for a couple
           minutes?
                         
                          CELESTE
           Sure.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          103 EXT. LACMA- SUNDOWN 103
                         
           Celeste and Jesse are now approaching the front of "Urban
           Light," the installation from the beginning of the movie.
           The street lamps are now illuminated. She takes a seat on a
           step. Jesse sits next to her. She refers to the lamps:
                         
                          CELESTE
           These are beautiful.
                         
                          JESSE
           I thought you hated them.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Yeah, well, I've never seen them at
           night.
                         
           Jesse looks at the lamps and takes them in. He looks pretty
           sad.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           What's up with you? I know we just
           got divorced but no one died,
           right?
           108.
                         
                         
                          JESSE
           I'm just feeling like maybe you
           were right. I am a fuck up. I
           don't know what I'm doing. My
           girlfriend left.
                         
          There is a long pause.
                         
                          CELESTE
           What? Veronica? Left where?
                         
                          JESSE
           Left me. She wanted me to tell her
           everything was gonna be okay and I
           couldn't. I don't know why but I
           just...couldn't. She wants to go
           back to Brussels.
                         
          Another monumental pause. Jesse's eyes start tearing up.
                         
           JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Okay, you can say it now. You were
           right, I blew it. Just say it.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Hey...don't do that.
                         
                          JESSE
           Do what?
                         
                          CELESTE
           You are not a loser. You never
           were. You took a chance. I admire
           that and I believe in you.
                         
                          JESSE
           You do?
                         
                          CELESTE
           I do. And I want to thank you.
                         
                          JESSE
           For what?
                         
                          CELESTE
           For never being the person I wanted
           you to be.
                         
                          JESSE
           Oh, you're welcome.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Go get her.
           109.
                         
                         
                          JESSE
           But I don't know if everything is
           gonna be all right.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Well, who does? Do you love her?
                         
          Jesse looks at Celeste.
                         
                          JESSE
           I do.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Then it's worth fighting for.
                         
                          JESSE
           Okay. Okay.
                         
          Celeste smiles with tears in her eyes.
                         
                          CELESTE
           God, I finally understand why you
           fucking cry all the time. Shit is
           emotional.
                         
          They share a laugh. Then, they sit in silence for a beat.
                         
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           You deserve to be happy. And I wish
           that for you, always.
                         
                          JESSE
           Me too.
                         
                          CELESTE
           So...I guess we were right.
                         
                          JESSE
           Huh?
                         
          Celeste makes the "C and J" hand gesture from the high school
          photo in the opening montage. Jesse makes it back. They
          smile.
                         
           JESSE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           I love you.
                         
          He kisses her on the lips. For the last time. And then, he's
          gone.
                         
                          CELESTE
           I love you too.
           110.
                         
                         
           Celeste sits awhile and looks up at the sky.
                         
                         
          104 INT. CELESTE'S PRIUS- NEXT DAY 104
                         
           Celeste drives and dials a number on her bluetooth.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Hey. So, you're probably giving
           your card to some girl in yoga
           right now. But if that doesn't work
           out for you...I think I may be
           ready. To beat you in Scrabble.
                         
                         
          105 EXT. GAS STATION- A MOMENT LATER 105
                         
           Celeste runs in to pay for gas. She is on her Blackberry.
                         
                         
          106 INT. GAS STATION MART 106
                         
           Celeste stands in line with some gum and water. A young man
           blatantly cuts in front of her with a gallon of water. Old
           Celeste returns for a moment.
                         
                          CELESTE
           Excuse me, sir?
                         
           The young man turns around. Celeste realizes she's no longer
           this person. She restrains herself.
                         
           CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD)
           Nothing.
                         
           Celeste takes in how she has changed. She smiles a little.
           The young man turns back to her.
                         
                          YOUNG MAN
           Hey, I'm sorry for cutting. My
           dog's in the car and he's really
           thirsty. So, thanks.
                         
                          CELESTE
           No problem.
                         
           She smiles again. The world feels bigger now.

                                   Based on a story by

                                Peter Stone and Marc Behm



                                                            October 1st, 1962

                

               FADE IN (BEFORE TITLES)

               EXT. FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE -- DUSK

               Silence -- complete silence for the urbanite, though the 
               oncoming darkness is punctuated by the sounds of farm country -- 
               a few birds, a distant rumble of thunder from some heavy 
               clouds on the horizon, a dog's barking.

               CAMERA PANS the green, squared-off flatland, lit only by a 
               fine sunset in its final throes. Then, gradually, starting 
               from nothing, a rumble is heard, quickly growing louder and 
               louder until the sound of a train can be recognized.

               CAMERA PANS quickly, discovering the railroad line atop a 
               man-made rise of land, and the speeding passenger train is 
               upon us, flashing by with a roar.

               Then, as if from nowhere, the figure of a man hits the 
               embankment and rolls crazily down to the bottom into the 
               thick underbrush alongside the tracks.

               It lies in the bushes, still, unmoving -- dead. CAMERA PANS 
               AWAY to the quiet peaceful countryside as the sound of the 
               train fades off until there is silence once more.

               DELETED

               FADE IN:

               EXT. MEGEVE -- DAY

               A handsome and elegant hotel perched on the mountain-side 
               overlooking the French resort town. A large, open sun deck -- 
               tables, gaily colored parasols, sun bathers.

               One of the latter is REGINA LAMPERT, a lovely young girl.

               She is, besides taking in the sun, involved in her favorite 
               activity -- eating.

               Then -- a dark, ominous shape intrudes in the f.g. FOCUS 
               CHANGES to bring into sharp relief a revolver -- shining, 
               black and ugly in the sunlight.

               REGGIE, unaware of her danger, continues to eat.

               The finger tightens around the trigger and finally the gun 
               shoots -- a stream of water arcs, with unerring aim, straight 
               into REGGIE's face.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Including JEAN-LOUIS, a French boy of six or so. REGGIE looks 
               at him sternly.

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                              (in for trouble)
                         Oh, la.

                                     REGGIE
                         Don't tell me you didn't know it was 
                         loaded.
                              (calling)
                         Sylvie!

               WIDER ANGLE

               SYLVIE GAUDET, French, attractive, blonde, in her early 
               thirties, comes from the railing of the sun deck to join 
               REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS.

                                     REGGIE
                         Isn't there something constructive 
                         he can do -- like start an avalanche?

                                     SYLVIE
                              (to JEAN-LOUIS)
                         Va jouer, mon ange.

               JEAN-LOUIS scampers off, content to have gotten off so 
               lightly. SYLVIE notices REGGIE's lunch which consists of 
               cold chicken, potato salad, rolls and butter, wine and coffee.

                                     SYLVIE
                         When you start to eat like this 
                         something is the matter.

               No answer from REGGIE. SYLVIE begins reading a magazine as 
               REGGIE continues eating.

                                     REGGIE
                         Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce.

                                     SYLVIE
                         Ça alors! From Charles?

                                     REGGIE
                         He's the only husband I've got. I 
                         tried to make it work, I really have -- 
                         but --

                                     SYLVIE
                         But what?

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't know how to explain it. I'm 
                         just too miserable.

               REGGIE picks up a chicken leg and starts off. SYLVIE regards 
               the devastated table before following.

                                     SYLVIE
                         It is infuriating that your 
                         unhappiness does not turn to fat!

               INT. SWIMMING POOL -- DAY

               A magnificent indoor, glass-enclosed pool, the vista of snow-
               covered mountains seen through the ceiling-high windows 
               beyond. REGGIE and SYLVIE are passing through, their 
               conversation continuing.

                                     SYLVIE
                         But why do you want a divorce?

                                     REGGIE
                         Because I don't love him.

                                     SYLVIE
                         But that is no reason to get a 
                         divorce!

               EXT. HOTEL TERRACE -- DAY

               An open balcony running around two sides of the pool, sun-
               worshippers lying in deck-chairs. REGGIE and SYLVIE appear, 
               their conversation continuing.

                                     SYLVIE
                         With a rich husband and this year's 
                         clothes you will not find it difficult 
                         to make some new friends.

                                     REGGIE
                              (sitting)
                         I admit I moved to Paris because I 
                         was tired of American Provincial,

                                      
                         but that doesn't mean I'm ready for 
                         French Traditional. I loathe the 
                         idea of divorce, Sylvie, but -- if 
                         only Charles had been honest with me -- 
                         that's all I ask of anybody -- the 
                         simple truth. But with him, everything 
                         is secrecy and lies. He's hiding 
                         something -- something frightening -- 
                         something terrible -- and evil.

               She stops as she is aware of a weird figure hovering over 
               her. She wheels, terrified.

               CLOSE SHOT -- PERUVIAN SNOW-MASK

               A strange, grotesque knitted mask that completely covers the 
               face except for eyes, nose and mouth. The eyes inside this 
               particular mask stare down at REGGIE.

                                     MAN
                         Does this belong to you?

               CAMERA PANS down to include JEAN-LOUIS, his hand held firmly 
               by the man in the mask.

               WIDER ANGLE

               Including REGGIE, MAN, SYLVIE and JEAN-LOUIS. REGGIE is too 
               terrified to answer. Realizing this, the man, PETER JOSHUA, 
               takes off the snow-mask to reveal a handsome, tanned face.

                                     PETER
                         Oh, forgive me.
                              (indicating JEAN-LOUIS)
                         Is this yours?

                                     REGGIE
                              (indicating SYLVIE)
                         It's hers. Where'd you find him, 
                         robbing a bank?

                                     PETER
                         He was throwing snowballs at Baron 
                         Rothschild.
                              (a pause)
                         We don't know each other, do we?

                                     REGGIE
                         Why, do you think we're going to?

                                     PETER
                         I don't know -- how would I know?

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm afraid I already know a great 
                         many people. Until one of them dies 
                         I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.

                                     PETER
                              (smiling)
                         Yes, of course. But you will let me 
                         know if anyone goes on the critical 
                         list
                              (he starts off)

                                     REGGIE
                         Quitter.

                                     PETER
                              (turning)
                         How's that?

                                     REGGIE
                         You give up awfully easy, don't you?

               Eyeing one, then the other, SYLVIE sizes up the situation 
               and rises.

                                     SYLVIE
                         Viens, Jean-Louis, let us take a 
                         walk. I have never seen a Rothschild 
                         before.

               SYLVIE and JEAN-LOUIS start off, but not before the boy 
               squirts PETER with his pistol.

                                     PETER
                              (drying)
                         Clever fellow -- almost missed me.

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm afraid you're blocking my view.

                                     PETER
                              (moving)
                         Sorry. Which view would you like?

                                     REGGIE
                         The one you're blocking. This is the 
                         last chance I have -- I'm flying 
                         back to Paris this afternoon. What's 
                         your name?

                                     PETER
                         Peter Joshua.

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm Regina Lampert.

                                     PETER
                         Is there a Mr. Lampert?

                                     REGGIE
                         Yes.

                                     PETER
                         Good for you.

                                     REGGIE
                         No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.

                                     PETER
                         Please, not on my account.

                                     REGGIE
                         No, you see, I don't really love 
                         him.

                                     PETER
                         Well, you're honest, anyway.

                                     REGGIE
                         Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- 
                         dishonesty infuriates me. Like when 
                         you go into a drugstore.

                                     PETER
                         I'm not sure I --

                                     REGGIE
                         Well, you go in and you ask for some 
                         toothpaste -- the small size -- and 
                         the man brings you the large size. 
                         You tell him you wanted the small 
                         size but he says the large size is 
                         the small size. I always thought the 
                         large size was the largest size, but 
                         he says that the family size, the 
                         economy size and the giant size are 
                         all larger than the large size -- 
                         that the large size is the smallest 
                         size there is.

                                     PETER
                         Oh. I guess.

                                     REGGIE
                         Is there a Mrs. Joshua?

                                     PETER
                         Yes, but we're divorced.

                                     REGGIE
                         That wasn't a proposal -- I was just 
                         curious.

                                     PETER
                         Is your husband with you?

                                     REGGIE
                         Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. 
                         First it was separate rooms -- now 
                         we're trying it with cities. What do 
                         people call you -- Pete?

                                     PETER
                         Mr. Joshua.
                              (turning to go)
                         Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.

                                     REGGIE
                         Now you're angry.

                                     PETER
                         No, I'm not -- I've got some packing 
                         to do. I'm also going back to Paris 
                         today.

                                     REGGIE
                         Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who 
                         said: "When strangers do meet they 
                         should erelong see one another again"?

                         Shakespeare never said that.

                         How do you know?

                                     PETER
                         It's terrible -- you just made it 
                         up.

                                     REGGIE
                         Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are 
                         you going to call me?

                                     PETER
                         Are you in the book?

                                     REGGIE
                         Charles is.

                                     PETER
                         Is there only one Charles Lampert?

               PANS to pick up a TAXI as it pulls up before the handsome 
               building. Inside are REGGIE, SYLVIE and JEAN-LOUIS.

               As REGGIE climbs out and the DRIVER begins unloading her 
               suitcases.

                                     REGGIE
                         Goodbye, Sylvie, and thanks.
                              (She turns toward the 
                              house)

               JEAN-LOUIS sticks his head out of the taxi window.

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         When you get your divorce will you 
                         be going back to America?

               MED. SHOT -- THE TAXI

               REGGIE looks at SYLVIE, surprised.

                                     SYLVIE
                         He knows everything.

                                     REGGIE
                              (to JEAN-LOUIS)
                         Don't you want me to stay?

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         Yes, of course -- but if you went 
                         back and wrote me a letter --

                                     REGGIE
                         -- you could have the stamps. I'll 
                         get you some here, okay?

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         Okay.

               REGGIE walks toward the house with the driver, who carries 
               her cases.  She presses the button that electrically opens 
               the front door.

               INT. APARTMENT LANDING -- DAY

               As the elevator rises REGGIE gets out, followed by the driver.  
               He puts down the bags in front of the apartment door.

                                     REGGIE
                              (handing him a tip)
                         Merci.

               The driver leaves. She goes to the door and presses the 
               minuterie, the button that turns on the time-light, and the 
               lights come on. Then she rings the doorbell. There is no 
               answer. She rings again. Still nothing. Sighing, she digs 
               out her keys and starts to fit it into the lock. At this 
               moment the minuterie expires, plunging the scene into 
               darkness.

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE
                         Wonderful.

               She finds the button and the light goes on again. She inserts 
               the key and turns it.

               From REGGIE's p.o.v. as CAMERA PANS the entrance hall. It is 
               bare -- no furniture, no rug, no pictures, no nothing.

               She stares for a moment, then goes back out into the landing.

               As REGGIE steps back outside. She looks at the nameplate

               It reads "MR. AND MRS. CHARLES LAMPERT."

               REGGIE looks at the plate in disbelief, then turns and hurries 
               back into the apartment.

               As REGGIE hurries into the entrance hall.

                         Honorine -- !

               No answer.

               Now, CAMERA FOLLOWING, she goes into the Salon. It is also 
               empty -- stripped bare. There are squares of the wall's 
               original color where paintings used to hang, the hooks still 
               in the wall.

               She rushes now, going into the bedroom, CAMERA FOLLOWING 
               crazily, lurching and careening behind her. The bedroom, 
               too, is empty. She goes to the built-in wardrobe closets and 
               throws open all the doors. Only some hangers remain.

               She pulls open the drawers -- nothing!

                                     REGGIE
                         Charles -- !

               She turns, and running now, goes through another door to the 
               library, CAMERA FOLLOWING. The rows of shelves are as empty 
               as the rest of the apartment. She begins to turn in a circle, 
               looking for something, anything. In a panic she turns and 
               runs out, colliding suddenly with a MAN whom she (and we) 
               have not noticed until the moment of impact.

               REGGIE screams.

               A heavy-set man of no particular age with tobacco-colored

                         Yes.

                         of the Police Judiciaire. Would you 
                         be so kind as to come with me, please?

               INT. MORGUE -- DAY

               We see a large metal drawer being opened and an all-too- 
               familiar shape outlined under a damp sheet of muslin.

               ANOTHER ANGLE -- OVERHEAD

               Looking straight down at the tops of REGGIE's, GRANDPIERRE's 
               and an ATTENDANT's head and smack into the open drawer.

               GRANDPIERRE lifts a corner of the sheet at the bottom and 
               reveals a bare foot with a ticket tied to its big toe.

               He stoops to read it. Satisfied, he recovers the foot, then 
               moves to the other end to uncover the head.  As the sheet 
               starts to lift:

               REVERSE SHOT

               REGGIE as she looks down into the CAMERA. She closes her 
               eyes for a moment, then looks again.

                                     GRANDPIERRE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Well, Madame -- ?

               She nods.

                                     GRANDPIERRE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         You are positive?

               She nods again. GRANDPIERRE moves into the SHOT.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         You loved him?

                         I'm very cold.

               GRANDPIERRE nods as he turns to the unseen ATTENDANT.

               CAMERA suddenly moves as the 'drawer' is slid back into the 
               wall. BLACKNESS comes with a loud clang and continues while

               CLOSE SHOT -- DESK DRAWER (FROM ABOVE) as it is pulled open.

               A photograph of Charles Lampert lies face up in the drawer.

               A hand reaches in and pulls it out.

               Including GRANDPIERRE sitting behind his desk, and REGGIE, 
               sitting across from him. The office is as bare as most 
               policemen's offices. GRANDPIERRE studies the photo.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         We discovered your husband's body 
                         lying next to the tracks of the Paris-
                         Bourdeaux railroad line. He was 
                         dressed only in his pajamas. Do you 
                         know of any reason why he might have 
                         wished to leave France?

                                     REGGIE
                         Leave?

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         Your husband possessed a ticket of 
                         passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed 
                         from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this 
                         morning at seven.

                                     REGGIE
                              (a pause)
                         I'm very confused.

               She starts to rummage through her bag. GRANDPIERRE shoves a 
               package of French cigarettes across the desk to her. But she 
               pulls a package of nuts out of her bag. She begins separating 
               the shells with her thumb nail and eating the nuts, depositing 
               the shells in the ashtray. GRANDPIERRE watches this for an 
               instant.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         He was American?

                                     REGGIE
                         Swiss.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         Oh. Swiss. His profession?

                                     REGGIE
                         He didn't have one.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         He was a wealthy man?

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't know. I suppose so.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         About how wealthy would you say?

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't know.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         Where did he keep his money?

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't know.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         Besides yourself, who is his nearest 
                         relation?

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't know.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                              (exploding)
                         C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment 
                         absurde!

                                     REGGIE
                         I know.
                              (pause)
                         I'm sorry.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         It is all right.

               GRANDPIERRE sighs, puts down his pencil and pushes a button 
               on the desk. He removes a cigar from his desk and inserts it 
               into his mouth.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         Is it all right?

                                     REGGIE
                         I wish you wouldn't.

               He rips the cigar out of his mouth and slams it back into 
               the drawer, closing it fiercely. A UNIFORMED POLICEMAN sticks 
               his head in the door.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         Les effets de Lampert.

               The POLICEMAN leaves and closes the door.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         On Wednesday last your husband sold 
                         the entire contents of the apartment 
                         at public auction. Furniture, 
                         clothing, kitchenware -- everything. 
                         The gallery, in complying with his 
                         wishes, paid him in cash. One million 
                         two hundred and fifty thousand New 
                         Francs. In dollars, a quarter of a 
                         million. The authorities in Bordeaux 
                         have searched his compartment on the 
                         train. They have searched it 
                         thoroughly. They did not find 
                         $250,000, Madame.

               He opens the desk drawer, puts the cigar back in his mouth 
               and lights a match by scratching it against the glass desk-
               top before he remembers REGGIE's request. He puts it back in 
               the drawer again. The door opens and the POLICEMAN enters 
               again, this time carrying a wicker basket which he deposits 
               on GRANDPIERRE's desk, and leaves. GRANDPIERRE peers into 
               the basket.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         These few things are all that was 
                         found in the train compartment. There 
                         was no other baggage. Your husband 
                         must have been in a great hurry.

               He begins to take them out, placing them on the desk, 
               identifying each item as he does.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         One wallet containing four thousand 
                         francs -- one agenda --
                              (pausing, he opens 
                              the notebook)
                         -- his last notation was made 
                         yesterday -- Thursday --
                              (reading)
                         "Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs-
                         Elysées"
                              (looking up)
                         Why there?

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                              (dryly)
                         Obviously.
                              (returning to the 
                              items in the basket)
                         One ticket of passage to South America -- 
                         one letter, stamped but unsealed, 
                         addressed to you --

                                     REGGIE
                              (lighting up)
                         A letter? May I see it?

               GRANDPIERRE hands her the letter and watches her closely as 
               she reads it.

                                     REGGIE
                              (reading)
                         "My dear Regina: I hope you are 
                         enjoying your holiday. Megeve can be 
                         so lovely this time of year. The 
                         days pass very slowly and I hope to 
                         see you soon. As always, Charles. 
                         P.S. Your dentist called yesterday. 
                         Your appointment has been changed."
                              (she looks up, puzzled)
                         Not very much, is it?

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         We took the liberty of calling your 
                         dentist -- we thought, perhaps, we 
                         would learn something.

                                     REGGIE
                         Did you?

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         Yes. Your appointment has been 
                         changed.
                              (he smiles at his 
                              little joke, then 
                              returns to the basket)
                         One key to your apartment -- one 
                         comb -- one fountain pen --  one 
                         toothbrush -- one tin of tooth powder
                              (he looks up)
                         -- that is all.

               He slides a sheet of paper and pen across to her, then starts 
               to put the things back into the basket while he speaks:

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         If you will sign this list you may 
                         take the things with you.

                                     REGGIE
                              (sighing)
                         Is that all? Can I go now?

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         One more question. Is this your 
                         husband's passport?

               He reaches into the desk drawer and pulls out a passport 
               which he hands to her.

               INSERT -- PASSPORT

               The cover indicates that it is Swiss. REGGIE's hand opens it 
               to a picture of a man -- the man we saw in GRANDPIERRE's 
               photo. Under it is the name: "CHARLES LAMPERT."

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND GRANDPIERRE

                                     REGGIE
                         Of course it is.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         And this?

               He hands her another passport.

               INSERT -- SECOND PASSPORT

               The cover is American. When it is opened, we see the identical 
               picture, but the name under it reads: "CHARLES VOSS."

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND GRANDPIERRE

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't understand.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         And this? And this?

               He hands her, one at a time, two more passports.

               INSERT -- THIRD AND FOURTH PASSPORTS

               One is Italian which, when opened, shows the same photo with 
               the name "CARLO FABRI." The other is Venezuelan, the same 
               photo, and the name "CARLOS MORENO."

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND GRANDPIERRE

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         Have you nothing to say, Madame?

               REGGIE looks down at the four passports, then back to 
               GRANDPIERRE.

                                     REGGIE
                              (hopefully)
                         It's all right if you want to smoke 
                         your cigar now.

               INT. LAMPERT APARTMENT -- DUSK

               The house is empty as before. Now it is silent, the late 
               afternoon light coming from outside. REGGIE stands by a 
               window. A canvas airline bag rests on the floor nearby.

               Suddenly there is the noise of a DOOR OPENING.

               CLOSER SHOT -- REGGIE

               As her head turns, in alarm, toward the noise. There is a 
               moment of silence, then FOOTSTEPS are heard, coming closer.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As PETER enters.

                                     REGGIE
                              (surprised)
                         What are you doing here?

                                     PETER
                         I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted 
                         to tell you how sorry I am -- and to 
                         find out if there was anything I 
                         could do.

                                     REGGIE
                         How did you find out?

                                     PETER
                         It's in all the afternoon papers. 
                         I'm very sorry.

                                     REGGIE
                         Thank you.

               A silence.

                                     PETER
                         I rang the bell but I don't think 
                         it's working.

                                     REGGIE
                         Yes it is -- I heard it this morning.

               He looks around for the light switch, then goes to it and 
               flicks it on -- nothing happens. He flicks it a few more 
               times.

                                     REGGIE
                         They must have turned off the 
                         electricity.

               She shakes her head. PETER looks around.

                                     PETER
                         Where did everything go?

                                     REGGIE
                         Charles sold it all -- at auction.

                                     PETER
                         Do you know what you're going to do?

                                     REGGIE
                         Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, 
                         I suppose.

                                     PETER
                         Doing what?

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm a simultaneous translator -- 
                         like Sylvie, only she's English to 
                         French -- I'm French to English. 
                         That's what I did before I married 
                         Charles. The police probably think I 
                         killed him.

                                     PETER
                         Instant divorce you mean?

                                     REGGIE
                         Something like that. But I'm sorry 
                         it ended like this -- tossed off a 
                         train like a sack of third-class 
                         mail.

                                     PETER
                              (Taking her hand)
                         Come on. You can't stay here.

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't know where to go.

                                     PETER
                         We'll find you a hotel.

                                     REGGIE
                         Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady 
                         of leisure anymore.

                                     PETER
                         Something modest but clean -- and 
                         near enough to UNESCO so you can 
                         take a cab when it rains -- okay?

               She nods. He picks up the airlines bag and they start out.

               REGGIE stops at the door and looks back.

                                     REGGIE
                         I loved this room -- but Charles 
                         never saw it -- only what was in it. 
                         All those exquisite things --
                              (looking around)
                         I think I prefer it like this.

               INT. FUNERAL CHAPEL -- DAY

               CLOSE SHOT of a phonograph. A hand appears, starts the record 
               on it spinning, then places the arm at the beginning.

               An instant later ORGAN MUSIC starts with a roar.

               INT. FUNERAL CHAPEL -- DAY

               CLOSE SHOT of the coffin. It rests on a low platform, with a 
               bouquet or two of flowers near the head, the lid open.

               Inside, the face made up to look lifelike (but failing), lie 
               the remnants of Charles Lampert.

               CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE

               The INSPECTOR sits quietly, eyes downcast, staring at his 
               hands in a prayer-like attitude. CAMERA PULLS BACK, revealing 
               row after row of empty wooden bench-like seats in the large, 
               dimly-lit, high-ceilinged room. Finally, in the first row, 
               REGGIE and SYLVIE are discovered. Besides GRANDPIERRE, they 
               are the only ones present. REGGIE turns around to look at 
               the empty room. They speak in whispers.

                                     REGGIE
                         It's not exactly what I'd call a 
                         large turn-out.

                                     SYLVIE
                         Didn't Charles have any friends?

                                     REGGIE
                         Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow.
                              (indicating GRANDPIERRE)
                         If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't 
                         even have him.

                                     SYLVIE
                         At least he knows how to behave at 
                         funerals.

               CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE

               His eyes still lowered. CAMERA PANS DOWN to feature his hands -- 
               he is methodically trimming his nails with a small clipper.

               TWO SHOT -- SYLVIE AND REGGIE

                                     SYLVIE
                         Have you no idea who could have done 
                         it?

                                     REGGIE
                         Until two days ago all I really knew 
                         about Charles was his name -- now it 
                         turns out I didn't even know that.

               The front DOOR of the Chapel is heard opening and a shaft of 
               daylight streams in. The WOMEN turn.

               MED. SHOT -- CHAPEL DOOR

               The short, heavy-set figure of a MAN is outlined against the 
               bright outdoor light. He stands for a moment, then closes 
               the door after him. LEOPOLD GIDEON, short-sighted, bald, in 
               his middle forties, glances around nervously, like a barnyard 
               bird. Then he walks down one of the side aisles of the Chapel.

               CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE

               As he watches GIDEON.

               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

               As she watches him.

               MED. SHOT -- THE BIER

               GIDEON arrives at the coffin. He stops, looks down at 
               LAMPERT's body for a moment. Then, suddenly, in rapid 
               succession, he sneezes six times. He takes a small bottle 
               from his pocket, shakes a pill from it and swallows it dry.

               He turns and walks back up the aisle, looking for a place to 
               sit. He comes face to face with GRANDPIERRE, stops, turns to 
               sit somewhere else.

               TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND SYLVIE

                                     SYLVIE
                         Do you know him?

                                     REGGIE
                         I've never seen him before.

                                     SYLVIE
                         He must have known Charles pretty 
                         well.

                                     REGGIE
                         How can you tell?

                                     SYLVIE
                         He's allergic to him.

               SYLVIE turns and glances at GIDEON. Again, the sound of the 
               DOOR opening interrupts them. They turn to look.

               MED. SHOT -- CHAPEL DOOR

               Again the figure of a MAN is outlined in silhouette against 
               the outside brightness. When he closes the door we can see 
               "TEX" PENTHOLLOW, a slim, rangy man with sandy-colored hair, 
               a weatherbeaten face, washed-out blue-eyes -- also in his 
               forties. He wears a velvet-corduroy suit, string tie and a 
               bright yellow flower in his lapel. A bulldurham tag hangs 
               from his outside breast pocket, dangling from its string.

               He starts down the aisle toward the bier, CAMERA LEADING 
               him, and we notice his unsteady gait. He turns to look at 
               the others present.

               TRAVELING SHOT -- TEX'S P.O.V.

               MOVING down the aisle. GRANDPIERRE's face, then GIDEON's, 
               then REGGIE's and SYLVIE's -- all staring at CAMERA.

               MED. SHOT -- THE BIER

               As TEX arrives. He stands staring at LAMPERT's body, swaying 
               on his feet until he reaches out and grabs the side of the 
               coffin to steady himself. Then he takes the flower from his 
               lapel and throws it into the open box.

               CLOSE SHOT -- TEX

                                     TEX
                              (heavy Texas accent)
                         Ariva durchy, Charlie.

               WIDER ANGLE

               As TEX turns away from the coffin and approaches REGGIE and 
               SYLVIE, addressing the latter -- after having first reached 
               for his hat which he discovers he isn't wearing.

                                     TEX
                         Miz Lampert, ma'am...

               SYLVIE points to REGGIE. Unruffled, TEX starts over. 
               addressing REGGIE this time.

                                     TEX
                         Miz Lampert, ma'am...

                                     REGGIE
                         Yes?

                                     TEX
                         Charlie had no call to handling it 
                         this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't understa--

               But TEX has nodded his head and moved off to find a seat.

               When he spots GIDEON, the two men stare at each other.

               Finally, TEX chooses a seat away from him and sits.

               MED. SHOT -- CHAPEL DOOR

               It flies open, this time with a bang, and the large MAN who 
               appears almost fills the frame.

               CLOSER SHOT -- TEX

               As the loud noise awakens him with a snort, mid-snore.

               MED. SHOT -- THE DOOR

               Closing the door, we see HERMAN SCOBIE, a heavy-weight -- 
               tall and wide, but not fat -- with black hair combed straight 
               back and heavy bushy eyebrows of a matching color, which 
               meet over his nose and join up. About the same age as the 
               first two men, SCOBIE is dressed in a battered raincoat, his 
               hands thrust deep in the pockets. He marches down the aisle. 
               Looking straight ahead, CAMERA PANNING with him. He stops 
               before the coffin and stares into it.

               CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE

               As he stares down into the coffin, his tongue trying to 
               dislodge a bit of food caught in his teeth. He stares hard 
               at the body, squinting his eyes. Then he removes one hand 
               from his pocket, removes a pin from the inside of his lapel, 
               picks his teeth with it, then slowly lets the hand down, 
               into the coffin.

               CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE'S HAND

               The pin held between thumb and forefinger, he jabs it slowly 
               but positively deep into the back of one of the dead man's 
               hands. There is no reaction.

               CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE

               He watches the dead man carefully, still squinting. Then 
               finally satisfied, he returns the pin to his lapel and walks 
               back up the aisle and out of the door, slamming it after 
               him.

               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

               Having watched SCOBIE exit. Suddenly a hand falls on her 
               shoulder. She jumps in alarm and utters a little cry of 
               fright.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Featuring a funeral ATTENDANT, a cadaverous type (aren't 
               they all) with a black cut-away coat and an over-solicitous, 
               unctuous manner. He is eternally bent at the waist, in a 
               sort of half bow. He offers REGGIE a letter which she takes.

                                     REGGIE
                         Merci, Monsieur.

                                     ATTENDANT
                         Pas du tout, madame, pardon -- pardon -- 
                         pardon.

               He backs off and is gone. REGGIE looks at the letter, back 
               and front, then starts to open it.

                                     SYLVIE
                         Who is it from?

                                     REGGIE
                         The American Embassy.

               She pulls out the letter and starts to read it.

               INSERT -- THE LETTER

               It bears the Great Seal as a letterhead and the typed message 
               reads:

               "Dear Mrs. Lampert: Please drop by my office tomorrow at 
               noon-thirty. I am anxious to discuss the matter of your late 
               husband's death. Sincerely, (signed) H. Bartholomew."

               TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND SYLVIE

               SYLVIE has been reading over REGGIE's shoulder.

                                     SYLVIE
                         What is it about?

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't know.  But if this is a sample 
                         of American diplomacy I'm buying a 
                         fallout shelter.

               EXT. THE AMERICAN EMBASSY -- ESTABLISHING -- DAY

               The fine old building in the Rue Gabriel.

               DELETED

               INT. EMBASSY CORRIDOR -- DAY

               As REGGIE leaves the elevator two young DIPLOMATIC TYPES 
               step in, immersed in conversation.

                                     1ST DIPLOMATIC TYPE
                         I bluffed the Old Man out of the 
                         last pot -- with a pair of deuces.

                                     2ND DIPLOMATIC TYPE
                         What's so depressing about that?

                                     1ST DIPLOMATIC TYPE
                         If I can do it, what are the Russians 
                         doing to him?

               The elevator door closes on them. REGGIE reacts to this and 
               starts down the hall, finally stopping at the door.

               MED. SHOT -- DOOR

               It is marked "307-A  H. BARTHOLOMEW." REGGIE checks the 
               letter, then opens the door.

               INT. BARTHOLOMEW'S OUTER OFFICE -- DAY

               The office is empty, the typewriter on the secretary's desk 
               is covered with its plastic shroud. REGGIE enters, looks for 
               somebody, notices that the door to the private office is 
               slightly ajar.

                                     REGGIE
                              (tentatively)
                         Hello -- ?
                              (there is no answer)
                         Hello?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)
                              (from the private 
                              office)
                         Is there anything wrong, Miss 
                         Tompkins?

                                     REGGIE
                         Uh -- Miss Tompkins isn't here.

               BARTHOLOMEW comes to the door and looks in. He is a pale 
               grey-haired man who looks, on first examination, older than 
               his forty-odd years. Sickly would be the word that describes 
               him best -- pallid, consumptive-looking. He wears heavy 
               tortoise-framed glasses which fall down his nose and cause 
               him to push them back in place every so often with a quick 
               automatic motion.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         I'm sorry -- my secretary must have 
                         gone to lunch. You are -- ?

                                     REGGIE
                         Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                              (looking at his watch)
                         Come in, Mrs. Lampert. You're quite 
                         late.

               He motions for her to enter, standing aside to let her do 
               so.

               INT. BARTHOLOMEW'S PRIVATE OFFICE -- DAY

               A small cubicle -- there is a silver-framed photo of three 
               kids on the desk. BARTHOLOMEW indicates a chair, then goes 
               behind his desk and sits. A can of lighter fluid stands open 
               on the desk and a crumpled hankie beside it.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Excuse me for a moment, Mrs. Lampert -- 
                         it's a stubborn little devil.

               He works at a stain on his necktie with lighter fluid and 
               hankie.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Dry-cleaningwise, things are all 
                         fouled up. I had a good man -- an 
                         excellent man on the Rue Ponthieu, 
                         but H.Q. asked us to use the plant 
                         here in the building -- to ease the 
                         gold outflow.

                                     REGGIE
                         Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you 
                         know who I am?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                              (looking up)
                         Charles Lampert's widow -- yes?
                              (going back to the 
                              tie)
                         Last time I sent out a tie only the 
                         spot came back.

               He looks up at her, laughs silently, then goes back to his 
               tie.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Voilà! As they say.

               He puts away the lighter fluid in a desk drawer, smells the 
               hankie, passes on it, then sticks it in his pocket.

               He opens another drawer and pulls out various sandwiches 
               wrapped in waxpaper, a salt and pepper shaker, a tube of 
               mustard, a bottle of red wine and two Dixie cups.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Have some, please. I've got...
                              (checking)
                         ...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken 
                         and -- liverwurst.

                                     REGGIE
                         No thanks.

               He uncorks the wine, fills a cup and begins eating.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. 
                         Lampert?

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't suppose it's an airline, is 
                         it?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.

                                     REGGIE
                         You mean spies and things like that?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Only we call them agents.

                                     REGGIE
                         We? You mean you're --?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't 
                         think that you people were supposed 
                         to admit --

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- 
                         I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- 
                         trying to run a bureau of overworked 
                         men with under-allocated funds. 
                         Congress seems to think that all a 
                         spy needs --

                                     REGGIE
                         Agent.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Yes -- That all he needs is a code 
                         book and a cyanide pill and he's in 
                         business.

                                     REGGIE
                         What's all this got to do with me, 
                         Mr. Bartholomew?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                              (his mouth full)
                         Your husband was wanted by the U. S. 
                         government.

                                     REGGIE
                         May I have a sandwich, please?

               He hands her a sandwich and fills a wine-cup for her.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         To be more specific, he was wanted 
                         by this agency.

                                     REGGIE
                              (eating)
                         So that was it.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Yes. We knew him, of course, by his 
                         real name.

                                     REGGIE
                              (almost choking)
                         His -- real -- ?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Voss -- Charles Voss. All right, 
                         Mrs. Voss --
                              (taking a photo from 
                              his desk)
                         -- I'd like you to look at this 
                         photograph, please -- by the way, 
                         you saw this one, didn't you?
                              (indicating the kids 
                              on the desk)
                         Scott, Cathy, and Ham, Jr.

                                     REGGIE
                         Very sweet.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Aren't they?  Now look at this one, 
                         Mrs. Voss, and --

                                     REGGIE
                         Stop calling me that! Lampert's the 
                         name on the marriage license.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Yes -- and tell me if you recognize 
                         anyone. Just a moment. Have a good 
                         look.

               He reaches back into the drawer and pulls out a glass which 
               he gives her.

               FOUR MEN, all in army uniform, sitting behind a table. The 
               glass is held over the first, magnifying the face.

               CLOSER SHOT -- PHOTO

               It's a photo of a young CHARLES LAMPERT.

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         It's Charles!

                                     BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Very good.

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         He looks so young -- when was this 
                         taken?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         1944. The next face, please.

               The glass and CAMERA move to the next man -- a young TEX.

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         It's the man who came to the funeral 
                         yesterday -- I'm sure of it -- a 
                         tall man in a corduroy suit and string 
                         tie.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Does the name Tex Penthollow mean 
                         anything to you?

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         No.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Next, please.

               The glass and CAMERA move to the third face -- a young GIDEON.

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Yes -- and he was there, too -- a 
                         little fatter now -- and less hair -- 
                         but it's the same one.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. 
                         Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         No.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         The last one, please.

               The glass and CAMERA move to the fourth face -- a young 
               SCOBIE.

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         That's a face you don't forget -- he 
                         was there too --

                                     BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Herman Scobie. And you've never seen 
                         him before, either?

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         No, thank heaven.

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND BARTHOLOMEW

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                              (a pause, regarding 
                              her)
                         Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a 
                         great deal of danger.

                                     REGGIE
                         Danger? Why should I be in any danger?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         You're Charles Voss's wife -- now 
                         that he's dead you're their only 
                         lead.

                                     REGGIE
                         Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying 
                         to frighten me you're doing a really 
                         first-rate job!
                              (she takes another 
                              sandwich)

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- 
                         it's your only chance.

                                     REGGIE
                         Gladly, only I don't know what you 
                         want! You haven't told me.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Oh, haven't I? The money -- Mrs. 
                         Lampert -- the money. The $250,000 
                         Charles Voss received from the 
                         auction. Those three men want it, 
                         too -- they want it very badly.

                                     REGGIE
                         But it's Charles's money, not theirs.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                              (laughing)
                         Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see 
                         you try and convince them of that!
                              (drying his eyes)
                         Oh, dear.

                                     REGGIE
                         Then whose is it? His or theirs?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Ours.

                                     REGGIE
                              (she looks at him for 
                              a moment)
                         Oh, I see.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         And I'm afraid we want it back.

                                     REGGIE
                         But I don't have it.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         That's impossible. You're the only 
                         one who could have it.

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm sorry it's impossible. It's the 
                         truth.

               BARTHOLOMEW is silent for a moment, thinking.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         I believe you.

                                     REGGIE
                         Thanks very much.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Oh, you've got the money all right -- 
                         you just don't know you've got it.

                                     REGGIE
                         Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter 
                         of a million dollars, believe me, 
                         I'd know it.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've 
                         got it.

                                     REGGIE
                         You mean it's just lying around 
                         someplace -- all that cash?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Or a safe deposit key, a certified 
                         check, a baggage claim -- you look 
                         for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite 
                         sure you'll find it.

                                     REGGIE
                         But --

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- look 
                         just as hard and as fast as you can. 
                         You may not have a great deal of 
                         time. Those men know you have it 
                         just as surely as we do. You won't 
                         be safe until the money's in our 
                         hands. Is that clear?

               REGGIE nods. He writes something on a pad of paper and tears 
               it off, handing it to her.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Here's where you're to call me -- 
                         day or night. It's a direct line to 
                         both my office and my apartment. 
                         Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert -- and 
                         please don't tell anyone about coming 
                         to see me. It could prove fatal for 
                         them as well as yourself.

                                     REGGIE
                         Wait a minute -- you think those 
                         three men killed Charles, don't you?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         We've no proof, of course, but we 
                         rather think so, yes.

                                     REGGIE
                         Well, there you are! Charles had the 
                         money with him -- so whoever killed 
                         him has it -- they have it!

               BARTHOLOMEW shakes his head.

                                     REGGIE
                         Why not?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                              (grimly)
                         Because they're still here.

                                     REGGIE
                         Oh.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Like I said, Mrs Lampert -- I'm afraid 
                         you're in a great deal of danger. 
                         Remember what happened to Charles.

               REGGIE takes the last sandwich and begins eating furiously.

               EXT. ESPLANADE DES CHAMPS-ELYÉES -- DAY

               MED. SHOT -- GUIGNOL.

               One of the French Punch and Judy shows set up on certain 
               days in the small park alongside the broad avenue between 
               the Rond Point and the Place de la Concorde. At the moment, 
               Judy, as always, is beating Punch with a bat. The sound of 
               CHILDREN laughing and screaming can be heard.

               VARIOUS CLOSE SHOTS -- THE CHILDREN

               Sitting on small benches lined up to face the stage. Their 
               attention is fixed on the show, their belief totally suspended 
               by the play as only children's can be -- laughing at the 
               slapstick, booing the villain, frightened by the perils.

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE

               Sitting on the last bench, next to some CHILDREN. They are 
               laughing but she isn't -- she just watches, her attention 
               caught up but her face void of emotion. The bench is too low 
               for her, forcing her knees up almost under her chin.

               After a moment, PETER comes up behind her and, stepping over 
               the benches, sits beside her. She doesn't seem to notice.

               [Throughout the following scene the CHILDREN and the ACTORS 
               can be heard in the b.g.]

                                     PETER
                         Reggie -- ?

               She turns and looks at him for a moment.

                                     REGGIE
                              (vaguely)
                         Hallo, Peter.

                                     PETER
                         You telephoned me to meet you. I've 
                         been standing on the corner back 
                         there -- waiting for you.

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm sorry -- I heard the children 
                         laughing.

               A ROAR from the CHILDREN. REGGIE and PETER turn toward the 
               stage.

               MED. SHOT -- GUIGNOL

               PUNCH and JUDY are arguing loudly.

               TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND PETER

                                     PETER
                         What's going on?

                                     REGGIE
                         Don't you understand French?

                                     PETER
                         I'm still having trouble with English.

                                     REGGIE
                         The man and the woman are married --

               CLOSE SHOT -- GUIGNOL STAGE

               PUNCH and JUDY are batting each other on the head.

                                     PETER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Yes, I can see that -- they're batting 
                         each other over the head with clubs.

               Finally, JUDY knocks Punch out of sight and a PUPPET wearing 
               a three-cornered hat appears.

                                     PETER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Who's that with the hat?

               MED SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE

               Wearing a hat, he stands off in the background, watching.

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         That's the policeman -- he wants to 
                         arrest Judy for killing Punch.

               CLOSE SHOT -- GUIGNOL STAGE

               JUDY and the POLICEMAN are batting one another.

                                     PETER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         What's she saying now?

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         That she's innocent -- she didn't do 
                         it.

                                     PETER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         She did it, all right -- take it 
                         from me.

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         I believe her.

               PUNCH's head appears on the other side of the stage, says 
               something, then ducks out.

                                     PETER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Who was that?

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Punch, of course.

               TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND PETER

                                     PETER
                         Of course? I thought he was dead.

                                     REGGIE
                         He's only pretending, to teach her a 
                         lesson -- only --
                              (her face clouding)
                         only he is dead, Peter -- I saw him -- 
                         he's not pretending. Somebody threw 
                         him off a train. What am I going to 
                         do?

               Charles was mixed up in something terrible.

                                     PETER
                         I wish you'd let me help you. Whatever 
                         it is, it doesn't sound like the 
                         sort of thing that a woman can handle 
                         all by herself.

               CLOSE SHOT -- GUIGNOL STAGE

               JUDY has gotten the upper hand is now batting the POLICEMAN's 
               brains out.

               CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE as he winces.

               TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND PETER

                                     PETER
                         Have you got a mirror?
                              (she nods)
                         Give it to me.

               She hands it to him and he holds it in front of her face.

                                     PETER
                         Right there, between your eyes -- 
                         see? Worry lines. You're much too 
                         young and too pretty to have anything 
                         like that. How about making me vice-
                         president in charge of cheering you 
                         up?

                                     REGGIE
                              (jumping at the 
                              suggesting)
                         Starting tonight?

               INT. NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT

               MED. SHOT -- EMCEE.

               He stands on the dance floor in front of a five piece Latin 
               dance band, a spotlight on him, wearing his professional 
               smile as he speaks into a mike.

                                     EMCEE
                         Bonsoir mesdames et messieurs, good 
                         evening ladies and gentlemen, guten 
                         Abend, meine Damen und Herren -- ce 
                         soir, comme tous les soirs, 
                         l'attraction ici, au Black Sheep 
                         Club, c'est vous! Venez, mesdames et 
                         messieurs, step right up, ladies and 
                         gentlemen, kommen Sie her, meine 
                         Damen en Herren, avanti, signore e 
                         signori -- avanti!

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND PETER

               At their table. REGGIE is dressed in a lovely Givenchy dress.

                                     PETER
                         What was all that?

                                     REGGIE
                         Fun and games. Evidently we're the 
                         floorshow.

                                     PETER
                         You mean you and me?

                                     REGGIE
                         No, everyone. Come on -- avanti, 
                         avanti!

               She rises and pulls him along.

               WIDE ANGLE

               Including the dance floor as most of the patrons go to it, 
               laughing self-consciously and looking around.

                                     EMCEE
                         Écoutez bien -- les règles sont tres 
                         simples -- the rules are very easy -- 
                         deux équipes -- two teams -- each 
                         with one orange -- une orange -- 
                         eine apfelsine -- un' arrancia -- 
                         held under the chin, like so --
                              (does it)
                         comme ça -- and passed to the player 
                         behind you -- sans vous servir de 
                         vos mains -- using nothing but the 
                         chin -- no hands -- and keeping the 
                         orange at all costs from touching 
                         the floor. Commencez, Mesdames et 
                         Messieurs -- begin, ladies and 
                         gentlemen -- signore e signori, 
                         comminciate!

               The EMCEE now circulates, forming teams, telling the patrons 
               to line up, making sure there is a woman next to every man. 
               REGGIE and PETER are the second couple in their line.

               Then the EMCEE picks up a basket of oranges and places one 
               under the chin, held securely against the chest, of each man 
               at the head of the line. Blowing a whistle, a signal for the 
               game to begin and the band to play, the men turn to the women 
               behind them and attempt to transfer the oranges from under 
               their chins to under the chins of the women -- without using 
               their hands.

               (This maneuver can only be accomplished by embracing one's 
               partner passionately and firmly pressing the orange against 
               the partner's throat until he or she can grip it tightly 
               enough with the chin to turn and offer it to the person next 
               in line, where the process begins anew. However, the slightest 
               miscalculation, which can be brought about by any number of 
               human frailties -- haste, modesty, inhibition or lack of co-
               ordination -- will surely result in losing control of the 
               orange so that it either falls to the floor [where it can 
               only be picked up by the chin] or it starts to roll and slide 
               from its proper place to some other, less proper, spot on 
               the human anatomy, forcing the man or the woman to retrieve 
               it -- again, with the chin only. This latter is an activity 
               which can prove extremely satisfying to old friends, or even 
               new friends who wish to become old friends, but can only be 
               a torment for total strangers and/or the English).

               VARIOUS SHOTS -- ORANGE GAME

               Some of the couples in various states of confusion, 
               entanglement and intimacy -- all of them, naturally, 
               hilarious.

               TWO SHOT -- PETER AND GIRL

               It is his turn to take the orange from a very short, but 
               quite shapely young girl in a strapless dress (held up by an 
               abundance of cantilever). PETER 'takes' when he sees the 
               twin obstacles which might -- and probably will -- encumber 
               the game but increase his worldly experience.

               The contest begins: because of her stature he is forced to 
               move in low, making the ordinary embrace needed for success 
               difficult, if not impossible. Then, inexorably, the orange 
               starts to slip down the GIRL's front. Manfully he goes after 
               it.

               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

               She is enjoying it thoroughly.

               TWO SHOT -- PETER AND GIRL

               Bending over backwards, in a sort of frontal half-nelson, 
               PETER makes a last valiant effort and voilà, grips the orange 
               under his chin -- amid much cheering and congratulations 
               from members of his TEAM.

               Now he turns to REGGIE and they face one another for a moment.

                                     PETER
                         En garde.

                                     REGGIE
                         Lay on, MacDuff.

               They go at it, working their bodies together to make it all 
               possible. Then, for a moment, the game and the onlookers 
               seem less important than their proximity. But, alas, they 
               are too good despite themselves and the transfer is 
               accomplished -- again with appreciative cheers from the TEAM.

               REGGIE, with the orange now tucked firmly under her chin, 
               turns to the next team-member in line and is locked in an 
               embrace before she realizes her partner is LEOPOLD GIDEON, 
               the short, fat, balding man seen at the funeral and later in 
               BARTHOLOMEW's photo.

               REGGIE starts to draw back but GIDEON holds her tightly.

               Putting his chin around the orange he is able to speak quietly 
               in REGGIE's ear.

               CLOSE TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND GIDEON

               Her eyes show her fright as he whispers:

                                     GIDEON
                         Mrs. Lampert --

                                     REGGIE
                         What do you want?

                                     GIDEON
                         Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?

                                     REGGIE
                         Tell me what?

                                     GIDEON
                         It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- 
                         you do know that, don't you?

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't know anything.

                                     GIDEON
                         Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you 
                         could wake up dead.

                                     REGGIE
                         Leave me alone -- !

                                     GIDEON
                         Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's 
                         news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --

                                     REGGIE (SHOUTING)
                         Stop it!

               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE'S AND GIDEON'S FEET

               As REGGIE hauls off and kicks GIDEON full in the shin.

               CLOSE SHOT -- GIDEON

               He stiffens as the pain registers. Instead of shouting he 
               merely closes his eyes.

               WIDER ANGLE

               Including REGGIE and GIDEON and PETER standing by, as well 
               as some spectators. PETER comes quickly forward.

                                     PETER
                         Reggie -- what's the trouble?

               REGGIE realizes that GIDEON no longer offers any resistance.

               She steps back, leaving GIDEON holding the orange, foolishly, 
               under his chin, his eyes still closed. REGGIE stares at him 
               for a moment.

                                     REGGIE
                         He -- he was stepping on my foot.

               CLOSE SHOT -- GIDEON

               Slowly, his eyes open and tears stream from them, rolling 
               down his cheeks. He speaks while holding the orange.

                                     GIDEON
                         Forgive me -- it was quite 
                         unintentional, I'm sure.

               WIDER ANGLE

               GIDEON turns to the woman behind him and the game resumes.

                                     REGGIE
                              (starting off)
                         Wait for me -- I won't be long.

               She goes off toward the rear of the club and starts down a 
               flight of stairs.

               CLOSE SHOT -- PETER

               Watching her go, a concerned look on his face.

               INT. NIGHTCLUB LOUNGE -- NIGHT

               A small, dimly lit area with a door to the combination men's-
               women's room and a 'phone cabin with a solid door.

               The music and shouting from upstairs float down. REGGIE comes 
               down the stairs and goes to the 'phone, flicking on the light 
               and closing the door after her.

               INT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT

               REGGIE takes a jeton ('phone token) from her bag and drops 
               it in the slot. Then she takes out a slip of paper (the one 
               given her by BARTHOLOMEW) and dials the number written on 
               it. She listens to it ring, then evidently he answers.

                                     REGGIE
                              (into 'phone)
                         Mr. Bartholomew -- it's me, Reggie 
                         Lampert -- listen Mr. Bartholomew: 
                         I've seen one of the
                              (she stops)
                         Mr. Bartholomew? Can you hear me?

               She realizes she has not pushed the button which takes her 
               coin and allows the party at the other end to hear her voice.

                                     REGGIE
                         Hello -- Mr. Bartholomew -- it's me, 
                         Regina Lam...

               Suddenly the door of the booth opens and REGGIE wheels to 
               look, slamming the receiver down as she does.

               REVERSE SHOT -- 'PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT

               TEX PENTHOLLOW, the second man from the funeral (and photo), 
               the man in the corduroy suit and string tie, stands in the 
               doorway, his face calm, a hand-rolled but unlit cigarette in 
               his mouth. He has put one foot up against the side of the 
               door so she can't leave. REGGIE stares at him, terrified.

                                     TEX
                         Howdy, Miz Lampert.

                                     REGGIE
                         Wha -- what do you want?

               TEX takes a book of matches from his pocket.

                                     TEX
                         You know what I want, Miz Lampert...

                                     REGGIE
                         No -- no, I'm don't.

                                     TEX
                         Come on now -- sure you do. An' you'd 
                         better give it to me, Miz Lampert -- 
                         cuz I ain't foolin'. No sireebob!

               He strikes a match and lights his cigarette, holding the 
               burning match in his hand afterward.

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't know what --

               TEX, without a word, throws the still-lit match into the 
               booth, onto REGGIE's lap. She beats it out frantically.

                                     REGGIE
                         What are you doing?

               TEX lights another match and throws it into her lap. She 
               beats this one out too.

                                     REGGIE
                         Stop that!

                                     TEX
                         Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert --

               He lights another match and reaches out toward her hair with 
               it. She shrinks back.

                                     TEX
                         It could get a whole lot worse.

               Then he throws it into her lap. As he continues to speak he 
               punctuates each phrase or so with another lit match. REGGIE 
               is too busy beating them out to do anything else.

                                     TEX
                         It belongs to me, Miz Lampert -- an' 
                         if you don't give it to me your life 
                         ain't gonna be worth the paper it's 
                         printed on. You savvy what I'm sayin', 
                         Miz Lampert?

                                     REGGIE
                         Please stop -- please!

                                     TEX
                         You think on it real careful-like, 
                         Miz Lampert -- y'hear?

               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

               As she frantically beats out the matches, her eyes on her 
               work.

                                     REGGIE
                         You're insane, absolutely insane!

               She looks up, then blinks her eyes.

               INT. 'PHONE BOOTH OVER REGGIE'S SHOULDER

               There is no one there. REGGIE rises and steps out of the 
               booth.

               INT. NIGHTCLUB LOUNGE -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE looks around. There is no one there.

               INT. PHONE BOOTH

               As REGGIE returns, sits and starts to put another jeton into 
               the slot. She notices her hand is shaking. She reaches back 
               into her bag, removes a piece of candy, puts it into her 
               mouth and leans her head back against the wall, closing her 
               eyes.

               Suddenly the door opens and REGGIE shrieks -- but this time 
               it is PETER.

                                     PETER
                         What are you doing in here?

                                     REGGIE
                              (a sigh of relief)
                         Having a nervous breakdown.

               INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT

               REGGIE and PETER enter the deserted lobby.

                                     PETER
                         You haven't said a word since we 
                         left the club -- what happened back 
                         there?

                                     REGGIE
                         I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to 
                         tell you or not.

                                     PETER
                         I don't think I follow you.

                                     REGGIE
                         He said if I told anybody it could 
                         prove fatal for them as well as me.

                                     PETER
                         Who said?

                                     REGGIE
                         That's what I'm not supposed to say.

                                     PETER
                         Stop this nonsense! If you're in 
                         some sort of trouble I want to know 
                         about it.

                                     REGGIE
                         Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying 
                         me.

                                     PETER
                         I wasn't --

                                     REGGIE
                         Yes, you were -- you called it 
                         nonsense. Being murdered in cold 
                         blood isn't nonsense. Wait until it 
                         happens to you sometime.

               She goes to the desk, followed by PETER, where the NIGHT 
               CLERK greets them sleepily.

                                     NIGHT CLERK
                         Bonsoir.

                                     REGGIE
                         Bonsoir. Quarante-deux, s'il vous 
                         plait.

               The NIGHT CLERK gets the key off a hook and hands it to 
               REGGIE.

                                     NIGHT CLERK
                         Bonne nuit.

                                     REGGIE
                              (to PETER)
                         Would you mind seeing me to the door?

                                     PETER
                         Of course not.

               They go to the elevator where he opens the door for her.

               INT. ELEVATOR -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE and PETER enter the small cage. It is somewhat 
               cramped, forcing them to stand close together.

                                     REGGIE
                         This is quite a place for making 
                         friends, isn't it?

               He presses the button and the elevator starts to rise.

                                     PETER
                         You said this afternoon that your 
                         husband was mixed up in something.

                                     REGGIE
                              (busy examining the 
                              cleft in his chin)
                         How do you shave in there?

                                     PETER
                         What was it?

                                     REGGIE
                         What was what?

                                     PETER
                         What your husband was mixed up in.

                                     REGGIE
                         Look, I know it's asking you to 
                         stretch your imagination, but can't 
                         you pretend for a moment that I'm a 
                         woman and that you're a --

                                     PETER
                         Don't you know I could already be 
                         arrested for transporting a minor 
                         above the first floor?

               The elevator stops.

                                     PETER
                         We're here.

                                     REGGIE
                         Where?

                                     PETER
                         On the street where you live.

                                     REGGIE
                         How about once more around the park?

               He reaches across her and opens the door.

                                     PETER
                         Out.

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE leaves the elevator, followed by PETER. They walk 
               to her door. There is a moment of silence as she looks at 
               him.

                                     REGGIE
                              (imitating PETER)
                         Him: 'Do you mind if I come in for a 
                         nightcap, Reggie?' Her: 'Well -- it 
                         is awfully late.' Him: 'Just one, 
                         all right?' Her: 'Promise you'll 
                         behave yourself.' Him: 'Sorry, baby, 
                         I never make promises I can't keep.'

                                     PETER
                         How would you like a spanking?

                                     REGGIE
                         How would you like a punch in the 
                         nose? Stop treating me like a child.

                                     PETER
                         Then stop acting like one. If you're 
                         really in some kind of trouble, I'd 
                         like to hear about it. Otherwise, 
                         it's late, I'm tired and I'm going 
                         home to bed.

                                     REGGIE
                         Do you know what's wrong with you?

                                     PETER
                         What?

                                     REGGIE
                         Nothing. Good night.

                                     PETER
                         Good night.

               He turns and leaves. She smiles slightly, then turns and 
               puts the key into the door and opens it.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               Featuring the door. REGGIE enters, then stops abruptly, the 
               doorknob still in her hand.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               The room has been torn apart. And standing in the center is 
               HERMAN SCOBIE, the large man in the battered raincoat.

               He starts slowly advancing toward REGGIE.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Where is it, lady -- where've you 
                         got it?

               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

                                     REGGIE
                              (terrified)
                         I don't know -- I don't know! I don't --

               She stops as she sees something.

               CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE'S HAND

               Instead of a human hand there is a twin-pronged metal one.

               WIDER ANGLE

               SCOBIE sees where REGGIE is staring; looks down at it himself, 
               then lunges at her, raising the hand to strike.

                                     SCOBIE
                         I want it -- give it to me -- it's 
                         mine!

               The hand is starting to come down. REGGIE, moving quickly, 
               turns and flies out.

                                     REGGIE
                              (screaming)
                         Peter -- ! Peter -- !

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE runs out, slamming the door after her, the metal 
               hand crashes against the wooden panel inside the door and 
               splinters through it, visible on this side now. Petrified 
               with fear, REGGIE can only stare dumbly at the protruding 
               claw.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As PETER comes running up to her. He sees the metal hand.

                                     REGGIE
                         A man -- he tried to kill me!

               Pulling her aside, PETER takes hold of the key (still in the 
               outside lock) and turns it slowly and quietly. Then, using 
               all his weight, he slams the door open as far as it will go, 
               making sure to hold it that way as he steps in.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               Inside, PETER pulls back the door and slugs the startled 
               SCOBIE full on the jaw. His head bangs against the wall but 
               he manages to raise a foot and push PETER violently away, 
               sending him sprawling back, toppling across the bed and over, 
               head first, onto the floor on the other side, where he 
               disappears. Hurrying, SCOBIE puts his foot against the door 
               and pushes it away, ripping his metal hand free.

               He then rushes to the open window and climbs out.

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT

               REGGIE waits anxiously. When she hears nothing, she gingerly 
               looks into the room.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

                                     REGGIE
                              (entering cautiously)
                         Peter -- ?
                              (alarmed)
                         Peter! Where are you?

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Showing the disarranged room, empty of people. Then, slowly 
               PETER's hand appears from behind the bed, shaking groggily.

               REGGIE rushes to him and helps him sit on the bed.

                                     REGGIE
                         Peter -- are you all right?

                                     PETER
                         I think I sprained my pride.
                              (He looks around)
                         Where'd he go?

                                     REGGIE
                         Out of the window, I guess -- I didn't 
                         see him.

               PETER goes, unsteady on his feet, to the window and looks 
               out. He then turns back.

                                     PETER
                         Lock the door and the window -- and 
                         don't let anyone in except me. I'll 
                         be back in a minute.

                                     REGGIE
                         Be careful, Peter.

                                     PETER
                              (one leg over the 
                              sill)
                         You took the words right out of my 
                         mouth.

               He climbs out.

               EXT. HOTEL WINDOW THIRD FLOOR -- NIGHT

               Outside the window to REGGIE's room is a small, false balcony, 
               consisting mostly of railing, with barely enough room between 
               it and the building's facade for a man to stand. PETER appears 
               and looks down over the railing.

               EXT. HOTEL SIDEWALK (FROM ABOVE) -- NIGHT

               SHOOTING STRAIGHT DOWN; there is no one on the street and it 
               is too far to jump.

               MED. SHOT -- PETER -- BALCONY

               He now looks around. REGGIE's is the last such balcony on 
               one side, but there are two or three on the other.

               PETER climbs over the railing and, holding on to it with one 
               hand, reaches for the railing on the next balcony.

               CLOSE SHOT -- PETER'S HAND

               As it stretches for the railing; it is several inches short 
               of touching it.

               MED. SHOT -- PETER

               As he straightens up and prepares to jump.

               EXT. HOTEL FACADE -- NIGHT

               From the GROUND. PETER, high above, jumps to the next balcony.

               MED. SHOT -- PETER

               As he climbs over the railing of the second balcony. He sees 
               a light coming through the window and looks in.

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Oh!

               PETER leaves the window quickly, climbing over the railing 
               on his way to the next balcony. As he does, the following 
               exchange is heard (in British English).

                                     MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         What is it now, Pamela?

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         It happened again, Henry -- another 
                         strange man peered in the window at 
                         me and then went away.

                                     MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Bad luck, Pamela.

               EXT. HOTEL FACADE -- NIGHT

               From the GROUND as PETER jumps to the next balcony.

               MED. SHOT -- PETER

               As he climbs over the rail to the third balcony. There is a 
               light coming from this window, too. PETER looks in.

               MED. SHOT -- WINDOW -- OVER PETER'S SHOULDER

               Inside the room are GIDEON, TEX, and SCOBIE in the midst of 
               a heated discussion.

                                     GIDEON
                         That was a dumb move, Herman -- a 
                         dumb move.

                                     TEX
                         And then some. If you'd only told us 
                         you was goin' to her room we could've 
                         kept 'em busy --

               INT. GIDEON'S HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

                                     TEX
                         -- but sneakin' in there on your own 
                         that-a-way, why, man, you was bound 
                         to get yore tokus kicked. I mean, 
                         what'd you think he'd do -- walk up 
                         'n' shake you by that hand o' yores?

                                     PETER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         That's right, Herman -- you didn't 
                         leave me much choice.

               They all turn toward the window.

               WIDER ANGLE

               As PETER climbs in through the window and joins them.

                                     PETER
                              (to SCOBIE)
                         I didn't hurt you, did I?

               SCOBIE shakes his head and turns away.

                                     GIDEON
                              (eagerly)
                         Never mind that -- did you get the 
                         money?

                                     PETER
                         How could I with the three Marx 
                         Brothers breathing down my neck? You 
                         said you'd let me handle it alone --
                         ! The girl trusts me. If she's got 
                         it, I'll find out about it. But you've 
                         got to leave me alone.

                                     SCOBIE
                              (to GIDEON and TEX)
                         We took all the chances. The money 
                         belongs to us, not him!

                                     TEX
                         Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- 
                         don't forget he done us a little ol' 
                         favor.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Yeah? What's that?

                                     TEX
                         He took care of Charlie for us.

                                     GIDEON
                              (to PETER)
                         We appreciate it, really we do.

                                     SCOBIE
                         But who asked him? Three shares are 
                         enough -- I'd say he's out!

                                     PETER
                         A third of nothing is nothing, Herman. 
                         Make up your minds -- she's waiting 
                         for me.

                                     GIDEON
                              (thoughtfully)
                         I don't see how another twenty-four 
                         hours could hurt.

                                     TEX
                         Shoot no, not after all these years.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Then he gets it out of your share, 
                         not mine! Not mine!

               SCOBIE turns and storms out of the door, slamming it.

               GIDEON begins sneezing, takes a bottle of pills from his 
               pocket and swallows two white tablets.

                                     GIDEON
                         I suggest you get about your business -- 
                         nothing soothes Herman like success.

                                     TEX
                              (chuckling)
                         That's right -- it's like ticklin' a 
                         alligator's belly.

                                     PETER
                         Who's got the room next to hers?

                                     TEX
                         Me. How come?

                                     PETER
                         Get another one, will you? I'm going 
                         to need it.

               PETER starts for the door.

                                     TEX
                         If you do find the money -- you won't 
                         forget t' tell us about it, will 
                         you, fella?

                                     PETER
                              (turning at the door)
                         Don't worry.

                                     TEX
                         Oh, I ain't worryin' -- but see this 
                         pudgy little fella here?
                              (indicating GIDEON)
                         He worries -- an' he's even meaner'n 
                         I am.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               As she waits anxiously, smoking a cigarette. There is a KNOCK 
               at the door.

                                     REGGIE
                         Who is it?

                                     PETER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         It's me. Peter.

               REGGIE unlocks the door and opens it. PETER enters and she 
               closes the door again --

                                     PETER
                         There was no trace of him. All right, 
                         Reggie -- suppose you tell me what 
                         this is all about.

                                     REGGIE
                         There are three men -- he's one of 
                         them -- they think I have something 
                         that belongs to them.

                                     PETER
                         What?

                                     REGGIE
                         A quarter of a million dollars.

               PETER is silent for a moment.

                                     PETER
                         Go on.

                                     REGGIE
                         That's all.

                                     PETER
                         No, it isn't -- where's the money?

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't know.  Those men killed 
                         Charles to get it. But he must not 
                         have had it with him on the train.

                                     PETER
                         So they think he left it with you.

                                     REGGIE
                         But he didn't! I've looked everywhere --
                              (tears welling)
                         And if I don't find it --
                              (wailing)
                         Those men going to kill me.

               She falls in his arms to be comforted.

                                     PETER
                         No, they won't -- I won't let them.

                                     REGGIE
                              (sobbing)
                         Please help me, Peter -- you're the 
                         only one I can trust.

                                     PETER
                         Of course I'll help -- I told you I 
                         would, didn't I? Come on now --

               He takes out his handkerchief and dries her eyes.

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm so hungry I could faint.
                              (trying to smile)
                         I've -- I've gotten your suit all 
                         wet.

                                     PETER
                         That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.

                                     REGGIE
                         Peter, you've got to promise me 
                         something. Promise you'll never lie 
                         the way Charles did. Why do people 
                         have to tell lies?

                                     PETER
                         Usually it's because they want 
                         something -- and they're afraid the 
                         truth won't get it for them.

                                     REGGIE
                         Do you tell lies?

               A pause. The phone rings. REGGIE answers it.

                                     REGGIE
                              (into the phone)

                         The man who hit me, lady -- Dyle -- 
                         that's his name. What's wrong -- is 
                         he still there?

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               REGGIE's back is turned to PETER so he can't see her face.

               He watches her.

                                     REGGIE
                              (on the phone)
                         Yes -- that's right.

                                     PETER
                         What is it, Reggie -- what's he 
                         saying?

               She shakes her head.

               INT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT

                                     SCOBIE

                         Don't trust him -- don't tell him 
                         anything. He's after the money.

               He hangs up.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               Slowly, REGGIE lowers the 'phone from her ear and hangs it 
               up.  She hesitates a moment.

                                     PETER
                         What'd he say?

                                     REGGIE
                         He -- he said if I didn't give the 
                         money, he'll kill me.

                                     PETER
                         I wouldn't take that too seriously.

                                     REGGIE
                         I believe what he said.

                                     PETER
                         They're only trying to scare you, 
                         that's all.

                                     REGGIE
                         How do you know what they're doing?

                                     PETER
                         I don't -- but as long as they think 
                         you have the money, or know where it 
                         is, or have it without knowing where 
                         it is, or don't even know you have 
                         it --

                                     REGGIE
                         What are you talking about?

                                     PETER
                         You mustn't let what he said bother 
                         you. It was only words.

                                     REGGIE
                              (softly)
                         Words can hurt very much.

                                     PETER
                              (a pause)
                         Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the 
                         morning.

                                     REGGIE
                         Don't put yourself out.

                                     PETER
                         Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember 
                         that.

                                     REGGIE
                         Yes, I'll remember. Good night.

                                     PETER
                         Good night.

               He starts out, pausing by the door and examining the hole 
               SCOBIE made in it.

                                     PETER
                         But if you'll take my advice --
                              (smiling)
                         You'll undress in the closet. Oh, 
                         and if you need me, just bang on the 
                         wall. I'll be next door.

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT

               As PETER (now called DYLE) leaves REGGIE's room and closes 
               the door. He pauses for a moment, listening, hears nothing, 
               then bends down and starts pulling at a loose thread in one 
               of his socks. As usual, the thread unravels -- and unravels -- 
               and unravels some more until it seems that the entire sock 
               has come unknit. Now, taking the long thread, he bends down 
               near the door and, taking his tie-pin, attaches one end of 
               the thread to the bottom of REGGIE's door. He then runs the 
               thread along the floor to his door (next door) and works it 
               underneath.

               INT. DYLE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               As DYLE enters, the thread in his hand. He goes to a nearby 
               table where he attaches the thread to the heavy room key, 
               which he then balances on the extreme edge of the table.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               REGGIE is on the phone.

                         -- But I am calm, Mr. Bartholomew -- 
                         what I called to tell you was there's 
                         someone else -- someone who wasn't 
                         in that photograph you showed me. He 
                         says his name is Peter Joshua -- but 
                         it isn't -- it's Dyle.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               REGGIE hangs up the phone, picks up her bag, checks her hair 
               in the mirror, then starts for the door. She stops as she 
               notices the connecting door leading to the room next door, 
               DYLE's room. She goes to it, silently slips out the key and 
               bends to peer through the keyhole.

               INT. DYLE'S ROOM -- NIGHT (THROUGH KEYHOLE)

               DYLE is removing his coat. Before he lays it over a chair, 
               he takes a gun from the inside pocket, checks it, and tucks 
               it into his belt.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               REGGIE reacts in surprise and fright, jumps quickly away 
               from the door. She hurries to the door leading to the hall 
               and reaches for the knob.

               INT. DYLE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROOM KEY. The thread attached to it is pulled 
               (by the action of REGGIE's door opening) and the key falls 
               to the floor with a clatter.

               WIDE ANGLE

               Including DYLE as he reacts, his head wheeling to look at 
               the key. Snatching his coat, he runs for the door.

               As REGGIE sneaks past DYLE's door. When she has passed, the 
               door opens and DYLE appears. REGGIE takes off on the run, 
               turning the corner and starting down the stairs.

               REGGIE comes running down the stairs.

                                     DYLE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Reggie... !

               She turns, looking back towards the sound of his voice, but 
               does not slacken her speed. She runs out the front door.

               EXT. HOTEL ENTRANCE -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE runs out. She looks up the street, sees a TAXI and 
               hails it.

                                     REGGIE
                         Taxi -- !

               It pulls over to the curb. Looking once more over her shoulder 
               she takes a bill out of her pocket, opens the cab door, slams 
               it loudly without getting in and hands the bill to the driver.

                                     REGGIE
                         N'importe où -- vite! Allez-y!

               She jumps back into the shadows of a nearby doorway as the 
               TAXI pulls away. At the same time DYLE runs out of the hotel.  
               Another TAXI is coming down the street. DYLE hails it 
               frantically.

                                     DYLE
                         Taxi -- ! Taxi -- !

               It pulls up and DYLE opens the door.

                                     DYLE
                              (pointing)
                         Follow that taxi.

                                     DRIVER
                         Comment?

                                     DYLE
                         Taxi! Follow!

                                     DRIVER
                         Je ne comprends rien.

               Desperately, DYLE reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out 
               a small dictionary and begins flipping through the pages.

               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

               In the shadows. She lifts her eyes in annoyance.

               MED. SHOT -- TAXI

                                     DYLE
                              (finding the word)
                         Suivre -- el taxi!

                                     DRIVER
                         Ah! Oui, Monsieur.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               REGGIE comes out of the shadows, looks after DYLE's taxi, 
               then hails another one which pulls up.

                                     REGGIE
                              (to DRIVER)
                         Aux Halles -- vite!

               DELETED

               EXT. LES HALLES -- NIGHT

               REGGIE and BARTHOLOMEW walking. The Central Market is teeming 
               with activity -- trucks creeping around other trucks, cases 
               of fruit and vegetables stacked on every inch of sidewalk, 
               WORKERS of all types milling around, unloading trucks and 
               stacking crates, little electric carts scooting in and out -- 
               and nearby, one of the huge, high-roofed sheds where the 
               butchers work.

               TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND BARTHOLOMEW

               CAMERA LEADING them as they walk.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                              (looking around)
                         Incredible, isn't it? Zola called it 
                         'le ventre de Paris' -- the womb of 
                         Paris, the belly.

               She takes a banana from a nearby stall.

                                     REGGIE
                              (peeling it)
                         What did you want to see me about, 
                         Mr. Bartholomew?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                              (leaves a coin on the 
                              crate)
                         Were you followed?

                                     REGGIE
                         Yes, but I lost him. I really did it 
                         quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to 
                         think women make the best spies.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Agents.

                                     REGGIE
                         He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew -- I 
                         saw it.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Who?

                                     REGGIE
                         Dyle, or whatever his name is.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         What does your Mr. Dyle look like, 
                         Mrs. Lampert?

                                     REGGIE
                         He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Describe him.

                                     REGGIE
                         Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- 
                         rather thin -- in good physical shape, 
                         I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite 
                         handsome, really.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                              (shaking his head)
                         No.

                                     REGGIE
                         No, what?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         That's not Carson Dyle.

                                     REGGIE
                              (stopping)
                         Carson?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         There's only one Dyle connected with 
                         this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's 
                         Carson.

                                     REGGIE
                         You mean you've known about him all 
                         along? Why didn't you tell me?

               BARTHOLOMEW looks at her for a moment, then glances around; 
               his attention is drawn inside the doorway.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         It's enough to make you a vegetarian, 
                         isn't it?

               INT. LES HALLES BUTCHERS' SHED -- NIGHT

               Almost as far as the eye can see, row upon row of beef sides, 
               hung on hooks.

               TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND BARTHOLOMEW (TRAVELING)

               As REGGIE looks at the hanging beef.

                                     REGGIE
                         It's just lucky that I'm not hanging 
                         next to one of those things right 
                         now.

               She shudders, throws away her banana and turns back to 
               BARTHOLOMEW.

                                     REGGIE
                         Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you 
                         tell me you knew about Dyle?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.

                                     REGGIE
                         Dead? Mr. Bartholomew -- maybe you'd 
                         better tell me what this thing's all 
                         about.

               DELETED

               INT. LES HALLES BISTRO -- NIGHT

               Lined up at a zinc bar are several BUTCHERS, their white 
               smocks stained with blood. REGGIE and BARTHOLOMEW sit at the 
               table.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         I suppose you're old enough to have 
                         heard of World War Two?

                                     REGGIE
                         Barely, yes.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         In 1944, five members of the O.S.S. -- 
                         the military espionage unit -- were 
                         ordered behind the German lines for 
                         the purpose of delivering $250,000 
                         in gold to the French Underground. 
                         The five men --

               A WAITER arrives.

                                     WAITER
                         Vous désirez?

                                     REGGIE
                              (smiling)
                         They always do that.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                              (to the WAITER)
                         Café.

                                     REGGIE
                         Gratinée, choucroute garnie, salade 
                         de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned 
                         on spending the entire night here.

                                     REGGIE
                         Can I at least keep the onion soup?

               BARTHOLOMEW shrugs.

                                     REGGIE
                              (to the WAITER)
                         La soupe tout simplement.

               The WAITER nods and goes.

                                     REGGIE
                              (anxiously)
                         Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- 
                         the French Underground --

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Yes. The five men. They were, of 
                         course, your husband, Charles, the 
                         three men who showed up at his funeral 
                         yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But 
                         something went wrong and they were 
                         unable to locate their contact. It 
                         must have been at that point that 
                         they decided to steal the money.

                                     REGGIE
                         Steal it how?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         By burying it, and then reporting 
                         that the Germans had captured it.  
                         All they had to do was come back 
                         after the war, dig it up and split 
                         it five ways -- a quarter of a million 
                         dollars with no questions asked.

                                     REGGIE
                              (fascinated)
                         May I have a cigarette, please?

               BARTHOLOMEW pulls out a package and she takes one, looks at 
               it and rips off the filter tip. He winces.

                                     REGGIE
                         I hate these things -- it's like 
                         drinking coffee through a veil.

               She puts the other end in her mouth, then picks up the matches 
               and lights it.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Everything went smoothly enough until 
                         after the gold was buried -- then, 
                         before they could get out, they were 
                         ambushed by a German patrol. A machine 
                         gun separated Scobie from his right 
                         hand -- and caught Carson Dyle full 
                         in the stomach.

               REGGIE takes another cigarette from his pack, rips off the 
               filter (he winces again) and puts it into her mouth.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         What's wrong with that one?

               He points to the cigarette she just lit, still practically 
               brand-new in the ashtray.

                                     REGGIE
                         Oh. Nothing, I guess. What happened 
                         then?

               She hands over the newer one to BARTHOLOMEW, who sadly 
               examines its mutilated end while REGGIE returns to the first 
               cigarette.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Have you any idea what these things 
                         cost over here?

                                     REGGIE
                         Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- 
                         what happened then?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Scobie was able to travel, but Carson 
                         Dyle was clearly dying, so they --

               The WAITER returns with the coffee and onion soup.

                                     WAITER
                         La soupe, c'est pour qui?

                                     REGGIE
                         Pour moi. Go on, Mr. Bartholomew.

               The WAITER puts down the cup and bowl and leaves.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Carson was dying so they were forced 
                         to leave him. They finally got back 
                         to the base, made their report, and 
                         waited for the war to end. Only 
                         Charles couldn't wait quite as long 
                         as the others. He beat them back to 
                         the gold, took everything for himself 
                         and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, 
                         Tex and Scobie all this time to catch 
                         up with him again.

                                     REGGIE
                         But if they stole all that money -- 
                         why can't you arrest them?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         We know what happened from the bits 
                         and pieces we were able to paste 
                         together -- but we still have no 
                         proof.

                                     REGGIE
                         But what has all this got to do with 
                         the C.I.O.?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an 
                         extension of the wartime O.S.S. It 
                         was our money and we want it back.

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but 
                         nothing you've told me has changed 
                         my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- 
                         tonight.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert.  
                         You'd better consider what happened 
                         to your husband when he tried to 
                         leave. Those men won't be very far 
                         away -- no matter where you go. In 
                         fact, I don't even see any point in 
                         your changing hotels. Please help 
                         us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is 
                         counting on you.

                                     REGGIE
                         Well, if I'm going to die, I might 
                         as well do it for my country.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         That's the spirit.

                                     REGGIE
                         Oh, stop it. What do you want me to 
                         do?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         We're anxious to know who this man 
                         is -- the one calling himself Dyle.

                                     REGGIE
                         Maybe he really is Dyle. He could 
                         still be alive.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         No, Mrs. Lampert.

                                     REGGIE
                         But no one actually saw him die.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is 
                         registered with the War Department 
                         in Washington.

                                     REGGIE
                         Oh. Then who's this one?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         I don't know -- but I think you'd 
                         better find out, don't you?

                                     REGGIE
                         Me? Why me?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         You're in an ideal position -- he 
                         trusts you.
                              (grinning)
                         Besides, you said yourself, women 
                         make the best spies.

                                     REGGIE
                              (resigned)
                         Agents.

               EXT. HOTEL (PLACE ST. ANDRÉ DES ARTS) -- LATE AFTERNOON

               DYLE leaves the hotel and turns into the Place. A moment 
               later, REGGIE comes cautiously from the hotel. As she watches 
               DYLE, a SANDWICH-MAN advertising a driving school passes the 
               hotel. REGGIE falls in behind him, his tall placard hiding 
               her from view.

               EXT. PLACE ST. ANDRÉ DES ARTS -- LATE AFTERNOON

               First comes DYLE, passing a sidewalk cafe on the corner, 
               then the SANDWICH-MAN and REGGIE. The SANDWICH-MAN turns 
               off, leaving REGGIE out in the open. A moment later, DYLE 
               passes a GIRL painting a canvas, her easel set up in the 
               middle of the sidewalk. He stops when he has passed her and 
               turns to look at her work. REGGIE, not knowing what to do, 
               and afraid she will be seen by DYLE, who is now looking her 
               way, spins and sits at the sidewalk cafe's nearest table, 
               her back to DYLE. It is already occupied by a middle-aged 
               TOURIST.

               TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND TOURIST

               The TOURIST, complete with camera, beret and guide book, 
               looks up from his coffee, surprised. He stares at REGGIE and 
               she stares back. Finally, not knowing what else to do, she 
               smiles, then takes a portion of his brioche and eats it.

               He smiles back emptily, not knowing what to make of her.

               REGGIE turns to look at DYLE.

               MED. SHOT -- DYLE

               He has made his judgment of the painting and now moves on.

               TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND TOURIST

               The TOURIST has finally found the courage to speak. As he 
               opens his mouth to make a sound, REGGIE, her eyes on DYLE, 
               rises quickly from the table and goes, leaving a very confused 
               TOURIST with his mouth open. He blinks, then leaves some 
               money on the table and starts after her.

               EXT. PLACE ST. ANDRÉ DES ARTS -- LATE AFTERNOON

               REGGIE following DYLE. As she passes the GIRL painting, she 
               cannot resist turning to see the work.

               CLOSE SHOT -- PAINTING

               An abstract jumble, nothing recognizable.

               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

               As she looks from the painting to reality.

               EXT. PLACE ST. ANDRÉ DES ARTS -- LATE AFTERNOON

               As the scene really looks.

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE

               She shrugs, continues after DYLE. Now we see that the TOURIST, 
               in turn, is following her.

                                     TOURIST
                              (calling)
                         Fraulein --

               REGGIE doesn't stop.

                                     TOURIST
                         Fraulein --

                                     REGGIE
                              (turning but continuing)
                         What are you doing, following me? 
                         Stop it -- we're going to look like 
                         a parade.

               She continues after DYLE. The TOURIST hesitates, then 
               continues after her.

               MED. SHOT -- DYLE

               He goes to the curb and starts to step off, attempting to 
               cross the Rue Danton, but finds the light against him. He 
               turns back in REGGIE's direction.

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE

               Realizing she has to do something before DYLE spots her, she 
               turns and takes the TOURIST's arm and starts walking with 
               him back toward the cafe.

                                     REGGIE
                              (smiling and rattling 
                              on)
                         How are you? When did you arrive in 
                         town? Are you enjoying Paris? It's 
                         lovely, isn't it? So many wonderful 
                         things to see and do, it makes one's 
                         head spin to think of it.

               She looks back over her shoulder and sees that DYLE is now 
               crossing the Rue Danton, heading for the platform of a bus 
               now stopped at the curb.

                                     TOURIST
                              (smiling)
                         Fraulein --

               REGGIE pulls away from him.

                                     REGGIE
                         If you don't stop following me I'll 
                         call the police.

               She leaves him standing there, more confused than ever, as 
               she starts after DYLE again.

               DYLE has hopped on the back of the bus as it pulls away.

               REGGIE hurries across the street, hailing a taxi.

                                     REGGIE
                         Taxi -- !

               INT. AMERICAN EXPRESS -- LATE AFTERNOON

               DYLE enters. CAMERA PANNING with him to the head of a stairway 
               leading downstairs, a sign indicating that it leads to the 
               "MAIL ROOM & TELEPHONES." CAMERA PANS back to the door as 
               REGGIE enters.

               DELETED

               INT. AMERICAN EXPRESS MAIL ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON

               DYLE walks to one of several windows. A sign over it reading:

                                         "A - D."

               MED. SHOT -- STAIRS

               REGGIE comes down the stairs. Suddenly she stops.

               MED. SHOT -- DYLE

               CAMERA ZOOMS in to sign on "D."

               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

               A confused look on her face.

               MED. SHOT -- DYLE

               As his turn comes, he addresses the CLERK

                                     DYLE
                         Dyle, please... D - Y - L - E.

                                     CLERK
                         Yes, Mr. Dyle. I remember.

               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

               Watching.

               MED. SHOT -- MAIL WINDOW

               The CLERK takes out a bundle of letters and quickly sorts 
               through it.

                                     CLERK
                         I'm sorry, Mr. Dyle -- nothing today.

                                     DYLE
                         Thanks -- see you soon.

               He turns and heads out, starting up the stairs where REGGIE 
               was but is no longer. As he reaches the fourth or fifth step, 
               a VOICE is heard over the loudspeaker.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Mr. Dyle, please -- you're wanted on 
                         the telephone -- Mr. Dyle. Cabin 4.

               DYLE stops in his tracks, pondering what to do.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Mr. Dyle. Cabin 4, please.

               He stops and comes down the stairs, going to the back of the 
               room and into the cabin marked "4."

                                     DYLE
                              (picking up the phone)
                         Yes?

               CAMERA DOLLIES across an empty cabin to discover REGGIE in 
               the third one, on the phone.

               INT. REGGIE'S CABIN

               REGGIE on the phone. 

               INT. DYLE'S CABIN

               DYLE on the phone.

                                     REGGIE
                         Good morning, Mr. Dyle.

                                     DYLE
                         Reggie?

                                     REGGIE
                         It's the only name I've got. How 
                         about you?

                                     DYLE
                         No cat and mouse -- you've got me. 
                         What do you want to know?

                                     REGGIE
                         Why you lied to me.

                                     DYLE
                         I had to -- for all I knew you could 
                         have been in on the whole thing.

                                     REGGIE
                         Well, you know now, so please tell 
                         me who you are.

                                     DYLE
                         But you know my name -- it's Dyle.

                                     REGGIE
                         Carson Dyle is dead.

                                     DYLE
                         Yes, he is. He was my brother.

                                     REGGIE
                         Your --

                                     DYLE
                         The army thinks he was killed in 
                         action by the Germans, but I think 
                         they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- 
                         and your husband -- because he 
                         wouldn't go along with their scheme 
                         to steal the gold. I think he 
                         threatened to turn them in and they 
                         killed him. I'm trying to prove it. 
                         They think I'm working with them. 
                         But I'm not, and that's the truth. 
                         I'm on your side, Reggie -- please 
                         believe that.

                                     REGGIE
                         How can I? You lied to me -- the way 
                         Charles did -- and after promising 
                         you wouldn't. Oh, I want to believe 
                         you, Peter... oh, but I can't call 
                         you that anymore, can I? It will 
                         take me a while to get used to your 
                         new name -- which I don't even know 
                         yet. What is it?
                              (pause)
                         Aren't you going to tell me?
                              (pause)
                         Hello -- ?

               She opens the door of the cabin and starts out.

               MED. SHOT -- PHONE CABINS

               As REGGIE steps out of her cabin and starts looking in the 
               others. They are all occupied except one and she looks inside 
               it.

               CLOSE SHOT -- EMPTY CABIN

               The receiver hangs by its cord, swinging back and forth.

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE

               As she looks at it, confused.

               INT. AMERICAN EXPRESS -- DAY

               DYLE and SCOBIE stand together, waiting for the elevator, 
               SCOBIE clearly holding a gun in the pocket of his raincoat.

                                     SCOBIE
                              (quietly)
                         If you do anything funny, or try to 
                         talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle -- 
                         here and now. Okay?

                                     DYLE
                         You'll wreck your raincoat.

               The self-service elevator doors open, one or two PASSENGERS 
               come out and DYLE and SCOBIE enter. A young GIRL starts in 
               after them.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Next car, please.

               He reaches out and presses the top button with his metal 
               hand. The doors close.

               DELETED

               INT. TOP FLOOR LANDING -- LATE AFTERNOON

               As SCOBIE follows DYLE out of the elevator. SCOBIE looks 
               around -- there is an open door at the end of a short hall. 
               He and DYLE go to it, CAMERA FOLLOWING. Through the door, 
               which SCOBIE closes behind them, is a flight of stairs, 
               leading up to a second floor.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Okay -- turn around.

               DYLE turns to find SCOBIE's gun out of the pocket and pointing 
               at him. SCOBIE now transfers it to his metal hand and goes 
               to DYLE, where he proceeds to frisk him.

               Finding the gun DYLE carries in his inside coat pocket, SCOBIE 
               removes it. During the following conversation he will shake 
               open the revolving magazine and let the bullets fall out 
               onto the floor before handing back the emptied gun to DYLE.  
               Then he will transfer his own gun back to his good hand.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Sit down.

               Shrugging, DYLE sits on the third step.

                                     DYLE
                         What now?

                                     SCOBIE
                         We wait -- with our mouths shut.

               INT. AMERICAN EXPRESS -- NIGHT

               The last EMPLOYEES leave the building as the WATCHMAN locks 
               the front door after them.

               INT. TOP FLOOR LANDING -- NIGHT

               In the semi-darkness, DYLE is still sitting on the third 
               step, SCOBIE still facing him with a gun.

                                     DYLE
                         How long do you intend -- ?

                                     SCOBIE
                         I said with the mouth shut.

               DYLE yawns wide.

                                     DYLE
                         Sorry about that.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Okay -- up there.

               DYLE gets to his feet and starts up the stairs, followed by 
               SCOBIE. DYLE stops at the door.

                                     DYLE
                         Do I knock or something?

                                     SCOBIE
                         Open it.

               DYLE opens the door. The stairs continue up.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Keep going.

                                     DYLE
                         The view had better be worth it.

               EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS -- ROOFTOP -- NIGHT

               A spectacular view of the Paris rooftops and the city lights 
               beyond. DYLE and SCOBIE come out onto a level portion of 
               roof. On the street side, the roof angles down abruptly into 
               a steep, slate-covered pitch, broken only by two widely 
               separated oval-shaped dormer windows.

               Below these is a rain gutter, then nothing -- for seven 
               stories.

                                     DYLE
                         Very pretty. Now what?

                                     SCOBIE
                         I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which 
                         is more than you'd give me. Where's 
                         the money?

                                     DYLE
                         Is that why you dragged me all the 
                         way up here -- to ask me that? She 
                         has it -- you know that.

                                     SCOBIE
                         And I say maybe you both have it! 
                         One more time, Dyle -- where is it?

                                     DYLE
                         Supposing I did have it -- which I 
                         don't -- do you really think I'd 
                         hand it over?

                                     SCOBIE
                         You're out, Dyle -- right now!

               SCOBIE aims the gun and starts advancing toward DYLE.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Step back.

               DYLE turns and looks -- there is nothing behind him but a 
               sheer drop to the street.

                                     DYLE
                         Back where?

                                     SCOBIE
                         That's the idea.

               Moving quickly, DYLE lashes out and hacks SCOBIE's gun hand 
               with the side of his palm and the gun falls to the roof.

               Following through, DYLE punches the large man full in the 
               jaw, but instead of falling, SCOBIE wraps his arm around 
               DYLE, holding on tightly until his head clears.

               Then, to his amazement, DYLE is lifted into the air and, 
               unable to break the bear-hold, carried toward the edge of 
               the roof. Working his arms between their two bodies, DYLE 
               suddenly flails them out with all his strength and the hold 
               is broken, but at the price of his coat and the flesh on his 
               back as SCOBIE's metal claw rips through both, a wound 
               extending from the center of DYLE's back to his shoulder.

               Both men look around for the gun, spot it simultaneously and 
               leap for it, both landing short of the mark. Now they grapple 
               with one another, each trying to break free and reach for 
               the gun.

               CLOSE SHOT -- THEIR HANDS

               Two hands, one real, one metal, inch toward the gun.

               MED. SHOT -- DYLE AND SCOBIE

               The battle is going to SCOBIE whose weight and strength are 
               beginning to tire DYLE, who is now on his back, trying to 
               stop SCOBIE from crawling over him. He has the large man by 
               both lapels of the raincoat in a last-ditch effort to hold 
               him. But SCOBIE, his face horribly distorted from the strain, 
               continues to inch forward toward the gun.

               Suddenly, DYLE releases his hold. With nothing restraining 
               him, SCOBIE lurches forward, tumbling past the gun, his 
               momentum carrying him onto the sloping part of the roof, 
               where he begins sliding down. SCOBIE beats wildly at the the 
               slate with his claw, trying to gouge a grip.

               CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE'S CLAW

               As it slides across the slate, making a hideous scratching 
               sound and causing sparks to fly.

               MED. SHOT -- SCOBIE

               As he slides over the edge and disappears.

               CLOSE SHOT -- DYLE

               As he watches, hypnotized.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROOF EDGE

               There appears to be no sign of SCOBIE. Then CAMERA ZOOMS IN 
               FOR A TIGHT CLOSE SHOT OF SCOBIE'S metal hand, gripping the 
               rain gutter at the very edge.

               MED. SHOT -- DYLE

               Having seen the claw, he rises and walks to the very edge of 
               the level part of the roof.

                                     DYLE
                         Herman?

               MED. SHOT -- SCOBIE

               As he hangs, seven stories over the street, by his metal 
               hand.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Yeah?

               MED. SHOT -- DYLE

               He finds it hard to believe.

                                     DYLE
                         How are you doing?

                                     SCOBIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         How do you think?

                                     DYLE
                         If you get bored, try writing 'Love 
                         thy neighbor' a hundred times on the 
                         side of the building.

               DYLE turns and leaves going down the stairs.

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT

               The HOTEL MANAGER is busy taping a piece of cardboard over 
               the hole ripped in REGGIE's door by SCOBIE's metal hand the 
               night before. DYLE leaves the elevator and goes to his own 
               door. The MANAGER eyes him coldly. DYLE "takes" the look.

                                     DYLE
                         I didn't do it.

                                     MANAGER
                         The next time madame forgets her 
                         key, there is another one at the 
                         desk.

               DYLE smiles, then enters his room.

               INT. DYLE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               He closes the door and starts to remove his torn coat, 
               wincing.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               REGGIE, smoking on the bed, sits up when she hears DYLE moving 
               about in his room. She goes to the connecting door, unlocks 
               her side, tries the knob, finds it still bolted from his 
               side and knocks.

                                     REGGIE
                         Is that you?

               INT. DYLE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               DYLE goes to the door, throws back the bolt and opens the 
               door. REGGIE enters.

                                     REGGIE
                         Didn't anyone ever tell you it's 
                         impolite to --
                              (seeing his injured 
                              back)
                         What happened?

                                     DYLE
                         I met a man with sharp nails.

                                     REGGIE
                         Scobie?

                                     DYLE
                         I left him hanging around the American 
                         Express.

                                     REGGIE
                         Come on -- I've got something that 
                         stings like crazy.

               She leads him into her room.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE and DYLE enter from his room. She leads him to the 
               bed.

                                     REGGIE
                         Take off your shirt and lie down.

               As REGGIE goes to the bathroom, DYLE takes off his torn shirt, 
               revealing a torn and bloody T-shirt. He lies face downwards 
               on the bed. REGGIE returns, carrying cotton, gauze, tape, 
               scissors, and disinfectant. She sits next to him and lifts 
               up his T-shirt to examine the wound.

                                     DYLE
                              (wincing)
                         Listen -- all I really want is an 
                         estimate.

                                     REGGIE
                         It's not so bad. You may not be able 
                         to lie on your back for a few days -- 
                         but, then, you can lie from any 
                         position, can't you?

               She wets the cotton with disinfectant and begins cleaning 
               the wound. He winces.

                                     REGGIE
                         Does it hurt?

                                     DYLE
                         Haven't you got a bullet I can bite?

               She continues working on his back, cleaning it, then bandaging 
               it while they talk.

                                     REGGIE
                         Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?

                                     DYLE
                         Would you like to see my passport?

                                     REGGIE
                         Your passport! What kind of a proof 
                         is that?

                                     DYLE
                         Would you like to see where I was 
                         tattooed?

                                     REGGIE
                         Sure.

                                     DYLE
                         Okay, I'll drive you around there 
                         some day.
                              (his back stinging)
                         Ouch!

                                     REGGIE
                         Ha ha. You could at least tell me 
                         what your first name is these days.

                                     DYLE
                         Alexander.

                                     REGGIE
                         Is there a Mrs. Dyle?

                                     DYLE
                         Yes, but we're divorced.

                                     REGGIE
                         I thought that was Peter Joshua.

                                     DYLE
                              (smiling)
                         I'm no easier to live with than he 
                         was.

                                     REGGIE
                              (finishing the bandage)
                         There -- you're a new man.

               As they continue talking, he rises from the bed and goes 
               into his own room. REGGIE remains on the bed, watching him 
               through the open door as he puts on a fresh T-shirt and shirt.

                                     DYLE
                         I'm sorry I couldn't tell you the 
                         truth, but I had to find out your 
                         part in all this.

                                     REGGIE
                         Alex -- how can you tell if someone 
                         is lying or not?

                                     DYLE
                         You can't.

                                     REGGIE
                         There must be some way.

                                     DYLE
                         There's an old riddle about two tribes 
                         of Indians -- the Whitefeet always 
                         tell the truth and the Blackfeet 
                         always lie. So one day you meet an 
                         Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful 
                         Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He 
                         tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, 
                         but which one is he?

                                     REGGIE
                         Why couldn't you just look at his 
                         feet?

                                     DYLE
                         Because he's wearing moccasins.

                                     REGGIE
                         Oh. Well, then he's a truthful 
                         Whitefoot, of course.

                                     DYLE
                         Why not a lying Blackfoot?

                                     REGGIE
                              (confused)
                         Which one are you?

                                     DYLE
                              (entering, smiling)
                         Whitefoot, of course.

                                     REGGIE
                         Come here.

               He goes to the bed.

                                     REGGIE
                         Sit down.

               He sits.

                                     REGGIE
                         I hope it turns out you're a 
                         Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very 
                         happy hanging around the tepee.

                                     DYLE
                         Reggie -- listen to me --

                                     REGGIE
                         Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly 
                         talk. You forget I'm already a widow.

                                     DYLE
                         So was Juliet -- at fifteen.

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm not fifteen.

                                     DYLE
                         Well, there's your trouble right 
                         there -- you're too old for me.

                                     REGGIE
                         Why can't you be serious?

                                     DYLE
                         There, you said it.

                                     REGGIE
                         Said what?

                                     DYLE
                         Serious. When a man gets to be my 
                         age that's the last word he ever 
                         wants to hear. I don't want to be 
                         serious -- and I especially don't 
                         want you to be.

                                     REGGIE
                         Okay -- I'll tell you what -- we'll 
                         just sit around all day long being 
                         frivolous -- how about that?

               She starts kissing him on the neck, on the chin, on the cheek.

                                     DYLE
                         Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.

                                     REGGIE
                              (pulling back)
                         Okay.

                                     DYLE
                         What are you doing?

                                     REGGIE
                         Cutting it out.

                                     DYLE
                         Who told you to do that?

                                     REGGIE
                         You did.

                                     DYLE
                         But I'm not through complaining yet.

                                     REGGIE
                         Oh.
                              (She starts kissing 
                              him again)
                          

                                     DYLE
                         Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.

                                     REGGIE
                         I think I love you, Alex --

               She kisses him on the mouth. The phone rings. He tries to 
               talk as she continues kissing him.

                                     DYLE
                              (mumbling)
                         The phone's ringing --

                                     REGGIE
                         Whoever it is won't give up -- and 
                         neither will I.

               The phone continues to ring and she continues to kiss him.

               Finally, REGGIE reaches out to the bedstand and takes the 
               phone off the hook. She brings the receiver up to their mouths 
               and mumbles into it.

                                     REGGIE
                              (on phone)
                         Sorry -- I was just -- uh -- nibbling 
                         on something.

               INT. TEX'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               TEX speaks into the phone.

                                     TEX
                         Miz Lampert, my buddies 'n me, we'd 
                         oblige it mighty highly if you could 
                         mosey on across the hall 'n chew the 
                         fat with us for a spell.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               DYLE is watching her.

                                     REGGIE
                              (on the phone)
                         Can you give me one good reason why 
                         I should?

               INT. TEX'S ROOM -- NIGHT

                                     TEX
                              (on the phone)
                         Yes, ma'am. A little one -- 'bout 
                         seven or eight years old. Th' little 
                         tyke keeps callin' you his Aunt Reggie -- 
                         ain't that cute?

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               She covers the phone and turns to DYLE in alarm.

                                     REGGIE
                         They've got Jean-Louis!

                                     DYLE
                         That sounds like their problem.

                                     REGGIE
                              (into the phone)
                         I'll be right there.

                         Miz Lampert -- so you just wiggle on

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE hangs up.

                                     REGGIE
                         What day is it?

                                     DYLE
                         Tuesday.

                                     REGGIE
                         Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie 
                         works late Tuesday nights -- she 
                         always leaves him with me. They 
                         wouldn't do anything to a little 
                         boy, would they?

                                     DYLE
                         I don't know -- it depends on whether 
                         or not they've already eaten.

               INT. TEX'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT -- JEAN-LOUIS. He looks around, uncertainly, first 
               one way, then the other. CAMERA PULLS BACK to show him sitting 
               on SCOBIE's knee, the large man holding him with his good 
               hand, the metal one in his pocket. TEX sits next to them 
               while GIDEON nervously paces the floor. When GIDEON begins 
               sneezing he takes the small bottle of pills from his pocket 
               and downs one or two, swallowing some water.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Hey, Tex -- move the kid to the other 
                         knee or something, will you? My leg's 
                         going to sleep.

               TEX lifts JEAN-LOUIS and puts him down on SCOBIE's other 
               knee.

                                     TEX
                         Upsy-daisy.

                         Are you a real cowboy?

                         Sure am.

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         Then where is your gun?

                                     TEX
                              (taking out his gun)
                         Right here -- see?

                                     GIDEON
                         Will you put that thing away!

               A KNOCK at the door. GIDEON goes to open it. REGGIE and DYLE 
               enter. She sees JEAN-LOUIS and TEX's gun.

                                     REGGIE
                         Jean-Louis!

               She snatches him off SCOBIE's lap.

                         Howdy, Miz Lampert.

                                     SCOBIE
                              (glaring at DYLE)
                         Who invited you?

                                     DYLE
                         Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, 
                         I see.

                                     REGGIE
                         I'd better call Sylvie -- she must 
                         be frantic.

               She starts for the door with JEAN-LOUIS. GIDEON blocks her 
               way.

                                     GIDEON
                         I'm afraid that will have to wait, 
                         Mrs. Lampert.

                                     REGGIE
                         But his mother --

                                     GIDEON
                         She isn't going to be anybody's mother 
                         unless you answer some questions.

                         TEX
                 This ain't no game, 
                 Miz Lampert.

                                                       SCOBIE
                                               We want that money -- now!

                                     DYLE
                              (forcefully)
                         Be quiet, all of you!

               The THREE MEN look at him, surprised by his tone.

                                     DYLE
                         And stop threatening that boy. He 
                         doesn't have the money. Mrs. Lampert 
                         doesn't either.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Then who does?

                                     DYLE
                         I don't know, Herman -- maybe you 
                         do.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Me?

                                     DYLE
                              (to TEX)
                         Or you --
                              (to GIDEON)
                         Or you --

                                     GIDEON, TEX & SCOBIE
                              (together)
                         That's the most ridiculous -- !
                         You gone loco?
                         Listen to the man!

                                     DYLE
                         Slowly. Suppose one of you found 
                         Charles here in Paris, followed him, 
                         cornered him on the train, threw him 
                         out the window and took the money.

                                     SCOBIE
                              (after a pause)
                         That's a crock! If one of us did 
                         that he wouldn't hang around here 
                         waiting for the other two to wise 
                         up.

                                     DYLE
                         But he'd have to. If he left he'd be 
                         admitting his guilt -- and the others 
                         would know what happened. Whoever it 
                         is has to wait here, pretending to 
                         look for the money, waiting for the 
                         rest of us to give up and go home. 
                         That's when he'll be safe and not a 
                         minute before.

               A pause as the THREE MEN look at one another.

                                     GIDEON
                         Up till now we always figured she 
                         had the money -- but you know so 
                         much about it, maybe you've got it.

                                     DYLE
                         Then what am I doing here? You didn't 
                         know anything about me -- I'm the 
                         only one who could have taken it and 
                         kept right on going.

                                     SCOBIE
                         He's just tryin' to throw us off! 
                         They've got it, I tell you! Why don't 
                         we search their rooms?

                                     DYLE
                              (exchanging looks 
                              with REGGIE)
                         It's all right with us --

                                     TEX
                              (rising)
                         What are we wastin' time for? Let's 
                         go.

                                     DYLE
                         And while we're waiting, we might as 
                         well go through yours.

                                     SCOBIE
                              (stopping)
                         Not my room!

                                     DYLE
                         What's wrong, Herman -- have you got 
                         something to hide?
                              (a pause, then smiling)
                         Then I take it there are no 
                         objections.

               The THREE MEN look at one another unhappily.

                                     DYLE
                         We'd better exchange keys. Here's 
                         mine.

                                     SCOBIE
                         I'll take that.

               He takes DYLE's key and gives DYLE his. GIDEON goes to REGGIE, 
               takes her key and gives her his own.

                                     TEX
                         Mine's in the door. Ariva durchy, 
                         y'all.

               The THREE MEN file out. DYLE and REGGIE exchange looks.

                                     DYLE
                         Come on -- let's get busy. Who gets 
                         your vote?

                                     REGGIE
                         Scobie -- he's the one that objected.

                                     DYLE
                              (handing her the boy)
                         He's all yours. I'll do Tex and 
                         Gideon. Take Jean-Louis with you -- 
                         and make sure you bolt the door from 
                         inside.

                                     REGGIE
                         Viens, Jean-Louis -- we're going to 
                         have a treasure hunt.

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                              (joining them)
                         Oh, la! If I find the treasure, will 
                         I win a prize?

                                     REGGIE
                              (to DYLE)
                         What should we give him?

                                     DYLE
                         How about $25,000? Or do you think 
                         it would spoil him?

               She smiles, takes JEAN-LOUIS' hand and leaves. DYLE turns to 
               survey TEX's room.

               He goes first to the drawer in the night table -- empty; and 
               the bed, looking in it and under it. Then he goes to the 
               desk and opens the drawers -- also empty. The bureau is next -- 
               he opens all three double drawers and they, too, are 
               completely empty. Frowning, he goes to the armoire and opens 
               it -- shelves and hanging bar are likewise bare.

               Then, CAMERA PANNING DOWN, he sees the only thing he's found 
               so far in the room -- a pair of fine cowboy boots.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT -- AIRLINES BAG. CAMERA PULLS BACK to include 
               GIDEON, staring down at it as it lies on the table in the 
               center of the room.

                                     GIDEON
                              (eyes on the bag)
                         Tex?

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Including TEX, busy going through the bureau. He looks up, 
               then joins GIDEON.

                                     TEX
                         What's that?

               GIDEON empties the contents of the bag on the table, then 
               starts examining the various items. He opens the wallet.

               INSERT - WALLET

               Inside, the initials "C.L." are printed in gold.

                                     TEX'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Charlie's stuff?

                                     GIDEON'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Looks like it.

               MED. SHOT -- TEX & GIDEON

                         Mebbe we'd better call Herman.

               GIDEON has put the wallet aside and now picks up the letter, 
               removing it from the envelope and reading it.

                                     GIDEON
                         What for? If it's not here, why bother 
                         him?

                                     TEX
                         And if it is?

                                     GIDEON
                              (a pause)
                         Why bother him?

               A broad grin from TEX. They continue going through the items 
               from the bag.

                                     TEX
                         You sure nuthin's missin'?

                                     GIDEON
                         No. The police have kindly provided 
                         us with a list.

               TEX takes the list, examines it, then folds it and puts it 
               in his pocket. They finish with the items from the bag.

                                     TEX
                         There sure ain't nothin' here worth 
                         no quarter of a million.

                                     GIDEON
                         Not unless we're blind.

                              (staring at GIDEON)
                         You think that mebbe we're fishin' 
                         the wrong stream?

                                     GIDEON
                         Meaning what?

                         vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.

                         Nachurly!

               INT. SCOBIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               REGGIE on the phone, JEAN-LOUIS standing by.

                                     REGGIE
                         -- He's all right, Sylvie, honestly. 
                         Just hurry up and get here.

               She hangs up and turns to JEAN-LOUIS.

                                     REGGIE
                         Come on, now -- if you wanted to 
                         hide something, where would you put 
                         it?

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         I know. I would bury it in the garden.

                                     REGGIE
                         Swell -- only this man doesn't have 
                         a garden.

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         Oh.
                              (Afterthought)
                         Neither do I.
                              (Seeing something)
                         Voilà!

                                     REGGIE
                         Voilà what?

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                              (pointing)
                         Up there! I would put it up there!

               REGGIE looks to where JEAN-LOUIS is pointing -- to the top 
               of the high armoire.

                                     REGGIE
                         You know something, cookie? Why not?

               Taking one of the straight chairs to the armoire, she stands 
               on it. Although she is still not high enough to see anything, 
               by standing on tip-toes she is able to reach with her hand 
               over the top and grope around blindly.

                                     REGGIE
                         I hope I don't find any little hairy 
                         things living up here -- wait! There 
                         is something! If I can just -- yes, 
                         I'm getting it -- a case of some 
                         sort -- it's heavy.

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                              (jumping up and down)
                         I found it! I found it!

                                     REGGIE
                         If you think you're getting credit 
                         for this, you're crazy.

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                              (ecstatic)
                         We won! We won!

               REGGIE has finally managed to pull down the case -- a 
               rectangular black bag about the size and shape of a trombone 
               case. As he climbs off the chair, JEAN-LOUIS suddenly runs 
               to the door, unbolts it and runs into the hall, CAMERA PANNING 
               with him.

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - THIRD LANDING - NIGHT

               As JEAN-LOUIS runs out into the hall, shouting.

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         We found it! We found it!

               DYLE is the first one to appear, coming out of GIDEON's room.

               TEX has also appeared from REGGIE's room, followed by GIDEON.

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         We found it!

               The THREE MEN rush by JEAN-LOUIS and squeeze simultaneously 
               into SCOBIE's room.

               INT. SCOBIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               As DYLE, TEX and GIDEON enter, REGGIE is placing the little 
               straight black chair to its original position. There is no 
               sign of the black case.

                                     DYLE
                         Reggie -- ? Did you find it?

                                     REGGIE
                         No.

                                     GIDEON
                         What do you mean, no?

                                     TEX
                         The kid said --

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                              (pointing atop the 
                              armoire)
                         Up there! It is up there!

                                     REGGIE
                         No, Jean-Louis.

               TEX grabs the chair and moves it to the armoire, climbing up 
               on it and grabbing the bag.

                                     REGGIE
                         It's nothing, I tell you!

               He brings it to the table as DYLE and GIDEON crowd around 
               him, anxious to see.

               CLOSE SHOTS (PANNING)

               The ring of faces, one at a time. TEX, his jaw muscles working 
               feverishly; DYLE, his eyes unblinking, a slight smile on his 
               lips; GIDEON, his mouth open greedily.

               GROUP SHOT

               As TEX finally springs the latches and opens the lid.

               CLOSE SHOT -- CASE

               Inside, neatly packed in velvet fittings, like the parts of 
               a musical instrument, are various portions of and attachments 
               for a metal artificial hand.

                                     TEX'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Jumpin' frejoles -- it's Herman's 
                         spare.

               GROUP SHOT -- THE THREE MEN

               As they stare at the case, surprised and just a little 
               embarrassed. Slowly TEX lowers the lid. The MEN avoid looking 
               at one another.

               WIDER ANGLE

               Including REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS by the door.

                         Where is he?

               The MEN look at one another.

                                     TEX
                         Hey, that's right!

                                     DYLE
                              (already running)
                         He's in my room.

               The THREE MEN hurry past REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS and out of 
               the door.

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         What is the matter?

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT

               DYLE, TEX, and GIDEON, followed by REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS 
               cross the hall to DYLE's room. DYLE turns the key which is 
               still in the door. He enters, followed by the others.

               INT. DYLE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               DYLE, TEX and GIDEON stand in the center of the room, looking 
               around. REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS wait in the open doorway. The 
               room looks like a cyclone hit the place, but there is no 
               sign of SCOBIE. The sound of running water can be heard coming 
               from behind the closed door to the bathroom and DYLE is the 
               first to notice the water beginning to leak out from under 
               the door.

                                     DYLE
                         Reggie -- you and the boy better 
                         wait here.

               INT. BATH -- NIGHT

               SCOBIE, still dressed in his raincoat, lies face up, his 
               head submerged in the filled tub, the water now pouring over 
               the edge. His face is distorted. DYLE's hand appears and 
               turns off the water.

                         Mine, either.

                              (considering the 
                              situation)
                         The police aren't going to like this 
                         one bit.

                              (helpful)
                         We could dry him off and take him 
                         down the hall to his own room.
                              (looking at the body)
                         He really doesn't look so bad.

                                     TEX
                         We could put him to bed 'n let one

                         always was strangers. Maybe now he'll 
                         meet up with his other hand someplace -- 
                         but I sure hope it ain't waitin' for 
                         him in Heaven.

               INT. SCOBIE'S ROOM -- DAY

               CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE. The dead man's eyes are open, his jaw 
               hanging, his head lying crazily on the pillow.

               CAMERA PULLS BACK to show him lying in bed, dressed in his 
               pajamas. CAMERA WHIRLS for a TIGHT CLOSE SHOT of a MAID, her 
               eyes widening as the realization that the man is dead strikes 
               her. Then she screams.

               INT. GRANDPIERRE'S OFFICE -- LATE AFTERNOON

               CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE. The policeman is apoplectic.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         No! No! No! No!

               CAMERA PULLS BACK to include, REGGIE, DYLE, TEX and GIDEON, 
               all sitting silently in the INSPECTOR's office.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         A man drowned in his bed -- 
                         impossible! And in his pajamas -- 
                         the second one in his pajamas --

                              his nose)
                         this nose tells me when you are lying --
                         it is never mistaken, not in twenty-
                         three years -- this nose will make 
                         me commissaire of police.

                         And yet you registered in Megeve as 
                         Mr. Joshua. Do you know it is against 
                         the law to register under an assumed 
                         name?

                         No, I didn't.

                         It's done in America all the time.

               GRANDPIERRE raps for silence on his desk. During the pause, 
               he looks into each face in turn.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         None of you will be permitted to 
                         leave Paris -- until this matter is 
                         cleared up. Only I warn you -- I 
                         will be watching. We use the 
                         guillotine in this country -- I have 
                         always suspected that the blade coming 
                         down causes no more than a slight 
                         tickling sensation on the back of 
                         the neck. It is only a guess, of 
                         course -- I hope none of you ever 
                         finds out for certain.

                         You're a big help. Can I have one of 
                         those?

               They have passed an ice-cream wagon on the corner of the 
               Pont au Double. DYLE shrugs.

                                     REGGIE
                              (to the VENDOR)
                         Vanille-chocolat.

               During the following, the VENDOR makes a double-decker cone 
               and hands it to REGGIE. DYLE pays and they resume their walk -- 
               all with no break in the dialogue.

                                     REGGIE
                         I think Tex did it.

                                     DYLE
                         Why?

                                     REGGIE
                         Because I really suspect Gideon -- 
                         and it is always the person you don't 
                         suspect.

                                     DYLE
                         Do women think it's feminine to be 
                         so illogical -- or can't they help 
                         it?

                                     REGGIE
                         What's so illogical about that?

                                     DYLE
                         A) It's always the person you don't 
                         suspect; B) that means you think 
                         it's Tex because you really suspect 
                         Gideon; therefore C) if you think 
                         it's Tex, it has to be someone else -- 
                         Gideon.

                                     REGGIE
                         Oh. I guess they just can't help it.

                                     DYLE
                         Who?

                                     REGGIE
                         Women. You know, I can't help feeling 
                         rather sorry for Scobie.
                              (a pause)
                         Wouldn't it be nice if we were like 
                         that?

                                     DYLE
                         What -- like Scobie?

                                     REGGIE
                         No -- Gene Kelly. Remember the way 
                         he danced down there next to the 
                         river in 'American in Paris' -- 
                         without a care in the world? This is 
                         good, want some?

               She offers him her cone, thrusting it forward with enough 
               force to dislodge the ice-cream. It lands right next to his 
               lapel, over his outside breast pocket.

                                     DYLE
                              (frowning)
                         I'd love some, thanks.

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm sorry.

               He pulls open the pocket with two sticky fingers and looks 
               inside, then shakes his head sadly at what he sees. REGGIE 
               still holds the empty cone, not knowing what to do with it.

               Seeing this, he takes it and sticks it into his pocket.

                                     DYLE
                         No sense messing up the streets.

                                     REGGIE
                         Alex --

                                     DYLE
                         Hm?

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm scared.

                                     DYLE
                         Don't worry, I'm not going to hit 
                         you.

                                     REGGIE
                         No, about Scobie, I mean. I can't 
                         think of any reason why he was killed.

               They resume walking.

                                     DYLE
                         Maybe somebody felt that four shares 
                         were too many --

                                     REGGIE
                         What makes you think that this 
                         somebody will be satisfied with three? 
                         He wants it all, Alex -- that means 
                         we're in his way, too.

                                     DYLE
                         Yes, I know.

                                     REGGIE
                         First your brother, then Charles, 
                         now Scobie -- we've got to do 
                         something! Any minute now we could 
                         be assassinated! Would you do anything 
                         like that?

                                     DYLE
                              (surprised)
                         What? Assassinate somebody?

                                     REGGIE
                         No --

                         to save the woman you love -- like 
                         Charles Laughton in 'The Hunchback 
                         of Notre Dame'?

                         Let me know what you want -- I'll 
                         pick a suit that matches.

               He goes into his room and she goes into hers.

               She enters, fixes her hair in the mirror, then goes to the 
               door connecting her room with DYLE's. She unlocks it, tries 
               to open it, but finds it locked. Disappointed, she knocks.

                         I wouldn't want to use that tub. 
                         Besides, I don't want to be alone.

               He sits down to take off his shoes, but is interrupted by 
               the sound of REGGIE screaming. He races for the connecting 
               door, pulls back the bolt and rushes in.

               He wheels as the door is slammed and REGGIE, who had been 
               standing behind it, locks it and pockets the key.

                                     REGGIE
                         Got you.

                         Did you ever hear the story of the 
                         boy who cried wolf?

               He goes to the door leading to the hall and finds that locked 
               as well. She smiles at him.

                                     DYLE

                         Reggie -- open the door.

                                     REGGIE
                         This is a ludicrous situation. There 
                         must be dozens of men dying to use 
                         my shower.

                         Then I suggest you call one of them.

                         I dare you.

               DYLE looks at her, then sits down and starts to remove his 
               shoes.

                                     REGGIE

                         What are you doing?

                                     DYLE
                         Have you ever heard of anyone taking 
                         a shower with his shoes on?
                              (to himself)
                         What a nut.

               Shoes off, DYLE starts for the bathroom, humming.

                         I usually sing a medley of old

               Testing the water with his hand, he now steps in fully 
               dressed. REGGIE can't believe her eyes. She goes to the open

               He takes the soap and begins washing as if he were washing 
               himself without the suit.

                         will help protect its shape."

               He flicks a little water in her face, then takes the nail-
               brush and scrubs his watch and watch-band. He holds up his 
               wrist so she can see the watch.

                                     REGGIE
                              (on the phone)
                         Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm 
                         listening.

               INT. BARTHOLOMEW'S APARTMENT -- LATE AFTERNOON

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                              (on the phone)
                         I told them what you said -- about 
                         this man being Carson Dyle's brother. 
                         I asked them what they knew about it 
                         and they told me -- you're not gonna 
                         like this, Mrs. Lampert -- they told 
                         me Carson Dyle has no brother.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON

               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE on the phone, looking like the rug has 
               been pulled out from under her.

                                     REGGIE
                              (pause, quietly)
                         Are you sure there's no mistake?

               INT. BARTHOLOMEW'S APARTMENT -- LATE AFTERNOON

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                              (on the phone)
                         None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- 
                         be careful.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON

               REGGIE slowly lowers the phone to its cradle, a worried 
               expression on her face. Then the bathroom door opens and 
               DYLE appears dressed in a large bath towel. Her back is to 
               him.

                                     DYLE
                         I left all my drip-dry dripping -- 
                         is it all right?

               She doesn't answer.

                                     DYLE
                         Reggie -- is something wrong?

               She shakes her head.

                                     DYLE
                         You're probably weak from hunger. 
                         You've only had five meals today. 
                         Hurry up and we'll go out.

               She turns and looks at him.

                                     REGGIE
                         Do you mind if we go someplace 
                         crowded? I -- I feel like lots of 
                         people tonight.

               EXT. SEINE - BÂTEAU MOUCHE -- DUSK

               The large motor launch, moving along the river, gaily ablaze 
               with lights.

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND DYLE (PROCESS)

               At a table for two by the rail, the city slowly passing in 
               the b.g.

                                     DYLE
                         Reggie -- you haven't spoken a word 
                         in twenty minutes.

                                     REGGIE
                         I keep thinking about Charles and 
                         Scobie -- and the one who's going to 
                         be next -- me?

                                     DYLE
                         Nothing's going to happen to you 
                         while I'm around -- I want you to 
                         believe that.

                                     REGGIE
                         How can I believe it when you don't 
                         even know who the killer is? I've 
                         got that right, haven't I? You don't 
                         know who did it.

                                     DYLE
                         No -- not yet.

                                     REGGIE
                         But then if we sit back and wait, 
                         the field should start narrowing 
                         down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left 
                         alive at the end will pretty well 
                         have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't 
                         you say so?

                                     DYLE
                         Are you trying to say that I might 
                         have killed Charles and Scobie?

               She doesn't answer.

                                     DYLE
                         What do I have to do to satisfy you -- 
                         become the next victim?

                                     REGGIE
                         It's a start, anyway.

                                     DYLE
                         I don't understand you at all -- one 
                         minute you're chasing me around the 
                         shower room and the next you're 
                         accusing me of murder.

                                     REGGIE
                         Carson Dyle didn't have a brother.

               WIDER ANGLE

               She rises from the table and walks away. DYLE hesitates a 
               moment, then follows.

                                     DYLE
                         I can explain if you'll just listen. 
                         Will you listen?

                                     REGGIE
                              (looking at the river)
                         I can't very well leave without a 
                         pair of water wings.

                                     DYLE
                         Okay. Then get set for the story of 
                         my life -- not that it would ever 
                         make the best-seller list.

                                     REGGIE
                         Fiction or non-fiction?

                                     DYLE
                         Why don't you shut up!

                                     REGGIE
                         Well!

                                     DYLE
                         Are you going to listen?

                                     REGGIE
                         Go on.

                                     DYLE
                         After I graduated college I was all 
                         set to go into my father business. 
                         Umbrella frames -- that's what he 
                         made. It was a sensible business, I 
                         suppose, but I didn't have the sense 
                         to be interested in anything sensible.

                                     REGGIE
                         I suppose all this is leading 
                         somewhere?

                                     DYLE
                         It led me away from umbrella frames, 
                         for one thing. But that left me 
                         without any honest means of support.

                                     REGGIE
                         What do you mean?

                                     DYLE
                         When a man has no profession except 
                         the one he loathes, what's left? I 
                         began looking for people with more 
                         money than they'd ever need -- 
                         including some they'd barely miss.

                                     REGGIE
                              (astonished)
                         You mean, you're a thief?

                                     DYLE
                         Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd 
                         have chosen, but I suppose it captures 
                         the spirit of the thing.

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't believe it.

                                     DYLE
                         Well, I can't really blame you -- 
                         not now.

                                     REGGIE
                         But I do believe it -- that's what I 
                         don't believe. So it's goodbye 
                         Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter 
                         Joshua.

                                     DYLE
                         Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield.

                                     REGGIE
                         Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you 
                         realize you've had three names in 
                         the past two days? I don't even know 
                         who I'm talking to any more.

                                     DYLE
                              (now called ADAM)
                         The man's the same, even if the name 
                         isn't.

                                     REGGIE
                         No -- he's not the same. Alexander 
                         Dyle was interested in clearing up 
                         his brother's death. Adam Canfield 
                         is a crook. And with all the 
                         advantages you've got -- brains, 
                         charm, education, a handsome face --

                                     ADAM
                         Oh, come on!

                                     REGGIE
                         -- there has to be a darn good reason 
                         for living the way you do. I want to 
                         know what it is.

                                     ADAM
                         It's simple. I like what I do -- I 
                         enjoy doing it. There aren't many 
                         men who love their work as much as I 
                         do. Look around some time.

                                     REGGIE
                         Is there a Mrs. Canfield?

                                     ADAM
                         Yes, but --

                                     ADAM AND REGGIE
                              (together)
                         -- we're divorced.

                                     ADAM
                         Right. Now go eat your dinner.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               They walk back to the table, where a WAITER is busy putting 
               food on it, mostly on REGGIE's side.

                                     REGGIE
                              (miserably)
                         I could eat a horse.

                                     ADAM
                              (looking at all the 
                              food)
                         I think that's what you ordered.

                                     REGGIE
                         Don't you dare to be civil with me!  
                         All this time you were leading me on --

                                     ADAM
                         How was I leading you on?

                                     REGGIE
                         All that marvelous rejection -- you 
                         knew I couldn't resist it. Now it 
                         turns out you were only interested 
                         in the money.

                                     ADAM
                         That's right.

                                     REGGIE (HURT)
                         Oh!

                                     ADAM
                         What would you like me to say -- 
                         that a pretty girl with an outrageous 
                         manner means more to an old pro like 
                         me than a quarter of a million 
                         dollars?

                                     REGGIE
                         No -- I guess not.

                                     ADAM
                         It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.

                                     REGGIE
                         What?

                                     ADAM
                         Don't you know I'm having a tough 
                         time keeping my eyes off of you?

               REGGIE reacts in surprise.

                                     ADAM
                         Oh, you should see your face.

                                     REGGIE
                         What about it?

                                     ADAM
                              (taking her hand, 
                              nicely)
                         It's lovely.

               She looks at him with happy amazement, then pushes her plate 
               away.

                                     ADAM
                         What's the matter?

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm not hungry -- isn't it glorious?

               The lights go out.

                                     REGGIE
                              (alarmed)
                         Adam!

                                     ADAM
                         It's all right -- look.

               EXT. SEINE BÂTEAU MOUCHE -- NIGHT

               A searchlight near the boat's bridge has gone on and now 
               begins sweeping the river banks. On benches by the water's 
               edge, lovers are surprised by the bright light which suddenly 
               and without warning discovers them in various attitudes of 
               mutual affection. Some are embarrassed, some are amused and 
               some (the most intimate) damn annoyed. One even shakes his 
               fist at the light.

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND ADAM

               Who, like everyone else, leave the table and stand together 
               at the rail watching.

                                     REGGIE
                         You don't look so bad in this light.

                                     ADAM
                         Why do you think I brought you here?

                                     REGGIE
                              (indicating the lovers)
                         I thought maybe you wanted me to see 
                         the kind of work the competition was 
                         turning out.

                                     ADAM
                         Pretty good, huh? I taught them 
                         everything they do.

                                     REGGIE
                         Oh? Did they do that sort of thing 
                         way back in your day?

                                     ADAM
                         How do you think I got here?

               She rises on tip-toes and kisses him gently; his only reaction 
               is to look at her.

                                     REGGIE
                         Aren't you allowed to kiss back?

                                     ADAM
                         No. The doctor said it would be bad 
                         for my -- thermostat.

               She kisses him again. He responds a little better.

                                     ADAM
                         When you come on, you really come 
                         on.

                                     REGGIE
                         Well -- come on.

               She starts to kiss him again, but he stops her.

                                     REGGIE
                         I know why you're not taken -- no 
                         one can catch up with you.

                                     ADAM
                         Relax -- you're gaining.

               DELETED

               INT. GIDEON'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               MED. SHOT -- GIDEON. As he sits bolt upright in bed, startled.

               The room is dark and the phone is ringing. He switches on 
               the lamp, looks at the clock (it reads 3:30) and shakes his 
               head before picking up the receiver.

                                     GIDEON
                         Huh? You must be crazy -- it's three-
                         thirty in the morning -- you mean 
                         now?  -- all right -- I'll be down 
                         in a minute.

               He hangs up, swings his feet out of bed and spears his 
               slippers, reaching for his robe at the same time. Then he 
               shuffles sleepily to the door.

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- THIRD FLOOR LANDING -- NIGHT

               As GIDEON comes out of his room and goes to the elevator.

               The cage is there. He opens the door and enters.

               INT. ELEVATOR -- NIGHT

               GIDEON closes the sliding grill and presses a button. The 
               cage starts down. GIDEON begins sneezing. Suddenly the 
               elevator stops between floors and the lights go out.

                                     GIDEON
                         Hey! Turn on the lights!

               Just as suddenly the lights go back on and the elevator starts 
               moving down again. GIDEON shakes his head and leans back, 
               whistling again. The cage comes to his floor and starts past 
               it. Seeing this, GIDEON looks confused.

               INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT

               The NIGHT PORTER is asleep behind the desk. The elevator, 
               GIDEON inside, keeps coming down. It passes the lobby level 
               and keeps right on going, toward the basement.

                                     GIDEON
                         Hey! How do you stop this thing?

               The elevator passes out of sight, still going down. There is 
               a silence as the motor stops, and then a series of sneezes 
               that ends with a terrifying shriek. The NIGHT PORTER, rudely 
               awakened, runs to the elevator shaft, his shoes squeaking 
               horribly. He looks up, sees nothing, then looks down. He 
               presses the call button and the motor starts.

               An instant later the cage appears and stops. The NIGHT PORTER 
               opens the gate, pulls back the grill and the CAMERA RUSHES 
               PAST him to pick up GIDEON. His body is sitting on the floor 
               of the cage, its grotesque sprawling attitude resembling a 
               puppet's with its strings cut. Except that GIDEON has no 
               strings to cut -- only a throat. From ear to ear.

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE. He is now doubly apoplectic.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         Three of them -- all in their pajamas! 
                         C'est ridicule! What is it, some new 
                         American fad?

               CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal REGGIE and ADAM, in their 
               bathrobes.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         And now your friend -- the one from 
                         Texas -- he has disappeared -- checked 
                         out -- pouf! into thin air! Where is 
                         he?

                                     ADAM
                         I don't know.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         Madame?

               REGGIE shrugs.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         Tell me, Mr. Dyle -- where were you 
                         at three-thirty?

                                     ADAM
                         In my room, asleep.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         And you, Mrs. Lampert?

                                     REGGIE
                         I was, too.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         In Mr. Dyle's room?

                                     REGGIE
                              (bitterly)
                         No -- in my room.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                              (pause, lighting cigar)
                         It stands to reason you are telling 
                         the truth -- for why would you invent 
                         such a ridiculous story?

               REGGIE and ADAM exchange looks.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         And if I were you, I would not stay 
                         in my pajamas. Good night.

               GRANDPIERRE turns and leaves. REGGIE and ADAM start down the 
               hall toward their own rooms.

                                     ADAM
                         That wraps it up -- Tex has the money. 
                         Go back to bed -- I'll let you know 
                         when I've found him.

                                     REGGIE
                         You're going to look for him -- now?

                                     ADAM
                         If the police find him first they're 
                         not very likely to turn over a quarter 
                         of a million dollars to us, are they?

                                     REGGIE
                         Adam --

                                     ADAM
                         There's no time -- I'll call you in 
                         the morning.

               ADAM disappears into his own room.

               INT. ADAM'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               As ADAM enters, going to the closet to remove his suit.

               The phone rings. He answers it.

                                     ADAM
                         Yes?

               INT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT -- TEX. As he speaks on the phone.

                                     TEX
                         Now Dyle, you listen to me -- my 
                         mama didn't raise no stupid children. 
                         I know who's got the money 'n I ain't 
                         disappearing till I got my share -- 
                         'n' my share's growin' a whole lot 
                         bigger ev'ry day.

               INT. ADAM'S ROOM -- NIGHT

                                     ADAM
                              (on the phone)
                         Where are you, ol' buddy?

               INT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT

                                     TEX
                              (on the phone)
                              (laughs)
                         I'll tell you what, fella -- you 
                         want t' find me, you jus' turn 'round --
                         from now on I'll be right behind 
                         you.
                              (hangs up)

               INT. ADAM'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               ADAM, before hanging up, reflects on TEX's words, then looks 
               behind him. Smiling softly, he hangs up the phone and starts 
               for REGGIE's door.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               REGGIE slips back into her robe and goes to the connecting 
               door.

                                     REGGIE
                         What is it?

                                     ADAM
                         Open up.

               She undoes the bolt and opens the door. ADAM enters.

                                     ADAM
                         I think we were wrong about Tex having 
                         the money.

                                     REGGIE
                         Why?

                                     ADAM
                         I just heard from him -- he's still 
                         hungry. That means killing Gideon 
                         didn't get it for him -- so he's 
                         narrowed it down to us. You've got 
                         it.

                                     REGGIE
                         I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --

                                     ADAM
                         Where's that airlines bag?

                                     REGGIE
                         Lord, you're stubborn.

                                     ADAM
                         I sure am. Get it.

               She goes to the closet and gets the bag.

                                     ADAM
                         Charles must have had the money with 
                         him on the train, and Tex missed it.

               He takes the bag to the bed where he dumps out the contents.

                                     REGGIE
                         But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's 
                         been through that bag. Somebody would 
                         have seen it.

                                     ADAM
                         Let's look anyway.

                                     REGGIE
                         Lord, you're stubborn.

                                     ADAM
                         I mean, it's there, Reggie. If only 
                         we could see it. We're looking at it 
                         right now.

                                     ADAM'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Something on that bed is worth a 
                         quarter of a million dollars.

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Yes, but what?

                                     ADAM'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         I don't know -- I just don't know.

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND ADAM

               As ADAM begins to examine the items one by one.

                                     ADAM
                         Electric razor -- comb -- steamship 
                         ticket -- fountain pen -- four 
                         passports -- toothbrush -- wallet --
                              (He goes through the 
                              wallet, finds nothing)
                         key -- what about that?

                                     REGGIE
                         To the apartment -- it matches mine 
                         perfectly.

                                     ADAM
                         The letter --

               He takes it out of the envelope and takes out his glasses 
               before reading it.

                                     REGGIE
                         I'll bet you don't really need those.

               He hands her the glasses and she looks through them.

                                     REGGIE
                         You need them.
                              (She hands them back)
                          

                                     ADAM
                              (reading the letter)
                         It still doesn't make sense, but it 
                         isn't worth any quarter of a million 
                         either. Have we forgotten anything?

                                     REGGIE
                         The tooth powder. Wait a minute -- 
                         could you recognize heroin just by 
                         tasting it?

               He shakes some powder into his hand and tastes it. REGGIE 
               watches expectantly.

                                     ADAM
                         Heroin -- peppermint-flavored heroin.

                                     REGGIE
                         Well, I guess that's it -- dead end.

                                     ADAM
                         Go to bed. You've got to be at work 
                         in the morning. There's nothing more 
                         we can do tonight.

                                     REGGIE
                              (pause)
                         I love you, Adam.

                                     ADAM
                         Yes, you told me.

                                     REGGIE
                         No -- last time I said "I love you, 
                         Alex."

               The ultra-modern glass and concrete structure behind the 
               Ecole Militaire.

               INT. UNESCO CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

               SEVERAL DELEGATES identified by little plaques in front of 
               them listing their respective nations, and their AIDES, sit 
               around the large table. They are all wearing earphones.

               The ITALIAN DELEGATE is speaking.

                                     ITALIAN DELEGATE
                         -- di conseguenza, il Governo Italiano 
                         è decisamente a favore per 
                         l'incoraggiamento, in accordo con le 
                         tradizioni etniche rispettive delle 
                         culture basilari dei passi in via di 
                         sviluppo. Per esempio, pregare i 
                         Vietnamiti di aggiungere alle loro 
                         risaie ed ai loro campi di soja 
                         tradizionali una raccolta di semola, 
                         non solo sconvolgerebbe le loro 
                         secolari tradizioni ma, oltre tutto, 
                         e questo è molto importante per il 
                         Governo che io ho l'onore di 
                         rappresentare disturberebbe 
                         l'esportazione delle derrate farinose 
                         italiane in questa parte del mondo. 
                         Signori Delegati vi ringrazio della 
                         vostra attenzione.

               INT. REGGIE'S BOOTH -- DAY

               REGGIE, wearing her headset, is talking with SYLVIE.

                                     REGGIE
                         I hope Jean-Louis understands about 
                         last night -- it's just not safe for 
                         him to be around me right now.

                                     SYLVIE
                         Don't be silly -- he would not do 
                         anything. He is not yet old enough 
                         to be interested in girls. He says 
                         collecting stamps is much more 
                         satisfying to a man of his age.

                                     REGGIE
                         Hold it -- Italy just finished. 
                         They're recognizing Great Britain.

                                     SYLVIE
                         Oh la vache!

               SYLVIE jumps up and rushes next door into her booth, shutting 
               the door after her.

               INT. CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

               The BRITISH DELEGATE rises to speak, continuing through the 
               next scene.

                                     BRITISH DELEGATE
                         Mr. Chairman, fellow delegates -- my 
                         distinguished colleague from Italy. 
                         Her Majesty's delegation has listened 
                         with great patience to the Southern 
                         European position on this problem, 
                         and while we find it charmingly 
                         stated, we cannot possibly agree 
                         with its content. In 1937, in the 
                         British colonies of Kenya, Uganda 
                         and Tanganyika -- and, if I'm not 
                         mistaken, more or less in Somaliland -- 
                         a programme of crop rotation was 
                         instituted vis-à-vis arable land 
                         which had never before known the 
                         plough, beginning before the soil 
                         was able to know the sort of fatigue 
                         now plaguing most of Western Europe. 
                         In 1937, therefore, Her Majesty's 
                         Government -- at that time His 
                         Majesty's Government -- was able to 
                         properly assay the situation. We 
                         therefore oppose the resolution.

               INT. REGGIE'S BOOTH -- DAY

               The door from the hall opens and ADAM enters.

                                     ADAM
                         Reggie -- I think I've found --
                              (stopping)
                         are you on?

                                     REGGIE
                         No, it's all right. What's wrong, 
                         Adam?

                                     ADAM
                         Nothing's wrong. I think I found 
                         something. I was snooping around 
                         Tex's room and I found this in the 
                         waste basket. I've stuck it back 
                         together.

               He hands her a paper.

               INSERT -- POLICE RECEIPT

               The one GRANDPIERRE gave REGGIE. It has been torn in half 
               and scotch-taped back together.

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         It's the receipt Inspector Grandpierre 
                         gave me -- for Charles's things. I 
                         don't see how that's going to --

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND ADAM

                                     ADAM
                         You didn't look. Last night, when we 
                         went through the airlines bag, 
                         something was missing. See -- ?
                              (showing her the list)
                         "One agenda." It wasn't there.

                                     REGGIE
                         You're right. I remember Grandpierre 
                         looking through it. But there was 
                         nothing in it -- at least, nothing 
                         that the police thought was very 
                         important.

                                     ADAM
                         Can you remember anything at all?

                                     REGGIE
                         Grandpierre asked me about an 
                         appointment Charles had -- on the 
                         day he was killed.

                                     ADAM
                         With whom? Where?

                                     REGGIE
                         I think it only said where -- but I 
                         can't --

                                     ADAM
                         Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- 
                         it may be what we're looking for.

                                     REGGIE
                         That money's not ours, Adam -- if we 
                         keep it, we'll be breaking the law.

                                     ADAM
                         Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's 
                         no law against stealing stolen money.

                                     REGGIE
                         Of course there is!

                                     ADAM
                         There is? Well, I can't say I think 
                         very much of a silly law like that. 
                         Think, Reggie -- please think -- 
                         what was written in Charles' notebook?

                                     REGGIE
                         Well -- it was a place -- a street 
                         corner, I think. But I don't --
                              (hearing something 
                              through her earpiece)
                         Hold it. I'm on.

               She turns back to the conference, flips a switch and starts 
               speaking into her headset.

                         five -- come on!

               MED. SHOT -- CONFERENCE TABLE

               From REGGIE'S and ADAM'S ANGLE. All the DELEGATES and their 
               AIDES suddenly turn, surprised, and look at CAMERA.

               REVERSE SHOT -- WINDOW

               From the DELEGATE'S ANGLE. Inside the booth, REGGIE and ADAM 
               can be seen heading for the door in a hurry.

               TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND ADAM

               By the locked gate.

                                     REGGIE
                         Now what?

                                     ADAM
                         Five o'clock -- Thursday -- the Garden -- 
                         it's got to be something around here.

                                     REGGIE
                         But Charles' appointment was last 
                         week, not --

                                     ADAM
                         I know, but this is all we've got 
                         left.

                                     REGGIE
                         Well, you're right there. Ten minutes 
                         ago I had a job.

                                     ADAM
                         Stop grousing. If we find the money 
                         I'll buy you an international 
                         conference all your own. Now start 
                         looking. You take this side and I'll 
                         poke around over there.

               VARIOUS SHOTS -- WHAT THEY SEE

               A quick succession of shots showing:

               1. Children's Merry-go-round 2. Rond Point de Champs-Elysées 
               with fountains playing 3. Children's swings 4. Restaurant 
               Laurent 5. Balloon salesman

               EXT. FOUNTAIN -- LATE AFTERNOON

               ADAM stands by the large fountain, staring off at something 
               as REGGIE joins him.

                                     REGGIE
                         It's hopeless -- I don't even know 
                         what we're looking for.

                                     ADAM
                         It's all right -- I don't think Tex 
                         does, either.

                                     REGGIE
                         Tex? You mean he's here, too?

                                     ADAM
                         Look.

               MED. SHOT -- TEX

               He stands near the merry-go-round, looking at something in 
               his hand: Charles' agenda. Now he closes it and moves off, 
               disappearing behind a hedge.

               TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND ADAM

                                     ADAM
                         I'd better see what he's up to.  
                         Stay here -- I won't be long.

               ADAM starts off.

                                     REGGIE
                              (concerned)
                         Be careful, Adam -- please. He's 
                         already killed three men.

               DELETED

               EXT. RUE GABRIEL -- LATE AFTERNOON

               Between the curb and the Jardin, several temporary wooden 
               booths have been set up. They have collected quite a CROWD. 
               Into this area comes TEX, followed at a safe distance by 
               ADAM. Suddenly TEX stops.

               DELETED

               CLOSE SHOT -- TEX

               As he stares wide-eyed at something.

               CLOSE SHOT -- STAMPS

               Neatly displayed on a counter of one of the booths.

               CLOSE SHOT -- TEX

               As he wheels to look at another booth.

               CLOSE SHOT -- MORE STAMPS

               In another arrangement.

               CLOSE SHOT -- TEX

               He turns crazily to look at another booth, then another.

               CLOSE SHOT -- EVEN MORE STAMPS

               Various FLASH SHOTS of stamps of all sizes, shapes and colors.

               MED. SHOT -- TEX

               As he understands. He turns to rush off and bumps smack into 
               ADAM. TEX is startled.

                                     TEX
                         Sorry, fella --

               He rushes off past ADAM, who watches him for a moment, 
               confused, then turns toward the booth, not yet having seen 
               the stamps.

               MED. SHOT -- BOOTH

               From ADAM's angle. There are one or two persons standing at 
               the booth. CAMERA ZOOMS in on the display of stamps.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ADAM

                                     ADAM
                              (amazed)
                         The letter.

               He quickly turns to find TEX.

               MED. SHOT -- TEX

               As he hops into the back of a TAXI and it pulls away from 
               the curb. ADAM runs toward another TAXI.

                                     ADAM
                         Taxi! -- Taxi!

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- THIRD FLOOR LANDING -- LATE AFTERNOON

               As ADAM comes up the stairs and goes to REGGIE's door.

               Whipping out his gun, he flings open the door.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON

               From ADAM's angle. TEX sits in the armchair, staring at 
               CAMERA. Next to him is the airlines bag, its contents dumped 
               on the floor.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Including ADAM as he enters, his gun trained on TEX. Without 
               speaking he goes to the airlines bag, then stoops down to go 
               through the spilled contents, keeping one eye all the time 
               on TEX. But he can't find what he's looking for.

                                     ADAM
                              (quietly)
                         All right -- where's the letter?

                                     TEX
                         The letter? The letter ain't worth 
                         nuthin'.

                                     ADAM
                         You know what I mean -- the envelope 
                         with the stamps. I want it.

                                     TEX
                              (a pause, then 
                              beginning to laugh)
                         You greenhorn -- you half-witted, 
                         thick-skulled, hare-brained, 
                         greenhorn! They wuz both too smart 
                         for us!

                         What are you talking about?

                                     TEX
                         First her husband, now her -- she 
                         hoodwinked you! She batted all them 
                         big eyes and you went 'n fell for it - 
                         like a egg from a tall chicken!

                         You want? Here -- it's yours!

               ADAM takes it and looks at it.

               INSERT -- ENVELOPE

               The corner containing the stamps is missing, torn off.

               MED. SHOT -- ADAM AND TEX

               TEX sees the expression on ADAM's face and begins laughing, 
               hysterically.

                                     TEX
                         Look at you! Horn-swoggled by a purty 
                         face 'n all them sweet words! You

                         You greenhorn! You block-headed 
                         jackass! You clod -- you booby -- 
                         you nincompoop -- !

               EXT. ROND POINT -- LATE AFTERNOON

               REGGIE is looking around for ADAM. She sees something across 
               the street. CAMERA SPINS AROUND to discover SYLVIE, sitting 
               alone on a bench near the stamp market, reading a newspaper.

               MED. SHOT -- SYLVIE

               As REGGIE approaches her.

                                     REGGIE
                         Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?

                                     SYLVIE
                              (looking up)
                         Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for 
                         Jean-Louis.

                                     REGGIE
                              (looking around)
                         What's he up to?

                                     SYLVIE
                         He was so excited -- when he got the 
                         stamps you gave him this morning. He 
                         said he had never seen any like them.

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm glad. But what's all this?

                                     SYLVIE
                         The stamp market, of course -- it is 
                         here every Thursday afternoon. This 
                         is where Jean-Louis trades his --

                              (as it dawns)
                         Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? 
                         Sylvie -- we've got to find him!

                                     SYLVIE
                         What's the matter, chérie?

                                     REGGIE
                         Those stamps -- they're worth a 
                         fortune!

                                     SYLVIE
                              (jumping up)
                         What?

                                     REGGIE
                         A fortune! Hurry -- we've got to 
                         find him!

               They rush off into the market.

               TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND SYLVIE

               As they stop among the booths, looking around.

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't see him.

                                     SYLVIE
                         We will separate -- you look over 
                         there.

               They go off in opposite directions.

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE

               As she hurries along a row of stalls, weaving around small 
               groups of MEN standing together, showing each other stamps.

               MED. SHOT -- SYLVIE

               Searching in another section of the market.

                              (calling)
                         Jean-Louis -- ?

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE

               Spotting a BOY, she runs to him and spins him around.

                                     REGGIE
                         Jean-Louis!

               But it isn't.

               MED. SHOT -- SYLVIE

               Looking everywhere. Suddenly she sees something.

               CLOSE SHOT -- GROUP OF MEN -- THEIR LEGS

               Only a small boy's elbow and part of his arm show, the rest 
               hidden by all the legs.

               MED. SHOT -- SYLVIE

               She recognizes him from these fragments.

                                     SYLVIE
                         Jean-Louis!

               She rushes to him, CAMERA PANNING WITH HER. JEAN-LOUIS stands 
               looking at some stamps. SYLVIE grabs him.

                                     SYLVIE
                         Jean-Louis -- les timbrés -- où sont-
                         ils?

               Smiling, JEAN-LOUIS holds up an enormous sack of assorted 
               stamps -- hundreds of them.

                                     SYLVIE
                         Oh, zut!
                              (calling)
                         Reggie -- Reggie -- !

               REGGIE runs up and joins them.

                                     REGGIE
                         Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you 
                         have -- !
                              (spotting the sack of 
                              stamps)
                         What's that?

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         A man traded with me -- all those 
                         for only four.

                                     REGGIE
                         Oh no! What man, Jean-Louis --  where?

               JEAN-LOUIS looks in one direction, then in the other, trying 
               to remember.

                                     SYLVIE
                         Vite, mon ange -- vite!

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         Là bas -- Monsieur Félix.

               They all run off down the line of booths. JEAN-LOUIS stops 
               and points off.

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         Il est là!

                         But he is gone.

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do 
                         you know where this Monsieur Félix 
                         lives?

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         No -- but I will ask.

               He goes to the closest booth and shakes the coat sleeve of 
               the proprietor.

                                     JEAN-LOUIS

                         Monsieur Félix, où habite-il?

                         Merci, Monsieur Théophile.

               Before he can finish, SYLVIE, who has heard THÉOPHILE, has

               right alongside.

               INT. FÉLIX'S ROOM -- DUSK

               A bare, unkempt little room. FÉLIX, a man in his sixties, 
               sits at a table, smoking a pipe. There are stamps and albums 
               everywhere. He holds a magnifying glass in his hand, busy 
               studying something on the table. There is a KNOCK. He looks 
               up. Another KNOCK.

                                     FÉLIX
                         Entrez.

               The door opens and REGGIE, followed by SYLVIE and JEAN-LOUIS, 
               enters.

                                     REGGIE
                         Monsieur Félix -- ?

                              (without looking up)
                         I was expecting you. You are American 
                         too, of course.

                                     REGGIE
                              (looking at SYLVIE)
                         Yes.

                                     FÉLIX
                         The man who bought them last week 
                         was American. I did not see him but 
                         I heard. I knew you would come.

               He gestures for REGGIE to come closer. Together with SYLVIE 
               and JEAN-LOUIS, she goes to the table and looks at the stamps.

                         Look at them, Madame.

               INSERT -- STAMPS

               Four of them -- a red, a yellow, a blue, and a green, still 
               attached to the portion of the torn envelope.

                         Have you ever, in your entire life, 
                         seen anything so beautiful?

                         I know them as one knows his own 
                         face, even though I have never seen 
                         them. This yellow one -- a Swedish 
                         four shilling -- called 'De Gula 
                         Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.

                         I'm afraid it is important.

                         there are only seven left. In 1894 
                         the owner of one was murdered by a

               As REGGIE comes hurrying up the stairs. She goes first to

               MED. SHOT -- TEX

               His dead body lies on the floor, the wrists of his extended 
               arms tied to the leg of the bed, his ankles to the steam 
               radiator. And tied around his head is a plastic, transparent 
               bag, inside of which the suffocated man's face, the eyes 
               bulging against the plastic clinging tight to his features, 
               can be seen all too clearly. REGGIE enters the shot, bending 
               down to see if he's alive. Then she sees something beside 
               his hands near the leg of the bed.

               CLOSE SHOT -- CARPET

               With his dying effort, TEX has traced a name against the 
               grain of the maroon carpet -- 'DYLE.'

                         word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the 
                         murderer I tell you -- he's the only

                         as soon as you can get there. Hurry, 
                         Mrs. Lampert.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

                                     REGGIE
                              (on the phone)
                         Yes, I'm leaving now -- goodbye.

               She hangs up, looks briefly at TEX's body, shudders, then 
               hurries to the door.

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE leaves her room and goes to the elevator. She 
               presses the button, then notices it is in use. She goes to 
               the stairs and starts down.

               INT. HOTEL STAIRCASE -- NIGHT

               Between the landings. The stairs curve around the open 
               elevator shaft. As REGGIE comes down the stairs, the cage 
               rises into view. Inside is ADAM. For a moment, she stops and 
               their eyes meet.

                                     ADAM
                         Reggie -- the stamps -- what've you 
                         done with --?

               REGGIE starts running downstairs.

                                     ADAM
                         Where are you going? Wait!

               ADAM pushes the emergency stop button and then starts the 
               cage down.

                                     ADAM
                         Reggie!

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- SECOND LANDING -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE comes off the stairs, passes the elevator gate and 
               starts down toward the lobby, the cage a few feet behind 
               her.

                                     ADAM
                         Reggie!

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- FIRST LANDING -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE continues to run.

               INT. HOTEL STAIRWAY -- NIGHT

               Between the first landing and the lobby. REGGIE running, the 
               elevator following.

                                     ADAM
                         Reggie -- stop!

                                     REGGIE
                         Why? So you can kill me too? Tex is 
                         dead, I've seen him! He said Dyle 
                         did it!

                                     ADAM
                         I'm not Dyle -- you know that!

                                     REGGIE
                         But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- 
                         !

                                     ADAM
                         Don't be an idiot!

               INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT

               REGGIE reaches the lobby first and, without hesitation, races 
               toward the front door and out. The confused hotel MANAGER 
               behind the desk can only stare in surprise. The elevator, 
               ADAM inside, has not yet reached the bottom.

                                     ADAM
                         Reggie -- ! I want those stamps!

               EXT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT

               A taxi stands by the curb. REGGIE leaves the hotel and runs 
               to it.

                                     REGGIE
                              (indicating the 
                              direction)
                         Palais Royal -- vite!

               Calmly, the DRIVER points to the little printed sign on his 
               windshield reading "ITALIE."

                                     DRIVER
                              (pointing the other 
                              way)
                         Porte d'Italie, moi.

                                     REGGIE
                         Mais c'est très vite! On veut me 
                         teur!

                                     DRIVER
                              (shaking his head)
                         Italie.

               She looks around and sees ADAM come out of the hotel and 
               straight toward her. She turns and runs off toward the Place 
               St. Michel.

               EXT. PLACE ST. MICHEL -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE comes to the corner. She stops, sees the Métro 
               station ("St. Michel") and rushes to it, scampering down the 
               stairs. ADAM is behind her.

               INT. ST. MICHEL MÉTRO STATION -- NIGHT

               REGGIE comes flying down the stairs and runs past the ticket 
               booth, fishing in her bag for her carnet (booklet of tickets), 
               casting a quick look behind her. CAMERA PANS QUICKLY TO ADAM 
               just coming off the stairs, who runs after her.

               DELETED

               INT. MÉTRO TICKET GATE -- NIGHT

               REGGIE gets to the gate ahead of ADAM and manages to crowd 
               in front of some OTHERS about to pass through. Barely 
               stopping, she holds out her ticket to the GUARD to be punched, 
               then heads down the platform, still running. ADAM gets to 
               the gate but the GUARD stops him as he tries to pass through.

                                     GUARD
                         Billet, Monsieur.

                                     ADAM
                              (breathless)
                         I don't want to go anywhere -- I'm 
                         only trying --

                                     GUARD
                              (pointing off)
                         Billet, Monsieur.

               ADAM tries to look past him, to see REGGIE, but gives it up 
               and goes back toward the ticket booth, on the run.

               INT. MÉTRO PASSAGEWAY -- NIGHT

               CAMERA LEADING REGGIE as she runs -- the passageway is nearly 
               empty. Her footsteps echo against the tile and concrete walls.

               CLOSE SHOT -- PASSAGEWAY WALL (TRAVELING)

               The jumble of advertising posters as it passes rapidly, 
               forming a moving band of letters, women, cartoons and colors.

               INT. MÉTRO PASSAGEWAY -- NIGHT

               REGGIE stops and pauses for a moment at a sign indicating 
               two different directions, an arrow for each.

               "DIRECTION: Pte D'ORLÉANS Pte DE CLIGNANCOURT-------"

               Choosing "Clignancourt," she runs off. CAMERA PANS SHARPLY, 
               180 degrees, to pick up ADAM rounding the corner in hot 
               pursuit.

               INT. MÉTRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT

               REGGIE starts down the platform, looking behind her every 
               few steps.  Suddenly she looks up in surprise -- there, across 
               the tracks on the opposite platform is ADAM.  He has evidently 
               made the wrong turn back in the passageway.

               They stare at each other for a moment.  Then the bell rings, 
               announcing the arrival of a train. ADAM turns, running back 
               through the exit behind him. Not knowing what to do, REGGIE 
               looks into the darkness of the tunnel. The approaching train 
               can be heard.

                                     REGGIE
                              (to herself)
                         Come on -- please --

               She turns to look at the gate -- slowly, the pneumatic door 
               starts to close. As it does, the train roars into the station.

               INT. MÉTRO PASSAGEWAY -- NIGHT

               The gate can be seen slowly closing. ADAM runs to it, tries 
               to force it back but cannot. Finally, he jumps up and, 
               commando style, vaults over it.

               INT. MÉTRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT

               REGGIE is just entering the red center car (the two on either 
               side are dark green). ADAM runs for the red car and just 
               manages to make it as the doors shut in unison, the latches 
               falling with a concerted click and the little whistle blowing 
               to inform the motor-man to depart. The train starts to move.

               INT. MÉTRO CAR -- NIGHT

               The entire length of the car separates ADAM and REGGIE.

               For a moment, their eyes meet, then ADAM starts to weave his 
               way past the other PASSENGERS, on his way to her.

               Suddenly, he is stopped. ADAM turns to see a TRAIN GUARD.

                                     TRAIN GUARD
                         Billet, Monsieur.

               ADAM shows him his yellow ticket and starts past him, but 
               again the TRAIN GUARD stops him.

                                     TRAIN GUARD
                         Vous êtes dans le premier classe, 
                         Monsieur.

                                     ADAM
                         What?

                                     TRAIN GUARD
                              (heavy accent)
                         This car is for first class only -- 
                         you have a second-class ticket.

                                     ADAM
                         But that's what they gave me.

               He tries to pull away from the TRAIN GUARD and finds himself 
               staring into the serious face of a GENDARME.

                                     GENDARME
                         Monsieur -- ?

               ADAM looks at the GENDARME, then at REGGIE.

               INT. "PALAIS-ROYAL" MÉTRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT

               As the TRAIN pulls in and comes to a stop.

               INT. MÉTRO CAR -- NIGHT

               The GENDARME opens the door for ADAM and escorts him out.

               ADAM turns once more to look at REGGIE as he goes. She remains 
               in the car.

               INT. MÉTRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT

               The GENDARME gestures for ADAM to enter the green, second- 
               class car behind the red, first-class one. Reluctantly, ADAM 
               does.

               INT. MÉTRO CAR -- NIGHT

               As ADAM enters and goes to the door through which he can see 
               REGGIE in the car ahead. She is gone. Moving quickly, he 
               returns to the exit door and looks at the platform.

               INT. MÉTRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT

               From ADAM'S P.O.V. She is hurrying toward an exit marked 
               "SORTIE."

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Featuring ADAM as he hurries from the car. He finds his way 
               blocked by FIVE NUNS in large, white butterfly hats.

               It takes him a few precious seconds to work his way around 
               them.

               INT. MÉTRO SORTIE -- NIGHT

               REGGIE has entered an area leading to the exit. But as she 
               reaches the stairway leading up to the street level, she is 
               confronted with an iron grill barring her way. She tries to 
               open it, but it is firmly padlocked. A sign hung on it reads 
               "FERMÉ LES WEEKENDS." She turns, desperately looking for 
               some way out.

               INT. MÉTRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT

               ADAM is off the train. He stands on the platform as the train 
               doors slam shut, the latches click, the whistle blows and 
               the train pulls out. He looks around in all directions, 
               looking for some sign of REGGIE. He spots the exit marked 
               "SORTIE" (the same one used by REGGIE) and starts toward it.

               INT. MÉTRO SORTIE -- NIGHT

               As ADAM enters the deserted area. There is, miraculously, no 
               sign of REGGIE. He goes to the locked grill and tries it, 
               testing the padlock. CAMERA PANS to a phone booth (solid 
               door with a window in the upper half) and we see REGGIE's 
               hand reaching up to dial a number.

               INT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT

               REGGIE sits on the floor of the booth, dialing.

                                     REGGIE
                              (to herself, as she 
                              dials)
                         Balzac 3 - 0 - 0 - 4.

               She holds the receiver to her ear. The number can be heard 
               ringing but no one answers. She hangs up and reaches for the 
               phone book, leafing through its pages.

                                     REGGIE

               ADAM stands for a minute, looking around, not knowing what 
               to do.

               INT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT

               REGGIE has finished dialing her number and now pushes the

                              (on the phone)
                         All right, Mrs. Lampert -- I'll see 
                         what I can do. Goodbye.

               She unplugs the call, plugs in another one and dials quickly.

                                     OPERATOR
                         Hello, Mr. Bartholomew? -- there was 
                         a call for you just now, Mr. 
                         Bartholomew -- it sounded quite urgent -- 
                         a Mrs. Lampert.

               INT. BARTHOLOMEW'S STUDY -- NIGHT

               It is a man we've never seen before, the physical opposite 
               of the old BARTHOLOMEW.

                                     REAL BARTHOLOMEW
                         Lampert? I don't know any Mrs. Lampert -- 
                         trapped in a Métro station? Who does 
                         she think I am, the C.I.A.? All right, 
                         you'd better call the French police.

               INT. MÉTRO SORTIE -- NIGHT

               MED. SHOT -- PHONE BOOTH. As REGGIE's head appears, peeking 
               cautiously over the bottom of the window.

               REVERSE SHOT

               From inside the phone booth. Through the glass ADAM can be 
               seen, leaving the Sortie area.

               MED. SHOT -- PHONE BOOTH

               Carefully, REGGIE opens the door and comes out. She goes to 
               the corner and looks around it.

               INT. MÉTRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT

               From REGGIE'S P.O.V. as ADAM walks away from CAMERA, down

               the platform. CAMERA PANS TO REGGIE, peeking around the 
               corner. She looks the opposite way, sees another exit at the 
               other end of the platform (also marked "SORTIE"). She looks 
               back once more at ADAM, then makes up her mind and starts 
               running towards the exit.

               MED. SHOT -- ADAM

               As the bell rings announcing the next train. He turns to 
               look and sees REGGIE.

                                     ADAM
                              (calling)
                         Reggie -- !

               He takes off, running after her.

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE

               As she runs, ADAM several yards behind her.

                                     ADAM
                              (in b.g., calling)
                         Reggie -- wait!

               She turns into the exit.

               INT. MÉTRO STAIRWAY -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE starts up the long, steep flight of stone steps 
               leading to the street level. ADAM appears behind her, climbing 
               two at a time and gaining.

                                     ADAM
                         Reggie -- why won't you listen?

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm through listening to you!

               He is rapidly closing the gap between them. It is clear that 
               REGGIE is tiring.

                                     ADAM
                         But I didn't kill anybody.

                                     REGGIE
                         Then who did? You're the only one 
                         left.

               PASSERSBY, descending the stairs, stand aside to let the two 
               strange Americans pass, watching in wonderment. ADAM is only 
               a few steps behind now.

                                     ADAM
                         Reggie -- please believe me!

                                     REGGIE
                         No!

               As REGGIE wearily gains the top, ADAM lunges for her. He 
               manages to grab her foot as he falls forward, but all he 
               winds up with is a shoe which has come loose in his hand.

               REGGIE shrieks, then regaining her balance, continues running, 
               limping in her one shoe. ADAM scrambles to his feet and starts 
               after her again.

               INT. MÉTRO TICKET BOOTH AREA -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE, still hobbling, runs through and toward the stairs, 
               leading to the street. CAMERA PANS TO ADAM, as he, too, runs 
               through. He is again several yards behind her.

               EXT. PLACE PALAIS ROYAL -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE comes up the stairs from the Métro. She stops long 
               enough to kick off her other shoe, then runs across the 
               street, ignoring the traffic, toward the Rue de Valois (which 
               forms one side of the Palais Royal). ADAM is gaining on her 
               again.

               EXT. PALAIS ROYAL COURTYARD -- COLONNADE -- NIGHT

               The smaller court at the Comédie-Française end of the Palais 
               gardens, separated from the larger garden by a double 
               peristyle consisting of two twin rows (these separated from 
               each other by a small marble court) of twenty columns each -- 
               in all, eighty columns. The only person in sight is the man 
               we have known as BARTHOLOMEW, waiting at the far end of the 
               columns, looking at his watch impatiently.

               Then, from the Rue de Valois side of the Palais, REGGIE runs 
               into the court. She spots "BARTHOLOMEW" and fishes in her 
               bag for the stamps as she runs, taking them out and waving 
               them.

                                     REGGIE
                         Mr. Bartholomew -- he's chasing me!

               ADAM has run into the court and now skids to a stop at the 
               near end of the colonnade as he spots "BARTHOLOMEW." REGGIE, 
               still running, is halfway between the two men. "BARTHOLOMEW" 
               draws his gun but can't get a shot at ADAM, who has ducked 
               in among the columns.

                                     ADAM
                         Reggie -- stop! That's Carson Dyle!

               This news hits REGGIE hard and she stops, in alarm.

                                     REGGIE
                              (breathless)
                         Carson -- ?

               She looks at "BARTHOLOMEW," then back at ADAM, who has drawn 
               his own gun.

               (NOTE: Both "BARTHOLOMEW" and ADAM are in among the stone 
               columns at opposite ends of the colonnade, keeping out of 
               each other's sight. REGGIE stands out in the open, the stamps 
               in her hand, confused as to which man she should go to).

                                     "BARTHOLOMEW"
                              (calmly)
                         We all know Carson Dyle is dead, 
                         Mrs. Lampert.

                                     ADAM
                         It's Carson Dyle, I tell you!

                                     "BARTHOLOMEW"
                         You're not going to believe him, 
                         Mrs. Lampert -- it's too fantastic. 
                         He's trying to trick you again.

               REGGIE looks at one, then the other, not knowing what to do.

                                     ADAM
                         Tex recognized him -- that's why he 
                         said Dyle. If you give him those 
                         stamps, he'll kill you too!

               REGGIE takes a step toward ADAM.

                                     "BARTHOLOMEW"
                         Mrs. Lampert -- if I'm who he said, 
                         what's preventing me from killing 
                         you right now?

               REGGIE stops, turns back to "BARTHOLOMEW."

                                     ADAM
                         Because he'd have to come out to get 
                         the stamps -- he knows he'd never 
                         make it.

                                     "BARTHOLOMEW"
                         What's the matter with you, Mrs. 
                         Lampert? Are you going to believe 
                         every lie he tells you? He wants the 
                         money for himself -- that's all he's 
                         ever wanted.

                                     REGGIE
                              (to ADAM, explaining)
                         He's -- with the C.I.A. -- I've seen 
                         him at the Embassy.

                                     ADAM
                         Don't be a fool! He's Carson Dyle!

                                     "BARTHOLOMEW"
                         That's right, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm a 
                         dead man -- look at me.

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't know who anybody is any more!

                                     ADAM
                         Reggie -- listen to me!

                                     REGGIE
                         You lied to me so many times --

                                     ADAM
                              (gently)
                         Reggie -- trust me once more -- 
                         please.

                                     REGGIE
                         Can I really believe you this time, 
                         Adam?

                                     ADAM
                              (a pause)
                         There's not a reason on earth why 
                         you should.

               She looks toward ADAM for a moment, then back to 
               "BARTHOLOMEW", then slowly starts toward ADAM.

                                     REGGIE
                         All right, Adam.

                                     "BARTHOLOMEW"
                         Stop right now, Mrs. Lampert, or 
                         I'll kill you.

               REGGIE stops in alarm.

                                     ADAM
                         It won't get you the stamps, Dyle -- 
                         You'll have to come out to get them, 
                         and I'm not likely to miss at this 
                         range.

                                     "BARTHOLOMEW"
                              (now called CARSON)
                         Maybe not -- but it takes a lot of 
                         bullets to kill me. They left me 
                         there with five of them in my legs 
                         and my stomach -- they knew I was 
                         still alive but they left me. I spent 
                         ten months in a German camp -- with 
                         nothing to stop the pain and no food -- 
                         they were willing to take all these 
                         chances for the money, but not for 
                         me. They deserved to die!

               MED. SHOT -- ADAM

               During the following, he looks around, looking for some way 
               out.

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         But I didn't have anything to do 
                         with --

                                     CARSON'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         You've got the money. It belongs to 
                         me now! Please believe me, Mrs. 
                         Lampert -- I'll kill you -- a little 
                         more blood won't matter.

               During this ADAM has moved out from behind the columns, 
               creeping cautiously across the open space between the two 
               colonnades and finally, behind the second.

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND CARSON

                                     CARSON
                         I'll give you five to make up your 
                         mind, Mrs. Lampert.

               She has seen ADAM's move from her angle, but doesn't know 
               quite what to do.

                                     REGGIE
                         Wait, please! I need some time to 
                         think!

                                     CARSON
                         One --

               MED. SHOT -- ADAM

               As he slowly moves along behind the second colonnade, his 
               gun ready, trying to get an angle on CARSON.

                                     CARSON'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         -- two --

               Suddenly ADAM stops -- he has caught sight of CARSON through 
               the columns. But he will have a difficult shot.

                                     CARSON'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         -- three --

               CLOSE SHOT -- CARSON

                                     CARSON
                         -- four --

               CAMERA PANS DOWN to his gun. As his finger tightens on the 
               trigger and the hammer moves slowly back.

               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

                                     REGGIE
                         Adam -- please!

               MED. SHOT -- ADAM

               As he aims carefully and fires.

               CLOSE SHOT -- COLUMN

               As the bullet creases it.

               CLOSE SHOT -- CARSON

               As the deflected bullet rips the shoulder of his coat, leaving 
               him unharmed. He wheels.

               MED. SHOT -- ADAM

               With CARSON in the b.g., who fires at him. ADAM ducks behind 
               the column as the bullet hits it and screams off.

               Quickly, he peers back out and throws another shot.

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE

               Seeing CARSON otherwise occupied, she turns and runs toward 
               the open stage door of the Comédie Française behind her.

               (Beside the door is a poster announcing the forthcoming 
               schedule of presentations.)

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Including CARSON who, seeing REGGIE running to the door, 
               turns and fires at her. But he is too late -- she is safely 
               inside. CARSON looks quickly back toward ADAM, then takes 
               off after REGGIE.

               MED. SHOT -- ADAM

               Over his shoulder we see a broken picture of CARSON running 
               toward the theatre door, flashing by the near and far columns.  
               ADAM tries to get a shot at him, but can't.

               Finally he runs after him.

               INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- BACKSTAGE -- NIGHT

               As CARSON enters and slams the door behind him, locking it.

               INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- STAGE DOOR -- NIGHT

               ADAM arriving at the door, bangs on it, then looks around, 
               frustrated. Several yards away he sees a short stairway 
               leading down to a door below the street level. He runs to 
               it, tries the door and enters.

               INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- ORCHESTRA -- NIGHT

               As CARSON enters the auditorium and looks around.

               CARSON'S P.O.V.

               As the CAMERA SWEEPS the magnificent old theatre -- boxes, 
               seats, stage, but there is no sign of REGGIE.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As CARSON walks up the aisle checking between the rows of 
               seats.

               INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- TRAPROOM -- NIGHT

               A large room, lit by a single bare bulb, under the stage.

               ADAM appears, moving cautiously, gun ready. He creeps along 
               next to the wall, looking around at all the various scenic 
               pieces which fill the room.

               INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- STAGE -- NIGHT

               As CARSON moves carefully across the darkened stage near the 
               footlights, looking for REGGIE. At mid-stage, CAMERA PANS 
               DOWN to his feet, only a few inches from the prompter's box.  
               Inside, huddling down, is a terrified REGGIE, holding her 
               breath as she watches him.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As CARSON moves into the opposite wings, sees the light board 
               and throws on all the switches. The stage is bathed in light.

               He returns to the stage.

               INT. TRAPROOM -- NIGHT

               ADAM is looking up, having heard the footsteps on the stage 
               over his head -- and hearing them now. He looks around and 
               sees a narrow, curving staircase leading up. He goes to it, 
               and, starting up, finds a door. He tries the knob -- the 
               door is locked.

               INT. PROMPTER'S BOX -- NIGHT

               REGGIE, cringing back from the bright light, notices the 
               doorknob turning. It makes a slight clicking sound.

               INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- STAGE -- NIGHT

               CARSON, upstage, looking behind a piece of classic scenery, 
               hears the doorknob and turns suddenly.

               CARSON'S P.O.V.

               We catch a quick glimpse of REGGIE as she ducks down out of 
               sight.  Too late.

               CLOSE SHOT -- CARSON

                                     CARSON
                         All right, Mrs. Lampert. The game's 
                         over. Come out of there.

               WIDER ANGLE

               REGGIE does not appear.

                                     CARSON
                         I don't want to kill you, Mrs. Lampert --
                         but I will --

               INT. TRAPROOM -- NIGHT

               ADAM comes down the stairs from the prompter's box and looks 
               up at the ceiling.

               MED. SHOT -- CEILING

               It is divided into thirty-six square sections, each numbered 
               and lettered -- from 1A to 6F. They are trapdoors.

               MED. SHOT -- ADAM

               He looks from the ceiling to a row of levers on one wall.

               CLOSE SHOT -- LEVERS

               Thirty-six of them, numbered and lettered to correspond to 
               the traps.

               INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- STAGE -- NIGHT

               As CARSON takes a few steps towards the prompter's box, his 
               gun ready.

                                     CARSON
                         Did you hear me, Mrs. Lampert -- ?

               INT. PROMPTER'S BOX -- NIGHT

               REGGIE huddled inside.

               INT. TRAPROOM -- NIGHT

               ADAM is listening carefully, trying to figure out where CARSON 
               is standing, watching the ceiling.

               CLOSE SHOT -- TRAP

               It is marked C-4.

                                     CARSON'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         I won't wait much longer, Mrs. Lampert

               MED. SHOT -- ADAM

               As he turns to the levers and reaches for the one marked C-
               4. He is about to pull it.

               INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- STAGE -- NIGHT

               CARSON takes a few more steps forward.

               INT. TRAPROOM -- NIGHT

               ADAM stops himself from pulling the lever just in time. He 
               lets his held breath escape. He looks back at the ceiling.

               CLOSE SHOT -- TRAP

               The one marked C-4. As CARSON's voice is heard, CAMERA MOVES 
               to the next trap, marked D-4.

                                     CARSON'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         I know you're in there, Mrs. Lampert --

               MED. SHOT -- ADAM

               He looks at the lever marked D-4. He is perspiring heavily.

               Now he slowly reaches for the lever.

               INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- STAGE -- NIGHT

               CARSON is about to move closer to the prompter's box when 
               suddenly the stage under him opens and he plummets through 
               out of sight. At the same time we hear a shot.

               CLOSE SHOT -- PROMPTER'S BOX

               As REGGIE slowly peers out.

               REGGIE'S P.O.V.

               The empty stage, without being able to see the open trap 
               from this low angle.

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE

               As she climbs out of the booth and, seeing the open trap 
               now, runs to it, looking down through it.

               MED. SHOT -- OPEN TRAP

               FROM ABOVE, over REGGIE's head. She can see CARSON sprawled 
               on the floor below, face down and dead. ADAM stands beside 
               the body, looking up at REGGIE and smiling.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As GRANDPIERRE and his TWO ASSISTANTS, guns drawn, walk onto 
               the stage from the wings. They go to the open trap and look 
               down at ADAM.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         Mr. Dyle -- you are under arrest for 
                         the murders of Charles Lampert, Herman 
                         Scobie, Joseph Penthollow, Leopold 
                         Gideon, and whoever that is down 
                         there.

               ADAM is surprised, then shakes his head.

                                     ADAM
                         Reggie -- you'd better tell him. He 
                         wouldn't dare hit a girl.

               EXT. RUE DE RIVOLI -- NIGHT

               As a TAXI rolls by the arcades, CAMERA PANNING with it.

               INT. TAXI -- NIGHT (PROCESS)

               REGGIE and ADAM in the rear of the cab. REGGIE has one of 
               her feet in her hand, shoe off, rubbing it.

                                     REGGIE
                         You didn't have to chase me so hard --

                                     ADAM
                         Here, give it to me.

               He starts to take the foot but she pulls it back and offers 
               him the other one.

                                     REGGIE
                         That one's done -- start on this 
                         one.

               He takes the foot and begins rubbing it.

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm sorry I thought you were the 
                         murderer, Adam -- how did I know 
                         that he was as big a liar as you 
                         are?

                                     ADAM
                         And that's all the gratitude I get 
                         for saving your hide.

                                     REGGIE
                         The truth, now -- was it my hide -- 
                         or the stamps?

                                     ADAM
                         What a terrible thing to say. How 
                         could you even think that?

                                     REGGIE
                         All right, prove it to me -- tell me 
                         to go to the Embassy first thing in 
                         the morning and turn in those stamps.

               ADAM says nothing.

                                     REGGIE
                         I said, tell me to go to the --

                                     ADAM
                         I heard you, I heard you.

                                     REGGIE
                         Then say it.

                                     ADAM
                         Reggie -- listen to me --

                                     REGGIE
                         Never mind -- I'll go by myself.

                                     ADAM
                         What makes you think they're even 
                         interested? It's only a quarter of a 
                         million -- it'll cost more than that 
                         to fix up their bookkeeping. As a 
                         taxpayer --

               As REGGIE and ADAM approach the MARINE in full-dress uniform 
               always on guard at the Embassy.

                                     REGGIE
                              (to ADAM)
                         Who's a taxpayer? Crooks don't pay
                         taxes.  Excuse me, soldier --

                         Marine, ma'am.

                                     REGGIE
                         Forgive me. Whom would I see regarding 
                         the return of stolen Government money?

                                     MARINE
                         You might try the Treasury Department, 
                         ma'am -- Room 216, second floor, Mr. 
                         Cruikshank.

                                     REGGIE
                         Cruikshank, 216. Thank you, Marine.

               INT. EMBASSY CORRIDOR -- DAY

                                     ADAM
                         Do you mind if I wait out here? The 
                         sight of all that money being given 
                         away might make me break out.

               INT. EMBASSY TREASURY OFFICE -- DAY

               A SECRETARY sits behind a desk. She looks up as REGGIE enters.

                                     REGGIE
                         Mr. Cruikshank, please -- my name is 
                         Lampert.

               The SECRETARY picks up her phone and presses a button.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Mr. Cruikshank, a Miss --

                         -- a Mrs. Lampert to see you -- yes 
                         sir.
                              (to REGGIE)
                         Go right in.

               REGGIE goes to the door leading to the private office.

               INT. CRUIKSHANK'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Featuring the door as REGGIE enters. She stops suddenly.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Featuring the desk. Behind it sits ADAM (now CRUIKSHANK).

               REGGIE stares at him, unbelievingly, then looks around, 
               confused. By way of explanation he indicates the door to the 
               hall.

                                     REGGIE
                              (blowing up)
                         Well, of all the mean, rotten, 
                         contemptible, crooked --

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         Crooked? I should think you'd be 
                         glad to find out I wasn't crooked.

                                     REGGIE
                         You couldn't even be honest about 
                         being dishonest. Why didn't you say 
                         something?

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         We're not allowed to tell. May I 
                         have the stamps, please?

                         Here --
                              (hesitating)
                         Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle 
                         get an office in here, anyway?

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         When did you see him -- what time, I 
                         mean?

                         Around one.

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         The lunch hour. He probably worked 
                         it out in advance. He found an office 
                         that was usually left open and just 
                         moved in for the time you were here.

                                     REGGIE
                         Then how do I know this is your 
                         office?

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                              (picking up the phone)
                         Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to 
                         Bartholomew at Security recommending 
                         that --

                                     REGGIE
                         Bartholomew?

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         -- recommending that all Embassy 
                         offices be locked during the lunch 
                         hour.

                                     REGGIE
                         Starting with his own.

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                              (hanging up)
                         Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.

                                     REGGIE
                         What's your first name today?

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         Brian.

                                     REGGIE
                         Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve 
                         me right if I got stuck with that 
                         one.

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         Who asked you to get stuck with any 
                         of them?

                                     REGGIE
                         Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         Yes.

                                     REGGIE
                         But you're -- divorced?

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         No.

                                     REGGIE
                              (crestfallen)
                         Oh.

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         My mother -- she lives in Detroit. 
                         Come on now -- give me those stamps.

                                     REGGIE
                         Only if you can prove to me that 
                         you're really Brian Cruikshank.

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         How about if next week some time I 
                         put it on a marriage license -- that 
                         ought to --

                                     REGGIE
                         Quit stalling -- I want to see some 
                         identification -- now!

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- 
                         I could go to jail.

                                     REGGIE
                         You'd lie about anything.

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         Well, maybe we'd better forget about 
                         it, then.

                                     REGGIE
                         You can't prove it, can you? You're 
                         still trying to --
                              (the coin drops into 
                              the slot)
                         marriage license! Did you say -- ?

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         I didn't say anything. Will you give 
                         me those stamps?

                                     REGGIE
                         You did too say it -- I heard you.  
                         Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- 
                         er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have 
                         lots of boys -- we can name them all 
                         after you.

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         Before we start on that, do you mind 
                         handing over the stamps?

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END

                

               BONUS ITEM -- Lyrics to the theme song of the film:

                

                                         CHARADE

                      Music by Henry Mancini, Words by Johnny Mercer

               When we played our Charade we were like children posing, 
               Playing at games, acting out names, guessing the parts we 
               played.

               Oh, what a hit we made. We came on next to closing Best on 
               the bill, lovers until love left the masquerade.

               Fate seemed to pull the strings, I turned and you were gone.

               While from the darkened wings the music box played on.

               Sad little serenade, song of my heart's composing, I hear it 
               still, I always will, best on the bill Charade.

	INT. COMIC BOOK STORE - DAY
	A pile of COMIC BOOKS are on a shelf next to myriad 
	others. The most prominent one is called BLUNTMAN AND 
	CHRONIC'.  A hand reaches in and pulls one out of frame.
	HOLDEN opens the comic and flips through it He shakes his 
	head.  BANKY looks over his shoulder.

					BANKY
			Felt Like this fucking day would never 
			come.  Issue two - on the shelf.

					HOLDEN
			Yippee.

					BANKY
			Don't start, alright!  This is a cool 
			moment, and I'd appreciate you not 
			trying to ruin it.  How often does		
			a guy get the opportunity to purchase 
			something with his name on it!
				(points to name on cover)
			Banky Edwards- right!
				(points to the other)
			Holden McNeil.
					HOLDEN
			I know my name.
					BANKY
			C'mon, sour puss.  We got the rest of 
			our lives to be artists.  But it's 
			supply and demand.  And right now,		
			the unwashed masses demand this.
					HOLDEN
				(off comic)
			This is easy, alright!  And right now 
			it pays the bills.  Just don't forget 
			that we're better than this.
					BANKY
			I'll tell you who we're better than: 
			these two fags right here.
	They approach the counter, where STEVE-DAVE, the store 
	manager, and WALT the Fan-boy, play a card game.
					BANKY
				(lays books on the counter)
			Alright Old-Maid's - take a break from 
			the Crazy-8's marathon and ring us up.
					STEVE-DAVE
				(not looking up)
			Well, well,well, Walt Did you see who 
			it is!  The local celebrities.  Quick - 
			get them to autograph one of their 
			books so we can sell it for triple 
			it's value.
					WALT
			I'm not that in need of fifteen cents 
			right now.
	They snicker and high-five one another.  Holden rolls his 
	eyes.
					BANKY
			You guys operate the smallest, ladies' 
			bridge circle I've ever seen.
					WALT
			For your information, we're playing 
			Crimson Mystical Mages' - an 
			overpower card game. Not that either 
			of you would give a shit about 
			something as advanced	as this - 
			there are no dick or poopie jokes 
			involved.
					BANKY
				(to Holden)
			I don't think they're fans.
					WALT
			No, we're not.  You're both a couple 
			of fucking no talents that got lucky.
					STEVE-DAVE
			And obviously your handlers or hangers-
			on convinced you that your first comic 
			was good which it was not it was 
			thoroughly mediocre with a few spiky 
			bits of dialogue.  And when you get 
			your foot in the door of the business, 
			what do you do!  You turn out a piece 
			of shit like Bluntman and Chronic'.
					WALT
			Tell him, Steve-Dave.
					STEVE-DAVE
				(off comic)
			Bluntman and Chronic'.  Pah.  
			What was that thing the little stoner 
			pulled on the villain in the last 
			issue!
					WALT
			The Stinky-palm.
					STEVE-DAVE
			Stinky-palm.  You give comics a bad 
			name I tell all my customers not to 
			buy it, to spend their money on a real 
			comic book.
					WALT
			Fucking one hit wonder, dime-store 
			Frank Miller's.
					STEVE-DAVE
			This is the reality at Comic-Toast - 
			you're not going to get your ass 
			kissed here, because both me and Walt 
			think you suck.
					WALT
			And me.
					STEVE-DAVE
			I said that.
	Steve-Dave offers the boys his two middle fingers, then 
	goes back to playing his game with Walt.  Holden and 
	Banky stare, shocked.  Banky nudges Holden and they both 
	exit Steve-Dave and the Fan-boy slap hands and go back to 
	playing.
					WALT
			I've got a dragon card - forty power-
			ups and twelve life points!  Ha!  I 
			get your elf card!
					STEVE-DAVE
			You're such a bitch!  But thankfully, 
			I've saved a dark forces Shaman card 
			for just such an occasion.
					WALT
			You suck!  Eighty six life-power 
			points to my twenty two!
					STEVE-DAVE
			I schooled their asses, now I'm 
			schooling your's.
	Suddenly.  A trash can crashes through the front window. 
	Steve-Dave and Walt hit the deck like bitches, covering 
	one another.  They look up slowly. Steve-Dave leaps to 
	his feet and looks at the shattered mess.  He pulls 
	something off the garbage can and reads it.
					WALT
			You know it was those two fucks!  
			Let's call the cops and have them 
			busted!  I know where their studio is!  
			Or better yet, let's sue!  You can sue 
			them, Steve-Dave!
					STEVE-DAVE
				(still reading note)
			That won't be necessary.
					WALT
			What?!  Why the hell not!
					STEVE-DAVE
				(holds up check)
			Because this is a check for three 
			times what that window cost.
				(reading note)
			Dear critics - thanks for the 
			insight. But like my grandmother 
			always said - Fuck 'em if they can't 
			take a joke.. and break their window.'  
			Kiss it,		Banky the Hack. 
			P.S. - Your card game blows.
					WALT
			He said Kiss it!
	CREDITS
	INT. COMIC BOOK: CONVENTION SIGNING BOOTH - DAY
	A physically large FAN - sweaty brow, tote bag bursting 
	with comics - leans forward, smiling.
					FAN
			Could you sign it To a really big 
			fan!
	Holden sits at a table.  Across from the barely-managing-
	to-stand Fan.  He offers him a patronizingly kind, half-
	smile in return,
					HOLDEN
			You bet.
	We're at a Comic Book show, specifically at a book-
	signing. Behind Holden hangs a large banner, heralding 
	HOLDEN McNEIL AND BANKY EDWARDS -
	CREATORS OF BLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC'. Beside it is a large 
	mock-up of the comic book cover which features two stoner 
	super-heroes who bear a
	striking resemblance to a pair of very familiar friendly 
	neighborhood drug
	dealers, Holden hands the book back to the Fan.
					FAN
			I love this book man!  This shit's 
			awesome.  I wish I was like these guys 
			- getting stoned, talking all raw 
			about		chicks and fighting 
			supervillains!  I love these guys!  
			They're like Cheech and Chong' meet 
			Bill and fed'!
					HOLDEN
			I like to chink of them as 
			Rosencrantz and Guildenstern' meet 
			Vladimir and Estragon'.
					FAN
			Yeah!
				(beat)
			Who!
	BANKY signs the book of another COLLECTOR.
					COLLECTOR
			So you draw this!
					BANKY
				(signing the comic)
			I ink it and I'm also the colorist.  
			The guy next to me draws it.  But we 
			both came up with the characters,
					COLLECTOR
			What's that mean - you ink it'!
					BANKY
			Well.  It means that Holden draws the 
			pictures in pencil, and then he gives 
			it to me to go over in ink
					COLLECTOR
			So you just trace!
	Banky freezes up.  He composes himself and continues 
	signing.
					BANKY
			It's not tracing.  I add depth and 
			shading to give the image mere 
			definition. Only then does the drawing	
			really take shape.
					COLLECTOR
			You go over what he draws with a pen - 
			that's tracing.
					BANKY
				(hands book back to 
				Collector)
			Not really.
				(calling out)
			Next!
	A LITTLE KID steps up but the Collector lingers.
					COLLECTOR
			Hey man.  If somebody draws something 
			and then you draw the same thing right 
			on top of it, not going out-side the 
			designated original art what do call 
			that!
					LITTLE KID
				(shrugs)
			I don't know.  Tracing?
					COLLECTOR
				(to Banky)
			See?
					BANKY
			It's not tracing.
					COLLECTOR
			Oh, but it is.
					BANKY
				(to Little Kid)
			Do you want Lour book signed or what?
					COLLECTOR
			Hey - don't get all testy with him 
			just because you have a problem with 
			your station in life.
					BANKY
			I'm secure with what I do.
					COLLECTOR
			Then say it - you're a tracer.
					BANKY
				(grabbing Little Kid's book)
			How should I sign this?
					LITTLE KID
				(grabs book back)
			I don't want you to sign it, I want 
			the guy that draws Bluntman and 
			Chronic to sign it.  You're just a 
			tracer.
					COLLECTOR
			Tell him, Little Shaver.
	Holden accepts a comic from another Fan.
					HOLDEN
				(off comic)
			Who do I sign it to!
	Before Holden can finish, a loud crash is heard.  He 
	looks to his left and freaks.
	Banky is throttling the Collector from across the table. 
	The Collector attempts to fight him off.  SECURITY GUARDS 
	pull them apart. Holden grabs Banky.
					COLLECTOR
			Jesus!  All I did was call him a 
			tracer!
					BANKY
				(to Collector)
			I'LL TRACE A CHALK LINE AROUND YOUR 
			DEAD FUCKING BODY, YOU FUCK?!
					HOLDEN
				(to Security Guard)
			Could you get him out of here!
	The Security Guards drag the collector away.
					COLLECTOR
			Hey, wait a sec!  He jumped me!  And 
			you're dragging me away!!
				(exiting)
			Fucking tracer!
					BANKY
				(calling OC)
			YOUR MOTHER'S A TRACER!!
 
					HOLDEN
			Can I explain the audience principle 
			to you!  If you insult and accost 
			them, then we have no audience.
					BANKY
			He started it!  Fucking cock-knocker! 
			He's lucky I didn't put my pen through 
			his thorax!
					HOLDEN
			Need I remind you...
				(holds up watch)
			Curtain's in ten minutes.
	INT. COMIC BOOK CONVENTION LECTURE HALL - DAY
	HOOPER fills the frame.  He comes off like a typical, pro-
	black/anti-white homeboy.
					HOOPER
			For years in this industry whenever an 
			African-American character - hero or 
			villain - was introduced usually by 
			white artists and writers - they got 
			slapped with racist names that singled 
			them out as negroes: Black Panther, 
			Black Lightning, Black Goliath, Black	
			Mantra, Black Talon, Black Spider, 
			Black Hand, Black Falcon, Black Cat..
					VOICE FROM CROWD
			She's white.
					HOOPER
			She is?
				(beat)
			Well bust this - regardless.
	We're at a panel discussion.  The room is full.  Five 
	creators sit at a long table, their names on placards in 
	front of them.  
	(One of them is a very striking Girl.)  The banner behind 
	them reads WORDS UP - MINORITY VOICES IN COMICS'.
					HOOPER
				(holds up comic)
			Now my book, White-Hating Coon', 
			doesn't have any of that bullshit. The 
			hero's name is Maleekwa, and he's a	
			descendant of the black tribe that 
			established the first society on the 
			planet, while all you European mother	
			fuckers were still hiding in caves and 
			shit, all terrified of the sun. He's a 
			strong role model that a young black	
			reader can look up to, Cause I'm here 
			to tell you - the chickens are comin' 
			home to roost, ya'll: the black man's	
			no longer gonna play the minstrel in 
			the medium of comics and Sci-
			Fi/Fantasy!  We're keeping it real, 
			and we're gonna get respect - 
			by any means necessary!
	During the speech, Holden and Banky enter and sit up 
	front.
					HOLDEN
				(calling out)
			Bullshit!  Lando Calrissian was a 
			black man, and he got to fly the 
			Millennium Falcon!
	Hooper whips his head around, looking for the source of 
	the comment
					HOOPER
			Who said that?!?
					HOLDEN
				(standing)
			I did!  Lando Calrissian is a positive 
			black role model in the realm of 
			Science Fiction/Fantasy.
					HOOPER
			Fuck Lando Calrissian!  Uncle Tom 
			nigger!  Always some white boy gotta 
			invoke the holy trilogy'! Bust this - 
			those movies are about how the white 
			man keeps the brother man down - even 
			in a galaxy far, far away.  Check		
			this shit.  You got cracker farm-boy 
			Luke Skywalker, Nazi poster boy - 
			blond hair, blue eyes.  
			And then you've got		Darth 
			Vader: the blackest brother in the 
			galaxy.  Nubian God.
					BANKY
			What's a Nubian?
					HOOPER
			Shut the fuck up!  Now Vader, he's a 
			spiritual brother, with the force and 
			all that shit.  Then this cracker 
			Skywalker gets his hands on a light-
			saber, and the boy decides he's		
			gonna run the fucking universe - gets 
			a whole Klan of whites together, and 
			they're gonna bust up Vader's hood		
			the Death Star.  Now what the fuck do 
			you call that!
					BANKY
			Intergalactic Civil War!
					HOOPER
			Gentrification.  They're gonna drive 
			our the black element, to make the 
			galaxy quote, unquote safe' for white 
			folks.
					HOLDEN
			But Vader turns, out to be Luke's 
			father.  And in Jedi, they become 
			friends.
					HOOPER
			Don't make me bust a cap in your ass, 
			yo!  Jedi's the most insulting 
			installment, because Vader's 
			beautiful,		black visage is 
			sullied when he pulls off his mask to 
			reveal a feeble, crusty white man! 
			They're trying to tell us that deep 
			inside, we all want to be white!
					BANKY
			Well isn't that true!
	Hooper explodes, He pulls a nine millimeter from his 
	belt, draws on Banky and fires.  Banky goes down, falling 
	forward into the crowd The crowd screams and starts to 
	scatter, Hooper jumps over the table and raises his fists 
	in the air.
					HOOPER
			BLACK RAGE! BLACK RAGE!!  I'LL KILL 
			ANY WHITE FOLKS I LAY MY MOTHER 
			FUCKIN' EYES ON!!!
	The crowd-is gone.  Holden sits in his chair, laughing. 
	Hooper steps off the stage and picks Banky's head up off 
	the floor.
					HOOPER

			What's a Nubian!'  Bitch, you almost 
			made me laugh!
	Hooper sounds different Actually, he sounds gay.  
	Actually - he is.  Banky smiles.
					BANKY
			Well what about you!  You didn't tell 
			me you were going to scream Black 
			Rage'.  I nearly pissed myself.
					HOLDEN
			How do you manage to get away with 
			this all the time?  Shouldn't cops be 
			busting your head open right about 
			now?
					BANKY
			Wrong coast.
					HOOPER
				(off gun)
			Well this right here - she full of 
			blanks, okay.  And Opiate gets all 
			sorts of legal clearances before I go 
			on.
					HOLDEN
			Your publisher condones these 
			theatrics!
					HOOPER
			Condones?  Honey, they insist.  I need 
			to sell the image to sell the book 
			Would the audience still buy the 
			Black Rage' angle if they found out 
			the book was written by a.. a...
					BANKY
			Faggot.
					HOOPER
			When you say if it sounds so sexy...
				(he kisses Banky full on the 
				lips)
					BANKY
				(wipes his lips)
			Hey, hey!  I'll play your victim, but 
			not your catcher.
					VOICE
			How is it that you sound like Minister 
			Farakhan when you're on stage..
	They turn to see...
	A beautiful, blonde, ruffled-haired angel swinging her 
	purse in a circle. Her name is ALYSSA.  She's the 
	striking Girl from the panel who didn't get to say much.
					ALYSSA
			...and the King of Pop when you're 
			nor.
					HOOPER
			Look out, boys - this kitten has a 
			whip.
					ALYSSA
				(shoves and slaps him)
			Always before I get to speak!  I swear 
			- the next con I attend and they ask 
			me to be on the minority panel, if I 
			see your name anywhere near the List, 
			I'm passing.
					HOOPER
				(defending himself)
			Holden.  Banky - this pile of P.M.S. 
			is Alyssa Jones.  She does that book 
			Idiosyncratic Routine'.  This is the 
			fourth panel we've been on together, 
			and even though she knows my publisher 
			sets this up and pays for the event. 
			She still gets mad when it ends with 
			my act.
					ALYSSA
			I just wish I was the one who gets to 
			shoot you.
					HOOPER
			That's what my father said when I came 
			- nay - leapt out of the closet
				(off guys)
			These boys do Bluntman and Chronic', 
			which outsells both of our books put 
			together, hence they're never on a 
			panel with the likes of us.  They 
			slumming right now.
					BANKY
			I've read your book.  It's cute.  
			Chick stuff, but cute.
	Holden hits him.
					BANKY
			What?
					HOLDEN
				(shoots him a look; to 
				Alyssa)
			Sorry about him.  He's dealing with 
			being an inker.
					ALYSSA
				(to Banky)
			Oh. You trace!
	Banky seethes.
					HOLDEN
				(shaking her hand)
			I really enjoy your book I'm surprised 
			we've never met at any other Con's 
			before.
					ALYSSA
			Lose the dick or change your skin tone 
			and we can get to know each other on 
			panel after panel while the Pink Black 
			Panther here plays Chuck D. for the 
			fanboys.
					HOOPER
			Hey, jealousy.
				(to the Boys)
			I told Alyssa I'd buy her a post-rave 
			drink.  Do the Garden-Staters have to 
			sprint to the Lincoln Tunnel, or can 
			you stay for a round in the big, scary 
			city!
					BANKY
			We're gonna take off soon...
					HOLDEN
			We'll go.
	Banky offers Holden a puzzled glance.  Then he nods to 
	Hooper.
					BANKY
			We'll go.
	INT BAR - NIGHT
	Holden, Banky, Alyssa and Hooper sir around a table 
	drinking, talking, and smoking.
					BANKY
			Archie, alright!  Archie and the 
			Riverdale gang were a pure and fun-
			lovin' bunch.  You can't find 
			dysfunction in those comics, because 
			they were just flat out wholesome.
					HOOPER
			Archie and Jughead were lovers.
				(sips his drink)
					BANKY
			Shut the fuck up.
					HOOPER
			It's true.  Archie was the bitch and 
			Jughead was the butch - that's why 
			Jughead wears that crown-looking hat 
			all the time: he the king, of queen 
			Archie's world.
					BANKY
			Man, I feel a hate-crime coming on
					HOLDEN
			He's got a point.  Archie never did 
			settle on Betty or Veronica.
					BANKY
			Because he wanted them both at the 
			same time, you assholes!  He never 
			chose one because he was trying to get 
			both of them into a three-way!
					HOOPER
				(pulls out a dollar and hands 
				it to Banky)
			Here.  I want you to go down to the 
			corner store and buy yourself a clue. 
			Go on.
					BANKY
			Eat it.  Urkel.
					HOOPER
			I told you to watch it with that Urkel 
			shit.  Face it, girl - Archie's a 
			sister.
					BANKY
				(getting up; to Hooper)
			That's it.  You.
					HOOPER
			Moi?
					BANKY
			You are marching back across the 
			street with me, and we're going to 
			pick up a shit load of Archie books, I 
			am going to prove to you - beyond the 
			shadow of a doubt that Archie was all 
			about pussy.  Come on.
					HOOPER
				(sliding out of booth)
			This boy is conflicted, I shall play 
			mother-therapist for him.  You two sit 
			tight.  We shall return promptly.
	Banky and Hooper exit, leaving Alyssa and Holden alone at 
	the table.
					ALYSSA
			Is he always Like that!
					HOLDEN
			For years now.  Started back in third 
			grade - a nun was teaching us about 
			the Blessed Trinity.  She's going on 
			about the three persons in one God 
			thing - Father, Son, Holy Spirit - and 
			he just goes ballistic.  I guess it 
			was too big for him to grasp.  They 
			got into this huge fight.
					ALYSSA
			Please.  How bad could it have been!
					HOLDEN
			You ever seen a nun call a small child 
			a fucking cunt-rag'?  Wasn't pretty, 
			Shit like that's bound to happen when 
			you make a kid wear a matching tie and 
			slacks everyday.
					ALYSSA
			And your parochial school 
			misadventures!
					HOLDEN
			Limited to wine-tasting prior to mass. 
			Turned me into a grade school 
			alcoholic altar boy.  I couldn't tell 
			you how many mornings after serous 
			benders		I'd wake up next 
			to strange priests.
					ALYSSA
			Aren't you the sharp wit!
					HOLDEN
			Sharp!  No.  I'm just a fan of clergy-
			molestation humor.  Probably why the 
			extended family quit inviting me to 
			First Communion parties.
	Alyssa laughs.  Holden smiles.
					ALYSSA
				(looking OC)
			You play darts!
					HOLDEN
			Not professionally.  You know - only 
			in bars.



	AT THE DART BOARD

	A dart hits the board then, one hits the wall beside the 
	board.

	Alyssa winds up with another dart.  Holden watches. Her's 
	always hit. His never do.

					ALYSSA
			So your new book seems to be selling 
			like mad.

					HOLDEN
			It goes back to something my 
			grandmother told me when I was a kid. 
			"Holden," she said "The big bucks are 
			in dick and fart jokes."  She was a 
			church-goer.

					ALYSSA
			Uh-oh - the cry from the heart of a 
			real artist trapped in commercial hell 
			- pitying his good fortune.  I'm sure 
			you can dry your eyes on all those fat 
			checks you rake in.

					HOLDEN
			I'm sorry - did I detect a note of 
			bitter envy in there!

					ALYSSA
			Nope.  I'm happy my stuff gets read at 
			all.  There's very little market for 
			hearts and flowers in this spandex-
			clad, big pecs, big tits, big guns 
			field.  If I sell two issues, I feel 
			like John Grisham.

					HOLDEN
				(looking out window)
			It's all about marketing.  Over- or 
			underweight guys who don't get laid - 
			they're our bread and butter.  People 
			like those two outside should be 
			yours.

	Through the window, we see a COUPLE making out on the 
	hood of a car.

					HOLDEN
			And sadly, there are more of our core 
			audience out there than yours.
				(smiles)
			Look at that, though - kind of gives 
			you a little charge, to see two people 
			in love.  And all over Banky's car, no 
			less.  That car's seeing more action 
			right now than it's seen in years.

					ALYSSA
			Bubbly guy like that, it's hard to 
			figure out why.

					HOLDEN
				(still looking at OC Couple)
			You've gotta respect that kind of 
			display of affection.  It's crazy, 
			rude, self-absorbed - but it's love.

					ALYSSA
			That's not love.

					HOLDEN
			Says you.

					ALYSSA
			That out there!  That's fleeting.

					HOLDEN
			Fleeting.

					ALYSSA
			Uh-huh.  You wanna hear about love!  
			Oh, I'll tell you about love.

					HOLDEN
			A story?

					ALYSSA
			The story.  The original love story.

					HOLDEN
			'Doctor Zhivago'.

					ALYSSA
			Nope.  My mother's uncle.  He was a 
			millionaire.

					HOLDEN
			Get out.

					ALYSSA
			I kid you not.

					HOLDEN
			Explain.

					ALYSSA
			All through high school, he dated this 
			one girl.  They  were inseparable.  
			And when they graduated, she went off 
			to Carnegie Mellon...

					HOLDEN
			In Pittsburgh.

					ALYSSA
			I'm impressed.  So he stays in the 
			home town, and they begin their long-
			distance relationship.  The plan is, 
			on the  third Sunday of every month, 
			he'll train out, spend a week then 
			train back They do this for four 
			years.

					HOLDEN
			That is love.

					ALYSSA
			Not nearly finished.  Two months 
			before she's going to graduate, he's 
			got this job digging graves, and he 
			comes across...

					HOLDEN
			A stiff.

					ALYSSA
			A steamer trunk containing silver 
			ingots.

					HOLDEN
			Get out of here.

					ALYSSA
			Many, many silver ingots.  Now, my 
			mother's uncle being quite the 
			ingenious chap - he buries the trunk  
			again and heads up to the main office, 
			where he proceeds to purchase a 
			cemetery plot.  Guess which one?

					HOLDEN
			Clever.

					ALYSSA
			So now he owns the plot and all of its 
			contents.  Two  days later, my 
			mother's uncle is worth three million.

					HOLDEN
			At which time he marries the high 
			school sweetheart and lives happily 
			ever after.

					ALYSSA
			Not even close.  Inside the steamer 
			trunk, stenciled into the wood, or 
			something like that, is a curse.

					HOLDEN
			Someone wrote 'Fuck' inside his new 
			steamer trunk.

					ALYSSA
			Not that kind of curse.  A cryptic 
			curse "Great fortune means great loss" 
			it said.

					HOLDEN
			What kind of asshole writes that 
			inside a steamer trunk!

					ALYSSA
			The same kind of asshole that buries 
			silver ingots.  The day my mother's 
			uncle is heading out to see the girl, 
			he stops at his accountant's to grab 
			some cash, and winds up missing his 
			train.  So he has to take the next one 
			- which he does - and he gets there an 
			hour later than his usual time of 
			arrival, whereupon he sees lights.

					HOLDEN
			A hero's welcome for the new 
			millionaire.

					ALYSSA
			It seems that while she was standing 
			on the platform waiting that extra 
			hour for my mother's uncle to show up, 
			the girl was dragged into the bushes 
			by an unknown assailant, raped and 
			gutted.

	Holden is silent Alyssa downs her drink.

					ALYSSA
			The assailant was never apprehended.

					HOLDEN
				(beat)
			That's a love story!!

					ALYSSA
			Yes, and here's why: my mother's uncle 
			rode that train every day for the rest 
			of his life.  One day up, the next day 
			back.  Did that 'till the day he died.  
			He donated the fortune he'd acquired 
			to the train station in Pittsburgh, to 
			have a well-lit terminal built.  
			The train line let him ride for free 
			after that.

					HOLDEN
			I should hope so.  Jesus, that's the 
			saddest tale I've ever heard.

					ALYSSA
			That's my love story.

	Alyssa tosses her last dart.  Holden seems a bit dazed.  
	He looks out the window.

					HOLDEN
			Those two aren't on the hood of 
			Banky's car anymore.

					ALYSSA
			I told you It wasn't love.
				(grabs her purse)
			I gotta split.  It was really nice 
			meeting you.  I wish you the best of 
			luck with your book.
				(shakes his hand)
			Tell Hooper I'll call him later.  And 
			tell your friend to calm down.

	Alyssa exits to the night.  Holden stares after her.  Two 
	beats later, Hooper and Banky enter, holding an 
	'Everything's Archie' comic between them.

					BANKY
			You're insane.  Archie is not fucking 
			Mister Weatherbee!

					HOOPER
			Deny, deny, deny.
				(to Holden)
			Where's Alyssa?

					HOLDEN
			Huh!  Oh.  She left.  She said she'd 
			call you later.

					BANKY
				(off comic)
			He's just offering to help Archie with 
			his homework!

					HOOPER
			Read between the lines.

					BANKY
				(shoves book at him)
			Fuck this.
				(to Holden)
			Let's go.  Traffic.
				(no response from Holden)
			Holden!

					HOLDEN
				(shaken)
			What!

					BANKY
			Let's go.

					HOOPER
				(looking out window)
			D'jou see that dent in the hood of 
			your car!

					BANKY
				(looking out window)
			What the...!  Son of a bitch!

	Banky runs out Holden shrugs at Hooper.

					HOOPER
			Let me guess: you like her!

					HOLDEN
			Who?

					HOOPER
			Miss Alyssa Jones.

					HOLDEN
			She's alright.

					HOOPER
			As long as that's all.
				(finishes drink)
			Maybe you can convince that partner of 
			your's to drop me off downtown before 
			you scurry out the tunnel!

					HOLDEN
				(beat)
			Mister Weatherbee wasn't really trying 
			to fuck Archie, was he!

	They begin exiting.

					HOOPER
			Hell no.  Weatherbee was Reggie's 
			bitch.



	INT. STUDIO - DAY

	We're in Holden and Banky's studio/apartment.  It's a 
	rented loft-style place with high ceilings, wood floors 
	and sparse furnishings.  There are posters on the walls, 
	a sort of kitchenette, a hockey net, a big TV. (with all 
	the trimmings - VCR, Laserdisc player, Sega, SNES), a 
	huge comfy couch, and two drawing boards with adjacent 
	desks (littered with pencils, pens, coloring pencils, 
	paints, erasers, etc.) - at which sit Holden and Banky.  
	They're working.  Some music plays.

	C.U. OF HOLDEN PENCILING - over his shoulder, we see 
	Holden sketching Chronic in mid-attack of his arch-
	nemesis - the Giggler.  Holden erases a line and re-
	draws.

	C.U. OF BANKY INKING - over his shoulder, we see Banky 
	outlining a pre-penciled page.  He traces Bluntman 
	swinging from a street light.

	The two work in silence.  Then...

					BANKY
				(not looking up)
			This is one of the best street lights 
			you've ever drawn.

					HOLDEN
			It's the one across from the post 
			office.

					BANKY
			Looks just like it.

					HOLDEN
			Thanks.
				(beat)
			What do you wanna do tonight!

					BANKY
			Get a pizza.  Watch 'Degrassi Junior 
			High'.

					HOLDEN
				(erases)
			You got a weird thing for Canadian 
			melodrama.

					BANKY
			I've got a weird thing for girls who 
			say 'aboot'.

	The phone starts ringing.  Holden answers it, while still 
	drawing.

					HOLDEN
			Bank-Hold-Up.

	CROSSCUT between Holden and Hooper.  He's on a phone in a 
	CLUB.

					HOOPER
			Hooper here.  Listen, I know how you 
			burb-fiends hate the city, but there's 
			a club shindig going down that I think 
			you'd get into.

					HOLDEN
			Where is it?

					HOOPER
			Place called Her-sterectomy - I'm 
			tempting as bar-keep.

					HOLDEN
			I don't know, Hoop.  We're prepping 
			the next issue, and we've got our big 
			M-TV meeting in the morning.

					HOOPER
			I told her you wouldn't be interested.

					HOLDEN
			Told who?

					HOOPER
			Alyssa.

					HOLDEN
			Alyssa from last night Alyssa?

					HOOPER
			How do you begin and end a question 
			with the same word like that?  You got 
			skill.  Yes, that one.  She asked me 
			to invite you.  Now here's the part 
			where you say...

					HOLDEN
			I'll be there.

					HOOPER
			Thought so.  Ten o'clock.  Later.
				(both hang up)

					BANKY
			Who was that?

					HOLDEN
			Hooper.  He invited me to a club.

					BANKY
			When's that faggot going to learn - 
			you like chicks.

					HOLDEN
				(getting up)
			Not that kind of a club.

					BANKY
			So when we leaving?

					HOLDEN
			'We'?  You can't go.  He's setting me 
			up with Alyssa.

					BANKY
			And?

					HOLDEN
			And I don't want you messing it up.

					BANKY
			Like I care about your shit.  Maybe 
			I'll hook up myself.

					HOLDEN
				(pulling on coat)
			I just told you - it's not that kind 
			of club.

					BANKY
			How does one man get to be so funny!

					HOLDEN
				(throws him his coat)
			How are you going to get home if I 
			hook up!

					BANKY
			Like that'll happen.

					HOLDEN
			Let me explain something to you, my 
			witless chum the other night in that 
			bar, we two - Alyssa and I shared a 
			moment, alright!

					BANKY
			Oh, you had a moment!

					HOLDEN
				(brings his two pointer 
				fingers together)
			We shared a moment.  And in that 
			moment, one thing was made abundantly 
			clear: this girl loves me, my friend.   
			Loves-me.



6.	INT. HER-STERECTOMY - NIGHT						6.

	It's a club - people are mingling, a band is playing, 
	it's loud.  But something's fishy.  Hooper's tending bar.  
	He hands a GUY a drink.  The Guy sips it.

					GUY
			This is so watered down.  It's 
			terrible.  Why is it you can never get 
			a decent drink in these places!

	Hooper looks around in a very exaggerated fashion.

					GUY
			What are you doing!

					HOOPER
			Trying to find you a tissue.

	The Guy shoots Hooper an angry glare, Banky enters.

					BANKY
			Alright - bring on the free hootch.

					HOOPER
			As long as you don't bitch about how 
			little alcohol is in the drink.
				(hands Banky a drink; to Guy)
			You owe me five sixty.

					GUY
				(off Banky)
			And I suppose you're going to make 
			your friend here pay for his drink 
			right!

					BANKY
			Hey, I befriended a guy in a position 
			of authority so I could abuse that 
			authority and get free shit.  You want 
			to do the same?  There's a lonely 
			Hindu works at the'7-ll' across the 
			street.  Get in tight with him.

	The Guy angrily pulls out his money and slams it on the 
	bar.

					GUY
			I work at that '7-11'!
				(storms away)

					BANKY
				(calling after him)
			Wanna be friends!

					HOOPER
			Where's your better half!

					BANKY
			Taking a piss.  Guy's got a bladder 
			like an infant.

					HOOPER
			That's funny - he says you're hung 
			like an infant.

					BANKY
			Must his mother tell him everything!

	Holden enters.

					BANKY
			What'd you do - fall in love?

					HOLDEN
			Where is she?

					HOOPER
			Over there...

	ON THE DANCE FLOOR - in the middle of a thrall of people - 
	dances Alyssa.  She moves like a cat and she's looking 
	very sexy.

					OC HOOPER
			Been dancin' for an hour.  Hasn't 
			stopped yet.

	Hooper, Holden, and Banky stare OC.

					BANKY
			She ain't no Denny Terrio, I'll say 
			that.

	Holden smacks Banky and moves to exit.

					HOOPER
			Wait. wait, wait - there's something 
			you should know.

					HOLDEN
			She's got a boyfriend.

					HOOPER
			Well.. no.

					HOLDEN
			Then what's to know?

	Holden exits; They watch him go.  Banky looks around.

					BANKY
			There're a lot of chicks in this 
			place.

					HOOPER
			'Chicks'.  You're such a man.

					BANKY
				(beat)
			He didn't really say that about my 
			dick, did he!

	ON THE DANCE FLOOR - Holden slips into the crowd and 
	dances up to Alyssa.  He intentionally bumps into her.

					HOLDEN
				(fake rage, dancing)
			Hey, hey, hey - you fucked up my 
			cabbage-patch!

					ALYSSA
			Well, well, well - Bluntman himself.  
			Or should I call you Chronic!

					HOLDEN
			Call me flattered.  I heard you sent 
			me the invite to this little soiree'.

					ALYSSA
			From a former home-town girl, to 
			Mister Home-Town himself.

					HOLDEN
			You're saying you're from the 'burbs!

					ALYSSA
			Middletown, N.J.

					HOLDEN
			Get out of here!  I'm from Highlands!

					ALYSSA
			I know.  Hooper told me.

					HOLDEN
			How is it that we never ran into one 
			another?

					ALYSSA
			You graduate from Hudson?

					HOLDEN
			Yeah.  Eighty eight.

					ALYSSA
			I went to North.  Also eighty eight.

					HOLDEN
			What a small fucking world.  So you 
			know the tri-town area!

					ALYSSA
			Quiz me.

					HOLDEN
			Miller Hill?

					ALYSSA
			I wrote my name on the wall.

					HOLDEN
			Sandy Hook?

					ALYSSA
			Lost my virginity there.

					HOLDEN
			This is so cool.  The mall!

					ALYSSA
			Eden Prairie of Menlo Park!

					HOLDEN
			Wait - here's the big test: Quick 
			Stop!

					ALYSSA
			My best friend fucked a dead guy in 
			the back room.

					HOLDEN
			You know that girl!!

					ALYSSA
			I did.  Before she was committed.

					HOLDEN
			You know what this is!  This is fate.

					ALYSSA
				(regarding her move)
			No, this is the 'Rog'.

					HOLDEN
			I was talking about us meeting - what 
			are the chances!

					ALYSSA
			Pretty slim.  I haven't been back to 
			the 'burbs since my friend's funeral.

					HOLDEN
			The Quick Stop girl died!

					ALYSSA
			Another friend - Julie Dwyer.  She 
			died in the..

					HOLDEN
			Y.M.C.A pool!  Damn!  You knew her 
			too!

					ALYSSA
			So well.

					HOLDEN
			One friend in an asylum, the other 
			friend in the grave.  You're a 
			dangerous person to know.

					ALYSSA
			But I can tap.
				(does an impromptu tap dance)
			That was the Buffalo Two-Step.

					HOLDEN
			Very solid.

					ALYSSA
			That's what six years of tap lessons 
			yields.

					HOLDEN
			Two towns away from each other for 
			years and we had to meet in New York.

	The Sand stops playing. People clap.

					ALYSSA
			Coulda been worse - we could have not 
			met at all.

	Holden looks at her.

					OC SINGER
			Thank you.  Thanks.

	The SINGER on stage speaks into the microphone.

					SINGER
			A long time ago, we used to have this 
			bass player who took off one day to 
			draw funny books or something.  Maybe 
			you've seen her stuff - it's called 
			'Idiosyncratic Routine''

	The crowd applauds.  Alyssa shakes her head, smiling. 
	Holden pokes her.

					SINGER
			But what a lot of people don't know is 
			that she used to harbor these 
			delusions that she could sing.  And 
			she used to subject us to these 
			throaty renditions of Debbie Gibson 
			tunes and shit, insisting that we let 
			her front on a few numbers.  Well, we 
			didn't and she quit.. and then she got 
			famous, the bitch.
				(crowd laughs)
			But she's here tonight, and I think if 
			we all begged, or maybe offered her 
			some X, she'd get up here and treat us 
			to some of her vocal stylings.
				(crowd applauds)
			What do you say, Alyssa?

	Alyssa shakes her head no.  The crowd urges her.  Holden 
	pushes her forward.

					SINGER
			She's shy.
				(yelling)
			GET UP HERE AND SING, BITCH!!

	The crowd thunders.  Alyssa offers the Singer an 
	embarrassed half-smile.  She looks at Holden, who claps 
	along with the others and nods toward the stage.  Alyssa 
	shakes her head and relents, heading through the crowd

	Banky and Hooper stand at the bar.

					BANKY
			This is so queer.
				(he exits)

					HOOPER
				(beat)
			You don't know the half of it.

	Alyssa jumps on stage, hugging the Singer.  She takes the 
	mic, shaking her head.  The crowd is applauding.

					ALYSSA
			She is such a twat.

	The crowd cheers.  Alyssa laughs.  She turns to the band 
	and says something which they nod.  She turns back to the 
	crowd.

					ALYSSA
			Alright.  I should dedicate this, 
			right?
				(thinks)
			This is for that special someone our 
			there.

	Holden smiles.  Banky joins him.  Holden glances at him.  
	Banky offers a mocking mimic of his smile.

	The band starts playing.  Cross cutting begins.

	Alyssa launches into a torchy tune.  The song is 
	extremely sexy - as is Alyssa who works the mic, making 
	direct eye contact with...

	Holden.  Or does she!  Holden is smiling, being seduced,  
	Banky rolls his eyes.  Beside Holden, stands a pretty 
	GIRL with a short haircut, who's also riveted by Alyssa's 
	performance.

	Alyssa makes big-time eye contact with somebody out 
	there.  
	The song seems to be aimed at whoever she's looking at.  
	It's more than obvious there's a seduction going on, bur 
	of whom!  At the end of the song, the crowd goes wild but 
	Alyssa's preoccupied.  She points to someone in the 
	crowd, and curls her finger back in a 'c'mere' fashion, 
	urging whoever it is to join her.  She jumps off the 
	stage.

	Holden shakes his head sheepishly and looks downward, aw-
	shucks style.  At that moment, the Girl beside him leaps 
	forward.  Banky's eyes widen.  Holden looks up and is 
	suddenly taken aback.

	Alyssa and the Girl race into each other's arms and fall 
	into a way-to-passionate-to-mean-anything-else kiss.

	Holden's eyes bug.  Banky allows a smile to creep across 
	his face.  The crowd applauds.  Banky looks around, and 
	for the first time, we get the distinct impression that 
	this is a lesbian bar...

	There are a lot of chicks in this place.  Gay chicks.  
	Banky looks at Holden and slaps him on the back.

					BANKY
			Now that, my friend, is a..
				(brings his fingers together, 
				mimicing Holden)
			...shared moment

	Holden continues to stare - mouth agape.

	Alyssa and the Girl continue to kiss.



	INT. HER-STERECTOMY - LATER

	Banky, Holden, Alyssa and the Girl from the dance floor 
	sit around a table.  Alyssa and the Girl continue to make 
	out.  Holden and Banky casually watch, wide-eyed.  Banky 
	stares a little harder.  Holden hits him.

					BANKY
			What?!

					HOLDEN
				(under his breath)
			That's rude.

					BANKY
			Man, when are we ever going to get a 
			chance to see this kind of shit live 
			without paying for it?

	Alyssa and the Girl break their kiss.

					ALYSSA
			Uh-oh - better knock it off: we're 
			getting a man excited.

					HOLDEN
			Sorry.  It's just... new to him.

					BANKY
			Oh, and you're an old hand at this.

					ALYSSA
			No, I should apologize.  I don't 
			usually get all mushy in public.  But 
			it's been awhile since I've seen Kim 
			here.

					KIM
				(formerly the Girl)
			Tell me you didn't set that gross 
			display up with the band just so you 
			could nail me.

					ALYSSA
			Like I'd have to go through that much 
			effort

					KIM
			You know what!  I want to dance.

					ALYSSA
			Go ahead.  I'll watch from here.

					KIM
				(tugging at her arm)
			No.  I want to dance with you.

					ALYSSA
			Don't be such a rag.  I have to sit 
			here and work up the desire to fuck 
			you later.

					KIM
			Please.

	Kim exits.  Banky is smiling ear-to-ear.  Alyssa looks at 
	him.

					ALYSSA
			Yes?

					BANKY
			You said 'fuck'.  To that girl.  You 
			said you'd 'fuck' her.

					ALYSSA
			And?

					BANKY
			How can a girl 'fuck' another girl! 
			Were you talking about strap-ons or 
			something?

					HOLDEN
				(hits him)
			Would you shut up!!

					BANKY
			What!!?  It's a valid question.  You 
			know the dyke stuff in the Penthouse 
			Letters section is written by guys - 
			this is our chance to get the inside 
			scoop.

					HOLDEN
				(to Alyssa)
			I don't know how many times I can 
			apologize for him.

					ALYSSA
			It's okay.  Secretly, all I really 
			want is to be the center of attention.
				(to Banky)
			I've never used a snap-on.

					BANKY
			Then what's with saying 'fuck?  
			Shouldn't you say 'eat her out' or at 
			least modify the term 'fuck' with 
			something like 'fist'?

					ALYSSA
			Let me ask you a question - can men 
			'fuck' each other!

					BANKY
			Ask Hooper.

					ALYSSA
			In your estimation.

					BANKY
			Sure.

					ALYSSA
			So for you, to 'fuck' means to 
			penetrate.  You're used to the more 
			traditional definition - you inside 
			some girl you've duped, jack-hammering 
			away, not noticing that bored look in 
			her eyes.

					BANKY
			Hey - I always notice the bored look 
			in their eyes.

					ALYSSA
				(laughs)
			'Fucking' is nor limited to 
			penetration, Banky. For me it 
			describes any sex when it's not 
			totally about love.  I don't love Kim, 
			but I'll fuck her.  I'm sure you don't 
			love every girl you sleep with.

					BANKY
			Some of them I downright loathe.

					ALYSSA
			But I'll bet it's different with the 
			ones you love.  I'll bet you go the 
			full nine when it's not just a quick 
			fix - like you go down on them longer 
			or something.

					HOLDEN
			Here we go.

					BANKY
			I don't do that.

					ALYSSA
			What?!?!

					BANKY
			I stopped dropping.  It got to be too 
			frustrating.

					HOLDEN
			As stupid as you usually come off 
			during this diatribe of your's, you're 
			going to come off ten times as stupid 
			on this occasion.

					BANKY
			What?!  I lost my tolerance for the 
			bullshit baggage that comes with 
			eating girls out.  What's the big 
			deal?!

					ALYSSA
			If you say the smell, so help me, I'll 
			slug you.

					BANKY
			Not the smell - the smell is good.  
			I'm talking about not being able to do 
			it property.  And my mother brought me 
			up to believe that if I can't do 
			something
			right I shouldn't do it at all.  Of 
			course, my father told me she gave 
			lousy head, but that's beside the 
			point.

					ALYSSA
			At least you blame yourself for your 
			sexual inadequacies.

					BANKY
			No, I blame them.  Chicks never help 
			you out.  They never tell you what to 
			do.  And most of them are self-
			conscious about that smell factor, and 
			so most of the time they just lay 
			there, frozen like a deer in the 
			headlights, right?  Not for nothing, 
			but when a chick goes down on me.  I 
			let her know where to go, and what the 
			status is.  You gotta handle it like 
			CNN and the Weather Channel - constant 
			updates.

					HOLDEN
			You're such an idiot.

					ALYSSA
			No, he's got a point.  That's how I 
			was in high school - I was nervous, 
			and inhibited about being eaten out.  
			But by the time I got to college, that 
			all changed.  I loosened up.  Not only 
			did I learn to communicate - I learned 
			to be bossy.  
			I was like one of those guys at the 
			airport with those big flash lights - 
			waving them this way, directing them 
			that way, telling them when to stop.

					BANKY
			And that's all I'm saying, it'd be 
			different if chicks helped out - 
			pointed a guy in the right direction.  
			Then there'd be no bullshit, no wasted 
			time, and no chance for permanent 
			injuries.

					ALYSSA
			Permanent injuries?

					BANKY
			Sure.  You wanna see something 
			permanent!
				(pulls our front tooth)
			I got this from Nina Rollins, 
			sophomore year.  I'm going down on 
			her, and out of nowhere, her cat jumps 
			on her stomach.  She does this big ol' 
			pelvic thrust - cracks my tooth in 
			half, sends it down my throat.  I had 
			to get a crown for the stub.

					ALYSSA
				(to Holden)
			I got that beat.
				(to Banky)
			I got that beat.
				(half-turns and lifts chin)
			Sophomore year.  I'm going down on 
			Cynthia Slater in her dorm room after 
			we went club-hopping.  I'm totally 
			drunk, and in the middle of it, I fall 
			asleep - right there in her lap.  She 
			got so mad, she digs her heel into my
			back, right there.
				(points to scar)
			That's permanent.

					BANKY
			You see this!
				(moves neck slightly right)
			That's the farthest I can move my neck 
			to the right Sophomore year, I'm going 
			out with Maria Bennert, and for six 
			months, I'm going down on her, and not 
			a damn thing's happening.  
			Then one night, I change a position, 
			or vary my lapping-speed, and suddenly 
			it's a whole new world.  She's moving 
			around, convulsing, breathing heavy.  
			And her legs are pressing against my 
			ears so tightly that I don't hear her 
			father come into the room.  He grabs 
			my hair...
				(grabs his own hair and pulls 
				back)
			...and he pulls me way back, hard.

					ALYSSA
				(throws up her leg, and rolls 
				up pants)
			Senior year.  Spring Formal.  I'm 
			eating our Missy Kurt in her brother's 
			car.  She's laying across the back 
			seat, and I'm half-hanging out of the 
			car, my knees on the ground.  She's 
			flailing around, and she knocks the 
			parking brake off.  The car starts 
			rolling down the hill, and my right 
			knee is cut up all to shit like a 
			kiddy's scissor class cut it up for 
			paper dolls.

	Banky and Alyssa laugh.  Holden looks at a small scar on 
	his arm and thinks better about mentioning it.  Then Kim 
	re-enters and plants a big kiss on Alyssa's neck.

					HOLDEN
				(off Banky's watch)
			Holy shit, is that the time.  We've 
			gotta beat traffic.

					BANKY
			What traffic - it's one thirty in the 
			morning!

					HOLDEN
				(getting up)
			And rush hour starts in six hours.  
			Let's go.
				(to Alyssa)
			Thanks for inviting us out.  It was... 
			educational.

	Alyssa waves at him as he exits.  Banky slides out of the 
	booth.

					BANKY
				(to Kim)
			Since you like chicks, right.. 
			do you just look at yourself in the 
			mirror all the time?

	Holden reaches in and pulls Banky out.  Alyssa watches 
	them go, then turns and kisses Kim.



	INT. M-TV EXEC'S OFFICE WAITING ROOM - DAY

	Holden looks preoccupied.  Banky flips through magazines, 
	biting off mini pieces of the gum he's chewing.  He 
	sticks them between pages, presses the mag closed, picks 
	up another one and then repeats the whole process.  A 
	Receptionist types.

					BANKY
				(off Holden's look)
			You're still dwelling on the dyke, 
			aren't you?

					HOLDEN
			Lower your voice.

					BANKY
			What'd I tell you - she just needs the 
			right guy.  All every woman really 
			wants - be it mother, senator, nun - 
			is some serious deep-dicking.

	The Receptionist stops typing and looks at Banky, 
	shocked.

					BANKY
				(off her look)
			Don't give me that look - I heard Adam 
			Curry say worse.

	The Secretary goes back to typing.  Banky shrugs at 
	Holden.

					BANKY
			That's why I can't buy lesbians.  
			Everyone needs dick.  See, I can buy 
			fags.  Bunch of guys that need dick - 
			just plain need it?  That I get.  
			Dykes?  Bullshit posturing.  But - 
			live and let live, I guess.

					HOLDEN
			I'm sure the gay community appreciates 
			your support.

	JOHN SLOSS, the boy's lawyer, joins them.

					SLOSS
			Please tell me you haven't blown this 
			deal already.

					BANKY
			Sloss like a mother fucker.
				(slaps his hand)

					SLOSS
			Hey, every mother but your's - a 
			shyster's gotta have his standards. 
			Shall we?



	INT. M-TV EXEC'S OFFICE - DAY

	The EXECS are a casual couple of guys, sitting on couches 
	across from our trio.

					EXEC 1
			We just want to start off by saying 
			that it's a pleasure to finally meet 
			you.  While it's been - shall we say - 
			an experience dealing with Sloss here, 
			one of the main reasons we started 
			this whole thing was to meet the guys 
			that do 'Bluntman and Chronic'.

					EXEC 2
				(points at them)
			'Snootchie Bootchies'.

	The Execs and Sloss laugh.  Holden and Banky politely 
	join in.  Banky shoots Holden a 'these guys are idiots' 
	look.

					EXEC 1
			Which brings us to our proposal: we 
			are extremely interested in doing 
			twelve, half-hour 'Bluntman and 
			Chronic' cartoons.  The age of Beavis 
			is coming to a close, and we're 
			looking for something... something...

					BANKY
			Even more retarded and juvenile to 
			sate the voracious, intellectually-
			challenged miscreants that make up 
			your key demographic.

	The Execs laugh hard.  Sloss secretly shrugs to Banky and 
	gives the thumbs up.

					EXEC 1
				(composes himself)
			So what do you say! Are we in 
			business!

	Banky leans back into the couch, wearing a thoughtful 
	face.  He looks to Holden, then to Sloss.  Sloss nods in 
	understanding.

					SLOSS
			Jim, Sean - could we have a few 
			minutes!

					EXEC 2
				(looks to Exec 1)
			Uh... absolutely.  We'll just..

					EXEC 1
			Uh...wait outside

	The Exec's smile and head our, closing the door behind 
	then.  Sloss turns to Banky.

					SLOSS
			So?  Did I do good?

					BANKY
			You did better - you sold us out!

	They clasp hands and quietly explode in ebullience.

					SLOSS
			Do you know how much you'll make on 
			merchandising alone!

					BANKY
				(as Simon Bar Sinister)
			Money and Power, and Money and 
			Power...

					SLOSS
				(joins in)
			Money dnd Power, and Money and...

					HOLDEN
				(interrupting)
			I don't think it's a good idea.

	Banky and Sloss freeze.  They stare at Holden.

					BANKY
			What's not a good idea!  Please don't 
			say the cartoon, please don't say the 
			cartoon...

					HOLDEN
			The cartoon.

					SLOSS
			What?!?  Are you out of your fucking 
			mind!

					BANKY
				(getting up)
			John, let me handle this.
				( to Holden)
			You are out of your fucking mind, 
			aren't you!

					HOLDEN
			Is this how you want to be remembered!  
			As the guy who created Bluntman and 
			Chronic!

	Banky sits at the Exec's desk and starts rifling through 
	the guy's stuff.

					BANKY
			No, I'd like to be remembered as the 
			filthy rich guy who created Bluntman 
			and Chronic.

					HOLDEN
			But it'll be all glossy and main-
			stream.  We'll lose any artistic 
			credibility we ever had.

					SLOSS
				(to Banky)
			Is it me!  I don't see the problem.

					BANKY
				(to Sloss)
			He just has to get over this crush of 
			his.

					SLOSS
			Oh God - not on Carrie Fisher again!
				(to Holden)
			Holden - she's not really a Princess.

					BANKY
				(opening drawer with a letter 
				opener)
			Not on her; on Alyssa Jones - the 
			chick that does that comic book 
			'Idiosyncratic Routine'.  You ever 
			seen it?

					SLOSS
			Please.  Like I even read your comic, 
			let alone anyone else's,
				(to Holden)
			I'm not limited to offering you legal 
			counsel only, my friend.  I'm also 
			learned in the ways of the heart, and 
			can offer you this advice - nail her, 
			get it out of your system, and move 
			on.  Like we say at Sloss Law - good 
			fences make good neighbors.

					BANKY
			She'd never let him in her yard.  The 
			chick's gay.

					SLOSS
				(laughing)
			She's gay?  You fell for a gay, comic-
			book writing chick?  Holden, you poor, 
			poor man!
				(beat)
			Wait a sec - does she have 
			representation!

					BANKY
			Always working, you.
				(holds up a Polaroid of a 
				naked woman)
			Look at this - Mrs. M-TV Exec has a 
			string of pearls hanging our of her 
			ass,

					SLOSS
			Would you leave his stuff alone!
				(to Holden)
			You can break her resolve, killer.  
			All it takes is one good man.  But if 
			it takes two good men, don't hesitate 
			to call me.  That being said, in 
			regards to the more pressing issue, I 
			suggest you leave art to the museums 
			and grab on with both hands to the 
			big, fat check.

					HOLDEN
			I'll give it some thought

					BANKY
				(holding up Polaroid)
			I'm taking this as a precaution - just 
			in case they give us any shit about 
			pussy's decision delay.
				(glaring at Holden)
			You'll 'give it some thought'.  You're 
			so retarded

					HOLDEN
			I'm retarded!  This from the guy who 
			only forty five minutes ago paid fifty 
			bucks for what's supposed to be a boot-
			leg of 'March of the Wooden Soldiers' 
			with a deleted scene of Stan Laurel 
			wearing a French Tickler.

					SLOSS
			How'd you fall for that!

					BANKY
			The guy who sold it to me had an 
			honest face.



	INT. STUDIO - DAY

	There is a door.  There's a knock at the door.  Holden 
	opens it and Alyssa is standing there.

					ALYSSA
			Somebody told me that they make comic 
			books here, and I've got an idea for 
			this story about a guy who comes to a 
			club and high-tails it when he finds 
			out this girl is pay.  Any interest in 
			a story like that!

	Holden smiles.



	EXT. RIVERFRONT PARK - DAY

	Alyssa and Holden walk through the park, eating hot dogs.

					ALYSSA
			M-TV?

					HOLDEN
			Twelve episodes.

					ALYSSA
			That's great, isn't it?

					HOLDEN
			Banky seems to think so.

					ALYSSA
			But you don't.

	They come to a swing set and sit down on the swings.

					HOLDEN
			I don't know if that's the perception 
			I want people to have of our stuff.  I 
			know this sounds pretentious as hell, 
			but I like to think of us as artists.  
			And I'd like to get back to doing 
			something more personal - like our 
			first book.

					ALYSSA
			Well when are you going to do that?

					HOLDEN
				(beat)
			As soon as we have something personal 
			to say.

					ALYSSA
			Do you know how pretty you are?

					HOLDEN
			What?

					ALYSSA
			You're a pretty man.

					HOLDEN
			Uh... thanks.

					ALYSSA
			Oh.  I get it.  I'm into girls, so I 
			have to find all men repulsive or 
			something.

					HOLDEN
			I didn't say anything.

					ALYSSA
			Aren't there some men that you find 
			attractive?  Granted, not enough to 
			sleep with, but still - just handsome 
			or something!

					HOLDEN
			Sure.  Harrison Ford.  And our mail-
			man.

					ALYSSA
			Well it's the same thing.  I look at 
			you and just find you really handsome.  
			And you know, it has very little to do 
			with your look, per-se.  Your look is 
			fine, don't get me wrong.  But it's 
			more your outlook.  The things you 
			say, the way you see things.  It's... 
			I don't know... attractive,

	Holden looks away, embarrassed,

					ALYSSA
			I weirded you our the other night

					HOLDEN
			Huh!  No, not really.

					ALYSSA
			Come on.

					HOLDEN
				(beat)
			It's just that we've.., I mean, I've 
			never seen that kind of thing up close 
			and personal.  It just took awhile to 
			process, longer than usual.

					ALYSSA
			Do you want to talk about it!

					HOLDEN
			Um.  If you want to.

					ALYSSA
			I like you.  I haven't liked a man in 
			a long time.  And I'm not a man-hater 
			or something.  It's just been some 
			time since I've been exposed to a man 
			that didn't immediately live-into a 
			stereotype of some sort.  And I want 
			you to feel comfortable with me, 
			because I want us to be friends.  So 
			if there are things you'd like to 
			know, it's okay to ask me.

					HOLDEN
				(beat)
			Why girls?

					ALYSSA
				(beat)
			Why men?

					HOLDEN
			Because that's the standard

					ALYSSA
			If that's the only reason you're 
			attracted to women - because it's the 
			standard..

					HOLDEN
			It's more than that.

					ALYSSA
			So you've never been curious about 
			men?

					HOLDEN
			Curious about men?  Well... I always 
			wondered why my father watched 'Hee-
			Haw'.

					ALYSSA
			You know what I mean.

					HOLDEN
			No.

					ALYSSA
			Why not!

					HOLDEN
			No interest.

					ALYSSA
			Because...?

					HOLDEN
			Girls feel right.

					ALYSSA
			And that's how I feel.  I've never 
			really been attracted to men.  I'm 
			more comfortable with the idea of 
			girls.

					HOLDEN
			Wait, wait, wait - you're still a 
			virgin?

					ALYSSA
			No.

					HOLDEN
			But you've only been with girls.

					ALYSSA
			You're saying a person's a virgin 
			until they've had intercourse with a 
			member of the opposite sex?

					HOLDEN
			Isn't that the standard definition?

					ALYSSA
			Again with the standards.  I think 
			virginity is lost when you make love 
			for the first time.

					HOLDEN
			With a member of the opposite sex.

					ALYSSA
			Why?  Why only then?

					HOLDEN
			Because that's the standard.

					ALYSSA
			So if a virgin is raped, then she's 
			still a virgin?

					HOLDEN
			Of course not.

					ALYSSA
			But rape is not the standard.  So 
			she's had sex, but not the standard 
			idea of sex.  Hence, according to  
			your definition, she'd still be a 
			virgin.

					HOLDEN
			Okay, I'll revise.  Virginity is lost 
			when the hymen is broken.

					ALYSSA
			Then I lost my virginity at ten, 
			because I fell on a fence post when I 
			was ten, and it broke my hymen.  Now I 
			have to tell people that I lost it to 
			a wooden post I'd known my whole young 
			life?

					HOLDEN
			Second revision - virginity is lost 
			through penetration.

					ALYSSA
			Physical penetration or emotional?

					HOLDEN
			Emotional?

					ALYSSA
			Well, I fell in love hard with Caitlin 
			Bree when we were in high school.

					HOLDEN
			Physical penetration.

					ALYSSA
			We had sex.

					HOLDEN
			Yeah, but not real sex.

					ALYSSA
			I move to have that remark stricken 
			from the record.  On account of it 
			makes you come off as completely naive 
			and infantile.

					HOLDEN
			Well where's the penetration in 
			lesbian sex.

	Alyssa holds up her hand.

					HOLDEN
			A finger?  Come on.  I've had my 
			finger in my ass but I wouldn't say 
			I've had anal sex.

					ALYSSA
			Did I hold up a finger?
				(waves her hand)

					HOLDEN
				(beat; then he gets it)
			You're kidding?!?!
				(she nods)
			How...?!?

					ALYSSA
			Our bodies are built to pass a child, 
			for Christ's sake.

					HOLDEN
			But doesn't it hurt?!

					ALYSSA
			Sure.  But in a good way.  And it's 
			only a once-in-awhile thing - reserved 
			for really special occasions.

					HOLDEN
			What about not-so-special occasions?

					ALYSSA
			Tongue only.

					HOLDEN
			But how can that be enough?  I mean, 
			let's be real - how big can a tongue 
			even get?

	Alyssa swallows what she's chewing and releases her 
	tongue, which is just huge.  Holden is transfixed.  
	Alyssa wraps it back up and smiles, standing.

					ALYSSA
			Let's go.

	She exits. Holden remains in the swing.  Alyssa comes 
	back in.

					ALYSSA
			Come on.

					HOLDEN
			Just...uh... just give me a moment.



	INT AIRPORT - DAY

	Holden enters. Banky tries to balance way-too-much 
	luggage.

					HOLDEN
			Look at you.  It's a two day trip.

					BANKY
			I got the Sega in one bag, my clothes 
			in the other, and two months worth of 
			unread comics in this one.

					HOLDEN
			We're going to a convention, for the 
			love of God.  We'll be busy from ten 
			'till eight each day. 
			When are you possibly going to have 
			time for any of that shit?  In fact, 
			fuck it - you're leaving some of this 
			shit here in a locker.  Come on - give 
			me the two that aren't clothes.

					BANKY
			Hold on.
				(starts rifling through one 
				bag)

					HOLDEN
			What are you doing?

					BANKY
			I just have to get something.
				(pulls out a huge stack of 
				porno books)

					HOLDEN
			Who are you, Larry fucking Flynt?  
			What are you going to do with all of 
			those?

					BANKY
			Read the articles.  What do you think 
			I'm going to do with them?  They're 
			stroke books.

					HOLDEN
			You've got like thirty books there!  
			We're only there for two days!

					BANKY
				(leafing through mags)
			Variety's the spice of life.  I like a 
			wide selection.  Sometimes I'm in the 
			mood for nasty close-ups, sometimes I 
			like them arty and air-brushed.  Some 
			times it's a spread brown-eye kind of 
			night, sometimes it's girl-on-girl 
			time.  Sometimes a steamy letter will 
			do it, sometimes - not often, but 
			sometimes - I like the idea of a chick 
			with a horse.

	A beeping sound is heard.  Holden checks his beeper.

					HOLDEN
			Go check us in.  I've gotta call 
			Alyssa.

					BANKY
			His master's voice.

					HOLDEN
			Put that stuff away.

	Holden exits.  Banky starts packing his mags up.  A 
	little KID enters, staring at him.

					KID
			What are those?

					BANKY
				(looks at kid then books)
			Do you Like horsies?

	Holden finishes dialing the phone.  Cross cut between him 
	and Alyssa at home.

					ALYSSA
			I hope for the sake of the women 
			you've dated that you're only this 
			quick in returning calls.

					HOLDEN
			What's up?  I'm about to get on a 
			plane.

					ALYSSA
			Ohhh.  Why!

					HOLDEN
			Last minute invite to the Dragon Con'.

					ALYSSA
			Shit.

					HOLDEN
			What?

					ALYSSA
			My sister's at my parents'.  I was 
			gonna go see her.

					HOLDEN
			The one that wrote the book?

					ALYSSA
			Yeah.  But I was staying all weekend, 
			and I wanted to hang our with you.  
			This sucks.

					HOLDEN
			You didn't get invited to the Con'?

					ALYSSA
			I don't do southern con's - all the 
			chicks have that annoying drawl.  You 
			know how hard it is nor to laugh when 
			someone moans "Fuhhk me"?

					HOLDEN
			Well this sucks.
				(thinks)
			You know - both of us don't have to 
			go.

					ALYSSA
			Really?

					HOLDEN
			Yeah.  Banky can go by himself.  It's 
			not like we're on a panel.  It was 
			just a signing appearance.

					ALYSSA
			If you come pick me up, I'll be your 
			best friend.

					HOLDEN
				(beat)
			Where's your apartment?

					ALYSSA
			I'm not there.  I'm at a friend's - in 
			the Village.  Corner of Houston and 
			Mercer.  Number eighty six, apartment 
			6-D.

					HOLDEN
			I'll be there in half an hour.

					ALYSSA
			You're so easy.

	They hang up.  Holden reacts to something OC and exits 
	quickly.

	C11. Banky points to pictures in the book.  The kid looks 
	on.

					BANKY
			...And then Black Beauty couldn't take 
			it any longer, and he finally did some 
			of his own mounting.

					KID
				(off book)
			Wow.

	Holden grabs Banky's arm and drags him away.

					HOLDEN
			What are you doing?

					BANKY
				(waving to kid)
			I think I want kids of my own one day.  
			They're fun.

					HOLDEN
			Listen to me - I'm not going.  You're 
			going to have to do this one by 
			yourself.

					BANKY
			What?  Why?

					HOLDEN
			Alyssa's coming down for the weekend, 
			so I want to hang out with her.  You 
			don't need me for this.
				(taking his excess baggage)
			Meantime,  I'll take this stuff home.  
			You can keep the filth.  I'll pick you 
			up at nine Sunday night, alright?  
			Don't forget to plug the Annual and 
			don't mention the t.v. show, okay?  
			Call me if you get bored.

	And he's gone.  Banky stands there, open-mouthed.  A 
	check-in FLIGHT ATTENDANT comes up to him.  His name-tag 
	reads 'Frank'.

					FLIGHT ATTENDANT
			Checking in, sir!

					BANKY
				(still watching Holden go)
			Hunhh!
				(looks at F.A.)
			Yeah.  But this is carry-on.

					F.A.
			Federal aviation security law requires 
			me to ask if you've been given any 
			strange gifts or parcels to carry-on 
			since arriving at the airport today.

					BANKY
				(thinks)
			Not this trip.  But one time, when I 
			was using curb side check-in, this sky-
			cap gave me a cock ring and a set of 
			anal ben-wa balls.  I always thought 
			that was pretty strange.  He said his 
			name was Frank.
				(looks closely at him)
			Hey!  You're name's Frank!

	Banky storms away.  The Flight Attendant watches him go.

					F.A.
			Fucking kids.



	EXT APARTMENT 6-D - DAY

	Holden knocks at the door.  It opens.  A WOMAN is 
	standing in the doorway in her bra She looks Holden up 
	and down and smirks.

					WOMAN
			Let me guess - 'the right man'?

					HOLDEN
			Excuse me?

					WOMAN
			You've got it in your head that 
			Alyssa's not really into chicks - that 
			she just hasn't met the right man.  
			And you believe you're it.  You're 
			going to treat her right, fuck her 
			like a stud, and 'straight-jacket' her 
			back from the land of the lost.  And 
			the sad truth is that you'll 
			accomplish none of that and wind up as 
			either an even more bitter misogynist 
			or a reverse fag-hag.

	Holden's at a loss.  Alyssa slips past the Woman, 
	carrying an overnight bag.

					ALYSSA
			Don't mind her.  That's just her way a 
			saying hello.

					WOMAN
			Actually, it's just my way of saying 
			"Give it up."

					ALYSSA
				(to Woman)
			You're such an asshole.

					WOMAN
			When you file the date-rape charges, 
			don't say I didn't warn you.

					HOLDEN
				(holding out hand)
			I'm Holden, by the way.

					WOMAN
			I'm the voice of reason that Miss 
			Bitch is having such a hard time 
			listening to.

					HOLDEN
			Look, we're just friends.

					WOMAN
			That's what every guy says before he 
			tries purring your hand on his dick.

					HOLDEN
			And how do you know men so well?

					WOMAN
			Because I lapdance for a living, dick-
			head.

	She slams the door. Holden looks to Alyssa.

					ALYSSA
			Ohhh - you look so cute!

	She heads down the stairs.

					HOLDEN
			Who was that?

					ALYSSA
			Just an occasional friend.

					HOLDEN
			Why would you want to hang our with 
			someone bitter as that?

					ALYSSA
				(stops)
			Remember this!
				(sticks out huge tongue)
			Her's is even bigger than that.

	She smiles and continues on.  Holden looks back up at the 
	door.  He sticks his own tongue our and sizes it with his 
	fingers.



	EXT TURNPIKE - DAY

	The car sits in traffic.



	INT CAR - DAY

	Holden sighs.  Alyssa plays with the radio.

					ALYSSA
			You were raised Catholic, right?

					HOLDEN
			Yeah.  You?

					ALYSSA
			Baptist.

					HOLDEN
			Really?  Did you have a strict 
			upbringing?

					ALYSSA
			Please There was no time to be bad - 
			we were too busy saying 'Jesus'.

					HOLDEN
			You think your upbringing had 
			something to do with your lifestyle 
			choice?

					ALYSSA
			Somewhere along the line.  It's a 
			gradual transition to make - from 
			doing what the majority does to taking 
			a leap of faith and doing what feels 
			more natural.  Everything helps - from 
			the way you were handled as a kid, to 
			the way the boys acted in third grade, 
			to the shoes you wore at your freshman 
			prom.

					HOLDEN
			Shoes?

					ALYSSA
			Well they were really tight.



	HANGING OUT MONTAGE BEGINS

	With the requisite music, over which we hear a 
	conversation between Holden and Alyssa.

	1) Holden and Alyssa sit in the DINER eating.  Holden's 
	talking.  The Waitress walks past and drops her pad.  She 
	bends over, to pick it up, hiking her mini-skirt up in 
	the process.  Alyssa stares at her ass.  Holden stops 
	talking and stares at her.  Alyssa looks over at him and 
	offers a caught smile.

	2) Holden pushes a shopping cart at the FOOD STORE, 
	throwing various things into the basket.  Alyssa comes up 
	with a box of Tampons and throws them in.  Holden glances 
	at them, a bit flushed.  Alyssa catches him, picks up the 
	box, and pulls one out.  She proceeds to demonstrate 
	their usage, throwing one leg on the can and miming 
	insertion.  Holden puts up his hands in the "I know, I 
	know," fashion.

	3) In the Studio, Holden displays some of his artwork to 
	Alyssa, during which she pulls out a cigarette and goes 
	to light it.  It's a child-proof lighter, so she's having 
	trouble.  Holden grows a little frustrated.  Finally, he 
	grabs the lighter and pulls the child proof tab out with 
	his teeth.  Alyssa stares at him a bit taken aback.  
	Holden spits the tab out, and lights Alyssa's smoke.  He 
	then continues with his display.

	4) Holden and Alyssa at the COMIC BOOK STORE.  Steve-Dave 
	and the Fan-Boy eye them suspiciously.  Alyssa pays for a 
	comic.  Steve-Dave glowers at Holden.  He gives Alyssa 
	her change and they exit.  Steve-Dave goes back to his 
	card game with the Fan-Boy.  Suddenly, a garbage can 
	comes crashing through their window.  Steve-Dave rips a 
	check off the garbage can and punches the counter.  The 
	Fan-Boy rubs his back soothingly,

	5) Holden and Alyssa walk through a PARKING LOT, talking.  
	She takes his hand and pulls his arm around her shoulder. 
	Holden smiles to himself.

					HOLDEN V.O.
			Let me ask you something - we get 
			along, right?

					ALYSSA V.O.
			Famously.

					HOLDEN V.O.
			We have a definite chemistry?

					ALYSSA V.O.
			So it would seem.

					HOLDEN V.O.
			But we're both into girls.

					ALYSSA V.O.
			I'm into women.

					HOLDEN V.O.
			But you weren't always gay.

					ALYSSA V.O.
			When I was nine I had a crush on Scott 
			Baio.

					HOLDEN V.O.
			So If we'd met a long time ago, say in 
			high school...

					ALYSSA V.O.
			...I'd still be muff-diving, yes.

					HOLDEN V.O.
			Thought so.



	INT STUDIO - DAY

	Holden and Banky play EA Sports Hockey on Sega.  There's 
	a knock at the door.

					HOLDEN
			Come in.

	Alyssa enters and stands besides them, smiling at their 
	game.

					ALYSSA
			I read somewhere that guys who play 
			hockey are merely making up for penile 
			deficiencies by carrying big sticks.

					BANKY
			I thought you lived in the city?  This 
			is like the umpteenth time I've seen 
			you here.  Isn't that grounds enough 
			for the little pink mafia to throw you 
			out of their club?

					HOLDEN
				(hits Banky; to Alyssa)
			I'll be ready in a second.  
			I just have to school this mouthy 
			second-stringer.

					BANKY
			Bitch, you're schooling no one.

	They play.  Cut back and forth between the game and 
	Banky, Holden, and Alyssa.

					HOLDEN
				(off game)
			What?  Do something!

					BANKY
				(off game)
			You fucking cock-teaser.  I'll knock 
			your fucking teeth out and pass all 
			over your ass.

					HOLDEN
			Look at how slow you are.  Christ, you 
			move like a geriatric.

					BANKY
				(screaming at screen)
			Fuck!  You Fucking cock-sucker, man!  
			These faggots won't do what I tell 
			them to!

					HOLDEN
			Oh. It's the controller, right?  It's 
			always the controller.

					BANKY
			No, it's these... fucking queers on 
			blades that can't accept a fucking 
			pass to save their lives!  What period 
			is this?

					HOLDEN
			Final sixty of the third.

					BANKY
			Fuck!  Look at your fucking guys, 
			they... FUCK!!!
				(whips controller)
			FUCKING COCK SUCKER, MAN!  I SWEAR TO 
			GOD!

	Banky storms away.  Alyssa looks at Holden,

					HOLDEN
			Imagine if I'd only beaten him by one 
			instead of thirty.



	INT SKEE-BALL ARCADE - DAY

	Holden feeds a couple dollars into the change machine.  
	Alyssa looks on.

					ALYSSA
			Explain this again.

					HOLDEN
			How could you have grown up down the 
			shore and never played skee-ball?  
			What did you do with your youth?

	They head toward the skee-ball runs.

					ALYSSA
			Stayed out late, smoked pot, screwed 
			around.

					HOLDEN
			Not your grade school years; your high 
			school years.

					ALYSSA
				(off skee-ball run)
			This looks complicated.

					HOLDEN
				(Inserts coin and pulls 
				lever)
			The premise is very basic - you roll 
			the ball up the ramp at varying 
			speeds, in an effort to pop it into 
			the score circles.  The higher the 
			score, the more prize tickets you get.

					ALYSSA
			What do you do with the prize tickets?

					HOLDEN
			Trade them in for prizes that aren't 
			worth nearly as much as you paid to 
			play the game.

					ALYSSA
			Then what's the point?

					HOLDEN
			It's fun.

					ALYSSA
			And you question my lifestyle.

					HOLDEN
			Observe.

	Holden rolls the ball.  It pops into a twenty point 
	circle.

					HOLDEN
			See?  It's just that simple.

					ALYSSA
			Why not just walk up there and put it 
			in the fifty every time?

					HOLDEN
			Where's the skill in that?

					ALYSSA
			Oh, this is a skill?  I'm sorry, I had 
			no idea.

					HOLDEN
			Just toss one.

	Alyssa picks up a ball, squints to aim, and whips it 
	overhand.  It pops off one of the circles and shoots back 
	at them, missing them as they duck.  An OC knock and an 
	"OW!" is heard.  Holden reacts as Alyssa laughs.

					HOLDEN
				(to OC guy)
			I'm sorry, man.  She's new at this.

	Holden ducks as the ball comes sailing back at his head.  
	He gets up.

					HOLDEN
				(to OC)
			Thank you.
				(hands Alyssa another ball)
			Underhand.  Throw it underhand.

					ALYSSA
			This is where you take straight chicks 
			on dates?

					HOLDEN
			It's like Spanish Fly.  This'll 
			probably be the first time I don't 
			score afterwards.

					ALYSSA
			I don't know.  I'm starting to get a 
			tingle in my bottom.
				(tosses a ball)
			Ten.

					HOLDEN
				(grabs a ball)
			So what'd you do last night?
				(prepares to throw)

					ALYSSA
			Got laid

	Holden whips the ball in surprise.  It ricochets off the 
	ceiling and through the glass of an old pinball machine.  
	Alyssa laughs.  Holden looks around, nervously.

					ALYSSA
			Some more of that skill you were 
			telling me about?

					HOLDEN
			Maybe we should just leave before 
			somebody gets hurt.

					ALYSSA
			No way.  I want a cheap prize.
				(throws a ball)
			So your friend's quite the homophobe.

					HOLDEN
			He just feels left out, I think.

					ALYSSA
			I'm not talking about his infantile 
			hang-up with me.  I'm talking about 
			when you two were playing that game.  
			Everytime he swore - when his players 
			messed up, he called them cocksuckers, 
			he referred to the players as queers, 
			he called you a cock-teaser...

					HOLDEN
			I thought he was talking to you.

					ALYSSA
			I know you think it means nothing, and 
			it may in fact be unintentional, but 
			it's ugly all the same.

					HOLDEN
			He was just pissed he was losing.

					ALYSSA
			So he slams the gay community?

					HOLDEN
			C'mon.  Don't get all p.c. on me.

					ALYSSA
			I'm not.  But what is that saying?

					HOLDEN
			It says he gets too easily frustrated.

					ALYSSA
			It's passive/agressive gay-bashing.

					HOLDEN
			How do you figure?

					ALYSSA
			How casually did it roll off his 
			tongue?  And that's how he expresses 
			his anger?  By calling people faggots?

					HOLDEN
			I think you're reading too much into 
			it.

					ALYSSA
			I think you're just so used to it that 
			it rolls off your back.  I've heard 
			the two of you play your little rank 
			out game where one insists the other 
			is gay.
				(as the boys)
			"You're a faggot.  No, you're a 
			faggot."  It's cute and all to watch 
			you go at it like grade-schooler, but 
			it's also offensive - labeling and 
			ducking the label of being gay as if 
			it were the scarlet fucking letter.

					HOLDEN
			You're blowing this way out of 
			proportion.  We live in a more 
			tolerant age now.  You refer to 
			yourself as a dyke.  Hooper calls 
			himself a faggot all the time...

					ALYSSA
			Yeah, but that's what's known as 
			empowerment/disempowerment.  I call 
			myself a dyke so it's not too 
			devastating when some throwback 
			screams it at me as I'm leaving a bar 
			at night.  
			Same for Hooper - by calling himself a 
			faggot, he steals the thunder away 
			from the mouthy jerks of this world 
			who'd like to beat him to it.  But the 
			difference between us having it and 
			your friend saying it is miles wide.  
			We say it to mask the pain - you say 
			it for lack of a better expression at 
			any given moment.  No Holden, we do 
			not live in a more tolerant age.  And 
			if you think that's the case, then 
			you've been in the suburbs way too 
			long to be resuscitated.

	Holden kind of sulks.  Alyssa notices.

					ALYSSA
			But you know what?
				(picks up his face)
			I have more faith in you than that.
				(rips her tickets off)
			Come on - I want my cheap prize.



	INT STUDIO - NIGHT

	Holden enters.  Banky's still playing Sega.  Holden sits 
	next to him.

					HOLDEN
				(off screen)
			How bad do you suck!

					BANKY
			How was your pseudo-date?

					HOLDEN
			Leave it alone.

					BANKY
			That chick bugs me.

					HOLDEN
				(rubs his head; in baby-talk)
			Aww.  Everyone bugs you.

					BANKY
			Get off.
				(off game)
			Fucking faggot!  Did you see that?!  
			Your dyke courting ass just got me 
			scored on!

					HOLDEN
				(beat)
			You know, you should watch that.  If 
			you're going to get all bent out of 
			shape while playing the game, so much 
			so that you need to curse the t.v., 
			try not to gay-bash it, alright.  
			You're nor that kind of guy.
				(gets up)
			And don't call her a dyke, alright?  
			She's a lesbian.

	Holden goes to his drawing table and takes off his coat.  
	Banky sits there, shocked.  He puts the controller down 
	and crosses to the drawing table.

					BANKY
			What the fuck is going on here?

					HOLDEN
				(pulling out pencil)
			I'm starting a new page.

					BANKY
				(smacking pencil away)
			Not with this shit!  With you.  What 
			the fuck is going on with you and that 
			girl?

					HOLDEN
			We're friends.

					BANKY
			She's programming you.

					HOLDEN
			I beg your pardon?  Programming?

					BANKY
			Yeah.  And apparently, you don't even 
			realize it.  What does it matter if I 
			refer to her as a dyke, or if I call 
			the Whalers a bunch of faggots in the 
			privacy of my own office, far from the 
			sensitive ears of the rest of the 
			world?

					HOLDEN
			It's passive/aggressive gay-bashing; 
			and I know you're not really 
			prejudiced at heart.  You should just 
			find some other way to express your 
			anger, is all I'm saying.

	Holden starts drawing.  Banky stares at him.  Then he 
	grabs the pencil out of Holden's hand and shoves him to 
	the side.  He starts drawing something.

					HOLDEN
			What the fuck are you doing!

					BANKY
			Bear with me here.  I just want to put 
			you through this little exercise.
				(drawing feverishly)
			Okay, now see this?  This is a four 
			way road, okay?

	Banky draws a four-way stop.  He illustrates according to 
	his voice-over.

					BANKY V.O.
			And dead in the center, is a crisp, 
			new, hundred dollar bill.  Now at the 
			end of each of the streets, are four 
			people, okay?  You following?  Up 
			here, we got a male-affectionate, easy-
			to-get-along-with, no political agenda 
			lesbian.  Okay?  Now down here, we 
			have a man-hating, angry-as-fuck, 
			agenda-of-rage, bitter dyke.  To this 
			side, we got Santa Claus, right?  And 
			over to this side - the Easter Bunny.

	Banky finishes drawing.  Holden's shaking his head

					BANKY
			Which one's going to get to the 
			hundred dollar bill first?

					HOLDEN
			What is this supposed to prove?

					BANKY
			I'm serious.  This is a serious 
			exercise.  It's like an S.A.T. 
			question.  Which one's going to get to 
			the hundred dollar bill first - the 
			male-friendly lesbian, the man-hating 
			dyke, Santa Claus, or the Easter 
			Bunny?

					HOLDEN
				(beat; then pissed)
			The man-hating dyke.

					BANKY
			Good.  Why?

					HOLDEN
			I don't know.

					BANKY
				(wildly crossing out the 
				other three)
			BECAUSE THESE OTHER THREE ARE FIGMENTS 
			OF YOUR FUCKING IMAGINATION!

	Holden storms away.  Banky follows.

					HOLDEN
			I don't need this.  I'm going home.

					BANKY
			She's fucking with your mind, man!  
			She knows you've got this schoolboy 
			crush and she's using it to sway your 
			way of thinking!

					HOLDEN
			And why would she need to do that?  
			What is she Mata fucking Hari?!  What 
			does she gain?

					BANKY
			Maybe she thinks you'll get her comic 
			picked up by Contender.  Or maybe she 
			thinks you'll change the content of 
			our book to something more political 
			and message oriented.  Or, gee - I 
			don't know - maybe because that's just 
			what dykes like to do: fuck around 
			with straight guys' heads, just so she 
			can go back to her little rug-muncher 
			club and have a good laugh with all 
			her man-hating harpy cronies about how 
			fucking stupid and easily duped men 
			are!

					HOLDEN
			You're so out of line right now..,

					BANKY
			You don't even know this girl!  Big 
			deal, she's from Middletown and she 
			went to North!  All the girls at North 
			were bitches and sluts anyway!  And 
			this one's got them beat by a mile 
			because she's a bitch/slut/dyke!

					HOLDEN
			Watch your fucking mouth, is all I'm 
			going to tell you..

					BANKY
			Oh why?  Do you get my back when she 
			bashes me?  Because I know she does.  
			And do you know why she does?  Because 
			I won't play her fucking game!

					HOLDEN
			Sometimes your paranoia and suspicious 
			bullshit is amusing.  Sometimes it's 
			just fucking annoying as piss!

					BANKY
			What is it about this girl?  You know 
			you have no shot at getting her into 
			bed!  Why do you bother wasting time 
			with her?  Because you're Holden 
			fucking McNeil - most persistent 
			traveller on the road that's not the 
			path of least resistance!  
			Everything's gotta be a fucking 
			challenge for you, and this little 
			relationship with that bitch is a 
			prime example of your fucking 
			condition.  Well I don't need a 
			fucking magic eight ball to look into 
			your future; you want a forecast?  
			Here - will Holden ever fuck Alyssa.
				(shakes and looks at 
				imaginary ball)
			What a shock - "Not fucking likely"!  
			This relationship of  your's is 
			affecting you, our work and our 
			friendship, and the time's going to 
			come when I throw down the gauntlet 
			and say it's me or her!  And then 
			what're you going to say?!

					HOLDEN
				(beat)
			I think you should let this one go.

					BANKY
			No, what would you say?  Would you 
			trash twenty years of friendship 
			because you've got some idiotic notion 
			that this chick would even let you 
			sniff her panties, let alone fuck 
			her?!

					HOLDEN
			Let it go...

					BANKY
			What the fuck.. WHAT THE FUCK MAKES
			THIS BITCH ALL THAT IMPORTANT?!?!
	Holden looks at Banky for a long beat.

					HOLDEN
			I'm in love with her, man.

	Banky stares at him.  Holden stares back.  Banky looks 
	into Holden's eyes.  Suddenly, he softens a bit.  He 
	drops his head.

					BANKY
			Fuck.

	Banky walks away.  Holden watches him go and exits.



	INT DINER - NIGHT

	Holden and Alyssa sit at a booth.  Alyssa picks through 
	her food.  Holden looks at the check and pulls money from 
	his wallet.

					HOLDEN
			I wish you were the one being pursued 
			by M-TV.

					ALYSSA
			Oh really?

					HOLDEN
			Sure.  Then you could sell our and 
			maybe pick up the check once in 
			awhile.

					ALYSSA
				(drops her fork and wipes her 
				hands)
			We're leaving!

					HOLDEN
			Well it's not like this is a bed and 
			breakfast,

					ALYSSA
			I've got a little business to conduct.

	She grabs her bag and slides out of the booth.  Holden 
	watches her, then follows.

	A23. Alyssa slides up to the cashier's desk as does 
	Holden, who offers a puzzled shrug.  Alyssa offers the 
	'just wait' finger.  The CASHIER turns to her.

					ALYSSA
			Are you an authorized deal-maker in 
			this establishment?  Do you have the 
			power to negotiate.

					CASHIER
			You wanna haggle over the price of 
			your French Dip?

					ALYSSA
			I want to haggle over the price of 
			fine art.

					CASHIER
			What do you mean?

					ALYSSA
				(pointing OC)
			There.  By the kitchen.  That 
			painting.

					CASHIER
			What about it?

					ALYSSA
			The price tag says seventy five.

					CASHIER
			So!

					HOLDEN
				(to Alyssa)
			Tell me you're kidding!

					ALYSSA
			I'll give you fifty.

					CASHIER
				(to OC)
			Manuel!  Bring, me the Dyksiezski off 
			the wall.
				(to Alyssa)
			All my years in the diner business, 
			I've waited for this day - the day 
			when someone wanted to buy one of the 
			pictures.

					ALYSSA
				(holds out hand)
			Alyssa Jones.  Pleased to meet you.

					CASHIER
			You say you want to haggle, but you 
			don't know rule one about haggling, 
			which you just broke: you never give 
			your name.  The name is power, and to 
			give the opponent that piece of you is 
			to give away victory.

					ALYSSA
			I'm only trying to conduct a 
			transaction.  We're not opponents.

					CASHIER
				(accepting painting from 
				BUSBOY)
			Oh, but we are - if you think I'm 
			letting this beautiful piece go for 
			fifty.

					ALYSSA
			Ah-ha!
				(to Holden)
			Now we're haggling.



24.    INT CAR - NIGHT									24.

	It's drizzling outside.  Holden drives.  Alyssa hugs her 
	painting and pushes her bare feet against the windshield, 
	making footprints.

					HOLDEN
			I've always wondered what kind of 
			people buy those things.  I can't 
			believe you talked him down to twenty 
			five!

					ALYSSA
			It was looking shakey when he told me 
			the artist was a blind cripple with a 
			hump-back, but I held my ground.  
			There's no room for sympathy in the 
			buyer's market.

					HOLDEN
			Where are you going to hang it?

					ALYSSA
			I'm not.  You are.

					HOLDEN
			You want me to hang it for you?  You 
			better hope it doesn't get out to the 
			girl-nation that you needed a man to 
			help you hang a picture.

					ALYSSA
			You're going to hang it in your house.  
			I bought it for you.

					HOLDEN
				(laughs)
			Yeah, right.

					ALYSSA
				(looks at him)
			I'm serious.

	Holden stares at her.

					HOLDEN
			Why?

					ALYSSA
			Because it's captured the moment.  
			It'll be a constant reminder - not 
			just of tonight, but of our 
			introduction, the building of our 
			friendship, everything.  Make no 
			mistake about it my Friend - it's a 
			gift to you, from me, so you'll always 
			remember us.

	Holden stares ahead.  Then he swerves the wheel to the 
	right.



	EXT ROADSIDE - NIGHT

	The car pulls to the side of the road.  The rain is a bit 
	heavier now.



	INT CAR - NIGHT

	Holden throws the car into park

					ALYSSA
			Why are we stopping?

					HOLDEN
			Because I can't take it.

					ALYSSA
			Can't take what?

					HOLDEN
			I love you.

					ALYSSA
				(beat)
			You love me.

					HOLDEN
			I love you.  And not in a friendly 
			way, although I think we're great 
			friends.  And not in a misplaced 
			affection, puppy-dog way, although I'm 
			sure that's what you'll call it.  And 
			it's not because you're unattainable.  
			I love you.  Very simple, very truly.  
			You're the epitome of every attribute 
			and quality I've ever looked for in 
			another person.  I know you think of 
			me as just a friend and crossing that 
			line is the furthest thing from an 
			option you'd ever consider.  But I 
			can't do this any longer.  I can't 
			stand next to you without wanting to 
			hold you.  I can't look into your eyes 
			without feeling that longing you only 
			read about in trashy romance novels.  
			I can't talk to you without wanting to 
			express my love for everything you 
			are.  I know this will probably queer 
			our friendship - no pun intended - but 
			I had to say it, because I've never 
			felt this before, and I like who I am 
			because of it.  And if bringing it to 
			light means we can't hang out anymore, 
			then that hurts me.  But I couldn't 
			allow another 	day to go by without 
			getting it out there, regardless of 
			the outcome, which by the look on your 
			face is to be the inevitable shoot-
			down.  And I'll accept that But I know 
			some part of you is hesitating for a 
			moment, and if there is a moment of 
			hesitation, that means you feel 
			something too.  All I ask is that you 
			not suppress that - at least for ten 
			minutes - and try to dwell in it 
			before you dismiss it.  
			There isn't another soul on this 
			fucking planet who's ever made me the 
			person I am when I'm with you, and I 
			would risk this friendship for the 
			chance to take it to the next plateau.  
			Because it's there between you and me.  
			You can't deny that.  And even if we 
			never speak again after tonight, 
			please know that I'm forever changed 
			because of you and what you've meant 
			to me, which - while I do appreciate 
			it - I'd never need a painting of 
			birds bought at a diner to remind me 
			of.

	Holden stares at Alyssa.  She stares back.  Then she gets 
	out of the car.

					HOLDEN
			Was it something I said?



	EXT ROADSIDE - NIGHT

	Holden gets out of the car.  It's raining pretty hard 
	now.  Alyssa's hitching up the road.  Holden reaches her.

					HOLDEN
			What are you doing?

					ALYSSA
			Get back in the car and get out of 
			here.

					HOLDEN
			You're going to hitch to New York?

					ALYSSA
			Y'ep.

					HOLDEN
			Aren't you at least going to comment?

					ALYSSA
			Here's my comment fuck you.

					HOLDEN
			Why?

					ALYSSA
			That was so unfair.  You know how 
			unfair that was.

					HOLDEN
			It's unfair that I'm in love with you?

					ALYSSA
			No, it's unfortunate that you're in 
			love with me.  It's  unfair that you 
			felt the fucking need to unburden your 
			soul about it.  Do you remember for a 
			fucking second who I am?

					HOLDEN
			So?  People change.

					ALYSSA
			Oh, it's that simple?  You fall in 
			love with me and want a romantic 
			relationship, nothing changes for you 
			with the exception of feeling hunky-
			dorey all the time.  But what about-
			me?  It's not that simple, is it?  I 
			can't just get into a relationship 
			with you without throwing my whole 
			fucking world into upheaval!

					HOLDEN
			But that's every relationship!  
			There's always going to be a period of 
			adjustment.

					ALYSSA
			Period of adjustment?!?
				(hitting him)
			THERE'S NO 'PERIOD OF ADJUSTMENT' 
			HOLDEN!  I'M FUCKING GAY!  THAT'S WHO 
			I AM!  AND YOU ASSUME I CAN TURN THAT 
			AROUND JUST BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A 
			CRUSH?!?

					HOLDEN
			If this is a crush... then I don't 
			know if I could take the real thing if 
			it ever happens.

	She looks at him, rain drenching the pair.  She shakes 
	her head ruefully.

					ALYSSA
			Go home, Holden.

	She walks away.  Holden stands there, at a loss.  Then he 
	turns and heads back to his car.  
	As he reaches the door and turns to look back at her, 
	Alyssa pounces on him, grabs his face and locks lips with 
	him, big time.  He drops his keys and embraces her.

	And there they stand, by the side of the road, drenched 
	kissing.



	EXT STUDIO - DAY

	Banky carries a bag in one arm and pulls out his keys 
	with the other.  He jams them into the lock, opening the 
	door.  He picks up the mail on the floor.



	INT STUDIO - DAY

	He closes the door behind him and shuffles to the 
	kitchenette, passing by the blanket-covered, slumbering 
	forms of Holden and Alyssa, who are out cold in each 
	other's arms.  The place looks a mess - Like a couple of 
	people were engaged in some tremendous fucking.  Banky is 
	oblivious.  He sets the bag down on the counter and pulls 
	out a chocolate milk.  He opens it, sticks a straw into 
	the top, and begins sipping and sifting through the mail.  
	He comes to mail that's Holden's and tosses it onto the 
	couch, near Holden's head.  He looks down at the sleeping 
	couple, then back at the mail for a couple of beats.  
	Then he freezes.  He looks down again, and drops his jaw 
	and his carton of choco.  It hits the floor with a pop.  
	Holden and Alyssa shoot straight up, eyes struggling to 
	focus.  They look at one another, then at the 
	flabbergasted Banky.  Banky blinks.  Then he shuffles 
	toward the door again and lets himself out.

					ALYSSA
				(off Holden's reaction)
			I take it that's not good.

					HOLDEN
				(getting up)
			Stay here.
				(he kisses her and exits)



	EXT STREET - DAY

	Banky sits on a curb, staring into the distance, Holden 
	saunters up and sits beside him.  He follows Banky's 
	gaze.

					BANKY
			Catholic school girls.

	Across the street, the Catholic High School is letting 
	out.  Teenage girls clad in uniforms and tight sweaters 
	smoke, frolic, wait for their bus.

					BANKY
			The uniform is what does it for me.  I 
			wish I'd have went with more Catholic 
			school girls when I was a kid.  As it 
			stands.  I have no "...and then she 
			unzipped her jumper..." stories.

					HOLDEN
			You looked weirded out back there.

					BANKY
			That's my couch you were fucking on.

					HOLDEN
			Sorry.

					BANKY
			I wanted to watch some TV.  Hard to do 
			when your best friend's wrapped around 
			a naked rug-muncher on your couch.

					HOLDEN
			She had boxers on.

	Banky shoots him a glare.  He goes back to staring at the 
	OC girls.

					BANKY
			This is all going to end badly.

					HOLDEN
			You don't know that.

					BANKY
			I know you.  You're way too 
			conservative for that girl.  She's 
			been around and seen things we've only 
			read about in books.

					HOLDEN
			But we have read about them.  So we're 
			prepared.

					BANKY
			There's no 'we' here.  You're going to 
			have to go through this alone.  And 
			it's one thing to read about shit, and 
			something different when you're forced 
			to deal with it on a regular basis.  
			When you guys are walking in the mall 
			and both your heads turn at a really 
			nice looking chick, it's going to eat 
			you up inside.  You'll spend most of 
			your time wondering when the other 
			shoe's going to drop.  Because for 
			you, this isn't about cool weird sex 
			stuff, it's about love.

					HOLDEN
			Maybe it is for her as well.

					BANKY
			Somehow I doubt it.

					HOLDEN
			Everyone's not out to get someone in 
			life.  Bank.

					BANKY
			Everybody has an agenda.  Everyone.

					HOLDEN
			Yourself?

					BANKY
			My agenda is to watch your back.

					HOLDEN
			To what end?

					BANKY
			To insure that all this time we've 
			spent together, building something, 
			wasn't wasted.

					HOLDEN
			She's not going to ruin the comic.

					BANKY
			I wasn't talking about the comic.
				(gets up)
			I'm going to gel a bagel.  Clean off 
			my fucking couch so I can watch TV.

	Banky walks away.  Holden shakes his head.



	INT ALYSSA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	An all-girl gathering. TORY. NICA, DALIA and JANE help 
	Alyssa finish an issue of 'Idiosyncratic Routine'.  Tory 
	letters a page.  Nica and Dalia lay-out the artwork.  
	Dalia drinks wine.  Alyssa paints the cover.

					DALIA
			From what I understand, when you sign 
			with a publisher, someone else does 
			all this work for you, and you just 
			sit back and collect.

					ALYSSA
			And miss these last minute cram 
			sessions with my nearest and dearest?  
			Never.

					TORY
			I don't know what she's bitching 
			about.  All she's done since we got 
			here is pound Merlot.

					DALIA
			I'm sorry weren't you the one who 
			misspelled 'receipt' on page eighteen?  
			Yeah, you're a real help.

					NICA
			What I'd like to know is why we're 
			here at all when we haven't seen 
			Princess funny-Book in a month.

					JANE
			Yeah Alyssa - who've you been shacking 
			up with?

					ALYSSA
			'Shacking up!' Please.
				(stops painting; smiles wide)
			I'm so in love!

	Everyone aww's.  Alyssa buries her face, giggling.

					ALYSSA
			I know.  I know -I feel like such a 
			goon.  But I can't help it - we have 
			such a great time together.

					DALIA
			Who is it?  Don't even tell me it's 
			Ms. Thing from the C.D. place.  I'll 
			kill you.

					ALYSSA
			It's not her.  It's someone you guys 
			don't know.

					NICA
			That chick you left the restaurant 
			with that night?

					ALYSSA
			They're not.  From around here.

					TORY
			Don't even tell me you met her down 
			the shore!

					JANE
			Eww!  Not a bridge-and-tunnel Jersey 
			dyke!

					TORY
			With huge hair and acid-washed jeans!

	They all cackle.  Alyssa tries to laugh with them.

					DALIA
			Come on, Alyss - Hoboken Hussy or 
			what?

					ALYSSA
			For your information, they don't have 
			big hair or wear acid wash.
				(goes back to painting)
			They're from my home town.

	Dalia stares at Alyssa, suspiciously.

					DALIA
			Why are you playing the pronoun game?

					ALYSSA
			What?  What are you talking about?  
			I'm not even.

					DALIA
			You are. "I met someone."  "We have a 
			great time.  "They're from my home 
			town."  Doesn't this tube of
			wonderful have a name!

					ALYSSA
				(beat)
			Holden.

	All four Girls stare at Alyssa, a bit horrified.  She 
	stops painting.

					JANE
			Oh, Alyssa - no.  Not you.

					TORY
			You're dating a guy?

					ALYSSA
			He's not like a typical man.  He's 
			really sweet to me, and we relate so 
			well.  You guys'd love him, really.

	They stare at Alyssa.  Then Dalia gets up.

					DALIA
			I've gotta go to the store.

					JANE
			I'll go with.

	They exit.  Alyssa looks to Tory and Nica.

					TORY
				(pouring wine)
			Whelp - here's to both of you.
				(moves the glass to her lips)
			Another one bites the dust.



	INT HOLDEN'S BEDROOM -NIGHT

	Holden and Alyssa lie in each other's arms, moonlight 
	bathing them.  She smokes.

					HOLDEN
			Can I ask you something?

					ALYSSA
			Don't even tell me you want to do it 
			again.

					HOLDEN
			Why me - you know?  Why now?

					ALYSSA
			Because you were giving me that look, 
			and I got wet...

					HOLDEN
			You know what I'm talking about.

					ALYSSA
			Why not You?

					HOLDEN
			I'm a guy.  You're attracted to girls.

					ALYSSA
			I see you've been taking notes. 
			Historically, yes  that's true.

					HOLDEN
			Then why this?

					ALYSSA
			I've given that a lot of thought, you 
			know?  I mean, now that I'm being 
			ostracized by my friends, I've had a 
			lot of time to think about all of 
			this.  And what I've come up with is 
			really simple: I came to this on my 
			terms.  I didn't just heed what I was 
			taught, you  know?  Men and women 
			should be together, it's the natural 
			way - that kind of thing.  I'm not 
			with you because of what family, 
			society, life tried to instill in me 
			from day one.  The way the world is - 
			how seldom you meet that one person 
			who gets you... it's so rare.   My 
			parents didn't really have it.  There 
			was no example set for me in the world 
			of male/female relation ships.  And to 
			cut oneself off from finding that 
			person - to immediately half your 
			options by eliminating the possibility 
			of finding that one person within your 
			own gender... that just seemed stupid.  
			So I didn't.  And by leaving my 
			options open, I was branded 'gay', 
			which to me was no big deal - labels 
			are labels, you know?  They define 
			what you do, not who you are, I guess. 
			But 		then you come along.  You - 
			the one least likely; I mean, you were 
			a guy.

					HOLDEN
			Still am.

					ALYSSA
			And while I was falling for you, I put 
			a ceiling on that, because you were a 
			guy.  
			Until I remembered why I opened the 
			door to women in the first place - to 
			not limit the likelihood of finding 
			that one person who'd compliment me so 
			completely.  And so here we are, I was 
			thorough when I looked for you, and I 
			feel justified lying in your arms - 
			because I got here on my terms, and 
			have no question that there was 
			someplace I didn't look.  And that 
			makes all the difference.

					HOLDEN
				(beat)
			Shit.

					ALYSSA
			What?

					HOLDEN
			Well, you took the luster our of it.

					ALYSSA
			What luster?

					HOLDEN
				(joking - in case you didn't 
				get it)
			Of how I brought you back from the 
			other side.  How all you needed was 
			the right man to turn you around.

					ALYSSA
			You're not the right man.
				(kisses him)
			You're just the one.

	She snuggles into him and closes her eyes.  Holden stares 
	at the ceiling.

					HOLDEN
			Can I at least cell people that all 
			you needed was some serious deep-
			dicking?

	She hits him with her pillow.



	THE BIG OL' FALLING-IN-LOVE MONTAGE BEGINS

	1) In Holden's Apartment - Alyssa waves in various 
	directions, shaking her head accordingly.  Then she puts 
	up her hands to stop.  Cut to Holden, hanging the 
	picture.  Alyssa gave him.  
	It hangs at a severely crooked angle.  He looks back to 
	her and shakes his head 'no'.

	2) Holden and Alyssa try to play a video game.  Banky 
	plays as well.  Holden instructs her in the ways of NHL 
	'96 (turning her paddle right-side-up, pointing at things 
	on the screen).  She presses the reset button, over and 
	over.  Banky gives Holden a 'What the fuck?' look.  
	Alyssa sticks her tongue at him.

	3) At the Video Store - Holden picks up a Disney cartoon 
	off the shelf.  He goes to show if to Alyssa, who's 
	reading the back of 'Anything But Dick', an allchick 
	porno.  An old WOMAN stares at her.  Holden nods to the 
	old Woman and takes the tape out of Alyssa's hands, 
	putting it back on the shelf.  He ushers her away.  The 
	old Woman waits until they're gone and then picks up the 
	tape herself,

	4) Holden carries Alyssa on his shoulders through the 
	park, her crotch against the back of his neck.  He's 
	talking. She taps him and he stops and looks up.  She 
	begins to maneuver around so her crotch is in his face.  
	He pulls her off and put her down.  She's laughing.  He's 
	flushed with embarrassment.  The same Old Woman from the 
	Video store passes by with her husband.  Holden shrugs.

	5) In Holden's Apartment again - Alyssa again with the 
	waving, then putting up her hands to stop.  Cut to Holden 
	again, this time with the painting hung completely upside 
	down.  He looks at it, then offers her a bewildered gaze.

	6) In the Office Banky comes to his drawing table.  There 
	are penciled pages on it with a note that says "Hanging 
	out with Alyssa today.  Holden".  Banky crumples it up 
	and throws it across the room.

	7) In Holden's Apartment - Alyssa waves this way, then 
	that way, then puts up her hands frantically to stop.  
	She settles back against the wall, a satisfied smile 
	crawling across her face, and closes her eyes.  We pull 
	back to reveal Holden on his knees in front of her, 
	eating her out (no, we don't see anything!).



	INT OFFICE - DAY

	Holden draws.  A book is thrown in front of him.  He 
	looks up.  Banky stands there.

					BANKY
			Check out page forty eight.

	Holden looks down at that book.  It's the Nineteen Eighty 
	Eight yearbook from Middletown North.  He shakes his head 
	at Banky and flips it open.

	On the page is Alyssa's Senior year photo.  Under her 
	name is another name in quotes that says 'Finger Cuffs'.

					HOLDEN
				(looking up)
			So?

					BANKY
			Did you see the nickname?

					HOLDEN
			'Finger Cuffs'.

					BANKY
			And...?

					HOLDEN
			And... she had a weird nick-name.  
			What's your point?

					BANKY
			Do you know why it's 'Finger Cuffs'?

					HOLDEN
			I suppose you do.

					BANKY
			I do.
				(takes a seat)
			You remember Cohee Lundin?  Left 
			Hudson and went to North our senior 
			year?

					HOLDEN
			Yeah.

					BANKY
			Well, I ran into him at Food City the 
			other day, and we got to talking, and 
			I mentioned that you were dating 
			Alyssa, and he said..

	CUT TO COHEE LUNDON.  In the PARKING LOT of FOOD CITY, 
	addressing the camera.

					COHEE
			Alyssa Jones?  Shit.  I know Alyssa 
			Jones.  I mean, I know Alyssa Jones, 
			you know what I'm saying?  
			Me and Rick Derris used to hang our 
			with her for awhile, right?  Just 
			hanging around her house after school,  
			'cuz her parents were like never home, 
			and shit.  And one day, Rick just 
			whips it out, and starts rubbing it on 
			her leg and shit; chasing her around 
			the living room - I was dying.  But 
			you know what the crazy bitch did?  
			She fucking drops to her knees, and 
			just starts sucking him off right in 
			front of me!  Like I wasn't even there 
			man!  I almost died!  But that's not 
			the fucked up part - the fucked up 
			part was Rick, man - right in the 
			middle of it, he turns to me and he's 
			pointing at her and he says "Cohee."  
			Just like that - "Cohee."  So I'm like 
			I'll give it a shot.  And I start 
			pulling her pants down all slow, 'cuz 
			I figure any second she's gonna turn 
			around and belt me in the mouth, 
			right?  But yo, check this shit out - 
			she's all into it man!  She don't try 
			to stop me or nothing!  She's 		
			all wet and shit, and I just went to 
			work, know what I'm saying?  Me and 
			Rick are going to town on this crazy 
			bitch, and she's just loving it, all 
			moaning and shit!  It was fucked up!  
			So Rick's the one that came up with 
			the nickname - 'cuz that day, she had 
			us locked in tight from both sides - 
			like a pair of goddamn Chinese finger 
			cuffs!

	BACK IN THE OFFICE - Holden stares at Banky.

					HOLDEN
			He's full of shit.

					BANKY
			Cohee's a lot of things, but an 
			exxagerator he's not.  The dude's 
			Catholic.

					HOLDEN
			She's never even been with a guy.

					BANKY
			That's what she says.  But I say her 
			on her hands and knees getting filled 
			out like an application constitutes 
			'being with a guy'.

					HOLDEN
			He's pulling your chain.  And the fact 
			that you even bought it for a second 
			makes you look like an idiot.

					BANKY
			I'm getting your back, asshole!  
			People don't forget shit like 'Finger 
			Cuffs'.  And if it got out that she's 
			queer as well, how do you think it's 
			going to make you look?

					HOLDEN
			I give a shit what people think.

					BANKY
			Alright, forget about that; what if 
			she's carrying a disease?  That was 
			just one story - what if there's more?

					HOLDEN
				(grabs his coat)
			You're such a fucking asshole.

					BANKY
			What?  Oh, it's not possible that 
			she's all crudded up?  Cohee I can 
			vouch for as clean - the dude never 
			got laid in high school.  But Derris 
			is an arch fucking bush-man!  Name me 
			one chick in our senior class that 
			Rick Derris didn't nail, for Christ's 
			sake!

					HOLDEN
			Would you let this go?  I'm telling 
			you - she's never even been with a 
			guy, let alone those two zeroes.

					BANKY
			And I'm telling you, the bitch could 
			be a bigger fucking germ farm than 
			that monkey in 'Outbreak'!

	Holden grabs Banky and pins him against the wall.

					HOLDEN
			Give it a rest!  Do you hear me?!  I'm 
			tired of this shit!  She's my goddamn 
			girlfriend, do you understand?!  Show 
			her a little fucking respect!  
			And if you ever even so much as 
			mention that Alyssa looks a little 
			peaked from now on, I'll put your 
			fucking teeth down your throat!

	He releases Banky.  Banky brushes himself off.

					BANKY
			Maybe I'll put your fucking teeth down 
			your throat.

					HOLDEN
				(walking out)
			Not bloody Likely.

	Banky runs to the open door.

					BANKY
				(calling after him)
			I've been working out you know!
				(no response)
			You better be ready to make that M-TV 
			deal!

	The downstairs door slams.  Banky makes a muscle, then 
	feels it.



	INT TOWER RECORDS - DAY

	Holden and Hooper peruse laser discs.

					HOOPER
			Where's that bitch partner of your's 
			been?

					HOLDEN
			Sulking.  He's having a real problem 
			with this Alyssa thing.

					HOOPER
			I think it's more like Banky's having 
			a problem with all things not hetero 
			right about now.  And I'm just another 
			paradigm of said aberration.

					HOLDEN
			Banky does not hate gays, you know 
			that.

					HOOPER
			But I do think he is a bit homophobic.  
			And this latest episode between you 
			and Ms. Thing has tapped into that.  
			In his warped perception, he lost you 
			to the dark side - which is she.

					HOLDEN
			You make it sound like me and him were 
			dating.

					HOOPER
			Don't kid yourself - that boy loves 
			you in a way that he's not ready to 
			deal with.

					HOLDEN
				(beat)
			He's been digging up dirt on Alyssa.

					HOOPER
			And just what has Mister Angela 
			Lansbury uncovered about your lady 
			fair?

					HOLDEN
			He heard some bullshit story that she 
			took on two guys.

					HOOPER
			Really?  Well then he's barking up the 
			wrong we if he wants to split you up, 
			isn't he?  He's not going to make you 
			see the error of your ways by pointing 
			out how truly gay she's not
				(holds up a disc)
			This one?

					HOLDEN
			Have it.
				(beat)
			Actually, it's kind of gotten to me.

					HOOPER
			How so?

					HOLDEN
			Banky's not known for believing 
			misinformation.  He's got a pretty 
			good bullshit detector.

					HOOPER
			So, what if it is true?  Would that 
			bother you?

					HOLDEN
			Sex with multiple partners?

	Hooper lets our a faux-shock shriek.

					HOLDEN
			At the same time.

	Again, even louder, hands slapped against his cheeks.

					HOLDEN
			Thanks for being so comforting.

					HOOPER
			So what do you care?

					HOLDEN
			Well that's the thing, isn't it?  I 
			shouldn't.. but it gets to me.

					HOOPER
			Kind of gal Alyssa is, you don't think 
			she's been in the middle of an all -
			girl group-grope?

					HOLDEN
			You see - that doesn't bother me.  But 
			the thought of her and guys... Uh!

					HOOPER
			Oh Holden, I beg you - please don't 
			drop fifty stories in my opinion of 
			you by falling prey to that latest of 
			trendy beasts.

					HOLDEN
			Which is?

					HOOPER
			Lesbian chic.  It's oh-so acceptable 
			to be a gay girl nowadays.  People 
			think it's cute, because they've got 
			this fool picture in their heads about 
			lipstick lesbians - like they all 
			resemble Alyssa - while most of them 
			look more like you.

					HOLDEN
			Do I detect a little inter-subculture 
			cattiness?

					HOOPER
			Gay or straight - ugly's still ugly.  
			And most of those boys are scary.

					HOLDEN
			I thought fags were all supposed to be 
			super-supportive of one another.

					HOOPER
			Screw that 'all for one' shit.  I 
			gotta deal with being the minority in 
			the minority of the minority, and 
			nobody's supporting my ass?  While the 
			whole of society is fawning over girls-
			on-girls, here I sit - a reviled gay 
			man, and to top that off,  I'm a gay 
			black man - notoriously the most 
			swishy of the bunch.

					HOLDEN
			Three strikes.

					HOOPER
			Hey, hey!  There's a line.

	A young BLACK KID approaches Hooper, holding a comic 
	book.

					KID
			Are you Hooper X?

					HOOPER
				(in militant mode)
			A-salaam Alaikum, little brother.

					KID
			Could you sign my comic?

					HOOPER
				(signing comic; nods to 
				Holden)
			See that guy there?  He's the devil, 
			you understand?  Never take your eye 
			off the Man.  Our people took their 
			eyes off him one time, and he had us 
			in chains in two shakes of his snake's 
			tail.

	The Kid offers Holden an angry look.  Hooper gives him 
	back his comic.

					HOOPER
			Fight the power, little 'G'.

					KID
			Word is bond

	The Kid leaves, Hooper slips back into his real voice.

					HOOPER
			Look at what I have to resort to for 
			professional respect.  What is it 
			about gay men that terrifies the rest 
			of the world.
				(shakes his head)
			As for this hang-up with Alyssa's 
			past, maybe what's really bothering 
			you is that your fragile fantasy might 
			not be true.

					HOLDEN
			What do you mean?

					HOOPER
			Holden - don't even try to come off 
			like you don't know what I'm saying.  
			Men need to believe that they're Marco 
			fucking Polo when it comes to sex - 
			like they're the only ones who've ever 
			explored new territory.  And it's hard 
			not to let them believe it.  I let my 
			boys run with it for awhile - feed 
			them some of that "I've never done 
			this before..." bullshit, and let 'em 
			labor under the delusion that they 
			rockin' my world, until I can't stand 
			them anymore.  Then I hit 'em with the 
			truth.  It's a sick game.  The world 
			would be a better place if people 
			would just accept that there's nothing 
			new under the sun, and everything you 
			can do with a person has probably been 
			done long before you got there.

					HOLDEN
			I can accept that.

					HOOPER
			Honey, that almost sounded convincing.  
			Do yourself a favor - just ask her 
			about her past, point blank.  Get it 
			out of the way, before it gets too big 
			for both ya'll to move.
				(spotting something OC)
			Oooh!  'Myra Breckinridge'!

	Hooper trots off, Holden glances at the disc in his 
	hands.  Pictured on it are two gorgeous chicks, barely 
	clad, making out.  The title is 'Men Suck.. and so do 
	Girls - All XXX Action.'



	INT HOCKEY RINK - NIGHT

	On the ice, two teams clash, chasing the puck up and 
	back, checking galore.

	In the bleachers, amidst a slew of fans, Alyssa watches 
	the game with a large degree of enjoyment.  Sitting 
	beside her, Holden doesn't seem to share her enthusiasm.

					ALYSSA
			Since most of these people are rooting 
			for the home team, I'm going to cheer 
			for the visitors.  I'm a big visitors 
			fan - especially the kind that make 
			coffee for you in the morning before 
			they go.
				(smiles at Holden; no 
				response)
			That was a joke.  A little wacky 
			wordplay?

					HOLDEN
			What do you mean, 'visitors'?

					ALYSSA
			Was I being too obscure?  The kind 
			that - until recently - had no dicks 
			and would spend the night.

					HOLDEN
			So that was until recently!

					ALYSSA
			Oh, yeah.
				(shouting; to ice)
			Hey - foul!  Foul!  He was traveling 
			or something!

					HOLDEN
			So nobody bur me has stayed the night 
			at your place since we got together?

					ALYSSA
				(beat)
			Something on your mind, Holden?

					HOLDEN
			No, I was just wondering,

					ALYSSA
			If I've been 'faithful' or something?

					HOLDEN
			Look, I was just asking.

					ALYSSA
				(toucher his face)
			Oh, sweetie.  I only have eyes for 
			you.
				(to ice)
			CALL THAT FUCKING SHIT, REF!!  THE GUY 
			ON THE SKATES TOTALLY SHOVED ONE OF MY 
			GUYS!!
				(to Holden)
			I told you I was great at sporting 
			events.  Imagine what a bitch I could 
			be if I knew what was going on?

	ON THE ICE - Things heat up between two opposing PLAYERS.  
	One snatches the puck away from the other and skates off.  
	The other Player gives chase.

	Alyssa's very into the game.  Holden shakes his head

					HOLDEN
			That'd make Banky half right.

					ALYSSA
			About what?

					HOLDEN
			He said all the girls from North were 
			bitches and sluts.

					ALYSSA
			Really.  I'm sorry - you two left high 
			school behind how many years ago?
				(grabs his face and kisses 
				his cheek)
			Can I put some of my books in your 
			locker?
				(goes back to watching game)

					HOLDEN
				(under his breath)
			How about your yearbook.

	ON THE ICE - The Player giving chase slashes the Player 
	with the puck.

	Alyssa jumps to her feet.

					ALYSSA
				(to ice)
			IF YOU DON'T START USING THAT WHISTLE 
			I'M GONNA JAM IT STRAIGHT UP YOUR 
			ASS!!
				(to guy next to her)
			Right?

					HOLDEN
			What's with 'Finger Cuffs'?

					ALYSSA
				(sitting back down)
			'Finger Cuffs'?

					HOLDEN
			Yeah.  In your senior yearbook your 
			nickname was 'Finger Cuffs'.  What is 
			that?

					ALYSSA
			It was?  Shit, damned if I can 
			remember.  I'd look it up, but I threw 
			all that shit our years ago?
				(beat)
			Where'd you see a North yearbook?

					HOLDEN
			Do you know Rick Derris?

	ON THE ICE - The Players skid into the corner where 
	Player One checks Player Two into the boards, hard.  
	Player Two scrambles to his feet and throws down his 
	gloves.

	The crowd around Alyssa and Holden go wild.

					ALYSSA
			Rick?  Sure.  We used to hang out in 
			high school.
				(to ice)
			PUNCH HIM IN THE FUCKING NECK, NUMBER 
			TWELVE!!

					HOLDEN
			Did you go out with him or something?

					ALYSSA
				(eyes on the ice)
			Date Rick Derris?  No.  We just hung 
			out a lot.

					HOLDEN
			Just... you and him?

					ALYSSA
			No.  Me, Rick, and... um... what was 
			that guy's name...?

					HOLDEN
			Cohee?

					ALYSSA
			Yeah!  Cohee Lundin.  God, I haven't 
			thought about that name in years.

	ON THE ICE - The Players square off.  Player Two pulls 
	Player One's helmet off and punches him in the face.

	Holden looks as if he'd Like to do the same to his 
	companion.  Alyssa's into the game.

					ALYSSA
			I remember those guys'd come over 
			almost everyday after school.  They'd 
			bug my sisters, look for porno tapes 
			in my dad's closet, raid our fridge.  
			They really took advantage of my 
			parents never being home.

	ON THE ICE - Player Two yanks at Player One's jersey and 
	gut punches him.  Alyssa seems oblivious to Holden's 
	anger, so enthralled with the action is she.

					ALYSSA
				(starts laughing)
			This one day... Rick pulled out his 
			dick and chased me around the house 
			with it!  Right in front of Cohee!  I 
			couldn't believe it!  Guys are weird - 
			I thought the whole size hang-up made 
			you all terrified to show your dicks 
			to each other?

	ON THE ICE - Player One staggers a bit, then quickly 
	rights his jersey and lunges at Player Two, landing a 
	barrage of his own punches.  Blood sprays across the ice.

	Holden's face is reeeeeaaaally sour looking.  Alyssa's 
	still in the game.

					HOLDEN
			Rick pulled his dick out?  Really?  
			What'd you do?

					ALYSSA
				(looks him dead in the eye)
			I blew him while Cohee fucked me.

	ON THE ICE - Player One delivers the kill shot, slamming 
	his fist into Player Two's nose.  The blood shoots out 
	like a geyser, and Two goes down hard.

	Holden stares at Alyssa, flabbergasted.  The crowd around 
	them stares not at the fight on the ice, but the fight in 
	their midst, shocked.  Alyssa fumes.

					HOLDEN
			Excuse me!?!

					ALYSSA
			That's what you wanted to hear, isn't 
			it?  Isn't that what this little cross-
			examination of your's is about?  Well 
			try not to be so obvious about it next 
			time, there are subtler ways of 
			badgering a witness.
				(to Bystander)
			Am I right?

					BYSTANDER
				(to Holden)
			Jeez, even I knew what you were 
			getting at.

					ALYSSA
				(gathering her stuff)
			If you wanted some background 
			information on me, all you had to do 
			was ask - I'd have gladly volunteered 
			it.  You didn't have to play Hercules 
			fucking Poirot!

	She storms away.  Holden chases after her.  The Bystander 
	watches them go.

					BYSTANDER
				(to companion)
			I told you these were good seats.



	INT RINK LOBBY / EXT PARKING LOT - NIGHT

	Alyssa marches quickly, pulling on her coat.  Holden 
	catches up to her.  We track with them our into the 
	parking lot.

					HOLDEN
			So it's true?!

					ALYSSA
			Yes Holden!  In fact, everything you 
			heard or dug up on me was probably 
			true!  Yeah, I took on two guys at 
			once!  You want to hear some gems you 
			might not have unearthed - I took a 
			twenty six year old guy to my senior 
			prom, and then left halfway through to  
			have sex with him and Gwen Turner in 
			the back of a limo!  And the girl who 
			got caught in the shower with Miss 
			Moffit, the gym teacher?  That was me!  
			Or how about in college, when I let 
			Shannon Hamilton videotape us having 
			sex - only to find out the next day 
			that he broadcast it on the campus 
			cable station?!  They're all true - 
			those and so many more!  Didn't you 
			know?  I'm the queen of urban legend!

					HOLDEN
			How the hell could you do those 
			things?!

					ALYSSA
			Easily!  Some of it I did out of 
			stupidity, some of it I did out of 
			what I thought was love, but - good or 
			bad - they were my choices, and I'm 
			not making apologies for them now - 
			not to you or anyone!  And how dare 
			you try to lay a guilt trip on me 
			about it - in public, no less!  Who 
			the fuck do you think you are, you 
			judgemental prick?!

					HOLDEN
			How am I supposed to feel about all of 
			this?

					ALYSSA
			How are you supposed to feel about it?  
			Feel what ever the fuck you want about 
			it!  The only thing that really 
			matters is how you feel about me.

					HOLDEN
			I don't know how I feel about you now.

					ALYSSA
			Why?  Because I had some sex?

					HOLDEN
			Some sex?

					ALYSSA
			Yes, Holden - that's all it was: some 
			sex!  Most of it stupid high school 
			sex, for Christ's sake!  Like you 
			never had sex in high school!

					HOLDEN
			There's a world of fucking difference 
			between typical high school sex and 
			two guys at once!  They fucking used 
			you?

					ALYSSA
			I used them!  You don't think I 
			would've let it happen if I hadn't 
			wanted it to, do you?!  I was an 
			experimental girl, for Christ's sake! 
			Maybe you knew early on that your 
			track was from point 'a' to 'b' - but 
			unlike you I wasn't given a fucking 
			map at birth, so I tried it all!  That 
			is until we - that's you and I - got 
			together, and suddenly, I was sated.  
			Can't you take some fucking comfort in 
			that?  You turned out to be all I was 
			ever looking for - the missing piece 
			in the big fucking puzzle!
				(tries to calm down)
			Look I'm sorry I let you believe that 
			you were the only guy I'd ever been 
			with.  I should've been more honest.  
			But it seemed to make you feel special 
			in a way that me telling you over and 
			over again how incredible you are 
			would never get across.

	She touches his face.  He pulls back.  She stares at him, 
	hurt and pissed.

					ALYSSA
			Do you mean to tell me that - while 
			you have zero problem with me sleeping 
			with half the women in New York City - 
			you have some sort of half-assed, 
			mealy-mouthed objection to pubescent 
			antics, that took place almost ten 
			years ago?  What the fuck is your 
			problem?!?

	Holden's eyes are downcast.  Alyssa waits for a response.

					HOLDEN
			I want us to be something that we 
			can't.

					ALYSSA
			And what's that?

					HOLDEN
				(beat)
			A normal couple.

	Holden skulks off.  Alyssa stares after him, and then 
	starts kicking and punching a car beside her, finally 
	slumping to the ground.  She cries.



	INT STUDIO - DUSK

	Holden sits on the couch, alone in the dark.  The door 
	opens and Banky enters.  He stands there, sizing up 
	Holden's mood.

					BANKY
			The girl?

	Holden nods.  Banky nods back.  He stands there for a 
	beat.  Then he sits beside Holden.  He opens his arms.  
	Holden shifts into his friend's embrace and begins crying 
	on his shoulder.  Banky pats his back.  Pull back on a 
	man in pain and the comfort of a friend.



	INT DINER - NIGHT

	Holden sits alone at a booth.  He stirs his iced tea.

					OC VOICE
			Yo, look at this morose mother fucker 
			here..

	Holden looks up.  JAY and SILENT BOB stand above him.

					JAY
			Smells like somebody shit in his 
			cereal.

	Holden offers a half-smile.  The pair slide into the 
	booth.

					HOLDEN
			What took you so long?

					JAY
			We were at the mall.  You bring the 
			salad?

	Holden pulls an envelope out of his jacket and tosses it 
	to Jay.  Jay opens it and pulls out a thick wad of bills, 
	along with the latest issue of 'BLUNTMAN and CHRONIC.'

					JAY
			Man, this likeness rights shit is more 
			profitable than selling smoke.

					HOLDEN
			How'd a dirt merchant like you ever 
			learn about likeness rights?

					JAY
				(hands envelope to Silent 
				Bob)
			We deal to a lot of lawyers.  Speaking 
			of which...
				(pulls out a dime bag)
			Little signing bonus and shit!

					HOLDEN
			I'll pass.  Take a look at the issue.

	Silent Bob thumbs through the comic.  Jay looks over his 
	shoulder, as he begins rolling a joint.

					JAY
			Yeah.  When you gonna get some pussy 
			in that book, man!  Throw some super-
			villain in with big fucking tits that 
			shoot milk or something, and I just 
			drink her dry, bust some moves on 
			her...
				(demonstrates)
			...and then she has to fuck me.
				(Silent Bob hits him)
			Fuck us.

					HOLDEN
			I'll see what I can do.

	A WAITRESS joins them.

					WAITRESS
			What can I get you.

					HOLDEN
			Nothing, thanks.

					JAY
			Yo Flo - tell Mel to whip me up a 
			toasted bagel and cream cheese.
				(to Silent Bob)
			You want one too?
				(Silent Bob nods)
			Make that two.  And kiss my grits.  
			Noonch.
				(the Waitress leaves; to 
				Holden)
			D'jever watch 'Alice'?  That show's 
			good as hell.
				(continues rolling)
			So why the long face, Horse?  Banky on 
			the rag?

					HOLDEN
			When is he not?  No - I'm just having 
			some girl trouble.

					JAY
			Bitch pressing charges?  I get that a 
			lot.

					HOLDEN
			No.  I'm just at a point where I don't 
			know what to do.

					JAY
			Kick her to the curb.  Girls get to be 
			too much trouble, there's always the 
			'band of the hand'.

					HOLDEN
			Can't do it, g.  I'm in love.

					JAY
			Ah, there ain't no such thing.  You 
			gotta boil it all down to the 
			essentials.  It's like Cube says - 
			life ain't nothing but bitches and 
			money.

					HOLDEN
			Just what I needed - advice from the 
			'hood

					JAY
			Who is this girl?

					HOLDEN
			I don't think you know her.

					JAY
			Come on man - I'm people who know 
			people.

					HOLDEN
			You sound like Barbra Streisand.

					JAY
			That's 'cause I got this tubby bitch 
			playing her greatest hits tape in my 
			ear all the time.  You should see him: 
			she starts singing 'You Don't Bring Me 
			Flowers', this faggot starts crying 
			like a little girl with a skinned knee 
			and shit.  It's embarrassing.  I got 
			the only muscle in the world with a 
			weakness for ballads.
				(to Silent Bob)
			You big fucking softie.
				(to Holden)
			So what's this skirt's name!

					HOLDEN
			I'm telling you, you don't know her.

					JAY
			I ain't playing.  Tell me her name, 
			Mysterio.

					HOLDEN
			Alyssa Jones.

					JAY
			Finger Cuffs?

	Holden rubs his eyes.

					JAY
			You're dating Finger Cuffs?  Wait a 
			minute I thought she was all gay and 
			shit!

					HOLDEN
			She is.  Or was.  I don't know.

	The Waitress returns with the order.

					JAY
			And you go out with her?  Shit, man - 
			you're a lucky dog.  She bring other 
			chicks to bed with you, get a little 
			of that filet o' fish sammich going 
			on?

	The Waitress stares wide-eyed and offended at Jay.

					JAY
				(off the Waitress' look)
			Yeah - you know what I'm talking 
			about, baby.
				(Waitress  leaves;  to 
				Holden)
			So - four tits, or what?

					HOLDEN
			It's not like that.

					JAY
			Well what's it like then?

					HOLDEN
			Right now?
				(beat)
			I don't know.  I love her.  But she 
			has a past

					JAY
			I'll say.  Stuffin' two guys, eating 
			chicks out.  Yo - I heard one time, 
			she had this dog...

					HOLDEN
			Eat your fucking bagel already!

					JAY
				(to Silent Bob)
			Look at this touchy mother fucker 
			right here.
				(to Holden)
			So, if you're all in love with her, 
			what's the problem?

					HOLDEN
			The problem is shit like that.  It was 
			one thing when it was just girls - 
			that was weird enough.  But now you 
			throw guys into the mix - two guys at 
			once, no less.  All that 
			experience...What am I supposed to 
			think?

					JAY
			You think good; because now she'll be 
			all true blue and shit.  The girl's 
			tasted life, yo.  Now she's settlin' 
			for your boring, funny-book-makin' 
			ass.

					HOLDEN
			Settling.  That's comforting, Jay.  
			Thanks.

					JAY
			That's what I'm here for.

					HOLDEN
			I'm lust having a problem with all of 
			it I can't get it out of my head these 
			visuals of her doing all this shit.  
			And I don't know why I can't let it 
			go.  Because I'm crazy about her, you 
			know?  I look at this girl, I see the 
			future.  I see kids.  I see grand-
			kids.

					JAY
			You're scaring me.

					HOLDEN
			I'm scaring myself.  Because I think 
			so much of her,  and then I can't get 
			over shit like 'Finger Cuffs'.
				(shakes his head)
			I don't know what I'm doing.

	Holden looks out the window.  Jay continues to roll his 
	joint.  There's silence. Then...

					BOB
			You're chasing Amy.

	Holden's head snaps forward.  He stares, wide-eyed at 
	Silent Bob.

					HOLDEN
			What..what did you say?

					BOB
			You're chasing Amy.

	Holden stares, shocked.  He looks to Jay, who's still 
	rolling his joint.

					JAY
			What do you look so shocked for?  He 
			does this all the time.  Fat bastard 
			thinks just because he never says 
			anything, that it'll have some huge 
			impact when he does open his fucking 
			mouth.

					BOB
			Why don't you shut up?  Jesus!  Always 
			yap, yap, yapping all the time.  Give 
			me a fucking headache.
				(to Holden)
			I went through something like what 
			you're going through.  Years ago.  
			Same kind of thing with a girl named 
			Amy.

					JAY
			When?

					BOB
			A couple of years ago.

					JAY
			What'd she 'Live in Canada' or 
			something?  Why don't I remember this?

					BOB
			What you don't know about me I can 
			just about squeeze into the Grand 
			fucking Canyon.  Did you know I always 
			wanted to be a dancer in Vegas?

	Jay and Holden look at him.  Silent Bob busts a move with 
	his hands.

					BOB
			Hunhh?  Bet you didn't know that?

					JAY
			Just cell your fucking story so we can 
			get out of here and smoke this.

					BOB
				(to Holden)
			So there's me an Amy, and we're all 
			inseparable, right?  Just big time in 
			love.  And then about four months in, 
			I ask about the ex-boyfriend.  Dumb 
			move, I know, but you know how it is - 
			you don't really want to know, but you 
			just have to... stupid guy bullshit.  
			Anyway she starts telling me all about 
			him - how they dated for years, lived 
			together, her mother likes me better, 
			blah, blah, blah - and I'm okay.  But 
			then she tells me that a couple times, 
			he brought other people to bed with 
			them - menage a tois, I believe it's 
			called.  Now this just blows my mind.  
			I mean, I'm not used to that sort of 
			thing, right?  I was raised Catholic.

					JAY
			Saint Shithead.

	Silent Bob backhands him.  Jay raises his fist as if to 
	strike.

					BOB
			Do something.
				(to Holden)
			So I get weirded out, and just start 
			blasting her, right?  This is the only 
			way I can deal with it - by calling 
			her a slut, and telling her that she 
			was used - I mean, I'm out for blood I 
			want to hurt her - because I don't 
			know how to deal with what I'm 
			feeling.  And I'm like "What the fuck 
			is wrong with you?"  and she's telling 
			me that it was that time, in that 
			place, and she didn't do anything 
			wrong, so she's not gonna apologize.  
			So I tell her it's over, and I walk.

					JAY
			Fucking a.

					BOB
			No, idiot.  It was a mistake.  I 
			wasn't disgusted with her, I was 
			afraid.  At that moment, I felt small - 
			like I'd lacked experience, like I'd 
			never be on her level or never be 
			enough for her or something.  
			And what I didn't get was that she 
			didn't care.  She wasn't looking for 
			that guy anymore.  She was looking for 
			me.  But by the time I realized this, 
			it was too late, you know.  She'd 
			moved on, and all I had to show for it 
			was some foolish pride, which then 
			gave way to regret.  She was the girl, 
			I know that now.  But I pushed her 
			away...

	Everyone's silent Silent Bob lights a cigarette.

					BOB
			So I've spent every day since then 
			chasing Amy...
				(takes a drag from his smoke)
			So to speak.

	They sit there for a beat.  Jay pockets the rest of his 
	dime-bag.

					JAY
			Enough of this fucking melodrama.  My 
			advice - forget her, dude.  There's 
			one woman in the world.  One woman, 
			with many faces.
				(to Silent Bob)
			Get up, bitch
				(to Holden)
			We gotta book.  We're catching a bus 
			to Chi-town.

					HOLDEN
			What's there?

					JAY
			Business, yo.  How many more of those 
			phat envelopes do we got coming to us?

					HOLDEN
			I don't know.  I don't know if the 
			book's going to be around much longer.

					JAY
			Yeah?  Good.  I'll be glad as shit 
			when it's gone.

					HOLDEN
			Are you kidding me?  There's millions 
			of people out there that'd love to see 
			themselves in a comic book.

					JAY
			I know.  I spend every fucking waking 
			hour with one of them.  But it ain't 
			like us at all - all slapsticky and 
			shit - running around like dicks, 
			saying... What's that shit you got me 
			saying?

					HOLDEN
			Snootchie-bootchies.

					JAY
			'Snootchie-bootchies'.  Who talks like 
			that?  That's baby-talk.
				(slaps his hand)
			It's a big world, g - but we're bound 
			to run into you again.  Until then - 
			keep your unit on you.

					HOLDEN
			I'll try.

					BOB
			Do, or do not - there is no ay.

					JAY
				(slaps him)
			Knock it off!  Get your fat ass moving 
			- we got a bus to catch.
				(under his breath)
			Jedi-bitch.

	Exit Jay and Silent Bob.  Holden remains in the booth, 
	thinking.



	MONTAGE - AN UNCOMFORTABLE SILENCE

	1) Holden sits at his drawing table, tapping his pencil 
	up and down.

	2)Alyssa sits in a club, getting talked at by some women. 
	She's not present in the conversation.

	3) Banky meets with Sloss at a restaurant Sloss shakes 
	the contracts at him, and Banky makes the "I know, I 
	know," face.

	4) Holden stares at the picture Alyssa gave him.

	5) Alyssa with her ear to the phone.  She hangs up, 
	angrily.

	6) Holden sits in the park that he and Alyssa walked 
	through.  He's staring at Alyssa's yearbook picture.  He 
	closes the book and sighs.  Then, an idea hits him.  He 
	jumps up and dashes out of the park.



	INT STUDIO - NIGHT

	Banky and Alyssa sit on the couch.  Holden paces in front 
	of them.

					HOLDEN
			I know you're wondering why I asked 
			you both here tonight, at the same 
			time, knowing that we have shit to 
			settle between us, separately.

					BANKY
			I just figured you wanted to kill two 
			birds with one stone by telling her to 
			fuck off with me here so you didn't 
			have to go through the story again 
			later on.

					ALYSSA
			Fuck you.

					BANKY
			Not even if you let me videotape it.

					HOLDEN
			Enough!
				(they both look at him)
			I've been going through things, over 
			and over.  And I dissected it all, and 
			looked at it a thousand different 
			ways.  Banky - there's friction 
			between us for the first time in our 
			lives.  You hate me dating Alyssa and 
			you want me to sign off on this M-TV 
			thing.

					BANKY
			How perceptive.

					HOLDEN
			Alyssa - you and I hit a wall, because 
			I don't know how to deal with... your 
			past, I guess.

					BANKY
			That's a nice way of putting it.  I'd 
			have said the whole double-stuff 
			thing...

					HOLDEN
				(right in his face)
			I'm only going to say it once: shut 
			up.
				(back to pacing)
			Now - I know I'm to blame one way or 
			the other on both accounts.  With you, 
			Alyssa - it's my fault because I feel 
			inadequate.  Because you've had so 
			much experience, had such a big life; 
			and my life's been pretty small in 
			comparison.

					ALYSSA
			That doesn't matter to me...

					HOLDEN
			Please.  I have to get through this.
				(beat)
			And with you Banky - I know why you're 
			having such a hard time with Alyssa, 
			and it's something that's been obvious 
			forever, but I guess I just didn't 
			acknowledge it.
				(takes a deep breath)
			You're in love with me.

					BANKY
				(makes a face; beat)
			What?

					HOLDEN
			You're attracted to me.  Just as, in a 
			way, I'm attracted to you.  I mean, it 
			makes sense - we've been together so 
			long, we have so much in common...

					BANKY
				(getting up)
			Well, I've got to get home and catch 
			the last few minutes of 'Babylon 5', 
			so I'll be...

	Holden grabs him, kisses him full on the lips, and pushes 
	him back onto the couch Alyssa reacts.  Banky - wide-eyed 
	and speechless - looks away.

					HOLDEN
			It's something you're going to have to 
			deal with.  Bank.  You may very well 
			be gay, which explains your homophobia 
			and why you're so jealous of Alyssa, 
			and your sense of humor as well.

					BANKY
			Just 'cause a guy's got a predilection 
			coward dick jokes...

					HOLDEN
			Bank.  Stop.  Deal with it.  You'll 
			feel much better.

	He grabs a chair from the side of the room.

					HOLDEN
			Now - at this point, you may be asking 
			yourself the question that I've been 
			going over and over in my head for the 
			last few days: what does one have to 
			do with the other?

	Alyssa's face drops.  She subtly shakes her head.

					ALYSSA
				(under her breath)
			Don't.

					HOLDEN
			And when I did some serious soul-
			searching, it came at me from out of 
			nowhere, and suddenly it all made 
			sense - a calm came over me.  I know 
			what we have to do.  And then you - 
			Bank, you Alyssa, and I - all of us... 
			can finally be... alright.

					ALYSSA
				(again, under her breath)
			Please don't say it.

					HOLDEN
				(sits in the chair; takes a 
				long beat)
			We've all got to have sex together.

	The room is silent.  Holden Lights a cigarette.  Banky's 
	eyes nearly bug.   Alyssa's  head drops.

					HOLDEN
			Don't you see?  That would take care 
			of everything.  Alyssa - I wouldn't 
			feel inadequate or too conservative 
			anymore.  I'll have done something on 
			par with all the experience you've 
			had.  And it'll be with you, which'll 
			make it that much more powerful.  And 
			Banky - you can cake that leap that 
			everyone else but you sees that you 
			should take.  And it'll be okay, 
			because it'll be with me - your best 
			friend for years.  We've been 
			everything to each other but 
			intimates.  And now, we'll have been 
			through that together too.  And it 
			won't have to be a total leap for you, 
			because a woman will be involved.  And 
			when it's over, all that aggression 
			you feel toward Alyssa will be gone.  
			Because you'll have shared in 
			something beautiful with the woman I 
			love.  It'll be cathartic.  A true 
			communion.  We have to do this.  For 
			me, for both of you... for all of our 
			sakes.  This will keep us together.
				(beat)
			What do you say?

	Banky stares forward, wide-eyed.  He leans back into the 
	couch and lets out a huge sigh.  Then shrugs.

					BANKY
			Sure.

	Holden smiles at his friend.  Then he looks at Alyssa.

					HOLDEN
			You know I need this.  You know it'll 
			help.

	Alyssa looks at him, sadly.

					ALYSSA
			No.

	Holden reacts, shocked Banky lets out a sigh of relief.

					HOLDEN
			No?  I... I thought you'd be into 
			this.

					ALYSSA
			You did?  What does that say about me?

					HOLDEN
			But you've... you've done... stuff... 
			like this.  This should be no big deal 
			for you.

					ALYSSA
			You don't want this.
				(lights her cigarette)
			You really don't want this.  Trust me.

					HOLDEN
			I need this.  This has to happen.  Why 
			can't you see that?  And how can you 
			not?  What does that say about me?  
			You can take it from two guys whose 
			names you can barely remember, but I 
			ask you to share an experience like it 
			- where it's about intimacy - and you 
			say no?

					ALYSSA
				(inhales from her cigarette, 
				takes a beat)
			I can't.

	Holden moves to her side of the couch.

					HOLDEN
			You can.  I'll be there.  And when 
			it's over, we'll be the strongest 
			we've ever been because we got through 
			some nasty shit together.  And we'll 
			finally be on the same level together.  
			And then there'll be nothing we can't 
			accomplish.

	A tear rolls down her cheek She looks at him, sadly, and 
	touches his face.

					ALYSSA
			Oh Holden.
				(trying to compose herself)
			That time is over for me.  I've been 
			there.  I've done it.  And I didn't 
			find what I was looking for in any of 
			it.  I found that in you - in us.  
			Doing this won't help you forget about 
			the things you're hung up on.  It'll 
			create more.

					HOLDEN
			No it won't.  I thought about all of 
			that.

					ALYSSA
			No, it will.  Maybe you'll see me 
			differently from then on - maybe 
			you'll despise me for going along with 
			it, once you're in the moment.  Maybe 
			I'll moan differently and then you'll 
			resent Banky, and become suspicious of 
			us.  Or you'll alienate him because of 
			it, and then grow to blame and hate me 
			for the deterioration of your 
			friendship.  Or what if- I sincerely 
			doubt it, but what if - I saw 
			something in Banky that I never saw 
			before, and fell in love with him and 
			left you.  I've been down roads like 
			this before; many times.  I know you 
			feel doing this will broaden your 
			horizons and give you experience.  But 
			I've had those experiences on my own.  
			I can't accompany you on your's.  I'm 
			past that now.
				(touches his face; stares to 
				cry)
			Or maybe I just love you too much.  
			And I feel hurt and let down that 
			you'd want to share me with anyone.  
			Because I never wanted to share you
				(holds it in; gets up)
			Regardless I can't be a part of this.
				(beat)
			Or you.  Not anymore
				(hugs him)
			I love you.  I always will.  Know 
			that.

	She releases him, then slaps him.

					ALYSSA
			But I'm not your fucking whore.

	Alyssa storms away, stopping briefly to look Banky up and 
	down.

					ALYSSA
			He's your's again.

	She walks our of the studio.  The door closes behind her.

	Banky and Holden stand there, silently.  Cut to black.

	INT COMIC BOOK SHOW - DAY

	It's ONE YEAR later.  We're at another show, not unlike 
	the one from the opening.

	A copy of 'Bluntman and Chronic' enters the frame.  The 
	cover reads 'The Death Chronic', complete with a 
	corresponding drawing.

					BANKY V.O.
			Blast from the past.

	Banky sits at his own signing table.  Behind him hangs a 
	banner that reads 'BANKY EDWARDS - CREATOR Of BABY DAVE'.  
	A small line is formed in front of him.  He talks with a 
	FAN.

					FAN
			Do you know how much it's going for 
			these days?  One ten.  You signing it 
			will push that up even higher,

					BANKY
			If you sell it, I want a kickback
				(starts signing)

					FAN
			I don't know if this is true, but I 
			heard once that there was going to be 
			an animated series.

					BANKY
			There was going to be

					FAN
			What happened!

					BANKY
				(off comic)
			You're looking at it.  No Chronic - no 
			cartoon

					FAN
			That sucks man.  That would've been 
			awesome.

					BANKY
			Tell me about it

					FAN
			Is that what happened to you and 
			Holden McNeil?  You got into a fight 
			over the rights or something?

					BANKY
			It was a little more involved than 
			that.

					FAN
			Whatever happened to him?

					BANKY
			He quit the biz.  I guess.

					FAN
			You guys don't talk anymore?

					BANKY
				(looks OC)
			No.  Not really.

	Banky locks eyes with someone OC.  His expression 
	softens.

	Holden leans against a wall on the far side of the room.  
	He smiles at Banky.  Banky smiles back, and sort of nods.

	Holden holds up a copy of Banky's new solo comic.  He 
	points to it and gives a thumbs up.

					OC FAN
			Probably shouldn't have killed off 
			Chronic.

	Banky smiles to OC.

					BANKY
			Guess not.  Some doors just shouldn't 
			be opened.

	Banky looks in another direction, OC.  He looks at Holden 
	and points to it.   Holden looks in the same direction, 
	and then looks back at Banky and nods.

					OC FAN
			You don't need that guy, anyway.  You 
			do great stuff without him.

	Banky looks at Holden for a beat.  Then he brings his 
	pointer fingers together,  mimicing Holden's 'shared 
	moment' gesture.

	Holden shrugs slightly, then crosses his fingers - as if 
	to say 'hopefully'.

					OC FAN
			You were just carrying that guy, 
			anyway.

	Banky sort of smiles at the OC Holden.  Then he offers 
	his own thumbs up - as to say 'good luck'.

					BANKY
				(to fan, still looking OC)
			You're so right.

	Holden smiles back, nods 'bye', and walks off.

					OC FAN
			Well, keep up the good work, man.  
			Love them dick jokes.  Love 'em.  See 
			ya.

	The Fan Leaves, but Banky is watching Holden go.

					BXVKY
			Yeah.  Bye.
				(shakes it off)
			Okay.  Who's next?

	Alyssa sits at a separate signing table, with a line in 
	front of her.  A WOMAN behind her.  Alyssa dashes off 
	signatures in the copies of her comic.

					ALYSSA
				(to OC departing fan)
			Thanks for reading it.

	The Woman stands and rubs her shoulders.

					WOMAN
			I'm going to get a soda.  You want 
			anything?

					ALYSSA
			I'm fine, thanks,

	The Woman heads off.  Alyssa starts rummaging through her 
	bag.

					ALYSSA
				(not rooking up)
			Okay, who's next!

	A comic book drops on the table in front of her.   It's a 
	comic book called 'Chasing Amy'.

	She leafs through it, not looking up.

					ALYSSA
			Um... This isn't one of mine.

					OC HOLDEN
			It's mine.

	Alyssa looks up sharply.

	Holden stands before her, smiling.

					HOLDEN
			I saved you one.

					ALYSSA
			Hi.

					HOLDEN
			Hi.

					ALYSSA
				(beat)
			How've you been?

					HOLDEN
			Good.  Really good.  Yourself?

					ALYSSA
			Good
				(beat; off her own comic)
			New issue's selling like crazy, for 
			some reason.

					HOLDEN
			Because it's so good.  I really liked 
			it.

					ALYSSA
			Thank you.
				(off comic)
			I haven't even seen this yet.  Did it 
			just come out?

					HOLDEN
			A month ago.  I did a really small 
			run.  Self-financed.  Only about five 
			hundred issues.

					ALYSSA
			Will I enjoy it?
					HOLDEN
			You might.  It's familiar subject 
			matter.

	Alyssa leafs through it.  Her eyes get somewhat misty.

					ALYSSA
			Looks Like a very personal story.

					HOLDEN
			I finally had something personal to 
			say.

	They look at each other for a beat

					HOLDEN
			I'm going to go.  I don't want to hold 
			up the line.

					ALYSSA
			Yeah.  I mean, it can get ugly.  I 
			just saw this nun in line call this 
			small child a cunt-rag.

					HOLDEN
				(smiles)
			Read that, when you have a minute

					ALYSSA
			I will.

					HOLDEN
			I'd like to hear your thoughts about 
			it.  If you get a chance, give me a 
			call.

					ALYSSA
			Okay.

	They look at each other for a beat.

					HOLDEN
			Nice seeing you again,

					ALYSSA
			Really nice to see you too.

	He walks away.  A few steps away, he turns and waves 
	again.  She waves back.  And then he starts moving 
	through the thrall of fan-boys.

	The Woman returns with coffee.  She follows Alyssa's 
	gaze.

					WOMAN
			who was that?

					ALYSSA
			Hmm!  Oh.  Just some guy I knew.

	She watches him go for another beat, then.

					ALYSSA
				(to line)
			Next
				(to Woman)
			So what do you want to do tonight?

	And as they fall into conversation, the show goes on.

Chasing Amy

	INT. COMIC BOOK STORE - DAY
	A pile of COMIC BOOKS are on a shelf next to myriad 
	others. The most prominent one is called BLUNTMAN AND 
	CHRONIC'.  A hand reaches in and pulls one out of frame.
	HOLDEN opens the comic and flips through it He shakes his 
	head.  BANKY looks over his shoulder.

					BANKY
			Felt Like this fucking day would never 
			come.  Issue two - on the shelf.

					HOLDEN
			Yippee.

					BANKY
			Don't start, alright!  This is a cool 
			moment, and I'd appreciate you not 
			trying to ruin it.  How often does		
			a guy get the opportunity to purchase 
			something with his name on it!
				(points to name on cover)
			Banky Edwards- right!
				(points to the other)
			Holden McNeil.
					HOLDEN
			I know my name.
					BANKY
			C'mon, sour puss.  We got the rest of 
			our lives to be artists.  But it's 
			supply and demand.  And right now,		
			the unwashed masses demand this.
					HOLDEN
				(off comic)
			This is easy, alright!  And right now 
			it pays the bills.  Just don't forget 
			that we're better than this.
					BANKY
			I'll tell you who we're better than: 
			these two fags right here.
	They approach the counter, where STEVE-DAVE, the store 
	manager, and WALT the Fan-boy, play a card game.
					BANKY
				(lays books on the counter)
			Alright Old-Maid's - take a break from 
			the Crazy-8's marathon and ring us up.
					STEVE-DAVE
				(not looking up)
			Well, well,well, Walt Did you see who 
			it is!  The local celebrities.  Quick - 
			get them to autograph one of their 
			books so we can sell it for triple 
			it's value.
					WALT
			I'm not that in need of fifteen cents 
			right now.
	They snicker and high-five one another.  Holden rolls his 
	eyes.
					BANKY
			You guys operate the smallest, ladies' 
			bridge circle I've ever seen.
					WALT
			For your information, we're playing 
			Crimson Mystical Mages' - an 
			overpower card game. Not that either 
			of you would give a shit about 
			something as advanced	as this - 
			there are no dick or poopie jokes 
			involved.
					BANKY
				(to Holden)
			I don't think they're fans.
					WALT
			No, we're not.  You're both a couple 
			of fucking no talents that got lucky.
					STEVE-DAVE
			And obviously your handlers or hangers-
			on convinced you that your first comic 
			was good which it was not it was 
			thoroughly mediocre with a few spiky 
			bits of dialogue.  And when you get 
			your foot in the door of the business, 
			what do you do!  You turn out a piece 
			of shit like Bluntman and Chronic'.
					WALT
			Tell him, Steve-Dave.
					STEVE-DAVE
				(off comic)
			Bluntman and Chronic'.  Pah.  
			What was that thing the little stoner 
			pulled on the villain in the last 
			issue!
					WALT
			The Stinky-palm.
					STEVE-DAVE
			Stinky-palm.  You give comics a bad 
			name I tell all my customers not to 
			buy it, to spend their money on a real 
			comic book.
					WALT
			Fucking one hit wonder, dime-store 
			Frank Miller's.
					STEVE-DAVE
			This is the reality at Comic-Toast - 
			you're not going to get your ass 
			kissed here, because both me and Walt 
			think you suck.
					WALT
			And me.
					STEVE-DAVE
			I said that.
	Steve-Dave offers the boys his two middle fingers, then 
	goes back to playing his game with Walt.  Holden and 
	Banky stare, shocked.  Banky nudges Holden and they both 
	exit Steve-Dave and the Fan-boy slap hands and go back to 
	playing.
					WALT
			I've got a dragon card - forty power-
			ups and twelve life points!  Ha!  I 
			get your elf card!
					STEVE-DAVE
			You're such a bitch!  But thankfully, 
			I've saved a dark forces Shaman card 
			for just such an occasion.
					WALT
			You suck!  Eighty six life-power 
			points to my twenty two!
					STEVE-DAVE
			I schooled their asses, now I'm 
			schooling your's.
	Suddenly.  A trash can crashes through the front window. 
	Steve-Dave and Walt hit the deck like bitches, covering 
	one another.  They look up slowly. Steve-Dave leaps to 
	his feet and looks at the shattered mess.  He pulls 
	something off the garbage can and reads it.
					WALT
			You know it was those two fucks!  
			Let's call the cops and have them 
			busted!  I know where their studio is!  
			Or better yet, let's sue!  You can sue 
			them, Steve-Dave!
					STEVE-DAVE
				(still reading note)
			That won't be necessary.
					WALT
			What?!  Why the hell not!
					STEVE-DAVE
				(holds up check)
			Because this is a check for three

			Dear critics - thanks for the

	CREDITS
	INT. COMIC BOOK: CONVENTION SIGNING BOOTH - DAY
	A physically large FAN - sweaty brow, tote bag bursting 
	with comics - leans forward, smiling.
					FAN
			Could you sign it To a really big 
			fan!
	Holden sits at a table.  Across from the barely-managing-
	to-stand Fan.  He offers him a patronizingly kind, half-
	smile in return,
					HOLDEN
			You bet.
	We're at a Comic Book show, specifically at a book-
	signing. Behind Holden hangs a large banner, heralding 
	HOLDEN McNEIL AND BANKY EDWARDS -
	CREATORS OF BLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC'. Beside it is a large 
	mock-up of the comic book cover which features two stoner 
	super-heroes who bear a
	striking resemblance to a pair of very familiar friendly 
	neighborhood drug
	dealers, Holden hands the book back to the Fan.
					FAN
			I love this book man!  This shit's 
			awesome.  I wish I was like these guys 
			- getting stoned, talking all raw 
			about		chicks and fighting 
			supervillains!  I love these guys!  
			They're like Cheech and Chong' meet 
			Bill and fed'!
					HOLDEN
			I like to chink of them as 
			Rosencrantz and Guildenstern' meet 
			Vladimir and Estragon'.
					FAN
			Yeah!
				(beat)
			Who!
	BANKY signs the book of another COLLECTOR.
					COLLECTOR
			So you draw this!
					BANKY
				(signing the comic)
			I ink it and I'm also the colorist.  
			The guy next to me draws it.  But we 
			both came up with the characters,
					COLLECTOR
			What's that mean - you ink it'!
					BANKY
			Well.  It means that Holden draws the 
			pictures in pencil, and then he gives 
			it to me to go over in ink
					COLLECTOR
			So you just trace!
	Banky freezes up.  He composes himself and continues 
	signing.
					BANKY
			It's not tracing.  I add depth and 
			shading to give the image mere 
			definition. Only then does the drawing	
			really take shape.
					COLLECTOR
			You go over what he draws with a pen - 
			that's tracing.
					BANKY
				(hands book back to 
				Collector)
			Not really.
				(calling out)
			Next!
	A LITTLE KID steps up but the Collector lingers.
					COLLECTOR
			Hey man.  If somebody draws something 
			and then you draw the same thing right 
			on top of it, not going out-side the 
			designated original art what do call 
			that!
					LITTLE KID
				(shrugs)
			I don't know.  Tracing?
					COLLECTOR
				(to Banky)
			See?
					BANKY
			It's not tracing.
					COLLECTOR
			Oh, but it is.
					BANKY
				(to Little Kid)
			Do you want Lour book signed or what?
					COLLECTOR
			Hey - don't get all testy with him 
			just because you have a problem with 
			your station in life.
					BANKY
			I'm secure with what I do.
					COLLECTOR
			Then say it - you're a tracer.
					BANKY
				(grabbing Little Kid's book)
			How should I sign this?
					LITTLE KID
				(grabs book back)
			I don't want you to sign it, I want 
			the guy that draws Bluntman and 
			Chronic to sign it.  You're just a 
			tracer.
					COLLECTOR
			Tell him, Little Shaver.
	Holden accepts a comic from another Fan.
					HOLDEN
				(off comic)
			Who do I sign it to!
	Before Holden can finish, a loud crash is heard.  He 
	looks to his left and freaks.
	Banky is throttling the Collector from across the table. 
	The Collector attempts to fight him off.  SECURITY GUARDS 
	pull them apart. Holden grabs Banky.
					COLLECTOR
			Jesus!  All I did was call him a 
			tracer!
					BANKY
				(to Collector)
			I'LL TRACE A CHALK LINE AROUND YOUR 
			DEAD FUCKING BODY, YOU FUCK?!
					HOLDEN
				(to Security Guard)
			Could you get him out of here!
	The Security Guards drag the collector away.
					COLLECTOR
			Hey, wait a sec!  He jumped me!  And 
			you're dragging me away!!
				(exiting)
			Fucking tracer!
					BANKY
				(calling OC)
			YOUR MOTHER'S A TRACER!!
 
					HOLDEN
			Can I explain the audience principle 
			to you!  If you insult and accost 
			them, then we have no audience.
					BANKY
			He started it!  Fucking cock-knocker! 
			He's lucky I didn't put my pen through 
			his thorax!
					HOLDEN
			Need I remind you...
				(holds up watch)
			Curtain's in ten minutes.
	INT. COMIC BOOK CONVENTION LECTURE HALL - DAY
	HOOPER fills the frame.  He comes off like a typical, pro-
	black/anti-white homeboy.
					HOOPER
			For years in this industry whenever an 
			African-American character - hero or 
			villain - was introduced usually by 
			white artists and writers - they got 
			slapped with racist names that singled 
			them out as negroes: Black Panther, 
			Black Lightning, Black Goliath, Black	
			Mantra, Black Talon, Black Spider, 
			Black Hand, Black Falcon, Black Cat..
					VOICE FROM CROWD
			She's white.
					HOOPER
			She is?
				(beat)
			Well bust this - regardless.
	We're at a panel discussion.  The room is full.  Five 
	creators sit at a long table, their names on placards in 
	front of them.  
	(One of them is a very striking Girl.)  The banner behind 
	them reads WORDS UP - MINORITY VOICES IN COMICS'.
					HOOPER
				(holds up comic)
			Now my book, White-Hating Coon', 
			doesn't have any of that bullshit. The 
			hero's name is Maleekwa, and he's a	
			descendant of the black tribe that 
			established the first society on the 
			planet, while all you European mother	
			fuckers were still hiding in caves and 
			shit, all terrified of the sun. He's a 
			strong role model that a young black	
			reader can look up to, Cause I'm here 
			to tell you - the chickens are comin' 
			home to roost, ya'll: the black man's	
			no longer gonna play the minstrel in 
			the medium of comics and Sci-
			Fi/Fantasy!  We're keeping it real, 
			and we're gonna get respect - 
			by any means necessary!
	During the speech, Holden and Banky enter and sit up 
	front.
					HOLDEN
				(calling out)
			Bullshit!  Lando Calrissian was a 
			black man, and he got to fly the 
			Millennium Falcon!
	Hooper whips his head around, looking for the source of 
	the comment
					HOOPER
			Who said that?!?
					HOLDEN
				(standing)
			I did!  Lando Calrissian is a positive 
			black role model in the realm of 
			Science Fiction/Fantasy.
					HOOPER
			Fuck Lando Calrissian!  Uncle Tom 
			nigger!  Always some white boy gotta 
			invoke the holy trilogy'! Bust this - 
			those movies are about how the white 
			man keeps the brother man down - even 
			in a galaxy far, far away.  Check		
			this shit.  You got cracker farm-boy 
			Luke Skywalker, Nazi poster boy - 
			blond hair, blue eyes.  
			And then you've got		Darth 
			Vader: the blackest brother in the 
			galaxy.  Nubian God.
					BANKY
			What's a Nubian?
					HOOPER
			Shut the fuck up!  Now Vader, he's a 
			spiritual brother, with the force and 
			all that shit.  Then this cracker 
			Skywalker gets his hands on a light-
			saber, and the boy decides he's		
			gonna run the fucking universe - gets 
			a whole Klan of whites together, and 
			they're gonna bust up Vader's hood		
			the Death Star.  Now what the fuck do 
			you call that!
					BANKY
			Intergalactic Civil War!
					HOOPER
			Gentrification.  They're gonna drive 
			our the black element, to make the 
			galaxy quote, unquote safe' for white 
			folks.
					HOLDEN
			But Vader turns, out to be Luke's 
			father.  And in Jedi, they become 
			friends.
					HOOPER
			Don't make me bust a cap in your ass, 
			yo!  Jedi's the most insulting 
			installment, because Vader's 
			beautiful,		black visage is 
			sullied when he pulls off his mask to 
			reveal a feeble, crusty white man! 
			They're trying to tell us that deep 
			inside, we all want to be white!
					BANKY
			Well isn't that true!
	Hooper explodes, He pulls a nine millimeter from his 
	belt, draws on Banky and fires.  Banky goes down, falling 
	forward into the crowd The crowd screams and starts to 
	scatter, Hooper jumps over the table and raises his fists 
	in the air.
					HOOPER
			BLACK RAGE! BLACK RAGE!!  I'LL KILL 
			ANY WHITE FOLKS I LAY MY MOTHER 
			FUCKIN' EYES ON!!!
	The crowd-is gone.  Holden sits in his chair, laughing. 
	Hooper steps off the stage and picks Banky's head up off 
	the floor.
					HOOPER
				(breaking character)
			What's a Nubian!'  Bitch, you almost 
			made me laugh!
	Hooper sounds different Actually, he sounds gay.  
	Actually - he is.  Banky smiles.
					BANKY
			Well what about you!  You didn't tell 
			me you were going to scream Black 
			Rage'.  I nearly pissed myself.
					HOLDEN
			How do you manage to get away with 
			this all the time?  Shouldn't cops be 
			busting your head open right about 
			now?
					BANKY
			Wrong coast.
					HOOPER
				(off gun)
			Well this right here - she full of 
			blanks, okay.  And Opiate gets all 
			sorts of legal clearances before I go 
			on.
					HOLDEN
			Your publisher condones these 
			theatrics!
					HOOPER
			Condones?  Honey, they insist.  I need 
			to sell the image to sell the book 
			Would the audience still buy the 
			Black Rage' angle if they found out 
			the book was written by a.. a...
					BANKY
			Faggot.
					HOOPER
			When you say if it sounds so sexy...
				(he kisses Banky full on the 
				lips)
					BANKY
				(wipes his lips)
			Hey, hey!  I'll play your victim, but 
			not your catcher.
					VOICE
			How is it that you sound like Minister 
			Farakhan when you're on stage..
	They turn to see...
	A beautiful, blonde, ruffled-haired angel swinging her 
	purse in a circle. Her name is ALYSSA.  She's the 
	striking Girl from the panel who didn't get to say much.
					ALYSSA
			...and the King of Pop when you're 
			nor.
					HOOPER
			Look out, boys - this kitten has a 
			whip.
					ALYSSA
				(shoves and slaps him)
			Always before I get to speak!  I swear 
			- the next con I attend and they ask 
			me to be on the minority panel, if I 
			see your name anywhere near the List, 
			I'm passing.
					HOOPER
				(defending himself)
			Holden.  Banky - this pile of P.M.S. 
			is Alyssa Jones.  She does that book 
			Idiosyncratic Routine'.  This is the 
			fourth panel we've been on together, 
			and even though she knows my publisher 
			sets this up and pays for the event. 
			She still gets mad when it ends with 
			my act.
					ALYSSA
			I just wish I was the one who gets to 
			shoot you.
					HOOPER
			That's what my father said when I came 
			- nay - leapt out of the closet
				(off guys)
			These boys do Bluntman and Chronic', 
			which outsells both of our books put 
			together, hence they're never on a 
			panel with the likes of us.  They 
			slumming right now.
					BANKY
			I've read your book.  It's cute.  
			Chick stuff, but cute.
	Holden hits him.
					BANKY
			What?
					HOLDEN
				(shoots him a look; to 
				Alyssa)
			Sorry about him.  He's dealing with 
			being an inker.
					ALYSSA
				(to Banky)
			Oh. You trace!
	Banky seethes.
					HOLDEN
				(shaking her hand)
			I really enjoy your book I'm surprised 
			we've never met at any other Con's 
			before.
					ALYSSA
			Lose the dick or change your skin tone 
			and we can get to know each other on 
			panel after panel while the Pink Black 
			Panther here plays Chuck D. for the 
			fanboys.
					HOOPER
			Hey, jealousy.
				(to the Boys)
			I told Alyssa I'd buy her a post-rave 
			drink.  Do the Garden-Staters have to 
			sprint to the Lincoln Tunnel, or can 
			you stay for a round in the big, scary 
			city!
					BANKY
			We're gonna take off soon...
					HOLDEN
			We'll go.
	Banky offers Holden a puzzled glance.  Then he nods to 
	Hooper.
					BANKY
			We'll go.
	INT BAR - NIGHT
	Holden, Banky, Alyssa and Hooper sir around a table 
	drinking, talking, and smoking.
					BANKY
			Archie, alright!  Archie and the 
			Riverdale gang were a pure and fun-
			lovin' bunch.  You can't find 
			dysfunction in those comics, because 
			they were just flat out wholesome.
					HOOPER
			Archie and Jughead were lovers.
				(sips his drink)
					BANKY
			Shut the fuck up.
					HOOPER
			It's true.  Archie was the bitch and 
			Jughead was the butch - that's why 
			Jughead wears that crown-looking hat 
			all the time: he the king, of queen 
			Archie's world.
					BANKY
			Man, I feel a hate-crime coming on
					HOLDEN
			He's got a point.  Archie never did 
			settle on Betty or Veronica.
					BANKY
			Because he wanted them both at the 
			same time, you assholes!  He never 
			chose one because he was trying to get 
			both of them into a three-way!
					HOOPER
				(pulls out a dollar and hands 
				it to Banky)
			Here.  I want you to go down to the 
			corner store and buy yourself a clue. 
			Go on.
					BANKY
			Eat it.  Urkel.
					HOOPER
			I told you to watch it with that Urkel 
			shit.  Face it, girl - Archie's a 
			sister.
					BANKY
				(getting up; to Hooper)
			That's it.  You.
					HOOPER
			Moi?
					BANKY
			You are marching back across the 
			street with me, and we're going to 
			pick up a shit load of Archie books, I 
			am going to prove to you - beyond the 
			shadow of a doubt that Archie was all 
			about pussy.  Come on.
					HOOPER
				(sliding out of booth)
			This boy is conflicted, I shall play 
			mother-therapist for him.  You two sit 
			tight.  We shall return promptly.
	Banky and Hooper exit, leaving Alyssa and Holden alone at 
	the table.
					ALYSSA
			Is he always Like that!
					HOLDEN
			For years now.  Started back in third 
			grade - a nun was teaching us about 
			the Blessed Trinity.  She's going on 
			about the three persons in one God 
			thing - Father, Son, Holy Spirit - and 
			he just goes ballistic.  I guess it 
			was too big for him to grasp.  They 
			got into this huge fight.
					ALYSSA
			Please.  How bad could it have been!
					HOLDEN
			You ever seen a nun call a small child 
			a fucking cunt-rag'?  Wasn't pretty, 
			Shit like that's bound to happen when 
			you make a kid wear a matching tie and 
			slacks everyday.
					ALYSSA
			And your parochial school 
			misadventures!
					HOLDEN
			Limited to wine-tasting prior to mass. 
			Turned me into a grade school 
			alcoholic altar boy.  I couldn't tell 
			you how many mornings after serous 
			benders		I'd wake up next 
			to strange priests.
					ALYSSA
			Aren't you the sharp wit!
					HOLDEN
			Sharp!  No.  I'm just a fan of clergy-
			molestation humor.  Probably why the 
			extended family quit inviting me to 
			First Communion parties.
	Alyssa laughs.  Holden smiles.
					ALYSSA
				(looking OC)
			You play darts!
					HOLDEN
			Not professionally.  You know - only 
			in bars.



	AT THE DART BOARD

	A dart hits the board then, one hits the wall beside the 
	board.

	Alyssa winds up with another dart.  Holden watches. Her's 
	always hit. His never do.

					ALYSSA
			So your new book seems to be selling 
			like mad.

					HOLDEN
			It goes back to something my 
			grandmother told me when I was a kid. 
			"Holden," she said "The big bucks are 
			in dick and fart jokes."  She was a 
			church-goer.

					ALYSSA
			Uh-oh - the cry from the heart of a 
			real artist trapped in commercial hell 
			- pitying his good fortune.  I'm sure 
			you can dry your eyes on all those fat 
			checks you rake in.

					HOLDEN
			I'm sorry - did I detect a note of 
			bitter envy in there!

					ALYSSA
			Nope.  I'm happy my stuff gets read at 
			all.  There's very little market for 
			hearts and flowers in this spandex-
			clad, big pecs, big tits, big guns 
			field.  If I sell two issues, I feel 
			like John Grisham.

					HOLDEN
				(looking out window)
			It's all about marketing.  Over- or 
			underweight guys who don't get laid - 
			they're our bread and butter.  People 
			like those two outside should be 
			yours.

	Through the window, we see a COUPLE making out on the 
	hood of a car.

					HOLDEN
			And sadly, there are more of our core 
			audience out there than yours.
				(smiles)
			Look at that, though - kind of gives 
			you a little charge, to see two people 
			in love.  And all over Banky's car, no 
			less.  That car's seeing more action 
			right now than it's seen in years.

					ALYSSA
			Bubbly guy like that, it's hard to 
			figure out why.

					HOLDEN
				(still looking at OC Couple)
			You've gotta respect that kind of 
			display of affection.  It's crazy, 
			rude, self-absorbed - but it's love.

					ALYSSA
			That's not love.

					HOLDEN
			Says you.

					ALYSSA
			That out there!  That's fleeting.

					HOLDEN
			Fleeting.

					ALYSSA
			Uh-huh.  You wanna hear about love!  
			Oh, I'll tell you about love.

					HOLDEN
			A story?

					ALYSSA
			The story.  The original love story.

					HOLDEN
			'Doctor Zhivago'.

					ALYSSA
			Nope.  My mother's uncle.  He was a 
			millionaire.

					HOLDEN
			Get out.

					ALYSSA
			I kid you not.

					HOLDEN
			Explain.

					ALYSSA
			All through high school, he dated this 
			one girl.  They  were inseparable.  
			And when they graduated, she went off 
			to Carnegie Mellon...

					HOLDEN
			In Pittsburgh.

					ALYSSA
			I'm impressed.  So he stays in the 
			home town, and they begin their long-
			distance relationship.  The plan is, 
			on the  third Sunday of every month, 
			he'll train out, spend a week then 
			train back They do this for four 
			years.

					HOLDEN
			That is love.

					ALYSSA
			Not nearly finished.  Two months 
			before she's going to graduate, he's 
			got this job digging graves, and he 
			comes across...

					HOLDEN
			A stiff.

					ALYSSA
			A steamer trunk containing silver 
			ingots.

					HOLDEN
			Get out of here.

					ALYSSA
			Many, many silver ingots.  Now, my 
			mother's uncle being quite the 
			ingenious chap - he buries the trunk  
			again and heads up to the main office, 
			where he proceeds to purchase a 
			cemetery plot.  Guess which one?

					HOLDEN
			Clever.

					ALYSSA
			So now he owns the plot and all of its 
			contents.  Two  days later, my 
			mother's uncle is worth three million.

					HOLDEN
			At which time he marries the high 
			school sweetheart and lives happily 
			ever after.

					ALYSSA
			Not even close.  Inside the steamer 
			trunk, stenciled into the wood, or 
			something like that, is a curse.

					HOLDEN
			Someone wrote 'Fuck' inside his new 
			steamer trunk.

					ALYSSA
			Not that kind of curse.  A cryptic 
			curse "Great fortune means great loss" 
			it said.

					HOLDEN
			What kind of asshole writes that 
			inside a steamer trunk!

					ALYSSA
			The same kind of asshole that buries 
			silver ingots.  The day my mother's 
			uncle is heading out to see the girl, 
			he stops at his accountant's to grab 
			some cash, and winds up missing his 
			train.  So he has to take the next one 
			- which he does - and he gets there an 
			hour later than his usual time of 
			arrival, whereupon he sees lights.

					HOLDEN
			A hero's welcome for the new 
			millionaire.

					ALYSSA
			It seems that while she was standing 
			on the platform waiting that extra 
			hour for my mother's uncle to show up, 
			the girl was dragged into the bushes 
			by an unknown assailant, raped and 
			gutted.

	Holden is silent Alyssa downs her drink.

					ALYSSA
			The assailant was never apprehended.

					HOLDEN
				(beat)
			That's a love story!!

					ALYSSA
			Yes, and here's why: my mother's uncle 
			rode that train every day for the rest 
			of his life.  One day up, the next day 
			back.  Did that 'till the day he died.  
			He donated the fortune he'd acquired 
			to the train station in Pittsburgh, to 
			have a well-lit terminal built.  
			The train line let him ride for free 
			after that.

					HOLDEN
			I should hope so.  Jesus, that's the 
			saddest tale I've ever heard.

					ALYSSA
			That's my love story.

	Alyssa tosses her last dart.  Holden seems a bit dazed.  
	He looks out the window.

					HOLDEN
			Those two aren't on the hood of 
			Banky's car anymore.

					ALYSSA
			I told you It wasn't love.
				(grabs her purse)
			I gotta split.  It was really nice 
			meeting you.  I wish you the best of 
			luck with your book.
				(shakes his hand)
			Tell Hooper I'll call him later.  And 
			tell your friend to calm down.

	Alyssa exits to the night.  Holden stares after her.  Two 
	beats later, Hooper and Banky enter, holding an 
	'Everything's Archie' comic between them.

					BANKY
			You're insane.  Archie is not fucking 
			Mister Weatherbee!

					HOOPER
			Deny, deny, deny.
				(to Holden)
			Where's Alyssa?

					HOLDEN
			Huh!  Oh.  She left.  She said she'd 
			call you later.

					BANKY
				(off comic)
			He's just offering to help Archie with 
			his homework!

					HOOPER
			Read between the lines.

					BANKY
				(shoves book at him)
			Fuck this.
				(to Holden)
			Let's go.  Traffic.
				(no response from Holden)
			Holden!

					HOLDEN
				(shaken)
			What!

					BANKY
			Let's go.

					HOOPER
				(looking out window)
			D'jou see that dent in the hood of 
			your car!

					BANKY
				(looking out window)
			What the...!  Son of a bitch!

	Banky runs out Holden shrugs at Hooper.

					HOOPER
			Let me guess: you like her!

					HOLDEN
			Who?

					HOOPER
			Miss Alyssa Jones.

					HOLDEN
			She's alright.

					HOOPER
			As long as that's all.
				(finishes drink)
			Maybe you can convince that partner of 
			your's to drop me off downtown before 
			you scurry out the tunnel!

					HOLDEN
				(beat)
			Mister Weatherbee wasn't really trying 
			to fuck Archie, was he!

	They begin exiting.

					HOOPER
			Hell no.  Weatherbee was Reggie's 
			bitch.



	INT. STUDIO - DAY

	We're in Holden and Banky's studio/apartment.  It's a 
	rented loft-style place with high ceilings, wood floors 
	and sparse furnishings.  There are posters on the walls, 
	a sort of kitchenette, a hockey net, a big TV. (with all 
	the trimmings - VCR, Laserdisc player, Sega, SNES), a 
	huge comfy couch, and two drawing boards with adjacent 
	desks (littered with pencils, pens, coloring pencils, 
	paints, erasers, etc.) - at which sit Holden and Banky.  
	They're working.  Some music plays.

	C.U. OF HOLDEN PENCILING - over his shoulder, we see 
	Holden sketching Chronic in mid-attack of his arch-
	nemesis - the Giggler.  Holden erases a line and re-
	draws.

	C.U. OF BANKY INKING - over his shoulder, we see Banky 
	outlining a pre-penciled page.  He traces Bluntman 
	swinging from a street light.

	The two work in silence.  Then...

					BANKY
				(not looking up)
			This is one of the best street lights 
			you've ever drawn.

					HOLDEN
			It's the one across from the post 
			office.

					BANKY
			Looks just like it.

					HOLDEN
			Thanks.
				(beat)
			What do you wanna do tonight!

					BANKY
			Get a pizza.  Watch 'Degrassi Junior 
			High'.

					HOLDEN
				(erases)
			You got a weird thing for Canadian 
			melodrama.

					BANKY
			I've got a weird thing for girls who 
			say 'aboot'.

	The phone starts ringing.  Holden answers it, while still 
	drawing.

					HOLDEN
			Bank-Hold-Up.

	CROSSCUT between Holden and Hooper.  He's on a phone in a 
	CLUB.

					HOOPER
			Hooper here.  Listen, I know how you 
			burb-fiends hate the city, but there's 
			a club shindig going down that I think 
			you'd get into.

					HOLDEN
			Where is it?

					HOOPER
			Place called Her-sterectomy - I'm 
			tempting as bar-keep.

					HOLDEN
			I don't know, Hoop.  We're prepping 
			the next issue, and we've got our big 
			M-TV meeting in the morning.

					HOOPER
			I told her you wouldn't be interested.

					HOLDEN
			Told who?

					HOOPER
			Alyssa.

					HOLDEN
			Alyssa from last night Alyssa?

					HOOPER
			How do you begin and end a question 
			with the same word like that?  You got 
			skill.  Yes, that one.  She asked me 
			to invite you.  Now here's the part 
			where you say...

					HOLDEN
			I'll be there.

					HOOPER
			Thought so.  Ten o'clock.  Later.
				(both hang up)

					BANKY
			Who was that?

					HOLDEN
			Hooper.  He invited me to a club.

					BANKY
			When's that faggot going to learn - 
			you like chicks.

					HOLDEN
				(getting up)
			Not that kind of a club.

					BANKY
			So when we leaving?

					HOLDEN
			'We'?  You can't go.  He's setting me 
			up with Alyssa.

					BANKY
			And?

					HOLDEN
			And I don't want you messing it up.

					BANKY
			Like I care about your shit.  Maybe 
			I'll hook up myself.

					HOLDEN
				(pulling on coat)
			I just told you - it's not that kind 
			of club.

					BANKY
			How does one man get to be so funny!

					HOLDEN
				(throws him his coat)
			How are you going to get home if I 
			hook up!

					BANKY
			Like that'll happen.

					HOLDEN
			Let me explain something to you, my 
			witless chum the other night in that 
			bar, we two - Alyssa and I shared a 
			moment, alright!

					BANKY
			Oh, you had a moment!

					HOLDEN
				(brings his two pointer 
				fingers together)
			We shared a moment.  And in that 
			moment, one thing was made abundantly 
			clear: this girl loves me, my friend.   
			Loves-me.



6.	INT. HER-STERECTOMY - NIGHT						6.

	It's a club - people are mingling, a band is playing, 
	it's loud.  But something's fishy.  Hooper's tending bar.  
	He hands a GUY a drink.  The Guy sips it.

					GUY
			This is so watered down.  It's 
			terrible.  Why is it you can never get 
			a decent drink in these places!

	Hooper looks around in a very exaggerated fashion.

					GUY
			What are you doing!

					HOOPER
			Trying to find you a tissue.

	The Guy shoots Hooper an angry glare, Banky enters.

					BANKY
			Alright - bring on the free hootch.

					HOOPER
			As long as you don't bitch about how 
			little alcohol is in the drink.
				(hands Banky a drink; to Guy)
			You owe me five sixty.

					GUY
				(off Banky)
			And I suppose you're going to make 
			your friend here pay for his drink 
			right!

					BANKY
			Hey, I befriended a guy in a position 
			of authority so I could abuse that 
			authority and get free shit.  You want 
			to do the same?  There's a lonely 
			Hindu works at the'7-ll' across the 
			street.  Get in tight with him.

	The Guy angrily pulls out his money and slams it on the 
	bar.

					GUY
			I work at that '7-11'!
				(storms away)

					BANKY
				(calling after him)
			Wanna be friends!

					HOOPER
			Where's your better half!

					BANKY
			Taking a piss.  Guy's got a bladder 
			like an infant.

					HOOPER
			That's funny - he says you're hung 
			like an infant.

					BANKY
			Must his mother tell him everything!

	Holden enters.

					BANKY
			What'd you do - fall in love?

					HOLDEN
			Where is she?

					HOOPER
			Over there...

	ON THE DANCE FLOOR - in the middle of a thrall of people - 
	dances Alyssa.  She moves like a cat and she's looking 
	very sexy.

					OC HOOPER
			Been dancin' for an hour.  Hasn't 
			stopped yet.

	Hooper, Holden, and Banky stare OC.

					BANKY
			She ain't no Denny Terrio, I'll say 
			that.

	Holden smacks Banky and moves to exit.

					HOOPER
			Wait. wait, wait - there's something 
			you should know.

					HOLDEN
			She's got a boyfriend.

					HOOPER
			Well.. no.

					HOLDEN
			Then what's to know?

	Holden exits; They watch him go.  Banky looks around.

					BANKY
			There're a lot of chicks in this 
			place.

					HOOPER
			'Chicks'.  You're such a man.

					BANKY
				(beat)
			He didn't really say that about my 
			dick, did he!

	ON THE DANCE FLOOR - Holden slips into the crowd and 
	dances up to Alyssa.  He intentionally bumps into her.

					HOLDEN
				(fake rage, dancing)
			Hey, hey, hey - you fucked up my 
			cabbage-patch!

					ALYSSA
			Well, well, well - Bluntman himself.  
			Or should I call you Chronic!

					HOLDEN
			Call me flattered.  I heard you sent 
			me the invite to this little soiree'.

					ALYSSA
			From a former home-town girl, to 
			Mister Home-Town himself.

					HOLDEN
			You're saying you're from the 'burbs!

					ALYSSA
			Middletown, N.J.

					HOLDEN
			Get out of here!  I'm from Highlands!

					ALYSSA
			I know.  Hooper told me.

					HOLDEN
			How is it that we never ran into one 
			another?

					ALYSSA
			You graduate from Hudson?

					HOLDEN
			Yeah.  Eighty eight.

					ALYSSA
			I went to North.  Also eighty eight.

					HOLDEN
			What a small fucking world.  So you 
			know the tri-town area!

					ALYSSA
			Quiz me.

					HOLDEN
			Miller Hill?

					ALYSSA
			I wrote my name on the wall.

					HOLDEN
			Sandy Hook?

					ALYSSA
			Lost my virginity there.

					HOLDEN
			This is so cool.  The mall!

					ALYSSA
			Eden Prairie of Menlo Park!

					HOLDEN
			Wait - here's the big test: Quick 
			Stop!

					ALYSSA
			My best friend fucked a dead guy in 
			the back room.

					HOLDEN
			You know that girl!!

					ALYSSA
			I did.  Before she was committed.

					HOLDEN
			You know what this is!  This is fate.

					ALYSSA
				(regarding her move)
			No, this is the 'Rog'.

					HOLDEN
			I was talking about us meeting - what 
			are the chances!

					ALYSSA
			Pretty slim.  I haven't been back to 
			the 'burbs since my friend's funeral.

					HOLDEN
			The Quick Stop girl died!

					ALYSSA
			Another friend - Julie Dwyer.  She 
			died in the..

					HOLDEN
			Y.M.C.A pool!  Damn!  You knew her 
			too!

					ALYSSA
			So well.

					HOLDEN
			One friend in an asylum, the other 
			friend in the grave.  You're a 
			dangerous person to know.

					ALYSSA
			But I can tap.
				(does an impromptu tap dance)
			That was the Buffalo Two-Step.

					HOLDEN
			Very solid.

					ALYSSA
			That's what six years of tap lessons 
			yields.

					HOLDEN
			Two towns away from each other for 
			years and we had to meet in New York.

	The Sand stops playing. People clap.

					ALYSSA
			Coulda been worse - we could have not 
			met at all.

	Holden looks at her.

					OC SINGER
			Thank you.  Thanks.

	The SINGER on stage speaks into the microphone.

					SINGER
			A long time ago, we used to have this 
			bass player who took off one day to 
			draw funny books or something.  Maybe 
			you've seen her stuff - it's called 
			'Idiosyncratic Routine''

	The crowd applauds.  Alyssa shakes her head, smiling. 
	Holden pokes her.

					SINGER
			But what a lot of people don't know is 
			that she used to harbor these 
			delusions that she could sing.  And 
			she used to subject us to these 
			throaty renditions of Debbie Gibson 
			tunes and shit, insisting that we let 
			her front on a few numbers.  Well, we 
			didn't and she quit.. and then she got 
			famous, the bitch.
				(crowd laughs)
			But she's here tonight, and I think if 
			we all begged, or maybe offered her 
			some X, she'd get up here and treat us 
			to some of her vocal stylings.
				(crowd applauds)
			What do you say, Alyssa?

	Alyssa shakes her head no.  The crowd urges her.  Holden 
	pushes her forward.

					SINGER
			She's shy.
				(yelling)
			GET UP HERE AND SING, BITCH!!

	The crowd thunders.  Alyssa offers the Singer an 
	embarrassed half-smile.  She looks at Holden, who claps 
	along with the others and nods toward the stage.  Alyssa 
	shakes her head and relents, heading through the crowd

	Banky and Hooper stand at the bar.

					BANKY
			This is so queer.
				(he exits)

					HOOPER
				(beat)
			You don't know the half of it.

	Alyssa jumps on stage, hugging the Singer.  She takes the 
	mic, shaking her head.  The crowd is applauding.

					ALYSSA
			She is such a twat.

	The crowd cheers.  Alyssa laughs.  She turns to the band 
	and says something which they nod.  She turns back to the 
	crowd.

					ALYSSA
			Alright.  I should dedicate this, 
			right?
				(thinks)
			This is for that special someone our 
			there.

	Holden smiles.  Banky joins him.  Holden glances at him.  
	Banky offers a mocking mimic of his smile.

	The band starts playing.  Cross cutting begins.

	Alyssa launches into a torchy tune.  The song is 
	extremely sexy - as is Alyssa who works the mic, making 
	direct eye contact with...

	Holden.  Or does she!  Holden is smiling, being seduced,  
	Banky rolls his eyes.  Beside Holden, stands a pretty 
	GIRL with a short haircut, who's also riveted by Alyssa's 
	performance.

	Alyssa makes big-time eye contact with somebody out 
	there.  
	The song seems to be aimed at whoever she's looking at.  
	It's more than obvious there's a seduction going on, bur 
	of whom!  At the end of the song, the crowd goes wild but 
	Alyssa's preoccupied.  She points to someone in the 
	crowd, and curls her finger back in a 'c'mere' fashion, 
	urging whoever it is to join her.  She jumps off the 
	stage.

	Holden shakes his head sheepishly and looks downward, aw-
	shucks style.  At that moment, the Girl beside him leaps 
	forward.  Banky's eyes widen.  Holden looks up and is 
	suddenly taken aback.

	Alyssa and the Girl race into each other's arms and fall 
	into a way-to-passionate-to-mean-anything-else kiss.

	Holden's eyes bug.  Banky allows a smile to creep across 
	his face.  The crowd applauds.  Banky looks around, and 
	for the first time, we get the distinct impression that 
	this is a lesbian bar...

	There are a lot of chicks in this place.  Gay chicks.  
	Banky looks at Holden and slaps him on the back.

					BANKY
			Now that, my friend, is a..
				(brings his fingers together, 
				mimicing Holden)
			...shared moment

	Holden continues to stare - mouth agape.

	Alyssa and the Girl continue to kiss.



	INT. HER-STERECTOMY - LATER

	Banky, Holden, Alyssa and the Girl from the dance floor 
	sit around a table.  Alyssa and the Girl continue to make 
	out.  Holden and Banky casually watch, wide-eyed.  Banky 
	stares a little harder.  Holden hits him.

					BANKY
			What?!

					HOLDEN
				(under his breath)
			That's rude.

					BANKY
			Man, when are we ever going to get a 
			chance to see this kind of shit live 
			without paying for it?

	Alyssa and the Girl break their kiss.

					ALYSSA
			Uh-oh - better knock it off: we're 
			getting a man excited.

					HOLDEN
			Sorry.  It's just... new to him.

					BANKY
			Oh, and you're an old hand at this.

					ALYSSA
			No, I should apologize.  I don't 
			usually get all mushy in public.  But 
			it's been awhile since I've seen Kim 
			here.

					KIM
				(formerly the Girl)
			Tell me you didn't set that gross 
			display up with the band just so you 
			could nail me.

					ALYSSA
			Like I'd have to go through that much 
			effort

					KIM
			You know what!  I want to dance.

					ALYSSA
			Go ahead.  I'll watch from here.

					KIM
				(tugging at her arm)
			No.  I want to dance with you.

					ALYSSA
			Don't be such a rag.  I have to sit 
			here and work up the desire to fuck 
			you later.

					KIM
			Please.

	Kim exits.  Banky is smiling ear-to-ear.  Alyssa looks at 
	him.

					ALYSSA
			Yes?

					BANKY
			You said 'fuck'.  To that girl.  You 
			said you'd 'fuck' her.

					ALYSSA
			And?

					BANKY
			How can a girl 'fuck' another girl! 
			Were you talking about strap-ons or 
			something?

					HOLDEN
				(hits him)
			Would you shut up!!

					BANKY
			What!!?  It's a valid question.  You 
			know the dyke stuff in the Penthouse 
			Letters section is written by guys - 
			this is our chance to get the inside 
			scoop.

					HOLDEN
				(to Alyssa)
			I don't know how many times I can 
			apologize for him.

					ALYSSA
			It's okay.  Secretly, all I really 
			want is to be the center of attention.
				(to Banky)
			I've never used a snap-on.

					BANKY
			Then what's with saying 'fuck?  
			Shouldn't you say 'eat her out' or at 
			least modify the term 'fuck' with 
			something like 'fist'?

					ALYSSA
			Let me ask you a question - can men 
			'fuck' each other!

					BANKY
			Ask Hooper.

					ALYSSA
			In your estimation.

					BANKY
			Sure.

					ALYSSA
			So for you, to 'fuck' means to 
			penetrate.  You're used to the more 
			traditional definition - you inside 
			some girl you've duped, jack-hammering 
			away, not noticing that bored look in 
			her eyes.

					BANKY
			Hey - I always notice the bored look 
			in their eyes.

					ALYSSA
				(laughs)
			'Fucking' is nor limited to 
			penetration, Banky. For me it 
			describes any sex when it's not 
			totally about love.  I don't love Kim, 
			but I'll fuck her.  I'm sure you don't 
			love every girl you sleep with.

					BANKY
			Some of them I downright loathe.

					ALYSSA
			But I'll bet it's different with the 
			ones you love.  I'll bet you go the 
			full nine when it's not just a quick 
			fix - like you go down on them longer 
			or something.

					HOLDEN
			Here we go.

					BANKY
			I don't do that.

					ALYSSA
			What?!?!

					BANKY
			I stopped dropping.  It got to be too 
			frustrating.

					HOLDEN
			As stupid as you usually come off 
			during this diatribe of your's, you're 
			going to come off ten times as stupid 
			on this occasion.

					BANKY
			What?!  I lost my tolerance for the 
			bullshit baggage that comes with 
			eating girls out.  What's the big 
			deal?!

					ALYSSA
			If you say the smell, so help me, I'll 
			slug you.

					BANKY
			Not the smell - the smell is good.  
			I'm talking about not being able to do 
			it property.  And my mother brought me 
			up to believe that if I can't do 
			something
			right I shouldn't do it at all.  Of 
			course, my father told me she gave 
			lousy head, but that's beside the 
			point.

					ALYSSA
			At least you blame yourself for your 
			sexual inadequacies.

					BANKY
			No, I blame them.  Chicks never help 
			you out.  They never tell you what to 
			do.  And most of them are self-
			conscious about that smell factor, and 
			so most of the time they just lay 
			there, frozen like a deer in the 
			headlights, right?  Not for nothing, 
			but when a chick goes down on me.  I 
			let her know where to go, and what the 
			status is.  You gotta handle it like 
			CNN and the Weather Channel - constant 
			updates.

					HOLDEN
			You're such an idiot.

					ALYSSA
			No, he's got a point.  That's how I 
			was in high school - I was nervous, 
			and inhibited about being eaten out.  
			But by the time I got to college, that 
			all changed.  I loosened up.  Not only 
			did I learn to communicate - I learned 
			to be bossy.  
			I was like one of those guys at the 
			airport with those big flash lights - 
			waving them this way, directing them 
			that way, telling them when to stop.

					BANKY
			And that's all I'm saying, it'd be 
			different if chicks helped out - 
			pointed a guy in the right direction.  
			Then there'd be no bullshit, no wasted 
			time, and no chance for permanent 
			injuries.

					ALYSSA
			Permanent injuries?

					BANKY
			Sure.  You wanna see something 
			permanent!
				(pulls our front tooth)
			I got this from Nina Rollins, 
			sophomore year.  I'm going down on 
			her, and out of nowhere, her cat jumps 
			on her stomach.  She does this big ol' 
			pelvic thrust - cracks my tooth in 
			half, sends it down my throat.  I had 
			to get a crown for the stub.

					ALYSSA
				(to Holden)
			I got that beat.
				(to Banky)
			I got that beat.
				(half-turns and lifts chin)
			Sophomore year.  I'm going down on 
			Cynthia Slater in her dorm room after 
			we went club-hopping.  I'm totally 
			drunk, and in the middle of it, I fall 
			asleep - right there in her lap.  She 
			got so mad, she digs her heel into my
			back, right there.
				(points to scar)
			That's permanent.

					BANKY
			You see this!
				(moves neck slightly right)
			That's the farthest I can move my neck 
			to the right Sophomore year, I'm going 
			out with Maria Bennert, and for six 
			months, I'm going down on her, and not 
			a damn thing's happening.  
			Then one night, I change a position, 
			or vary my lapping-speed, and suddenly 
			it's a whole new world.  She's moving 
			around, convulsing, breathing heavy.  
			And her legs are pressing against my 
			ears so tightly that I don't hear her 
			father come into the room.  He grabs 
			my hair...
				(grabs his own hair and pulls 
				back)
			...and he pulls me way back, hard.

					ALYSSA
				(throws up her leg, and rolls 
				up pants)
			Senior year.  Spring Formal.  I'm 
			eating our Missy Kurt in her brother's 
			car.  She's laying across the back 
			seat, and I'm half-hanging out of the 
			car, my knees on the ground.  She's 
			flailing around, and she knocks the 
			parking brake off.  The car starts 
			rolling down the hill, and my right 
			knee is cut up all to shit like a 
			kiddy's scissor class cut it up for 
			paper dolls.

	Banky and Alyssa laugh.  Holden looks at a small scar on 
	his arm and thinks better about mentioning it.  Then Kim 
	re-enters and plants a big kiss on Alyssa's neck.

					HOLDEN
				(off Banky's watch)
			Holy shit, is that the time.  We've 
			gotta beat traffic.

					BANKY
			What traffic - it's one thirty in the 
			morning!

					HOLDEN
				(getting up)
			And rush hour starts in six hours.  
			Let's go.
				(to Alyssa)
			Thanks for inviting us out.  It was... 
			educational.

	Alyssa waves at him as he exits.  Banky slides out of the 
	booth.

					BANKY
				(to Kim)
			Since you like chicks, right.. 
			do you just look at yourself in the 
			mirror all the time?

	Holden reaches in and pulls Banky out.  Alyssa watches 
	them go, then turns and kisses Kim.



	INT. M-TV EXEC'S OFFICE WAITING ROOM - DAY

	Holden looks preoccupied.  Banky flips through magazines, 
	biting off mini pieces of the gum he's chewing.  He 
	sticks them between pages, presses the mag closed, picks 
	up another one and then repeats the whole process.  A 
	Receptionist types.

					BANKY
				(off Holden's look)
			You're still dwelling on the dyke, 
			aren't you?

					HOLDEN
			Lower your voice.

					BANKY
			What'd I tell you - she just needs the 
			right guy.  All every woman really 
			wants - be it mother, senator, nun - 
			is some serious deep-dicking.

	The Receptionist stops typing and looks at Banky, 
	shocked.

					BANKY
				(off her look)
			Don't give me that look - I heard Adam 
			Curry say worse.

	The Secretary goes back to typing.  Banky shrugs at 
	Holden.

					BANKY
			That's why I can't buy lesbians.  
			Everyone needs dick.  See, I can buy 
			fags.  Bunch of guys that need dick - 
			just plain need it?  That I get.  
			Dykes?  Bullshit posturing.  But - 
			live and let live, I guess.

					HOLDEN
			I'm sure the gay community appreciates 
			your support.

	JOHN SLOSS, the boy's lawyer, joins them.

					SLOSS
			Please tell me you haven't blown this 
			deal already.

					BANKY
			Sloss like a mother fucker.
				(slaps his hand)

					SLOSS
			Hey, every mother but your's - a 
			shyster's gotta have his standards. 
			Shall we?



	INT. M-TV EXEC'S OFFICE - DAY

	The EXECS are a casual couple of guys, sitting on couches 
	across from our trio.

					EXEC 1
			We just want to start off by saying 
			that it's a pleasure to finally meet 
			you.  While it's been - shall we say - 
			an experience dealing with Sloss here, 
			one of the main reasons we started 
			this whole thing was to meet the guys 
			that do 'Bluntman and Chronic'.

					EXEC 2
				(points at them)
			'Snootchie Bootchies'.

	The Execs and Sloss laugh.  Holden and Banky politely 
	join in.  Banky shoots Holden a 'these guys are idiots' 
	look.

					EXEC 1
			Which brings us to our proposal: we 
			are extremely interested in doing 
			twelve, half-hour 'Bluntman and 
			Chronic' cartoons.  The age of Beavis 
			is coming to a close, and we're 
			looking for something... something...

					BANKY
			Even more retarded and juvenile to 
			sate the voracious, intellectually-
			challenged miscreants that make up 
			your key demographic.

	The Execs laugh hard.  Sloss secretly shrugs to Banky and 
	gives the thumbs up.

					EXEC 1
				(composes himself)
			So what do you say! Are we in 
			business!

	Banky leans back into the couch, wearing a thoughtful 
	face.  He looks to Holden, then to Sloss.  Sloss nods in 
	understanding.

					SLOSS
			Jim, Sean - could we have a few 
			minutes!

					EXEC 2
				(looks to Exec 1)
			Uh... absolutely.  We'll just..

					EXEC 1
			Uh...wait outside

	The Exec's smile and head our, closing the door behind 
	then.  Sloss turns to Banky.

					SLOSS
			So?  Did I do good?

					BANKY
			You did better - you sold us out!

	They clasp hands and quietly explode in ebullience.

					SLOSS
			Do you know how much you'll make on 
			merchandising alone!

					BANKY
				(as Simon Bar Sinister)
			Money and Power, and Money and 
			Power...

					SLOSS
				(joins in)
			Money dnd Power, and Money and...

					HOLDEN
				(interrupting)
			I don't think it's a good idea.

	Banky and Sloss freeze.  They stare at Holden.

					BANKY
			What's not a good idea!  Please don't 
			say the cartoon, please don't say the 
			cartoon...

					HOLDEN
			The cartoon.

					SLOSS
			What?!?  Are you out of your fucking 
			mind!

					BANKY
				(getting up)
			John, let me handle this.
				( to Holden)
			You are out of your fucking mind, 
			aren't you!

					HOLDEN
			Is this how you want to be remembered!  
			As the guy who created Bluntman and 
			Chronic!

	Banky sits at the Exec's desk and starts rifling through 
	the guy's stuff.

					BANKY
			No, I'd like to be remembered as the 
			filthy rich guy who created Bluntman 
			and Chronic.

					HOLDEN
			But it'll be all glossy and main-
			stream.  We'll lose any artistic 
			credibility we ever had.

					SLOSS
				(to Banky)
			Is it me!  I don't see the problem.

					BANKY
				(to Sloss)
			He just has to get over this crush of 
			his.

					SLOSS
			Oh God - not on Carrie Fisher again!
				(to Holden)
			Holden - she's not really a Princess.

					BANKY
				(opening drawer with a letter 
				opener)
			Not on her; on Alyssa Jones - the 
			chick that does that comic book 
			'Idiosyncratic Routine'.  You ever 
			seen it?

					SLOSS
			Please.  Like I even read your comic, 
			let alone anyone else's,
				(to Holden)
			I'm not limited to offering you legal 
			counsel only, my friend.  I'm also 
			learned in the ways of the heart, and 
			can offer you this advice - nail her, 
			get it out of your system, and move 
			on.  Like we say at Sloss Law - good 
			fences make good neighbors.

					BANKY
			She'd never let him in her yard.  The 
			chick's gay.

					SLOSS
				(laughing)
			She's gay?  You fell for a gay, comic-
			book writing chick?  Holden, you poor, 
			poor man!
				(beat)
			Wait a sec - does she have 
			representation!

					BANKY
			Always working, you.
				(holds up a Polaroid of a 
				naked woman)
			Look at this - Mrs. M-TV Exec has a 
			string of pearls hanging our of her 
			ass,

					SLOSS
			Would you leave his stuff alone!
				(to Holden)
			You can break her resolve, killer.  
			All it takes is one good man.  But if 
			it takes two good men, don't hesitate 
			to call me.  That being said, in 
			regards to the more pressing issue, I 
			suggest you leave art to the museums 
			and grab on with both hands to the 
			big, fat check.

					HOLDEN
			I'll give it some thought

					BANKY
				(holding up Polaroid)
			I'm taking this as a precaution - just 
			in case they give us any shit about 
			pussy's decision delay.
				(glaring at Holden)
			You'll 'give it some thought'.  You're 
			so retarded

					HOLDEN
			I'm retarded!  This from the guy who 
			only forty five minutes ago paid fifty 
			bucks for what's supposed to be a boot-
			leg of 'March of the Wooden Soldiers' 
			with a deleted scene of Stan Laurel 
			wearing a French Tickler.

					SLOSS
			How'd you fall for that!

					BANKY
			The guy who sold it to me had an 
			honest face.



	INT. STUDIO - DAY

	There is a door.  There's a knock at the door.  Holden 
	opens it and Alyssa is standing there.

					ALYSSA
			Somebody told me that they make comic 
			books here, and I've got an idea for 
			this story about a guy who comes to a 
			club and high-tails it when he finds 
			out this girl is pay.  Any interest in 
			a story like that!

	Holden smiles.



	EXT. RIVERFRONT PARK - DAY

	Alyssa and Holden walk through the park, eating hot dogs.

					ALYSSA
			M-TV?

					HOLDEN
			Twelve episodes.

					ALYSSA
			That's great, isn't it?

					HOLDEN
			Banky seems to think so.

					ALYSSA
			But you don't.

	They come to a swing set and sit down on the swings.

					HOLDEN
			I don't know if that's the perception 
			I want people to have of our stuff.  I 
			know this sounds pretentious as hell, 
			but I like to think of us as artists.  
			And I'd like to get back to doing 
			something more personal - like our 
			first book.

					ALYSSA
			Well when are you going to do that?

					HOLDEN
				(beat)
			As soon as we have something personal 
			to say.

					ALYSSA
			Do you know how pretty you are?

					HOLDEN
			What?

					ALYSSA
			You're a pretty man.

					HOLDEN
			Uh... thanks.

					ALYSSA
			Oh.  I get it.  I'm into girls, so I 
			have to find all men repulsive or 
			something.

					HOLDEN
			I didn't say anything.

					ALYSSA
			Aren't there some men that you find 
			attractive?  Granted, not enough to 
			sleep with, but still - just handsome 
			or something!

					HOLDEN
			Sure.  Harrison Ford.  And our mail-
			man.

					ALYSSA
			Well it's the same thing.  I look at 
			you and just find you really handsome.  
			And you know, it has very little to do 
			with your look, per-se.  Your look is 
			fine, don't get me wrong.  But it's 
			more your outlook.  The things you 
			say, the way you see things.  It's... 
			I don't know... attractive,

	Holden looks away, embarrassed,

					ALYSSA
			I weirded you our the other night

					HOLDEN
			Huh!  No, not really.

					ALYSSA
			Come on.

					HOLDEN
				(beat)
			It's just that we've.., I mean, I've 
			never seen that kind of thing up close 
			and personal.  It just took awhile to 
			process, longer than usual.

					ALYSSA
			Do you want to talk about it!

					HOLDEN
			Um.  If you want to.

					ALYSSA
			I like you.  I haven't liked a man in 
			a long time.  And I'm not a man-hater 
			or something.  It's just been some 
			time since I've been exposed to a man 
			that didn't immediately live-into a 
			stereotype of some sort.  And I want 
			you to feel comfortable with me, 
			because I want us to be friends.  So 
			if there are things you'd like to 
			know, it's okay to ask me.

					HOLDEN
				(beat)
			Why girls?

					ALYSSA
				(beat)
			Why men?

					HOLDEN
			Because that's the standard

					ALYSSA
			If that's the only reason you're 
			attracted to women - because it's the 
			standard..

					HOLDEN
			It's more than that.

					ALYSSA
			So you've never been curious about 
			men?

					HOLDEN
			Curious about men?  Well... I always 
			wondered why my father watched 'Hee-
			Haw'.

					ALYSSA
			You know what I mean.

					HOLDEN
			No.

					ALYSSA
			Why not!

					HOLDEN
			No interest.

					ALYSSA
			Because...?

					HOLDEN
			Girls feel right.

					ALYSSA
			And that's how I feel.  I've never 
			really been attracted to men.  I'm 
			more comfortable with the idea of 
			girls.

					HOLDEN
			Wait, wait, wait - you're still a 
			virgin?

					ALYSSA
			No.

					HOLDEN
			But you've only been with girls.

					ALYSSA
			You're saying a person's a virgin 
			until they've had intercourse with a 
			member of the opposite sex?

					HOLDEN
			Isn't that the standard definition?

					ALYSSA
			Again with the standards.  I think 
			virginity is lost when you make love 
			for the first time.

					HOLDEN
			With a member of the opposite sex.

					ALYSSA
			Why?  Why only then?

					HOLDEN
			Because that's the standard.

					ALYSSA
			So if a virgin is raped, then she's 
			still a virgin?

					HOLDEN
			Of course not.

					ALYSSA
			But rape is not the standard.  So 
			she's had sex, but not the standard 
			idea of sex.  Hence, according to  
			your definition, she'd still be a 
			virgin.

					HOLDEN
			Okay, I'll revise.  Virginity is lost 
			when the hymen is broken.

					ALYSSA
			Then I lost my virginity at ten, 
			because I fell on a fence post when I 
			was ten, and it broke my hymen.  Now I 
			have to tell people that I lost it to 
			a wooden post I'd known my whole young 
			life?

					HOLDEN
			Second revision - virginity is lost 
			through penetration.

					ALYSSA
			Physical penetration or emotional?

					HOLDEN
			Emotional?

					ALYSSA
			Well, I fell in love hard with Caitlin 
			Bree when we were in high school.

					HOLDEN
			Physical penetration.

					ALYSSA
			We had sex.

					HOLDEN
			Yeah, but not real sex.

					ALYSSA
			I move to have that remark stricken 
			from the record.  On account of it 
			makes you come off as completely naive 
			and infantile.

					HOLDEN
			Well where's the penetration in 
			lesbian sex.

	Alyssa holds up her hand.

					HOLDEN
			A finger?  Come on.  I've had my 
			finger in my ass but I wouldn't say 
			I've had anal sex.

					ALYSSA
			Did I hold up a finger?
				(waves her hand)

					HOLDEN
				(beat; then he gets it)
			You're kidding?!?!
				(she nods)
			How...?!?

					ALYSSA
			Our bodies are built to pass a child, 
			for Christ's sake.

					HOLDEN
			But doesn't it hurt?!

					ALYSSA
			Sure.  But in a good way.  And it's 
			only a once-in-awhile thing - reserved 
			for really special occasions.

					HOLDEN
			What about not-so-special occasions?

					ALYSSA
			Tongue only.

					HOLDEN
			But how can that be enough?  I mean, 
			let's be real - how big can a tongue 
			even get?

	Alyssa swallows what she's chewing and releases her 
	tongue, which is just huge.  Holden is transfixed.  
	Alyssa wraps it back up and smiles, standing.

					ALYSSA
			Let's go.

	She exits. Holden remains in the swing.  Alyssa comes 
	back in.

					ALYSSA
			Come on.

					HOLDEN
			Just...uh... just give me a moment.



	INT AIRPORT - DAY

	Holden enters. Banky tries to balance way-too-much 
	luggage.

					HOLDEN
			Look at you.  It's a two day trip.

					BANKY
			I got the Sega in one bag, my clothes 
			in the other, and two months worth of 
			unread comics in this one.

					HOLDEN
			We're going to a convention, for the 
			love of God.  We'll be busy from ten 
			'till eight each day. 
			When are you possibly going to have 
			time for any of that shit?  In fact, 
			fuck it - you're leaving some of this 
			shit here in a locker.  Come on - give 
			me the two that aren't clothes.

					BANKY
			Hold on.
				(starts rifling through one 
				bag)

					HOLDEN
			What are you doing?

					BANKY
			I just have to get something.
				(pulls out a huge stack of 
				porno books)

					HOLDEN
			Who are you, Larry fucking Flynt?  
			What are you going to do with all of 
			those?

					BANKY
			Read the articles.  What do you think 
			I'm going to do with them?  They're 
			stroke books.

					HOLDEN
			You've got like thirty books there!  
			We're only there for two days!

					BANKY
				(leafing through mags)
			Variety's the spice of life.  I like a 
			wide selection.  Sometimes I'm in the 
			mood for nasty close-ups, sometimes I 
			like them arty and air-brushed.  Some 
			times it's a spread brown-eye kind of 
			night, sometimes it's girl-on-girl 
			time.  Sometimes a steamy letter will 
			do it, sometimes - not often, but 
			sometimes - I like the idea of a chick 
			with a horse.

	A beeping sound is heard.  Holden checks his beeper.

					HOLDEN
			Go check us in.  I've gotta call 
			Alyssa.

					BANKY
			His master's voice.

					HOLDEN
			Put that stuff away.

	Holden exits.  Banky starts packing his mags up.  A 
	little KID enters, staring at him.

					KID
			What are those?

					BANKY
				(looks at kid then books)
			Do you Like horsies?

	Holden finishes dialing the phone.  Cross cut between him 
	and Alyssa at home.

					ALYSSA
			I hope for the sake of the women 
			you've dated that you're only this 
			quick in returning calls.

					HOLDEN
			What's up?  I'm about to get on a 
			plane.

					ALYSSA
			Ohhh.  Why!

					HOLDEN
			Last minute invite to the Dragon Con'.

					ALYSSA
			Shit.

					HOLDEN
			What?

					ALYSSA
			My sister's at my parents'.  I was 
			gonna go see her.

					HOLDEN
			The one that wrote the book?

					ALYSSA
			Yeah.  But I was staying all weekend, 
			and I wanted to hang our with you.  
			This sucks.

					HOLDEN
			You didn't get invited to the Con'?

					ALYSSA
			I don't do southern con's - all the 
			chicks have that annoying drawl.  You 
			know how hard it is nor to laugh when 
			someone moans "Fuhhk me"?

					HOLDEN
			Well this sucks.
				(thinks)
			You know - both of us don't have to 
			go.

					ALYSSA
			Really?

					HOLDEN
			Yeah.  Banky can go by himself.  It's 
			not like we're on a panel.  It was 
			just a signing appearance.

					ALYSSA
			If you come pick me up, I'll be your 
			best friend.

					HOLDEN
				(beat)
			Where's your apartment?

					ALYSSA
			I'm not there.  I'm at a friend's - in 
			the Village.  Corner of Houston and 
			Mercer.  Number eighty six, apartment 
			6-D.

					HOLDEN
			I'll be there in half an hour.

					ALYSSA
			You're so easy.

	They hang up.  Holden reacts to something OC and exits 
	quickly.

	C11. Banky points to pictures in the book.  The kid looks 
	on.

					BANKY
			...And then Black Beauty couldn't take 
			it any longer, and he finally did some 
			of his own mounting.

					KID
				(off book)
			Wow.

	Holden grabs Banky's arm and drags him away.

					HOLDEN
			What are you doing?

					BANKY
				(waving to kid)
			I think I want kids of my own one day.  
			They're fun.

					HOLDEN
			Listen to me - I'm not going.  You're 
			going to have to do this one by 
			yourself.

					BANKY
			What?  Why?

					HOLDEN
			Alyssa's coming down for the weekend, 
			so I want to hang out with her.  You 
			don't need me for this.
				(taking his excess baggage)
			Meantime,  I'll take this stuff home.  
			You can keep the filth.  I'll pick you 
			up at nine Sunday night, alright?  
			Don't forget to plug the Annual and 
			don't mention the t.v. show, okay?  
			Call me if you get bored.

	And he's gone.  Banky stands there, open-mouthed.  A 
	check-in FLIGHT ATTENDANT comes up to him.  His name-tag 
	reads 'Frank'.

					FLIGHT ATTENDANT
			Checking in, sir!

					BANKY
				(still watching Holden go)
			Hunhh!
				(looks at F.A.)
			Yeah.  But this is carry-on.

					F.A.
			Federal aviation security law requires 
			me to ask if you've been given any 
			strange gifts or parcels to carry-on 
			since arriving at the airport today.

					BANKY
				(thinks)
			Not this trip.  But one time, when I 
			was using curb side check-in, this sky-
			cap gave me a cock ring and a set of 
			anal ben-wa balls.  I always thought 
			that was pretty strange.  He said his 
			name was Frank.
				(looks closely at him)
			Hey!  You're name's Frank!

	Banky storms away.  The Flight Attendant watches him go.

					F.A.
			Fucking kids.



	EXT APARTMENT 6-D - DAY

	Holden knocks at the door.  It opens.  A WOMAN is 
	standing in the doorway in her bra She looks Holden up 
	and down and smirks.

					WOMAN
			Let me guess - 'the right man'?

					HOLDEN
			Excuse me?

					WOMAN
			You've got it in your head that 
			Alyssa's not really into chicks - that 
			she just hasn't met the right man.  
			And you believe you're it.  You're 
			going to treat her right, fuck her 
			like a stud, and 'straight-jacket' her 
			back from the land of the lost.  And 
			the sad truth is that you'll 
			accomplish none of that and wind up as 
			either an even more bitter misogynist 
			or a reverse fag-hag.

	Holden's at a loss.  Alyssa slips past the Woman, 
	carrying an overnight bag.

					ALYSSA
			Don't mind her.  That's just her way a 
			saying hello.

					WOMAN
			Actually, it's just my way of saying 
			"Give it up."

					ALYSSA
				(to Woman)
			You're such an asshole.

					WOMAN
			When you file the date-rape charges, 
			don't say I didn't warn you.

					HOLDEN
				(holding out hand)
			I'm Holden, by the way.

					WOMAN
			I'm the voice of reason that Miss 
			Bitch is having such a hard time 
			listening to.

					HOLDEN
			Look, we're just friends.

					WOMAN
			That's what every guy says before he 
			tries purring your hand on his dick.

					HOLDEN
			And how do you know men so well?

					WOMAN
			Because I lapdance for a living, dick-
			head.

	She slams the door. Holden looks to Alyssa.

					ALYSSA
			Ohhh - you look so cute!

	She heads down the stairs.

					HOLDEN
			Who was that?

					ALYSSA
			Just an occasional friend.

					HOLDEN
			Why would you want to hang our with 
			someone bitter as that?

					ALYSSA
				(stops)
			Remember this!
				(sticks out huge tongue)
			Her's is even bigger than that.

	She smiles and continues on.  Holden looks back up at the 
	door.  He sticks his own tongue our and sizes it with his 
	fingers.



	EXT TURNPIKE - DAY

	The car sits in traffic.



	INT CAR - DAY

	Holden sighs.  Alyssa plays with the radio.

					ALYSSA
			You were raised Catholic, right?

					HOLDEN
			Yeah.  You?

					ALYSSA
			Baptist.

					HOLDEN
			Really?  Did you have a strict 
			upbringing?

					ALYSSA
			Please There was no time to be bad - 
			we were too busy saying 'Jesus'.

					HOLDEN
			You think your upbringing had 
			something to do with your lifestyle 
			choice?

					ALYSSA
			Somewhere along the line.  It's a 
			gradual transition to make - from 
			doing what the majority does to taking 
			a leap of faith and doing what feels 
			more natural.  Everything helps - from 
			the way you were handled as a kid, to 
			the way the boys acted in third grade, 
			to the shoes you wore at your freshman 
			prom.

					HOLDEN
			Shoes?

					ALYSSA
			Well they were really tight.



	HANGING OUT MONTAGE BEGINS

	With the requisite music, over which we hear a 
	conversation between Holden and Alyssa.

	1) Holden and Alyssa sit in the DINER eating.  Holden's 
	talking.  The Waitress walks past and drops her pad.  She 
	bends over, to pick it up, hiking her mini-skirt up in 
	the process.  Alyssa stares at her ass.  Holden stops 
	talking and stares at her.  Alyssa looks over at him and 
	offers a caught smile.

	2) Holden pushes a shopping cart at the FOOD STORE, 
	throwing various things into the basket.  Alyssa comes up 
	with a box of Tampons and throws them in.  Holden glances 
	at them, a bit flushed.  Alyssa catches him, picks up the 
	box, and pulls one out.  She proceeds to demonstrate 
	their usage, throwing one leg on the can and miming 
	insertion.  Holden puts up his hands in the "I know, I 
	know," fashion.

	3) In the Studio, Holden displays some of his artwork to 
	Alyssa, during which she pulls out a cigarette and goes 
	to light it.  It's a child-proof lighter, so she's having 
	trouble.  Holden grows a little frustrated.  Finally, he 
	grabs the lighter and pulls the child proof tab out with 
	his teeth.  Alyssa stares at him a bit taken aback.  
	Holden spits the tab out, and lights Alyssa's smoke.  He 
	then continues with his display.

	4) Holden and Alyssa at the COMIC BOOK STORE.  Steve-Dave 
	and the Fan-Boy eye them suspiciously.  Alyssa pays for a 
	comic.  Steve-Dave glowers at Holden.  He gives Alyssa 
	her change and they exit.  Steve-Dave goes back to his 
	card game with the Fan-Boy.  Suddenly, a garbage can 
	comes crashing through their window.  Steve-Dave rips a 
	check off the garbage can and punches the counter.  The 
	Fan-Boy rubs his back soothingly,

	5) Holden and Alyssa walk through a PARKING LOT, talking.  
	She takes his hand and pulls his arm around her shoulder. 
	Holden smiles to himself.

					HOLDEN V.O.
			Let me ask you something - we get 
			along, right?

					ALYSSA V.O.
			Famously.

					HOLDEN V.O.
			We have a definite chemistry?

					ALYSSA V.O.
			So it would seem.

					HOLDEN V.O.
			But we're both into girls.

					ALYSSA V.O.
			I'm into women.

					HOLDEN V.O.
			But you weren't always gay.

					ALYSSA V.O.
			When I was nine I had a crush on Scott 
			Baio.

					HOLDEN V.O.
			So If we'd met a long time ago, say in 
			high school...

					ALYSSA V.O.
			...I'd still be muff-diving, yes.

					HOLDEN V.O.
			Thought so.



	INT STUDIO - DAY

	Holden and Banky play EA Sports Hockey on Sega.  There's 
	a knock at the door.

					HOLDEN
			Come in.

	Alyssa enters and stands besides them, smiling at their 
	game.

					ALYSSA
			I read somewhere that guys who play 
			hockey are merely making up for penile 
			deficiencies by carrying big sticks.

					BANKY
			I thought you lived in the city?  This 
			is like the umpteenth time I've seen 
			you here.  Isn't that grounds enough 
			for the little pink mafia to throw you 
			out of their club?

					HOLDEN
				(hits Banky; to Alyssa)
			I'll be ready in a second.  
			I just have to school this mouthy 
			second-stringer.

					BANKY
			Bitch, you're schooling no one.

	They play.  Cut back and forth between the game and 
	Banky, Holden, and Alyssa.

					HOLDEN
				(off game)
			What?  Do something!

					BANKY
				(off game)
			You fucking cock-teaser.  I'll knock 
			your fucking teeth out and pass all 
			over your ass.

					HOLDEN
			Look at how slow you are.  Christ, you 
			move like a geriatric.

					BANKY
				(screaming at screen)
			Fuck!  You Fucking cock-sucker, man!  
			These faggots won't do what I tell 
			them to!

					HOLDEN
			Oh. It's the controller, right?  It's 
			always the controller.

					BANKY
			No, it's these... fucking queers on 
			blades that can't accept a fucking 
			pass to save their lives!  What period 
			is this?

					HOLDEN
			Final sixty of the third.

					BANKY
			Fuck!  Look at your fucking guys, 
			they... FUCK!!!
				(whips controller)
			FUCKING COCK SUCKER, MAN!  I SWEAR TO 
			GOD!

	Banky storms away.  Alyssa looks at Holden,

					HOLDEN
			Imagine if I'd only beaten him by one 
			instead of thirty.



	INT SKEE-BALL ARCADE - DAY

	Holden feeds a couple dollars into the change machine.  
	Alyssa looks on.

					ALYSSA
			Explain this again.

					HOLDEN
			How could you have grown up down the 
			shore and never played skee-ball?  
			What did you do with your youth?

	They head toward the skee-ball runs.

					ALYSSA
			Stayed out late, smoked pot, screwed 
			around.

					HOLDEN
			Not your grade school years; your high 
			school years.

					ALYSSA
				(off skee-ball run)
			This looks complicated.

					HOLDEN
				(Inserts coin and pulls 
				lever)
			The premise is very basic - you roll 
			the ball up the ramp at varying 
			speeds, in an effort to pop it into 
			the score circles.  The higher the 
			score, the more prize tickets you get.

					ALYSSA
			What do you do with the prize tickets?

					HOLDEN
			Trade them in for prizes that aren't 
			worth nearly as much as you paid to 
			play the game.

					ALYSSA
			Then what's the point?

					HOLDEN
			It's fun.

					ALYSSA
			And you question my lifestyle.

					HOLDEN
			Observe.

	Holden rolls the ball.  It pops into a twenty point 
	circle.

					HOLDEN
			See?  It's just that simple.

					ALYSSA
			Why not just walk up there and put it 
			in the fifty every time?

					HOLDEN
			Where's the skill in that?

					ALYSSA
			Oh, this is a skill?  I'm sorry, I had 
			no idea.

					HOLDEN
			Just toss one.

	Alyssa picks up a ball, squints to aim, and whips it 
	overhand.  It pops off one of the circles and shoots back 
	at them, missing them as they duck.  An OC knock and an 
	"OW!" is heard.  Holden reacts as Alyssa laughs.

					HOLDEN
				(to OC guy)
			I'm sorry, man.  She's new at this.

	Holden ducks as the ball comes sailing back at his head.  
	He gets up.

					HOLDEN
				(to OC)
			Thank you.
				(hands Alyssa another ball)
			Underhand.  Throw it underhand.

					ALYSSA
			This is where you take straight chicks 
			on dates?

					HOLDEN
			It's like Spanish Fly.  This'll 
			probably be the first time I don't 
			score afterwards.

					ALYSSA
			I don't know.  I'm starting to get a 
			tingle in my bottom.
				(tosses a ball)
			Ten.

					HOLDEN
				(grabs a ball)
			So what'd you do last night?
				(prepares to throw)

					ALYSSA
			Got laid

	Holden whips the ball in surprise.  It ricochets off the 
	ceiling and through the glass of an old pinball machine.  
	Alyssa laughs.  Holden looks around, nervously.

					ALYSSA
			Some more of that skill you were 
			telling me about?

					HOLDEN
			Maybe we should just leave before 
			somebody gets hurt.

					ALYSSA
			No way.  I want a cheap prize.
				(throws a ball)
			So your friend's quite the homophobe.

					HOLDEN
			He just feels left out, I think.

					ALYSSA
			I'm not talking about his infantile 
			hang-up with me.  I'm talking about 
			when you two were playing that game.  
			Everytime he swore - when his players 
			messed up, he called them cocksuckers, 
			he referred to the players as queers, 
			he called you a cock-teaser...

					HOLDEN
			I thought he was talking to you.

					ALYSSA
			I know you think it means nothing, and 
			it may in fact be unintentional, but 
			it's ugly all the same.

					HOLDEN
			He was just pissed he was losing.

					ALYSSA
			So he slams the gay community?

					HOLDEN
			C'mon.  Don't get all p.c. on me.

					ALYSSA
			I'm not.  But what is that saying?

					HOLDEN
			It says he gets too easily frustrated.

					ALYSSA
			It's passive/agressive gay-bashing.

					HOLDEN
			How do you figure?

					ALYSSA
			How casually did it roll off his 
			tongue?  And that's how he expresses 
			his anger?  By calling people faggots?

					HOLDEN
			I think you're reading too much into 
			it.

					ALYSSA
			I think you're just so used to it that 
			it rolls off your back.  I've heard 
			the two of you play your little rank 
			out game where one insists the other 
			is gay.
				(as the boys)
			"You're a faggot.  No, you're a 
			faggot."  It's cute and all to watch 
			you go at it like grade-schooler, but 
			it's also offensive - labeling and 
			ducking the label of being gay as if 
			it were the scarlet fucking letter.

					HOLDEN
			You're blowing this way out of 
			proportion.  We live in a more 
			tolerant age now.  You refer to 
			yourself as a dyke.  Hooper calls 
			himself a faggot all the time...

					ALYSSA
			Yeah, but that's what's known as 
			empowerment/disempowerment.  I call 
			myself a dyke so it's not too 
			devastating when some throwback 
			screams it at me as I'm leaving a bar 
			at night.  
			Same for Hooper - by calling himself a 
			faggot, he steals the thunder away 
			from the mouthy jerks of this world 
			who'd like to beat him to it.  But the 
			difference between us having it and 
			your friend saying it is miles wide.  
			We say it to mask the pain - you say 
			it for lack of a better expression at 
			any given moment.  No Holden, we do 
			not live in a more tolerant age.  And 
			if you think that's the case, then 
			you've been in the suburbs way too 
			long to be resuscitated.

	Holden kind of sulks.  Alyssa notices.

					ALYSSA
			But you know what?
				(picks up his face)
			I have more faith in you than that.
				(rips her tickets off)
			Come on - I want my cheap prize.



	INT STUDIO - NIGHT

	Holden enters.  Banky's still playing Sega.  Holden sits 
	next to him.

					HOLDEN
				(off screen)
			How bad do you suck!

					BANKY
			How was your pseudo-date?

					HOLDEN
			Leave it alone.

					BANKY
			That chick bugs me.

					HOLDEN
				(rubs his head; in baby-talk)
			Aww.  Everyone bugs you.

					BANKY
			Get off.
				(off game)
			Fucking faggot!  Did you see that?!  
			Your dyke courting ass just got me 
			scored on!

					HOLDEN
				(beat)
			You know, you should watch that.  If 
			you're going to get all bent out of 
			shape while playing the game, so much 
			so that you need to curse the t.v., 
			try not to gay-bash it, alright.  
			You're nor that kind of guy.
				(gets up)
			And don't call her a dyke, alright?  
			She's a lesbian.

	Holden goes to his drawing table and takes off his coat.  
	Banky sits there, shocked.  He puts the controller down 
	and crosses to the drawing table.

					BANKY
			What the fuck is going on here?

					HOLDEN
				(pulling out pencil)
			I'm starting a new page.

					BANKY
				(smacking pencil away)
			Not with this shit!  With you.  What 
			the fuck is going on with you and that 
			girl?

					HOLDEN
			We're friends.

					BANKY
			She's programming you.

					HOLDEN
			I beg your pardon?  Programming?

					BANKY
			Yeah.  And apparently, you don't even 
			realize it.  What does it matter if I 
			refer to her as a dyke, or if I call 
			the Whalers a bunch of faggots in the 
			privacy of my own office, far from the 
			sensitive ears of the rest of the 
			world?

					HOLDEN
			It's passive/aggressive gay-bashing; 
			and I know you're not really 
			prejudiced at heart.  You should just 
			find some other way to express your 
			anger, is all I'm saying.

	Holden starts drawing.  Banky stares at him.  Then he 
	grabs the pencil out of Holden's hand and shoves him to 
	the side.  He starts drawing something.

					HOLDEN
			What the fuck are you doing!

					BANKY
			Bear with me here.  I just want to put 
			you through this little exercise.
				(drawing feverishly)
			Okay, now see this?  This is a four 
			way road, okay?

	Banky draws a four-way stop.  He illustrates according to 
	his voice-over.

					BANKY V.O.
			And dead in the center, is a crisp, 
			new, hundred dollar bill.  Now at the 
			end of each of the streets, are four 
			people, okay?  You following?  Up 
			here, we got a male-affectionate, easy-
			to-get-along-with, no political agenda 
			lesbian.  Okay?  Now down here, we 
			have a man-hating, angry-as-fuck, 
			agenda-of-rage, bitter dyke.  To this 
			side, we got Santa Claus, right?  And 
			over to this side - the Easter Bunny.

	Banky finishes drawing.  Holden's shaking his head

					BANKY
			Which one's going to get to the 
			hundred dollar bill first?

					HOLDEN
			What is this supposed to prove?

					BANKY
			I'm serious.  This is a serious 
			exercise.  It's like an S.A.T. 
			question.  Which one's going to get to 
			the hundred dollar bill first - the 
			male-friendly lesbian, the man-hating 
			dyke, Santa Claus, or the Easter 
			Bunny?

					HOLDEN
				(beat; then pissed)
			The man-hating dyke.

					BANKY
			Good.  Why?

					HOLDEN
			I don't know.

					BANKY
				(wildly crossing out the 
				other three)
			BECAUSE THESE OTHER THREE ARE FIGMENTS 
			OF YOUR FUCKING IMAGINATION!

	Holden storms away.  Banky follows.

					HOLDEN
			I don't need this.  I'm going home.

					BANKY
			She's fucking with your mind, man!  
			She knows you've got this schoolboy 
			crush and she's using it to sway your 
			way of thinking!

					HOLDEN
			And why would she need to do that?  
			What is she Mata fucking Hari?!  What 
			does she gain?

					BANKY
			Maybe she thinks you'll get her comic 
			picked up by Contender.  Or maybe she 
			thinks you'll change the content of 
			our book to something more political 
			and message oriented.  Or, gee - I 
			don't know - maybe because that's just 
			what dykes like to do: fuck around 
			with straight guys' heads, just so she 
			can go back to her little rug-muncher 
			club and have a good laugh with all 
			her man-hating harpy cronies about how 
			fucking stupid and easily duped men 
			are!

					HOLDEN
			You're so out of line right now..,

					BANKY
			You don't even know this girl!  Big 
			deal, she's from Middletown and she 
			went to North!  All the girls at North 
			were bitches and sluts anyway!  And 
			this one's got them beat by a mile 
			because she's a bitch/slut/dyke!

					HOLDEN
			Watch your fucking mouth, is all I'm 
			going to tell you..

					BANKY
			Oh why?  Do you get my back when she 
			bashes me?  Because I know she does.  
			And do you know why she does?  Because 
			I won't play her fucking game!

					HOLDEN
			Sometimes your paranoia and suspicious 
			bullshit is amusing.  Sometimes it's 
			just fucking annoying as piss!

					BANKY
			What is it about this girl?  You know 
			you have no shot at getting her into 
			bed!  Why do you bother wasting time 
			with her?  Because you're Holden 
			fucking McNeil - most persistent 
			traveller on the road that's not the 
			path of least resistance!  
			Everything's gotta be a fucking 
			challenge for you, and this little 
			relationship with that bitch is a 
			prime example of your fucking 
			condition.  Well I don't need a 
			fucking magic eight ball to look into 
			your future; you want a forecast?  
			Here - will Holden ever fuck Alyssa.
				(shakes and looks at 
				imaginary ball)
			What a shock - "Not fucking likely"!  
			This relationship of  your's is 
			affecting you, our work and our 
			friendship, and the time's going to 
			come when I throw down the gauntlet 
			and say it's me or her!  And then 
			what're you going to say?!

					HOLDEN
				(beat)
			I think you should let this one go.

					BANKY
			No, what would you say?  Would you 
			trash twenty years of friendship 
			because you've got some idiotic notion 
			that this chick would even let you 
			sniff her panties, let alone fuck 
			her?!

					HOLDEN
			Let it go...

					BANKY
			What the fuck.. WHAT THE FUCK MAKES
			THIS BITCH ALL THAT IMPORTANT?!?!
	Holden looks at Banky for a long beat.

					HOLDEN
			I'm in love with her, man.

	Banky stares at him.  Holden stares back.  Banky looks 
	into Holden's eyes.  Suddenly, he softens a bit.  He 
	drops his head.

					BANKY
			Fuck.

	Banky walks away.  Holden watches him go and exits.



	INT DINER - NIGHT

	Holden and Alyssa sit at a booth.  Alyssa picks through 
	her food.  Holden looks at the check and pulls money from 
	his wallet.

					HOLDEN
			I wish you were the one being pursued 
			by M-TV.

					ALYSSA
			Oh really?

					HOLDEN
			Sure.  Then you could sell our and 
			maybe pick up the check once in 
			awhile.

					ALYSSA
				(drops her fork and wipes her 
				hands)
			We're leaving!

					HOLDEN
			Well it's not like this is a bed and 
			breakfast,

					ALYSSA
			I've got a little business to conduct.

	She grabs her bag and slides out of the booth.  Holden 
	watches her, then follows.

	A23. Alyssa slides up to the cashier's desk as does 
	Holden, who offers a puzzled shrug.  Alyssa offers the 
	'just wait' finger.  The CASHIER turns to her.

					ALYSSA
			Are you an authorized deal-maker in 
			this establishment?  Do you have the 
			power to negotiate.

					CASHIER
			You wanna haggle over the price of 
			your French Dip?

					ALYSSA
			I want to haggle over the price of 
			fine art.

					CASHIER
			What do you mean?

					ALYSSA
				(pointing OC)
			There.  By the kitchen.  That 
			painting.

					CASHIER
			What about it?

					ALYSSA
			The price tag says seventy five.

					CASHIER
			So!

					HOLDEN
				(to Alyssa)
			Tell me you're kidding!

					ALYSSA
			I'll give you fifty.

					CASHIER
				(to OC)
			Manuel!  Bring, me the Dyksiezski off 
			the wall.
				(to Alyssa)
			All my years in the diner business, 
			I've waited for this day - the day 
			when someone wanted to buy one of the 
			pictures.

					ALYSSA
				(holds out hand)
			Alyssa Jones.  Pleased to meet you.

					CASHIER
			You say you want to haggle, but you 
			don't know rule one about haggling, 
			which you just broke: you never give 
			your name.  The name is power, and to 
			give the opponent that piece of you is 
			to give away victory.

					ALYSSA
			I'm only trying to conduct a 
			transaction.  We're not opponents.

					CASHIER
				(accepting painting from 
				BUSBOY)
			Oh, but we are - if you think I'm 
			letting this beautiful piece go for 
			fifty.

					ALYSSA
			Ah-ha!
				(to Holden)
			Now we're haggling.



24.    INT CAR - NIGHT									24.

	It's drizzling outside.  Holden drives.  Alyssa hugs her 
	painting and pushes her bare feet against the windshield, 
	making footprints.

					HOLDEN
			I've always wondered what kind of 
			people buy those things.  I can't 
			believe you talked him down to twenty 
			five!

					ALYSSA
			It was looking shakey when he told me 
			the artist was a blind cripple with a 
			hump-back, but I held my ground.  
			There's no room for sympathy in the 
			buyer's market.

					HOLDEN
			Where are you going to hang it?

					ALYSSA
			I'm not.  You are.

					HOLDEN
			You want me to hang it for you?  You 
			better hope it doesn't get out to the 
			girl-nation that you needed a man to 
			help you hang a picture.

					ALYSSA
			You're going to hang it in your house.  
			I bought it for you.

					HOLDEN
				(laughs)
			Yeah, right.

					ALYSSA
				(looks at him)
			I'm serious.

	Holden stares at her.

					HOLDEN
			Why?

					ALYSSA
			Because it's captured the moment.  
			It'll be a constant reminder - not 
			just of tonight, but of our 
			introduction, the building of our 
			friendship, everything.  Make no 
			mistake about it my Friend - it's a 
			gift to you, from me, so you'll always 
			remember us.

	Holden stares ahead.  Then he swerves the wheel to the 
	right.



	EXT ROADSIDE - NIGHT

	The car pulls to the side of the road.  The rain is a bit 
	heavier now.



	INT CAR - NIGHT

	Holden throws the car into park

					ALYSSA
			Why are we stopping?

					HOLDEN
			Because I can't take it.

					ALYSSA
			Can't take what?

					HOLDEN
			I love you.

					ALYSSA
				(beat)
			You love me.

					HOLDEN
			I love you.  And not in a friendly 
			way, although I think we're great 
			friends.  And not in a misplaced 
			affection, puppy-dog way, although I'm 
			sure that's what you'll call it.  And 
			it's not because you're unattainable.  
			I love you.  Very simple, very truly.  
			You're the epitome of every attribute 
			and quality I've ever looked for in 
			another person.  I know you think of 
			me as just a friend and crossing that 
			line is the furthest thing from an 
			option you'd ever consider.  But I 
			can't do this any longer.  I can't 
			stand next to you without wanting to 
			hold you.  I can't look into your eyes 
			without feeling that longing you only 
			read about in trashy romance novels.  
			I can't talk to you without wanting to 
			express my love for everything you 
			are.  I know this will probably queer 
			our friendship - no pun intended - but 
			I had to say it, because I've never 
			felt this before, and I like who I am 
			because of it.  And if bringing it to 
			light means we can't hang out anymore, 
			then that hurts me.  But I couldn't 
			allow another 	day to go by without 
			getting it out there, regardless of 
			the outcome, which by the look on your 
			face is to be the inevitable shoot-
			down.  And I'll accept that But I know 
			some part of you is hesitating for a 
			moment, and if there is a moment of 
			hesitation, that means you feel 
			something too.  All I ask is that you 
			not suppress that - at least for ten 
			minutes - and try to dwell in it 
			before you dismiss it.  
			There isn't another soul on this 
			fucking planet who's ever made me the 
			person I am when I'm with you, and I 
			would risk this friendship for the 
			chance to take it to the next plateau.  
			Because it's there between you and me.  
			You can't deny that.  And even if we 
			never speak again after tonight, 
			please know that I'm forever changed 
			because of you and what you've meant 
			to me, which - while I do appreciate 
			it - I'd never need a painting of 
			birds bought at a diner to remind me 
			of.

	Holden stares at Alyssa.  She stares back.  Then she gets 
	out of the car.

					HOLDEN
			Was it something I said?



	EXT ROADSIDE - NIGHT

	Holden gets out of the car.  It's raining pretty hard 
	now.  Alyssa's hitching up the road.  Holden reaches her.

					HOLDEN
			What are you doing?

					ALYSSA
			Get back in the car and get out of 
			here.

					HOLDEN
			You're going to hitch to New York?

					ALYSSA
			Y'ep.

					HOLDEN
			Aren't you at least going to comment?

					ALYSSA
			Here's my comment fuck you.

					HOLDEN
			Why?

					ALYSSA
			That was so unfair.  You know how 
			unfair that was.

					HOLDEN
			It's unfair that I'm in love with you?

					ALYSSA
			No, it's unfortunate that you're in 
			love with me.  It's  unfair that you 
			felt the fucking need to unburden your 
			soul about it.  Do you remember for a 
			fucking second who I am?

					HOLDEN
			So?  People change.

					ALYSSA
			Oh, it's that simple?  You fall in 
			love with me and want a romantic 
			relationship, nothing changes for you 
			with the exception of feeling hunky-
			dorey all the time.  But what about-
			me?  It's not that simple, is it?  I 
			can't just get into a relationship 
			with you without throwing my whole 
			fucking world into upheaval!

					HOLDEN
			But that's every relationship!  
			There's always going to be a period of 
			adjustment.

					ALYSSA
			Period of adjustment?!?
				(hitting him)
			THERE'S NO 'PERIOD OF ADJUSTMENT' 
			HOLDEN!  I'M FUCKING GAY!  THAT'S WHO 
			I AM!  AND YOU ASSUME I CAN TURN THAT 
			AROUND JUST BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A 
			CRUSH?!?

					HOLDEN
			If this is a crush... then I don't 
			know if I could take the real thing if 
			it ever happens.

	She looks at him, rain drenching the pair.  She shakes 
	her head ruefully.

					ALYSSA
			Go home, Holden.

	She walks away.  Holden stands there, at a loss.  Then he 
	turns and heads back to his car.  
	As he reaches the door and turns to look back at her, 
	Alyssa pounces on him, grabs his face and locks lips with 
	him, big time.  He drops his keys and embraces her.

	And there they stand, by the side of the road, drenched 
	kissing.



	EXT STUDIO - DAY

	Banky carries a bag in one arm and pulls out his keys 
	with the other.  He jams them into the lock, opening the 
	door.  He picks up the mail on the floor.



	INT STUDIO - DAY

	He closes the door behind him and shuffles to the 
	kitchenette, passing by the blanket-covered, slumbering 
	forms of Holden and Alyssa, who are out cold in each 
	other's arms.  The place looks a mess - Like a couple of 
	people were engaged in some tremendous fucking.  Banky is 
	oblivious.  He sets the bag down on the counter and pulls 
	out a chocolate milk.  He opens it, sticks a straw into 
	the top, and begins sipping and sifting through the mail.  
	He comes to mail that's Holden's and tosses it onto the 
	couch, near Holden's head.  He looks down at the sleeping 
	couple, then back at the mail for a couple of beats.  
	Then he freezes.  He looks down again, and drops his jaw 
	and his carton of choco.  It hits the floor with a pop.  
	Holden and Alyssa shoot straight up, eyes struggling to 
	focus.  They look at one another, then at the 
	flabbergasted Banky.  Banky blinks.  Then he shuffles 
	toward the door again and lets himself out.

					ALYSSA
				(off Holden's reaction)
			I take it that's not good.

					HOLDEN
				(getting up)
			Stay here.
				(he kisses her and exits)



	EXT STREET - DAY

	Banky sits on a curb, staring into the distance, Holden 
	saunters up and sits beside him.  He follows Banky's 
	gaze.

					BANKY
			Catholic school girls.

	Across the street, the Catholic High School is letting 
	out.  Teenage girls clad in uniforms and tight sweaters 
	smoke, frolic, wait for their bus.

					BANKY
			The uniform is what does it for me.  I 
			wish I'd have went with more Catholic 
			school girls when I was a kid.  As it 
			stands.  I have no "...and then she 
			unzipped her jumper..." stories.

					HOLDEN
			You looked weirded out back there.

					BANKY
			That's my couch you were fucking on.

					HOLDEN
			Sorry.

					BANKY
			I wanted to watch some TV.  Hard to do 
			when your best friend's wrapped around 
			a naked rug-muncher on your couch.

					HOLDEN
			She had boxers on.

	Banky shoots him a glare.  He goes back to staring at the 
	OC girls.

					BANKY
			This is all going to end badly.

					HOLDEN
			You don't know that.

					BANKY
			I know you.  You're way too 
			conservative for that girl.  She's 
			been around and seen things we've only 
			read about in books.

					HOLDEN
			But we have read about them.  So we're 
			prepared.

					BANKY
			There's no 'we' here.  You're going to 
			have to go through this alone.  And 
			it's one thing to read about shit, and 
			something different when you're forced 
			to deal with it on a regular basis.  
			When you guys are walking in the mall 
			and both your heads turn at a really 
			nice looking chick, it's going to eat 
			you up inside.  You'll spend most of 
			your time wondering when the other 
			shoe's going to drop.  Because for 
			you, this isn't about cool weird sex 
			stuff, it's about love.

					HOLDEN
			Maybe it is for her as well.

					BANKY
			Somehow I doubt it.

					HOLDEN
			Everyone's not out to get someone in 
			life.  Bank.

					BANKY
			Everybody has an agenda.  Everyone.

					HOLDEN
			Yourself?

					BANKY
			My agenda is to watch your back.

					HOLDEN
			To what end?

					BANKY
			To insure that all this time we've 
			spent together, building something, 
			wasn't wasted.

					HOLDEN
			She's not going to ruin the comic.

					BANKY
			I wasn't talking about the comic.
				(gets up)
			I'm going to gel a bagel.  Clean off 
			my fucking couch so I can watch TV.

	Banky walks away.  Holden shakes his head.



	INT ALYSSA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	An all-girl gathering. TORY. NICA, DALIA and JANE help 
	Alyssa finish an issue of 'Idiosyncratic Routine'.  Tory 
	letters a page.  Nica and Dalia lay-out the artwork.  
	Dalia drinks wine.  Alyssa paints the cover.

					DALIA
			From what I understand, when you sign 
			with a publisher, someone else does 
			all this work for you, and you just 
			sit back and collect.

					ALYSSA
			And miss these last minute cram 
			sessions with my nearest and dearest?  
			Never.

					TORY
			I don't know what she's bitching 
			about.  All she's done since we got 
			here is pound Merlot.

					DALIA
			I'm sorry weren't you the one who 
			misspelled 'receipt' on page eighteen?  
			Yeah, you're a real help.

					NICA
			What I'd like to know is why we're 
			here at all when we haven't seen 
			Princess funny-Book in a month.

					JANE
			Yeah Alyssa - who've you been shacking 
			up with?

					ALYSSA
			'Shacking up!' Please.
				(stops painting; smiles wide)
			I'm so in love!

	Everyone aww's.  Alyssa buries her face, giggling.

					ALYSSA
			I know.  I know -I feel like such a 
			goon.  But I can't help it - we have 
			such a great time together.

					DALIA
			Who is it?  Don't even tell me it's 
			Ms. Thing from the C.D. place.  I'll 
			kill you.

					ALYSSA
			It's not her.  It's someone you guys 
			don't know.

					NICA
			That chick you left the restaurant 
			with that night?

					ALYSSA
			They're not.  From around here.

					TORY
			Don't even tell me you met her down 
			the shore!

					JANE
			Eww!  Not a bridge-and-tunnel Jersey 
			dyke!

					TORY
			With huge hair and acid-washed jeans!

	They all cackle.  Alyssa tries to laugh with them.

					DALIA
			Come on, Alyss - Hoboken Hussy or 
			what?

					ALYSSA
			For your information, they don't have 
			big hair or wear acid wash.
				(goes back to painting)
			They're from my home town.

	Dalia stares at Alyssa, suspiciously.

					DALIA
			Why are you playing the pronoun game?

					ALYSSA
			What?  What are you talking about?  
			I'm not even.

					DALIA
			You are. "I met someone."  "We have a 
			great time.  "They're from my home 
			town."  Doesn't this tube of
			wonderful have a name!

					ALYSSA
				(beat)
			Holden.

	All four Girls stare at Alyssa, a bit horrified.  She 
	stops painting.

					JANE
			Oh, Alyssa - no.  Not you.

					TORY
			You're dating a guy?

					ALYSSA
			He's not like a typical man.  He's 
			really sweet to me, and we relate so 
			well.  You guys'd love him, really.

	They stare at Alyssa.  Then Dalia gets up.

					DALIA
			I've gotta go to the store.

					JANE
			I'll go with.

	They exit.  Alyssa looks to Tory and Nica.

					TORY
				(pouring wine)
			Whelp - here's to both of you.
				(moves the glass to her lips)
			Another one bites the dust.



	INT HOLDEN'S BEDROOM -NIGHT

	Holden and Alyssa lie in each other's arms, moonlight 
	bathing them.  She smokes.

					HOLDEN
			Can I ask you something?

					ALYSSA
			Don't even tell me you want to do it 
			again.

					HOLDEN
			Why me - you know?  Why now?

					ALYSSA
			Because you were giving me that look, 
			and I got wet...

					HOLDEN
			You know what I'm talking about.

					ALYSSA
			Why not You?

					HOLDEN
			I'm a guy.  You're attracted to girls.

					ALYSSA
			I see you've been taking notes. 
			Historically, yes  that's true.

					HOLDEN
			Then why this?

					ALYSSA
			I've given that a lot of thought, you 
			know?  I mean, now that I'm being 
			ostracized by my friends, I've had a 
			lot of time to think about all of 
			this.  And what I've come up with is 
			really simple: I came to this on my 
			terms.  I didn't just heed what I was 
			taught, you  know?  Men and women 
			should be together, it's the natural 
			way - that kind of thing.  I'm not 
			with you because of what family, 
			society, life tried to instill in me 
			from day one.  The way the world is - 
			how seldom you meet that one person 
			who gets you... it's so rare.   My 
			parents didn't really have it.  There 
			was no example set for me in the world 
			of male/female relation ships.  And to 
			cut oneself off from finding that 
			person - to immediately half your 
			options by eliminating the possibility 
			of finding that one person within your 
			own gender... that just seemed stupid.  
			So I didn't.  And by leaving my 
			options open, I was branded 'gay', 
			which to me was no big deal - labels 
			are labels, you know?  They define 
			what you do, not who you are, I guess. 
			But 		then you come along.  You - 
			the one least likely; I mean, you were 
			a guy.

					HOLDEN
			Still am.

					ALYSSA
			And while I was falling for you, I put 
			a ceiling on that, because you were a 
			guy.  
			Until I remembered why I opened the 
			door to women in the first place - to 
			not limit the likelihood of finding 
			that one person who'd compliment me so 
			completely.  And so here we are, I was 
			thorough when I looked for you, and I 
			feel justified lying in your arms - 
			because I got here on my terms, and 
			have no question that there was 
			someplace I didn't look.  And that 
			makes all the difference.

					HOLDEN
				(beat)
			Shit.

					ALYSSA
			What?

					HOLDEN
			Well, you took the luster our of it.

					ALYSSA
			What luster?

					HOLDEN
				(joking - in case you didn't 
				get it)
			Of how I brought you back from the 
			other side.  How all you needed was 
			the right man to turn you around.

					ALYSSA
			You're not the right man.
				(kisses him)
			You're just the one.

	She snuggles into him and closes her eyes.  Holden stares 
	at the ceiling.

					HOLDEN
			Can I at least cell people that all 
			you needed was some serious deep-
			dicking?

	She hits him with her pillow.



	THE BIG OL' FALLING-IN-LOVE MONTAGE BEGINS

	1) In Holden's Apartment - Alyssa waves in various 
	directions, shaking her head accordingly.  Then she puts 
	up her hands to stop.  Cut to Holden, hanging the 
	picture.  Alyssa gave him.  
	It hangs at a severely crooked angle.  He looks back to 
	her and shakes his head 'no'.

	2) Holden and Alyssa try to play a video game.  Banky 
	plays as well.  Holden instructs her in the ways of NHL 
	'96 (turning her paddle right-side-up, pointing at things 
	on the screen).  She presses the reset button, over and 
	over.  Banky gives Holden a 'What the fuck?' look.  
	Alyssa sticks her tongue at him.

	3) At the Video Store - Holden picks up a Disney cartoon 
	off the shelf.  He goes to show if to Alyssa, who's 
	reading the back of 'Anything But Dick', an allchick 
	porno.  An old WOMAN stares at her.  Holden nods to the 
	old Woman and takes the tape out of Alyssa's hands, 
	putting it back on the shelf.  He ushers her away.  The 
	old Woman waits until they're gone and then picks up the 
	tape herself,

	4) Holden carries Alyssa on his shoulders through the 
	park, her crotch against the back of his neck.  He's 
	talking. She taps him and he stops and looks up.  She 
	begins to maneuver around so her crotch is in his face.  
	He pulls her off and put her down.  She's laughing.  He's 
	flushed with embarrassment.  The same Old Woman from the 
	Video store passes by with her husband.  Holden shrugs.

	5) In Holden's Apartment again - Alyssa again with the 
	waving, then putting up her hands to stop.  Cut to Holden 
	again, this time with the painting hung completely upside 
	down.  He looks at it, then offers her a bewildered gaze.

	6) In the Office Banky comes to his drawing table.  There 
	are penciled pages on it with a note that says "Hanging 
	out with Alyssa today.  Holden".  Banky crumples it up 
	and throws it across the room.

	7) In Holden's Apartment - Alyssa waves this way, then 
	that way, then puts up her hands frantically to stop.  
	She settles back against the wall, a satisfied smile 
	crawling across her face, and closes her eyes.  We pull 
	back to reveal Holden on his knees in front of her, 
	eating her out (no, we don't see anything!).



	INT OFFICE - DAY

	Holden draws.  A book is thrown in front of him.  He 
	looks up.  Banky stands there.

					BANKY
			Check out page forty eight.

	Holden looks down at that book.  It's the Nineteen Eighty 
	Eight yearbook from Middletown North.  He shakes his head 
	at Banky and flips it open.

	On the page is Alyssa's Senior year photo.  Under her 
	name is another name in quotes that says 'Finger Cuffs'.

					HOLDEN
				(looking up)
			So?

					BANKY
			Did you see the nickname?

					HOLDEN
			'Finger Cuffs'.

					BANKY
			And...?

					HOLDEN
			And... she had a weird nick-name.  
			What's your point?

					BANKY
			Do you know why it's 'Finger Cuffs'?

					HOLDEN
			I suppose you do.

					BANKY
			I do.
				(takes a seat)
			You remember Cohee Lundin?  Left 
			Hudson and went to North our senior 
			year?

					HOLDEN
			Yeah.

					BANKY
			Well, I ran into him at Food City the 
			other day, and we got to talking, and 
			I mentioned that you were dating 
			Alyssa, and he said..

	CUT TO COHEE LUNDON.  In the PARKING LOT of FOOD CITY, 
	addressing the camera.

					COHEE
			Alyssa Jones?  Shit.  I know Alyssa 
			Jones.  I mean, I know Alyssa Jones, 
			you know what I'm saying?  
			Me and Rick Derris used to hang our 
			with her for awhile, right?  Just 
			hanging around her house after school,  
			'cuz her parents were like never home, 
			and shit.  And one day, Rick just 
			whips it out, and starts rubbing it on 
			her leg and shit; chasing her around 
			the living room - I was dying.  But 
			you know what the crazy bitch did?  
			She fucking drops to her knees, and 
			just starts sucking him off right in 
			front of me!  Like I wasn't even there 
			man!  I almost died!  But that's not 
			the fucked up part - the fucked up 
			part was Rick, man - right in the 
			middle of it, he turns to me and he's 
			pointing at her and he says "Cohee."  
			Just like that - "Cohee."  So I'm like 
			I'll give it a shot.  And I start 
			pulling her pants down all slow, 'cuz 
			I figure any second she's gonna turn 
			around and belt me in the mouth, 
			right?  But yo, check this shit out - 
			she's all into it man!  She don't try 
			to stop me or nothing!  She's 		
			all wet and shit, and I just went to 
			work, know what I'm saying?  Me and 
			Rick are going to town on this crazy 
			bitch, and she's just loving it, all 
			moaning and shit!  It was fucked up!  
			So Rick's the one that came up with 
			the nickname - 'cuz that day, she had 
			us locked in tight from both sides - 
			like a pair of goddamn Chinese finger 
			cuffs!

	BACK IN THE OFFICE - Holden stares at Banky.

					HOLDEN
			He's full of shit.

					BANKY
			Cohee's a lot of things, but an 
			exxagerator he's not.  The dude's 
			Catholic.

					HOLDEN
			She's never even been with a guy.

					BANKY
			That's what she says.  But I say her 
			on her hands and knees getting filled 
			out like an application constitutes 
			'being with a guy'.

					HOLDEN
			He's pulling your chain.  And the fact 
			that you even bought it for a second 
			makes you look like an idiot.

					BANKY
			I'm getting your back, asshole!  
			People don't forget shit like 'Finger 
			Cuffs'.  And if it got out that she's 
			queer as well, how do you think it's 
			going to make you look?

					HOLDEN
			I give a shit what people think.

					BANKY
			Alright, forget about that; what if 
			she's carrying a disease?  That was 
			just one story - what if there's more?

					HOLDEN
				(grabs his coat)
			You're such a fucking asshole.

					BANKY
			What?  Oh, it's not possible that 
			she's all crudded up?  Cohee I can 
			vouch for as clean - the dude never 
			got laid in high school.  But Derris 
			is an arch fucking bush-man!  Name me 
			one chick in our senior class that 
			Rick Derris didn't nail, for Christ's 
			sake!

					HOLDEN
			Would you let this go?  I'm telling 
			you - she's never even been with a 
			guy, let alone those two zeroes.

					BANKY
			And I'm telling you, the bitch could 
			be a bigger fucking germ farm than 
			that monkey in 'Outbreak'!

	Holden grabs Banky and pins him against the wall.

					HOLDEN
			Give it a rest!  Do you hear me?!  I'm 
			tired of this shit!  She's my goddamn 
			girlfriend, do you understand?!  Show 
			her a little fucking respect!  
			And if you ever even so much as 
			mention that Alyssa looks a little 
			peaked from now on, I'll put your 
			fucking teeth down your throat!

	He releases Banky.  Banky brushes himself off.

					BANKY
			Maybe I'll put your fucking teeth down 
			your throat.

					HOLDEN
				(walking out)
			Not bloody Likely.

	Banky runs to the open door.

					BANKY
				(calling after him)
			I've been working out you know!
				(no response)
			You better be ready to make that M-TV 
			deal!

	The downstairs door slams.  Banky makes a muscle, then 
	feels it.



	INT TOWER RECORDS - DAY

	Holden and Hooper peruse laser discs.

					HOOPER
			Where's that bitch partner of your's 
			been?

					HOLDEN
			Sulking.  He's having a real problem 
			with this Alyssa thing.

					HOOPER
			I think it's more like Banky's having 
			a problem with all things not hetero 
			right about now.  And I'm just another 
			paradigm of said aberration.

					HOLDEN
			Banky does not hate gays, you know 
			that.

					HOOPER
			But I do think he is a bit homophobic.  
			And this latest episode between you 
			and Ms. Thing has tapped into that.  
			In his warped perception, he lost you 
			to the dark side - which is she.

					HOLDEN
			You make it sound like me and him were 
			dating.

					HOOPER
			Don't kid yourself - that boy loves 
			you in a way that he's not ready to 
			deal with.

					HOLDEN
				(beat)
			He's been digging up dirt on Alyssa.

					HOOPER
			And just what has Mister Angela 
			Lansbury uncovered about your lady 
			fair?

					HOLDEN
			He heard some bullshit story that she 
			took on two guys.

					HOOPER
			Really?  Well then he's barking up the 
			wrong we if he wants to split you up, 
			isn't he?  He's not going to make you 
			see the error of your ways by pointing 
			out how truly gay she's not
				(holds up a disc)
			This one?

					HOLDEN
			Have it.
				(beat)
			Actually, it's kind of gotten to me.

					HOOPER
			How so?

					HOLDEN
			Banky's not known for believing 
			misinformation.  He's got a pretty 
			good bullshit detector.

					HOOPER
			So, what if it is true?  Would that 
			bother you?

					HOLDEN
			Sex with multiple partners?

	Hooper lets our a faux-shock shriek.

					HOLDEN
			At the same time.

	Again, even louder, hands slapped against his cheeks.

					HOLDEN
			Thanks for being so comforting.

					HOOPER
			So what do you care?

					HOLDEN
			Well that's the thing, isn't it?  I 
			shouldn't.. but it gets to me.

					HOOPER
			Kind of gal Alyssa is, you don't think 
			she's been in the middle of an all -
			girl group-grope?

					HOLDEN
			You see - that doesn't bother me.  But 
			the thought of her and guys... Uh!

					HOOPER
			Oh Holden, I beg you - please don't 
			drop fifty stories in my opinion of 
			you by falling prey to that latest of 
			trendy beasts.

					HOLDEN
			Which is?

					HOOPER
			Lesbian chic.  It's oh-so acceptable 
			to be a gay girl nowadays.  People 
			think it's cute, because they've got 
			this fool picture in their heads about 
			lipstick lesbians - like they all 
			resemble Alyssa - while most of them 
			look more like you.

					HOLDEN
			Do I detect a little inter-subculture 
			cattiness?

					HOOPER
			Gay or straight - ugly's still ugly.  
			And most of those boys are scary.

					HOLDEN
			I thought fags were all supposed to be 
			super-supportive of one another.

					HOOPER
			Screw that 'all for one' shit.  I 
			gotta deal with being the minority in 
			the minority of the minority, and 
			nobody's supporting my ass?  While the 
			whole of society is fawning over girls-
			on-girls, here I sit - a reviled gay 
			man, and to top that off,  I'm a gay 
			black man - notoriously the most 
			swishy of the bunch.

					HOLDEN
			Three strikes.

					HOOPER
			Hey, hey!  There's a line.

	A young BLACK KID approaches Hooper, holding a comic 
	book.

					KID
			Are you Hooper X?

					HOOPER
				(in militant mode)
			A-salaam Alaikum, little brother.

					KID
			Could you sign my comic?

					HOOPER
				(signing comic; nods to 
				Holden)
			See that guy there?  He's the devil, 
			you understand?  Never take your eye 
			off the Man.  Our people took their 
			eyes off him one time, and he had us 
			in chains in two shakes of his snake's 
			tail.

	The Kid offers Holden an angry look.  Hooper gives him 
	back his comic.

					HOOPER
			Fight the power, little 'G'.

					KID
			Word is bond

	The Kid leaves, Hooper slips back into his real voice.

					HOOPER
			Look at what I have to resort to for 
			professional respect.  What is it 
			about gay men that terrifies the rest 
			of the world.
				(shakes his head)
			As for this hang-up with Alyssa's 
			past, maybe what's really bothering 
			you is that your fragile fantasy might 
			not be true.

					HOLDEN
			What do you mean?

					HOOPER
			Holden - don't even try to come off 
			like you don't know what I'm saying.  
			Men need to believe that they're Marco 
			fucking Polo when it comes to sex - 
			like they're the only ones who've ever 
			explored new territory.  And it's hard 
			not to let them believe it.  I let my 
			boys run with it for awhile - feed 
			them some of that "I've never done 
			this before..." bullshit, and let 'em 
			labor under the delusion that they 
			rockin' my world, until I can't stand 
			them anymore.  Then I hit 'em with the 
			truth.  It's a sick game.  The world 
			would be a better place if people 
			would just accept that there's nothing 
			new under the sun, and everything you 
			can do with a person has probably been 
			done long before you got there.

					HOLDEN
			I can accept that.

					HOOPER
			Honey, that almost sounded convincing.  
			Do yourself a favor - just ask her 
			about her past, point blank.  Get it 
			out of the way, before it gets too big 
			for both ya'll to move.
				(spotting something OC)
			Oooh!  'Myra Breckinridge'!

	Hooper trots off, Holden glances at the disc in his 
	hands.  Pictured on it are two gorgeous chicks, barely 
	clad, making out.  The title is 'Men Suck.. and so do 
	Girls - All XXX Action.'



	INT HOCKEY RINK - NIGHT

	On the ice, two teams clash, chasing the puck up and 
	back, checking galore.

	In the bleachers, amidst a slew of fans, Alyssa watches 
	the game with a large degree of enjoyment.  Sitting 
	beside her, Holden doesn't seem to share her enthusiasm.

					ALYSSA
			Since most of these people are rooting 
			for the home team, I'm going to cheer 
			for the visitors.  I'm a big visitors 
			fan - especially the kind that make 
			coffee for you in the morning before 
			they go.
				(smiles at Holden; no 
				response)
			That was a joke.  A little wacky 
			wordplay?

					HOLDEN
			What do you mean, 'visitors'?

					ALYSSA
			Was I being too obscure?  The kind 
			that - until recently - had no dicks 
			and would spend the night.

					HOLDEN
			So that was until recently!

					ALYSSA
			Oh, yeah.
				(shouting; to ice)
			Hey - foul!  Foul!  He was traveling 
			or something!

					HOLDEN
			So nobody bur me has stayed the night 
			at your place since we got together?

					ALYSSA
				(beat)
			Something on your mind, Holden?

					HOLDEN
			No, I was just wondering,

					ALYSSA
			If I've been 'faithful' or something?

					HOLDEN
			Look, I was just asking.

					ALYSSA
				(toucher his face)
			Oh, sweetie.  I only have eyes for 
			you.
				(to ice)
			CALL THAT FUCKING SHIT, REF!!  THE GUY 
			ON THE SKATES TOTALLY SHOVED ONE OF MY 
			GUYS!!
				(to Holden)
			I told you I was great at sporting 
			events.  Imagine what a bitch I could 
			be if I knew what was going on?

	ON THE ICE - Things heat up between two opposing PLAYERS.  
	One snatches the puck away from the other and skates off.  
	The other Player gives chase.

	Alyssa's very into the game.  Holden shakes his head

					HOLDEN
			That'd make Banky half right.

					ALYSSA
			About what?

					HOLDEN
			He said all the girls from North were 
			bitches and sluts.

					ALYSSA
			Really.  I'm sorry - you two left high 
			school behind how many years ago?
				(grabs his face and kisses 
				his cheek)
			Can I put some of my books in your 
			locker?
				(goes back to watching game)

					HOLDEN
				(under his breath)
			How about your yearbook.

	ON THE ICE - The Player giving chase slashes the Player 
	with the puck.

	Alyssa jumps to her feet.

					ALYSSA
				(to ice)
			IF YOU DON'T START USING THAT WHISTLE 
			I'M GONNA JAM IT STRAIGHT UP YOUR 
			ASS!!
				(to guy next to her)
			Right?

					HOLDEN
			What's with 'Finger Cuffs'?

					ALYSSA
				(sitting back down)
			'Finger Cuffs'?

					HOLDEN
			Yeah.  In your senior yearbook your 
			nickname was 'Finger Cuffs'.  What is 
			that?

					ALYSSA
			It was?  Shit, damned if I can 
			remember.  I'd look it up, but I threw 
			all that shit our years ago?
				(beat)
			Where'd you see a North yearbook?

					HOLDEN
			Do you know Rick Derris?

	ON THE ICE - The Players skid into the corner where 
	Player One checks Player Two into the boards, hard.  
	Player Two scrambles to his feet and throws down his 
	gloves.

	The crowd around Alyssa and Holden go wild.

					ALYSSA
			Rick?  Sure.  We used to hang out in 
			high school.
				(to ice)
			PUNCH HIM IN THE FUCKING NECK, NUMBER 
			TWELVE!!

					HOLDEN
			Did you go out with him or something?

					ALYSSA
				(eyes on the ice)
			Date Rick Derris?  No.  We just hung 
			out a lot.

					HOLDEN
			Just... you and him?

					ALYSSA
			No.  Me, Rick, and... um... what was 
			that guy's name...?

					HOLDEN
			Cohee?

					ALYSSA
			Yeah!  Cohee Lundin.  God, I haven't 
			thought about that name in years.

	ON THE ICE - The Players square off.  Player Two pulls 
	Player One's helmet off and punches him in the face.

	Holden looks as if he'd Like to do the same to his 
	companion.  Alyssa's into the game.

					ALYSSA
			I remember those guys'd come over 
			almost everyday after school.  They'd 
			bug my sisters, look for porno tapes 
			in my dad's closet, raid our fridge.  
			They really took advantage of my 
			parents never being home.

	ON THE ICE - Player Two yanks at Player One's jersey and 
	gut punches him.  Alyssa seems oblivious to Holden's 
	anger, so enthralled with the action is she.

					ALYSSA
				(starts laughing)
			This one day... Rick pulled out his 
			dick and chased me around the house 
			with it!  Right in front of Cohee!  I 
			couldn't believe it!  Guys are weird - 
			I thought the whole size hang-up made 
			you all terrified to show your dicks 
			to each other?

	ON THE ICE - Player One staggers a bit, then quickly 
	rights his jersey and lunges at Player Two, landing a 
	barrage of his own punches.  Blood sprays across the ice.

	Holden's face is reeeeeaaaally sour looking.  Alyssa's 
	still in the game.

					HOLDEN
			Rick pulled his dick out?  Really?  
			What'd you do?

					ALYSSA
				(looks him dead in the eye)
			I blew him while Cohee fucked me.

	ON THE ICE - Player One delivers the kill shot, slamming 
	his fist into Player Two's nose.  The blood shoots out 
	like a geyser, and Two goes down hard.

	Holden stares at Alyssa, flabbergasted.  The crowd around 
	them stares not at the fight on the ice, but the fight in 
	their midst, shocked.  Alyssa fumes.

					HOLDEN
			Excuse me!?!

					ALYSSA
			That's what you wanted to hear, isn't 
			it?  Isn't that what this little cross-
			examination of your's is about?  Well 
			try not to be so obvious about it next 
			time, there are subtler ways of 
			badgering a witness.
				(to Bystander)
			Am I right?

					BYSTANDER
				(to Holden)
			Jeez, even I knew what you were 
			getting at.

					ALYSSA
				(gathering her stuff)
			If you wanted some background 
			information on me, all you had to do 
			was ask - I'd have gladly volunteered 
			it.  You didn't have to play Hercules 
			fucking Poirot!

	She storms away.  Holden chases after her.  The Bystander 
	watches them go.

					BYSTANDER
				(to companion)
			I told you these were good seats.



	INT RINK LOBBY / EXT PARKING LOT - NIGHT

	Alyssa marches quickly, pulling on her coat.  Holden 
	catches up to her.  We track with them our into the 
	parking lot.

					HOLDEN
			So it's true?!

					ALYSSA
			Yes Holden!  In fact, everything you 
			heard or dug up on me was probably 
			true!  Yeah, I took on two guys at 
			once!  You want to hear some gems you 
			might not have unearthed - I took a 
			twenty six year old guy to my senior 
			prom, and then left halfway through to  
			have sex with him and Gwen Turner in 
			the back of a limo!  And the girl who 
			got caught in the shower with Miss 
			Moffit, the gym teacher?  That was me!  
			Or how about in college, when I let 
			Shannon Hamilton videotape us having 
			sex - only to find out the next day 
			that he broadcast it on the campus 
			cable station?!  They're all true - 
			those and so many more!  Didn't you 
			know?  I'm the queen of urban legend!

					HOLDEN
			How the hell could you do those 
			things?!

					ALYSSA
			Easily!  Some of it I did out of 
			stupidity, some of it I did out of 
			what I thought was love, but - good or 
			bad - they were my choices, and I'm 
			not making apologies for them now - 
			not to you or anyone!  And how dare 
			you try to lay a guilt trip on me 
			about it - in public, no less!  Who 
			the fuck do you think you are, you 
			judgemental prick?!

					HOLDEN
			How am I supposed to feel about all of 
			this?

					ALYSSA
			How are you supposed to feel about it?  
			Feel what ever the fuck you want about 
			it!  The only thing that really 
			matters is how you feel about me.

					HOLDEN
			I don't know how I feel about you now.

					ALYSSA
			Why?  Because I had some sex?

					HOLDEN
			Some sex?

					ALYSSA
			Yes, Holden - that's all it was: some 
			sex!  Most of it stupid high school 
			sex, for Christ's sake!  Like you 
			never had sex in high school!

					HOLDEN
			There's a world of fucking difference 
			between typical high school sex and 
			two guys at once!  They fucking used 
			you?

					ALYSSA
			I used them!  You don't think I 
			would've let it happen if I hadn't 
			wanted it to, do you?!  I was an 
			experimental girl, for Christ's sake! 
			Maybe you knew early on that your 
			track was from point 'a' to 'b' - but 
			unlike you I wasn't given a fucking 
			map at birth, so I tried it all!  That 
			is until we - that's you and I - got 
			together, and suddenly, I was sated.  
			Can't you take some fucking comfort in 
			that?  You turned out to be all I was 
			ever looking for - the missing piece 
			in the big fucking puzzle!
				(tries to calm down)
			Look I'm sorry I let you believe that 
			you were the only guy I'd ever been 
			with.  I should've been more honest.  
			But it seemed to make you feel special 
			in a way that me telling you over and 
			over again how incredible you are 
			would never get across.

	She touches his face.  He pulls back.  She stares at him, 
	hurt and pissed.

					ALYSSA
			Do you mean to tell me that - while 
			you have zero problem with me sleeping 
			with half the women in New York City - 
			you have some sort of half-assed, 
			mealy-mouthed objection to pubescent 
			antics, that took place almost ten 
			years ago?  What the fuck is your 
			problem?!?

	Holden's eyes are downcast.  Alyssa waits for a response.

					HOLDEN
			I want us to be something that we 
			can't.

					ALYSSA
			And what's that?

					HOLDEN
				(beat)
			A normal couple.

	Holden skulks off.  Alyssa stares after him, and then 
	starts kicking and punching a car beside her, finally 
	slumping to the ground.  She cries.



	INT STUDIO - DUSK

	Holden sits on the couch, alone in the dark.  The door 
	opens and Banky enters.  He stands there, sizing up 
	Holden's mood.

					BANKY
			The girl?

	Holden nods.  Banky nods back.  He stands there for a 
	beat.  Then he sits beside Holden.  He opens his arms.  
	Holden shifts into his friend's embrace and begins crying 
	on his shoulder.  Banky pats his back.  Pull back on a 
	man in pain and the comfort of a friend.



	INT DINER - NIGHT

	Holden sits alone at a booth.  He stirs his iced tea.

					OC VOICE
			Yo, look at this morose mother fucker 
			here..

	Holden looks up.  JAY and SILENT BOB stand above him.

					JAY
			Smells like somebody shit in his 
			cereal.

	Holden offers a half-smile.  The pair slide into the 
	booth.

					HOLDEN
			What took you so long?

					JAY
			We were at the mall.  You bring the 
			salad?

	Holden pulls an envelope out of his jacket and tosses it 
	to Jay.  Jay opens it and pulls out a thick wad of bills, 
	along with the latest issue of 'BLUNTMAN and CHRONIC.'

					JAY
			Man, this likeness rights shit is more 
			profitable than selling smoke.

					HOLDEN
			How'd a dirt merchant like you ever 
			learn about likeness rights?

					JAY
				(hands envelope to Silent 
				Bob)
			We deal to a lot of lawyers.  Speaking 
			of which...
				(pulls out a dime bag)
			Little signing bonus and shit!

					HOLDEN
			I'll pass.  Take a look at the issue.

	Silent Bob thumbs through the comic.  Jay looks over his 
	shoulder, as he begins rolling a joint.

					JAY
			Yeah.  When you gonna get some pussy 
			in that book, man!  Throw some super-
			villain in with big fucking tits that 
			shoot milk or something, and I just 
			drink her dry, bust some moves on 
			her...
				(demonstrates)
			...and then she has to fuck me.
				(Silent Bob hits him)
			Fuck us.

					HOLDEN
			I'll see what I can do.

	A WAITRESS joins them.

					WAITRESS
			What can I get you.

					HOLDEN
			Nothing, thanks.

					JAY
			Yo Flo - tell Mel to whip me up a 
			toasted bagel and cream cheese.
				(to Silent Bob)
			You want one too?
				(Silent Bob nods)
			Make that two.  And kiss my grits.  
			Noonch.
				(the Waitress leaves; to 
				Holden)
			D'jever watch 'Alice'?  That show's 
			good as hell.
				(continues rolling)
			So why the long face, Horse?  Banky on 
			the rag?

					HOLDEN
			When is he not?  No - I'm just having 
			some girl trouble.

					JAY
			Bitch pressing charges?  I get that a 
			lot.

					HOLDEN
			No.  I'm just at a point where I don't 
			know what to do.

					JAY
			Kick her to the curb.  Girls get to be 
			too much trouble, there's always the 
			'band of the hand'.

					HOLDEN
			Can't do it, g.  I'm in love.

					JAY
			Ah, there ain't no such thing.  You 
			gotta boil it all down to the 
			essentials.  It's like Cube says - 
			life ain't nothing but bitches and 
			money.

					HOLDEN
			Just what I needed - advice from the 
			'hood

					JAY
			Who is this girl?

					HOLDEN
			I don't think you know her.

					JAY
			Come on man - I'm people who know 
			people.

					HOLDEN
			You sound like Barbra Streisand.

					JAY
			That's 'cause I got this tubby bitch 
			playing her greatest hits tape in my 
			ear all the time.  You should see him: 
			she starts singing 'You Don't Bring Me 
			Flowers', this faggot starts crying 
			like a little girl with a skinned knee 
			and shit.  It's embarrassing.  I got 
			the only muscle in the world with a 
			weakness for ballads.
				(to Silent Bob)
			You big fucking softie.
				(to Holden)
			So what's this skirt's name!

					HOLDEN
			I'm telling you, you don't know her.

					JAY
			I ain't playing.  Tell me her name, 
			Mysterio.

					HOLDEN
			Alyssa Jones.

					JAY
			Finger Cuffs?

	Holden rubs his eyes.

					JAY
			You're dating Finger Cuffs?  Wait a 
			minute I thought she was all gay and 
			shit!

					HOLDEN
			She is.  Or was.  I don't know.

	The Waitress returns with the order.

					JAY
			And you go out with her?  Shit, man - 
			you're a lucky dog.  She bring other 
			chicks to bed with you, get a little 
			of that filet o' fish sammich going 
			on?

	The Waitress stares wide-eyed and offended at Jay.

					JAY
				(off the Waitress' look)
			Yeah - you know what I'm talking 
			about, baby.
				(Waitress  leaves;  to 
				Holden)
			So - four tits, or what?

					HOLDEN
			It's not like that.

					JAY
			Well what's it like then?

					HOLDEN
			Right now?
				(beat)
			I don't know.  I love her.  But she 
			has a past

					JAY
			I'll say.  Stuffin' two guys, eating 
			chicks out.  Yo - I heard one time, 
			she had this dog...

					HOLDEN
			Eat your fucking bagel already!

					JAY
				(to Silent Bob)
			Look at this touchy mother fucker 
			right here.
				(to Holden)
			So, if you're all in love with her, 
			what's the problem?

					HOLDEN
			The problem is shit like that.  It was 
			one thing when it was just girls - 
			that was weird enough.  But now you 
			throw guys into the mix - two guys at 
			once, no less.  All that 
			experience...What am I supposed to 
			think?

					JAY
			You think good; because now she'll be 
			all true blue and shit.  The girl's 
			tasted life, yo.  Now she's settlin' 
			for your boring, funny-book-makin' 
			ass.

					HOLDEN
			Settling.  That's comforting, Jay.  
			Thanks.

					JAY
			That's what I'm here for.

					HOLDEN
			I'm lust having a problem with all of 
			it I can't get it out of my head these 
			visuals of her doing all this shit.  
			And I don't know why I can't let it 
			go.  Because I'm crazy about her, you 
			know?  I look at this girl, I see the 
			future.  I see kids.  I see grand-
			kids.

					JAY
			You're scaring me.

					HOLDEN
			I'm scaring myself.  Because I think 
			so much of her,  and then I can't get 
			over shit like 'Finger Cuffs'.
				(shakes his head)
			I don't know what I'm doing.

	Holden looks out the window.  Jay continues to roll his 
	joint.  There's silence. Then...

					BOB
			You're chasing Amy.

	Holden's head snaps forward.  He stares, wide-eyed at 
	Silent Bob.

					HOLDEN
			What..what did you say?

					BOB
			You're chasing Amy.

	Holden stares, shocked.  He looks to Jay, who's still 
	rolling his joint.

					JAY
			What do you look so shocked for?  He 
			does this all the time.  Fat bastard 
			thinks just because he never says 
			anything, that it'll have some huge 
			impact when he does open his fucking 
			mouth.

					BOB
			Why don't you shut up?  Jesus!  Always 
			yap, yap, yapping all the time.  Give 
			me a fucking headache.
				(to Holden)
			I went through something like what 
			you're going through.  Years ago.  
			Same kind of thing with a girl named 
			Amy.

					JAY
			When?

					BOB
			A couple of years ago.

					JAY
			What'd she 'Live in Canada' or 
			something?  Why don't I remember this?

					BOB
			What you don't know about me I can 
			just about squeeze into the Grand 
			fucking Canyon.  Did you know I always 
			wanted to be a dancer in Vegas?

	Jay and Holden look at him.  Silent Bob busts a move with 
	his hands.

					BOB
			Hunhh?  Bet you didn't know that?

					JAY
			Just cell your fucking story so we can 
			get out of here and smoke this.

					BOB
				(to Holden)
			So there's me an Amy, and we're all 
			inseparable, right?  Just big time in 
			love.  And then about four months in, 
			I ask about the ex-boyfriend.  Dumb 
			move, I know, but you know how it is - 
			you don't really want to know, but you 
			just have to... stupid guy bullshit.  
			Anyway she starts telling me all about 
			him - how they dated for years, lived 
			together, her mother likes me better, 
			blah, blah, blah - and I'm okay.  But 
			then she tells me that a couple times, 
			he brought other people to bed with 
			them - menage a tois, I believe it's 
			called.  Now this just blows my mind.  
			I mean, I'm not used to that sort of 
			thing, right?  I was raised Catholic.

					JAY
			Saint Shithead.

	Silent Bob backhands him.  Jay raises his fist as if to 
	strike.

					BOB
			Do something.
				(to Holden)
			So I get weirded out, and just start 
			blasting her, right?  This is the only 
			way I can deal with it - by calling 
			her a slut, and telling her that she 
			was used - I mean, I'm out for blood I 
			want to hurt her - because I don't 
			know how to deal with what I'm 
			feeling.  And I'm like "What the fuck 
			is wrong with you?"  and she's telling 
			me that it was that time, in that 
			place, and she didn't do anything 
			wrong, so she's not gonna apologize.  
			So I tell her it's over, and I walk.

					JAY
			Fucking a.

					BOB
			No, idiot.  It was a mistake.  I 
			wasn't disgusted with her, I was 
			afraid.  At that moment, I felt small - 
			like I'd lacked experience, like I'd 
			never be on her level or never be 
			enough for her or something.  
			And what I didn't get was that she 
			didn't care.  She wasn't looking for 
			that guy anymore.  She was looking for 
			me.  But by the time I realized this, 
			it was too late, you know.  She'd 
			moved on, and all I had to show for it 
			was some foolish pride, which then 
			gave way to regret.  She was the girl, 
			I know that now.  But I pushed her 
			away...

	Everyone's silent Silent Bob lights a cigarette.

					BOB
			So I've spent every day since then 
			chasing Amy...
				(takes a drag from his smoke)
			So to speak.

	They sit there for a beat.  Jay pockets the rest of his 
	dime-bag.

					JAY
			Enough of this fucking melodrama.  My 
			advice - forget her, dude.  There's 
			one woman in the world.  One woman, 
			with many faces.
				(to Silent Bob)
			Get up, bitch
				(to Holden)
			We gotta book.  We're catching a bus 
			to Chi-town.

					HOLDEN
			What's there?

					JAY
			Business, yo.  How many more of those 
			phat envelopes do we got coming to us?

					HOLDEN
			I don't know.  I don't know if the 
			book's going to be around much longer.

					JAY
			Yeah?  Good.  I'll be glad as shit 
			when it's gone.

					HOLDEN
			Are you kidding me?  There's millions 
			of people out there that'd love to see 
			themselves in a comic book.

					JAY
			I know.  I spend every fucking waking 
			hour with one of them.  But it ain't 
			like us at all - all slapsticky and 
			shit - running around like dicks, 
			saying... What's that shit you got me 
			saying?

					HOLDEN
			Snootchie-bootchies.

					JAY
			'Snootchie-bootchies'.  Who talks like 
			that?  That's baby-talk.
				(slaps his hand)
			It's a big world, g - but we're bound 
			to run into you again.  Until then - 
			keep your unit on you.

					HOLDEN
			I'll try.

					BOB
			Do, or do not - there is no ay.

					JAY
				(slaps him)
			Knock it off!  Get your fat ass moving 
			- we got a bus to catch.
				(under his breath)
			Jedi-bitch.

	Exit Jay and Silent Bob.  Holden remains in the booth, 
	thinking.



	MONTAGE - AN UNCOMFORTABLE SILENCE

	1) Holden sits at his drawing table, tapping his pencil 
	up and down.

	2)Alyssa sits in a club, getting talked at by some women. 
	She's not present in the conversation.

	3) Banky meets with Sloss at a restaurant Sloss shakes 
	the contracts at him, and Banky makes the "I know, I 
	know," face.

	4) Holden stares at the picture Alyssa gave him.

	5) Alyssa with her ear to the phone.  She hangs up, 
	angrily.

	6) Holden sits in the park that he and Alyssa walked 
	through.  He's staring at Alyssa's yearbook picture.  He 
	closes the book and sighs.  Then, an idea hits him.  He 
	jumps up and dashes out of the park.



	INT STUDIO - NIGHT

	Banky and Alyssa sit on the couch.  Holden paces in front 
	of them.

					HOLDEN
			I know you're wondering why I asked 
			you both here tonight, at the same 
			time, knowing that we have shit to 
			settle between us, separately.

					BANKY
			I just figured you wanted to kill two 
			birds with one stone by telling her to 
			fuck off with me here so you didn't 
			have to go through the story again 
			later on.

					ALYSSA
			Fuck you.

					BANKY
			Not even if you let me videotape it.

					HOLDEN
			Enough!
				(they both look at him)
			I've been going through things, over 
			and over.  And I dissected it all, and 
			looked at it a thousand different 
			ways.  Banky - there's friction 
			between us for the first time in our 
			lives.  You hate me dating Alyssa and 
			you want me to sign off on this M-TV 
			thing.

					BANKY
			How perceptive.

					HOLDEN
			Alyssa - you and I hit a wall, because 
			I don't know how to deal with... your 
			past, I guess.

					BANKY
			That's a nice way of putting it.  I'd 
			have said the whole double-stuff 
			thing...

					HOLDEN
				(right in his face)
			I'm only going to say it once: shut 
			up.
				(back to pacing)
			Now - I know I'm to blame one way or 
			the other on both accounts.  With you, 
			Alyssa - it's my fault because I feel 
			inadequate.  Because you've had so 
			much experience, had such a big life; 
			and my life's been pretty small in 
			comparison.

					ALYSSA
			That doesn't matter to me...

					HOLDEN
			Please.  I have to get through this.
				(beat)
			And with you Banky - I know why you're 
			having such a hard time with Alyssa, 
			and it's something that's been obvious 
			forever, but I guess I just didn't 
			acknowledge it.
				(takes a deep breath)
			You're in love with me.

					BANKY
				(makes a face; beat)
			What?

					HOLDEN
			You're attracted to me.  Just as, in a 
			way, I'm attracted to you.  I mean, it 
			makes sense - we've been together so 
			long, we have so much in common...

					BANKY
				(getting up)
			Well, I've got to get home and catch 
			the last few minutes of 'Babylon 5', 
			so I'll be...

	Holden grabs him, kisses him full on the lips, and pushes 
	him back onto the couch Alyssa reacts.  Banky - wide-eyed 
	and speechless - looks away.

					HOLDEN
			It's something you're going to have to 
			deal with.  Bank.  You may very well 
			be gay, which explains your homophobia 
			and why you're so jealous of Alyssa, 
			and your sense of humor as well.

					BANKY
			Just 'cause a guy's got a predilection 
			coward dick jokes...

					HOLDEN
			Bank.  Stop.  Deal with it.  You'll 
			feel much better.

	He grabs a chair from the side of the room.

					HOLDEN
			Now - at this point, you may be asking 
			yourself the question that I've been 
			going over and over in my head for the 
			last few days: what does one have to 
			do with the other?

	Alyssa's face drops.  She subtly shakes her head.

					ALYSSA
				(under her breath)
			Don't.

					HOLDEN
			And when I did some serious soul-
			searching, it came at me from out of 
			nowhere, and suddenly it all made 
			sense - a calm came over me.  I know 
			what we have to do.  And then you - 
			Bank, you Alyssa, and I - all of us... 
			can finally be... alright.

					ALYSSA
				(again, under her breath)
			Please don't say it.

					HOLDEN
				(sits in the chair; takes a 
				long beat)
			We've all got to have sex together.

	The room is silent.  Holden Lights a cigarette.  Banky's 
	eyes nearly bug.   Alyssa's  head drops.

					HOLDEN
			Don't you see?  That would take care 
			of everything.  Alyssa - I wouldn't 
			feel inadequate or too conservative 
			anymore.  I'll have done something on 
			par with all the experience you've 
			had.  And it'll be with you, which'll 
			make it that much more powerful.  And 
			Banky - you can cake that leap that 
			everyone else but you sees that you 
			should take.  And it'll be okay, 
			because it'll be with me - your best 
			friend for years.  We've been 
			everything to each other but 
			intimates.  And now, we'll have been 
			through that together too.  And it 
			won't have to be a total leap for you, 
			because a woman will be involved.  And 
			when it's over, all that aggression 
			you feel toward Alyssa will be gone.  
			Because you'll have shared in 
			something beautiful with the woman I 
			love.  It'll be cathartic.  A true 
			communion.  We have to do this.  For 
			me, for both of you... for all of our 
			sakes.  This will keep us together.
				(beat)
			What do you say?

	Banky stares forward, wide-eyed.  He leans back into the 
	couch and lets out a huge sigh.  Then shrugs.

					BANKY
			Sure.

	Holden smiles at his friend.  Then he looks at Alyssa.

					HOLDEN
			You know I need this.  You know it'll 
			help.

	Alyssa looks at him, sadly.

					ALYSSA
			No.

	Holden reacts, shocked Banky lets out a sigh of relief.

					HOLDEN
			No?  I... I thought you'd be into 
			this.

					ALYSSA
			You did?  What does that say about me?

					HOLDEN
			But you've... you've done... stuff... 
			like this.  This should be no big deal 
			for you.

					ALYSSA
			You don't want this.
				(lights her cigarette)
			You really don't want this.  Trust me.

					HOLDEN
			I need this.  This has to happen.  Why 
			can't you see that?  And how can you 
			not?  What does that say about me?  
			You can take it from two guys whose 
			names you can barely remember, but I 
			ask you to share an experience like it 
			- where it's about intimacy - and you 
			say no?

					ALYSSA
				(inhales from her cigarette, 
				takes a beat)
			I can't.

	Holden moves to her side of the couch.

					HOLDEN
			You can.  I'll be there.  And when 
			it's over, we'll be the strongest 
			we've ever been because we got through 
			some nasty shit together.  And we'll 
			finally be on the same level together.  
			And then there'll be nothing we can't 
			accomplish.

	A tear rolls down her cheek She looks at him, sadly, and 
	touches his face.

					ALYSSA
			Oh Holden.
				(trying to compose herself)
			That time is over for me.  I've been 
			there.  I've done it.  And I didn't 
			find what I was looking for in any of 
			it.  I found that in you - in us.  
			Doing this won't help you forget about 
			the things you're hung up on.  It'll 
			create more.

					HOLDEN
			No it won't.  I thought about all of 
			that.

					ALYSSA
			No, it will.  Maybe you'll see me 
			differently from then on - maybe 
			you'll despise me for going along with 
			it, once you're in the moment.  Maybe 
			I'll moan differently and then you'll 
			resent Banky, and become suspicious of 
			us.  Or you'll alienate him because of 
			it, and then grow to blame and hate me 
			for the deterioration of your 
			friendship.  Or what if- I sincerely 
			doubt it, but what if - I saw 
			something in Banky that I never saw 
			before, and fell in love with him and 
			left you.  I've been down roads like 
			this before; many times.  I know you 
			feel doing this will broaden your 
			horizons and give you experience.  But 
			I've had those experiences on my own.  
			I can't accompany you on your's.  I'm 
			past that now.
				(touches his face; stares to 
				cry)
			Or maybe I just love you too much.  
			And I feel hurt and let down that 
			you'd want to share me with anyone.  
			Because I never wanted to share you
				(holds it in; gets up)
			Regardless I can't be a part of this.
				(beat)
			Or you.  Not anymore
				(hugs him)
			I love you.  I always will.  Know 
			that.

	She releases him, then slaps him.

					ALYSSA
			But I'm not your fucking whore.

	Alyssa storms away, stopping briefly to look Banky up and 
	down.

					ALYSSA
			He's your's again.

	She walks our of the studio.  The door closes behind her.

	Banky and Holden stand there, silently.  Cut to black.

	INT COMIC BOOK SHOW - DAY

	It's ONE YEAR later.  We're at another show, not unlike 
	the one from the opening.

	A copy of 'Bluntman and Chronic' enters the frame.  The 
	cover reads 'The Death Chronic', complete with a 
	corresponding drawing.

					BANKY V.O.
			Blast from the past.

	Banky sits at his own signing table.  Behind him hangs a 
	banner that reads 'BANKY EDWARDS - CREATOR Of BABY DAVE'.  
	A small line is formed in front of him.  He talks with a 
	FAN.

					FAN
			Do you know how much it's going for 
			these days?  One ten.  You signing it 
			will push that up even higher,

					BANKY
			If you sell it, I want a kickback
				(starts signing)

					FAN
			I don't know if this is true, but I 
			heard once that there was going to be 
			an animated series.

					BANKY
			There was going to be

					FAN
			What happened!

					BANKY
				(off comic)
			You're looking at it.  No Chronic - no 
			cartoon

					FAN
			That sucks man.  That would've been 
			awesome.

					BANKY
			Tell me about it

					FAN
			Is that what happened to you and 
			Holden McNeil?  You got into a fight 
			over the rights or something?

					BANKY
			It was a little more involved than 
			that.

					FAN
			Whatever happened to him?

					BANKY
			He quit the biz.  I guess.

					FAN
			You guys don't talk anymore?

					BANKY
				(looks OC)
			No.  Not really.

	Banky locks eyes with someone OC.  His expression 
	softens.

	Holden leans against a wall on the far side of the room.  
	He smiles at Banky.  Banky smiles back, and sort of nods.

	Holden holds up a copy of Banky's new solo comic.  He 
	points to it and gives a thumbs up.

					OC FAN
			Probably shouldn't have killed off 
			Chronic.

	Banky smiles to OC.

					BANKY
			Guess not.  Some doors just shouldn't 
			be opened.

	Banky looks in another direction, OC.  He looks at Holden 
	and points to it.   Holden looks in the same direction, 
	and then looks back at Banky and nods.

					OC FAN
			You don't need that guy, anyway.  You 
			do great stuff without him.

	Banky looks at Holden for a beat.  Then he brings his 
	pointer fingers together,  mimicing Holden's 'shared 
	moment' gesture.

	Holden shrugs slightly, then crosses his fingers - as if 
	to say 'hopefully'.

					OC FAN
			You were just carrying that guy, 
			anyway.

	Banky sort of smiles at the OC Holden.  Then he offers 
	his own thumbs up - as to say 'good luck'.

					BANKY
				(to fan, still looking OC)
			You're so right.

	Holden smiles back, nods 'bye', and walks off.

					OC FAN
			Well, keep up the good work, man.  
			Love them dick jokes.  Love 'em.  See 
			ya.

	The Fan Leaves, but Banky is watching Holden go.

					BXVKY
			Yeah.  Bye.
				(shakes it off)
			Okay.  Who's next?

	Alyssa sits at a separate signing table, with a line in 
	front of her.  A WOMAN behind her.  Alyssa dashes off 
	signatures in the copies of her comic.

					ALYSSA
				(to OC departing fan)
			Thanks for reading it.

	The Woman stands and rubs her shoulders.

					WOMAN
			I'm going to get a soda.  You want 
			anything?

					ALYSSA
			I'm fine, thanks,

	The Woman heads off.  Alyssa starts rummaging through her 
	bag.

					ALYSSA
				(not rooking up)
			Okay, who's next!

	A comic book drops on the table in front of her.   It's a 
	comic book called 'Chasing Amy'.

	She leafs through it, not looking up.

					ALYSSA
			Um... This isn't one of mine.

					OC HOLDEN
			It's mine.

	Alyssa looks up sharply.

	Holden stands before her, smiling.

					HOLDEN
			I saved you one.

					ALYSSA
			Hi.

					HOLDEN
			Hi.

					ALYSSA
				(beat)
			How've you been?

					HOLDEN
			Good.  Really good.  Yourself?

					ALYSSA
			Good
				(beat; off her own comic)
			New issue's selling like crazy, for 
			some reason.

					HOLDEN
			Because it's so good.  I really liked 
			it.

					ALYSSA
			Thank you.
				(off comic)
			I haven't even seen this yet.  Did it 
			just come out?

					HOLDEN
			A month ago.  I did a really small 
			run.  Self-financed.  Only about five 
			hundred issues.

					ALYSSA
			Will I enjoy it?
					HOLDEN
			You might.  It's familiar subject 
			matter.

	Alyssa leafs through it.  Her eyes get somewhat misty.

					ALYSSA
			Looks Like a very personal story.

					HOLDEN
			I finally had something personal to 
			say.

	They look at each other for a beat

					HOLDEN
			I'm going to go.  I don't want to hold 
			up the line.

					ALYSSA
			Yeah.  I mean, it can get ugly.  I 
			just saw this nun in line call this 
			small child a cunt-rag.

					HOLDEN
				(smiles)
			Read that, when you have a minute

					ALYSSA
			I will.

					HOLDEN
			I'd like to hear your thoughts about 
			it.  If you get a chance, give me a 
			call.

					ALYSSA
			Okay.

	They look at each other for a beat.

					HOLDEN
			Nice seeing you again,

					ALYSSA
			Really nice to see you too.

	He walks away.  A few steps away, he turns and waves 
	again.  She waves back.  And then he starts moving 
	through the thrall of fan-boys.

	The Woman returns with coffee.  She follows Alyssa's 
	gaze.

					WOMAN
			who was that?

					ALYSSA
			Hmm!  Oh.  Just some guy I knew.

	She watches him go for another beat, then.

					ALYSSA
				(to line)
			Next
				(to Woman)
			So what do you want to do tonight?

	And as they fall into conversation, the show goes on.

                                                         Production Draft

                

               FADE IN. BEGIN TITLE SEQUENCE.

               EXT. ST CLOUD'S - TRAIN STATION - DAWN

               An establishing shot of the rundown train station on an 
               overcast morning. There's snow on the station platform. A 
               train arrives and departs.

                                     LARCH (V.O.)
                         In other parts of the world, young 
                         men of promise leave home to make 
                         their fortunes, battle evil, or solve 
                         the problems of the world.

               Behind the station, at the top of the hill, lies the St. 
               Cloud's orphanage.

                                     LARCH (V.O.)
                         I was myself such a young man, when 
                         I came to save the orphanage in St. 
                         Cloud's... many years ago.

               EXT. ST. CLOUD'S - ORPHANAGE - EARLY MORNING

               A man and woman (COUPLE #1) make their way toward the main 
               entrance of the large brick building.

                                     LARCH (V.O.)
                         Here in St. Cloud's, I have come to 
                         understand that promises are rarely 
                         kept, that the battle isn't so much 
                         against evil as ignorance, and that 
                         being successful can't hold a candle 
                         to being of *use*.

               The couple enters the orphanage, where we hear the sound of 
               babies.

                                     LARCH (V.O.)
                         Nor have I solved the problem I came 
                         here to solve.

               INT. ORPHANAGE - MORNING

               Two nurses, EDNA and ANGELA, chase CHILDREN--a morning 
               routine.

                                     LARCH (V.O.)
                         Even in the most enlightened times, 
                         unwanted babies will manage to be 
                         born. That there will always be 
                         orphans is simple not a problem to 
                         be solved. Here is St. Cloud's, we 
                         don't regard the sordid facts of 
                         life as problems.

               The camera goes up the stairs with some of the kids.

               INT. LARCH'S OFFICE - DAY

               We enter an office where DR. LARCH shows couple #1 their 
               newly adopted son, HOMER, an infant who lies smiling in Dr. 
               Larch's arms.

                                     LARCH (V.O.)
                         In truth, we've only had one real 
                         problem.

               We close in on the infant until his face fills the screen.

                                     LARCH (V.O.)
                         His name was Homer Wells.

               Dr. Larch hands over the infant to the adopting parents.

                                     LARCH
                         I named him after the Greek writer. 
                         You know Homer, of course?

               Hesitant nods. (They don't look as if they read.)

                                     LARCH
                         I made his name "Wells" because I 
                         could tell he was very deep.

               The parents look with pride at their adopted son.

                                     LARCH (V.O.)
                         In truth, Nurse Angela named him--
                         her father *drilled* wells, and 
                         "Homer" was one of her family's 
                         umpteen cats.

               INT./EXT. ORPHANAGE - DAY

               At the front door, Larch and the nurses wave and call good-
               bye to Homer, they close the door.

               INT./EXT. ORPHANAGE - NIGHT

               The same door swings open; it's another night. The same couple 
               is bringing Homer back. There is concern in their faces as 
               Nurse Edna lets them in.

               INT. BOY'S DIVISION, DOORWAY - NIGHT

               Larch is delivering his benediction to the boys.

                                     LARCH
                         "Good night, you Princes of Maine, 
                         you Kings of New England!"

               As he turns, he is startled by Nurse Edna, waiting with couple 
               #1 and baby Homer.

                                     ADOPTING MOTHER
                         There's something wrong with him! He 
                         never makes a sound.

               Larch looks quickly at Homer.

                                     LARCH (V.O.)
                         He didn't cry enough for them, if 
                         you can believe it.

                                     ADOPTING FATHER
                         Do you think we could have a look at 
                         someone a little different?

               The mother hands over the baby to Larch. Baby Homer lets out 
               a happy squeal as soon as he's in Larch's arms. The parents 
               stare in disbelief.

                                     LARCH (V.O.)
                         Thus was Homer Wells returned. He 
                         was too happy a baby.

               EXT. ORPHANAGE - DAY

               Angela and Edna call and wave good-bye to a two-year-old 
               Homer, leaving with COUPLE #2. Larch stands on the porch and 
               watches the family head down the hill.

                                     LARCH (V.O.)
                         The second family has an unfortunate 
                         gift for getting sounds out of Homer.

               INT. COUPLE #2'S HOME - DAY

               Larch bursts into the home of the second couple and lifts a 
               crying and bruised Homer out of his bed. There is rage in 
               Larch's eyes as he looks at the couple.

                                     LARCH (V.O.)
                         The rumor was true. They beat him. 
                         He couldn't stop crying.

               EXT. HILL, ST. CLOUD'S - DAY

               Larch carries Homer up the orphanage hill.

                                     LARCH (V.O.)
                         Here is St. Cloud's, I try to 
                         consider, with each rule I make or 
                         break, that my first priority is an 
                         orphan's future.

               INT. DELIVERY ROOM - DAY

               The naked belly of a VERY PREGNANT WOMAN.

                                     LARCH (V.O.)
                         Easier said than done.

               A tiny hand comes in with a stethoscope and puts it on the 
               big belly. Young Homer's head, with the stethoscope around 
               his neck, pops up behind the belly; he closes his eyes as he 
               concentrates on listening to the sounds of the unborn child. 
               Larch stops in the doorway, catching sight of Homer. He smiles 
               faintly.

               EXT. COUPLE #3'S HOME - DAY

               The door opens to a THIRD COUPLE smiling at us, welcoming 
               and embracing a sixteen-year-old Homer. Behind them waits 
               the would-be STEPSISTER--an attractive girl, a little older 
               then Homer.

                                     LARCH (V.O.)
                         I told the third family to take good 
                         care--this was a special boy.

               INT. STEPSISTER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Homer and the stepsister are in bed together. The parents 
               burst in on them--the father chasing Homer around and around 
               the bed, the mother beating her daughter, who covers herself 
               with a pillow.

                                     LARCH (V.O.)
                         It was Homer who took too much good 
                         care of himself.

               EXT. COUPLE #3'S HOME - NIGHT

               From her window, the stepsister watches Homer leave the house 
               carrying his suitcase. Homer looks up at her as he walks to 
               the street.

               EXT. ORPHANAGE - EARLY MORNING

               It's after dawn, but still a little dark, as Homer walks to 
               the orphanage door, suitcase in hand. A HUGELY PREGNANT WOMAN 
               arrives at the same time. They stand awkwardly next to each 
               other, waiting for someone to answer the door. The woman is 
               crying. Homer reaches out and takes her hand.

                                     HOMER
                         Don't be frightened. Everyone is 
                         nice here.

                                     PREGNANT WOMAN
                         Do you live here?

                                     HOMER
                         I just belong here.

               The woman sniffles; she nods vaguely. The door opens. Nurse 
               Edna lets the woman in and embraces Homer.

                                     LARCH (V.O.)
                         What could I do with him? He kept 
                         coming back!

               INT. LARCH'S OFFICE - DAY

               Larch instructs an older Homer from "Gray's Anatomy." Homer 
               is bored and looks out the window.

                                     LARCH
                         Homer, if you're going to stay at 
                         St. Cloud's, I expect you to be of 
                         use.

               INT. DELIVERY ROOM - DAY

               Homer looks adoringly at Dr. Larch as Larch examines ANOTHER 
               PREGNANT WOMAN. Larch waves Homer over; he places the boy's 
               hand on the woman's abdomen, to feel the fetus kicking.

                                     LARCH (V.O.)
                         But, in failing to withhold love, 
                         had I created a true and everlasting 
                         orphan? I had been too successful 
                         with Homer Wells. I had managed to 
                         make the orphanage his *home*.

               INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY

               Larch closes a door quickly behind him (so that Homer doesn't 
               see the ABORTION PATIENT in the O.R.)

               INT. DELIVERY ROOM - DAY

               Homer assists Larch in delivering a BABY.

               EXT. INCINERATOR - DAY

               Homer carries a white enamel pail to the incinerator. He 
               looks inside the pail; he stops.

                                     LARCH (V.O.)
                         God forgive me. I have *made* an 
                         orphan by loving him too much. Homer 
                         Wells will belong to St. Cloud's, 
                         forever.

               Hold on Homer's disgusted expression as he stares at the 
               contents of the pail.

               END TITLE SEQUENCE. FADE OUT. We hear a song playing on an 
               old phonograph.

               INT. DISPENSARY - DAY

               We see the song playing on the old phonograph. Dr. Larch is 
               taking ether. He holds the bottle in one hand, the cone over 
               his mouth and nose with the other.

               SUPER: ST. CLOUD'S, MAINE, MARCH 1943.

               When Larch dozes off, his hand loosens its grip on the cone; 
               the cone falls off his face, and he wakes up. Then he puts 
               the cone back in place, dripping more ether from the bottle 
               to the gauze covering the cone.

               Pan the dispensary, which also serves as Larch's photo gallery 
               and bedroom apartment. The ether-bed is separated from the 
               room by a hospital curtain (the kind on casters). We see the 
               recording revolving, the glass-encased cabinets of medical 
               supplies, the old photographs of St. Cloud's.

               Homer enters, he stands uncomfortably, watching Larch for a 
               moment. Then he turns around and walks back into the corridor.

               INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

               Homer calls out as though he's just coming down the corridor.

                                     HOMER
                         Dr. Larch! Dr. Larch!

               INT. DISPENSARY - DAY

               Larch wakes up; he shakes off the ether haze. Homer reenters.

                                     HOMER
                         We've got two new patients, one to 
                         deliver.

               Dr. Larch and Homer leave together.

               INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

               The *two* doctors walk briskly down the hall, a couple of 
               professionals.

                                     LARCH
                         First pregnancy?

                                     HOMER
                         Yes, for both.

                                     LARCH
                              (sarcastically)
                         I presume you'd prefer handling the 
                         delivery.

                                     HOMER
                              (tiredly; an old topic)
                         All I said was, I don't want to 
                         perform abortions. I have no argument 
                         with *you* performing them.

                                     LARCH
                         You know *how* to help these women--
                         how can you not feel *obligated* to 
                         help them when they can't get help 
                         anywhere else?

                                     HOMER
                         One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask 
                         how to do it--you just showed me.

                                     LARCH
                         What *else* could I have showed you, 
                         Homer? The only thing I can teach 
                         you is what I know! In every life, 
                         you've got to be of use.

               Homer and Larch split off and disappear into two different 
               operating rooms. As he goes, Homer mumbles to himself, "Of 
               use, of use, of use."

               INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY

               Larch and Angela are preparing the ether for DOROTHY, a not 
               visibly pregnant woman. The sounds of labor across the hall 
               can be heard Over.

                                     LARCH
                              (holds the cone)
                         Have you ever had ether, Dorothy?

                                     DOROTHY
                         Once, when they took out my appendix.

                                     ANGELA
                              (looks for scar)
                         No one's touched your appendix.

                                     DOROTHY
                         Whatever it was... the ether made me 
                         sick.

                                     LARCH
                         It won't make you sick this time, 
                         Dorothy--not the way I do it, just a 
                         drop at a time.

                                     DOROTHY
                         I can't pay for this, you know--I 
                         got no money.

                                     LARCH
                         One day, Dorothy, if you have any 
                         money, a donation to the orphanage 
                         would be very much appreciated.

                                     ANGELA
                         Only if you can afford it.

                                     LARCH
                              (holds the ether bottle)
                         Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.

               Angela puts the cone over Dorothy's mouth and nose; Larch 
               drips the ether on the cone. A newborn wails in the other 
               O.R. Over.

               INT. DELIVERY ROOM - DAY

               Homer has delivered CARLA. A newborn baby is screaming in 
               Edna's arms. Homer is attending to Carla, who is panting.

                                     HOMER
                         That was good, Carla--that was 
                         *perfect*. Everything's fine.

                                     CARLA
                         I don't wanna see it!

                                     EDNA
                         You don't have to see it, dear. Don't 
                         worry.

                                     CARLA
                         I don't even wanna know what sex it 
                         is--don't tell me!

                                     HOMER
                         We won't tell you, Carla. You're 
                         going to be okay.

                                     EDNA
                         Your *baby's* going to be okay, too.

                                     CARLA
                         I don't wanna know!

               Larch pops into the delivery room; he peers at the baby.

                                     LARCH
                         He's a big boy!

                                     CARLA
                         Let me see him, for Christ's sake--I 
                         wanna see him.

               Edna shows the baby to Carla, who stares, then turns away. 
               Larch whispers to Homer.

                                     LARCH
                         Would you mind having a look at 
                         Dorothy?

               INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY

               Angela sits with the still-etherized Dorothy while Larch and 
               Homer confer over a basin containing Dorothy's uterus.

                                     HOMER
                         There was no visible wound?

                                     LARCH
                         No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus 
                         was virtually *disintegrating*--my 
                         stitches pulled right through the 
                         tissue!

                                     HOMER
                              (mystified)
                         It looks like scurvy.

                                     LARCH
                              (derisively sarcastic)
                         Scurvy! Ah yes, the curse of the old-
                         time sailor, suffering long periods 
                         at sea with no fresh fruits or 
                         vegetables. Homer, Dorothy isn't a 
                         *sailor*!

                                     ANGELA
                         She's a prostitute, isn't she?

                                     HOMER
                              (to Angela)
                         Did you look in her purse?

                                     LARCH
                              (frustrated)
                         I looked everywhere else!

               Angela hands Larch a bottle of brown liquid.

                                     ANGELA
                         It's called French Lunar Solution.

               Larch wrinkles his nose at the odor.

                                     LARCH
                         It's not ergot, it's not pituitary 
                         extract, it's not oil of rue...

                                     ANGELA
                         It claims to restore monthly 
                         regularity.

                                     HOMER
                         It's obviously an aborticide.

                                     LARCH
                         Obviously.

               Larch wets his finger with the stuff, then touches it to his 
               tongue.

                                     LARCH
                              (spits)
                         Christ, it's oil of tansy!

                                     HOMER
                         I don't know it.

                                     LARCH
                         If you take enough of it, your 
                         intestines lose their ability to 
                         absorb Vitamin C.

                                     HOMER
                         In other words, scurvy.

                                     LARCH
                         Good boy. Good job. And you call 
                         yourself "not a doctor"!
                              (to Angela)
                         Keep an eye on her--she's in trouble.

               As Homer turns to leave, Larch stops him; he points to the 
               basin.

                                     LARCH
                         Take care of that, will you?

               Homer stops, annoyed; he picks up the basin and empties the 
               contents into a white enamel pail.

               INT. DINING HALL - AFTERNOON

               MISS TITCOMB is teaching math to some distracted boys and 
               girls in a corner of the dining room. A blackboard on wheels 
               is a mass of numbers. Homer, passing through the dining room 
               with the white enamel pail, attracts the attention of BUSTER, 
               a sixteen-year-old who is picking over a plate of pastries 
               on a table. Buster immediately goes with Homer.

                                     BUSTER
                         I'll help you.

               Homer shakes his head, keeps walking. Buster follows. Dr. 
               Larch passes close to Buster. Buster makes a face, disgusted.

               EXT. INCINERATOR - AFTERNOON

               Buster and Homer tramp through the snow toward the 
               incinerator. Homer still carries the pail.

                                     BUSTER
                         He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen 
                         him do it!

                                     HOMER
                         It's because he's too tired to sleep. 
                         He has to.

                                     BUSTER
                         He *smells* like he could put you to 
                         sleep!

                                     HOMER
                         He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell 
                         like ether.

                                     BUSTER
                         *You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't 
                         smell like ether.

                                     HOMER
                         I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been 
                         to medical school--I haven't even 
                         been to high school!

                                     BUSTER
                         But you've studied with the old man 
                         for *years*!

                                     HOMER
                         I'm *not* a doctor!

                                     BUSTER
                         I'm sorry, Homer.

               Buster stands watching as Homer empties the pail into the 
               incinerator.

               INT. DISPENSARY - NIGHT

               With his head inclined to the giant ear of Larch's phonograph, 
               FUZZY--six, thin, and pale and looking remarkably like an 
               embryo--is listening to a recording. He can't hear what Larch 
               and Homer are saying about him as they construct a humidified 
               tent over a small hospital bed on wheels. The humidifier is 
               operated by a car battery.

                                     LARCH
                         Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, 
                         there's something about the premature 
                         babies of alcoholic mothers. They 
                         seem susceptible to every damn thing 
                         that comes along.

                                     HOMER
                         I haven't read that.

                                     LARCH
                         I haven't, either. But you *will*. 
                         The morons who write the books should 
                         do a little research *here*.

                                     HOMER
                         But isn't Fuzzy just... well, 
                         underdeveloped?

                                     LARCH
                         When *doesn't* he have bronchitis? I 
                         wouldn't call his bronchial infections 
                         "underdeveloped." Would you?

               Larch plucks Fuzzy from in front of the phonograph and zips 
               him into the breathing tent. Fuzzy smiles. As larch leaves, 
               MARY AGNES, a pretty but tough-looking teenager, comes into 
               the dispensary.

                                     HOMER
                         What is it, Mary Agnes?

               Mary Agnes smiles at Homer; then she sticks her tongue out 
               at him. Homer looks at her impassively, but as the moment 
               continues his expression suggests his annoyance. Fuzzy starts 
               to cough; he wheezes as he breathes. Homer leans down; he 
               peers at Fuzzy through a hole by the zipper of the tent.

                                     MARY AGNES
                              (garbled because of 
                              her tongue)
                         Look!

               Homer examines Mary Agnes' tongue.

                                     HOMER
                         Did you bite it?

                                     MARY AGNES
                         I don't remember.

                                     HOMER
                              (dismissively)
                         It looks like you bit it--it'll be 
                         all right.

                                     MARY AGNES
                         Maybe I was kissing someone and he 
                         bit me.

                                     HOMER
                              (looks at her tongue 
                              again)
                         No, you did it yourself. Maybe in 
                         your sleep.

                                     MARY AGNES
                         I must have been *dreaming* of kissing 
                         someone.

               Homer is not responding to her come-on. He wheels Fuzzy into 
               the hall.

                                     HOMER
                         Story time, Fuzzy!

               INT. GIRLS' DIVISION - NIGHT

               In the girls' bunk room, Nurse Edna is saying prayers. The 
               girls lie with their palms pressed together on their chests.

                                     EDNA
                         "Oh Lord, support us all the day 
                         long..."

               EXT. ST. CLOUD'S - THE HILL - NIGHT

               The building of St. Cloud's is silhouetted against the sky. 
               Carla, the woman we saw deliver the baby, is heading down 
               the hill alone, she sobs, not looking back.

                                     EDNA (O.S.)
                         "...until the shadows lengthen and 
                         the evening comes, and the busy world 
                         is hushed, and the fever of life is 
                         over, and our work is done."

               INT. GIRLS' DIVISION - NIGHT

               In the bunk room again, with Edna and the girls.

                                     EDNA
                         "Then in Thy mercy grant us save 
                         lodging, and holy rest, and peace at 
                         the last."

                                     ALL THE GIRLS
                         Amen! Amen! Amen!

               INT. BOYS' DIVISION - NIGHT

               Dr. Larch is reading from Oliver Twist--the death scene of 
               Bill Sike's dog. The boys listen in horror in their beds.

                                     LARCH
                         "A dog, which had lain concealed 
                         till now, ran backwards and forwards 
                         on the parapet with a dismal howl, 
                         and collecting himself for a spring, 
                         jumped for the dead man's shoulders."

               Homer enters; he walks quietly to his bed in the far corner 
               of the room, where he starts to undress.

                                     LARCH
                         "Missing his aim, he fell into a 
                         ditch, turning completely over as he 
                         went; and striking his head against 
                         a stone, dashed his brains out.

               Larch turns out the lights. From the open doorway to the 
               hall, Larch delivers his nightly benediction.

                                     LARCH
                         Good night, you Princes of Maine! 
                         You Kings of New England!

               Larch closes the door, leaving them in the semi-darkness. 
               One young boy runs into Homer's bed, nervously giggling.

                                     FUZZY
                              (in his breathing 
                              tent)
                         Why does Dr. Larch *do* tht every 
                         night?

                                     CURLY
                              (about seven)
                         Maybe to scare us...

                                     COPPERFIELD
                              (about eleven)
                         No, you jerk.

                                     STEERFORTH
                              (about nine)
                         Dr. Larch *loves* us!

                                     FUZZY
                         But why does he do *that*?

                                     BUSTER
                         He does it because we like it.

               The boys silently agree, Homer among them.

               EXT. ST. CLOUD'S - EARLY MORNING

               The girls, led by Mary Agnes, round a corner of the orphanage, 
               towing a sled piled high with snowballs.

                                     MARY AGNES
                         Buster is mine. You two get 
                         Copperfield and Curly. Nobody touches 
                         Fuzzy.

               They shriek as the boys suddenly surprise them. Buster throws 
               two hard snowballs that hit Mary Agnes and CLARA (eight or 
               nine) before Mary Agnes overwhelms him and repeatedly sticks 
               his head in the snow. Copperfield, terrified of Mary Agnes, 
               escapes. Curly misses, then tips over the sled of snowballs 
               as Clara and the adorable HAZEL (five or six) throw him to 
               the ground. Fuzzy drops his one snowball; he runs aimlessly 
               in circles, coughing, as Nurse Edna explodes from a door of 
               the orphanage.

                                     EDNA
                         Stop it! No fighting! *Share* the 
                         snowballs!

                                     BUSTER
                              (mouth full of snow)
                         They're *our* snowballs! They *stole* 
                         them!

                                     MARY AGNES
                         They attacked us--just like the Japs!

               Fuzzy coughs and wheezes, trying to catch his breath.

                                     EDNA
                         Listen to you, Fuzzy! You've been 
                         running. You get to the shower!

               A NEW COUPLE comes up the hill. The orphans stop and stare, 
               brushing snow off themselves, struggling to make themselves 
               look presentable. Curly is desperate to look his best. Mary 
               Agnes doesn't bother to pretty herself. She whispers to Clara 
               and Hazel.

                                     MARY AGNES
                         I know the type--they'll take one of 
                         the babies.

               INT. DINING HALL - MORNING

               The children are eating breakfast as the would-be parents 
               walk around the tables, looking over the assembled orphans. 
               Curly works on his table manners; he forks and eats a piece 
               of pancake with elegance. Angela and Edna try to make the 
               couple slow down by the older children, but the couple stop 
               and stare at the adorable Hazel.

               INT. BABY ROOM - MORNING

               Larch and Homer are examining the babies. The doctors are 
               checking the babies' grips, their eyes, ears, and throats.

               Angela appears in the doorway.

                                     ANGELA
                         Wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting 
                         in your office.

                                     LARCH
                              (irritated)
                         Life is waiting.

               Angela disappears. Larch looks at the next baby's record 
               (attached to the bed).

                                     LARCH
                         Where's the name sheet?

                                     HOMER
                         Nobody's named this one yet.

                                     LARCH
                         It's my turn!

               Homer is tired of this game. Larch touches the child's 
               forehead with his index finger.

                                     LARCH
                         Henceforth you shall be... Little 
                         Dorrit!

               The baby starts to cry.

                                     HOMER
                         He doesn't like it.
                              (looks at the record)
                         He's a boy, That's why.

                                     LARCH
                         Can't a boy be a Dorrit?

                                     HOMER
                         I don't think so.

                                     LARCH
                         You do it then.

               Homer points his finger at the child's forehead like a gun.

                                     HOMER
                         Henceforth you shall be... Little 
                         Wilbur.

                                     LARCH
                         I'm not crazy about the "Little..."

               Homer is writing the name.

                                     HOMER
                         Okay, he's just a Wilbur then.

                                     LARCH
                         We haven't had a Wilbur here in a 
                         year or so, have we? We used to have 
                         *dozens*!

               They are interrupted by Copperfield, who comes running from 
               the corridor.

                                     COPPERFIELD
                         They picked Hazel! The idiots chose 
                         Hazel!

               INT. GIRLS' DIVISION - DAY

               Hazel is being fussed over by Edna. Hazel clutches a cardboard 
               suitcase and a tattered rag doll. Mary Agnes, by far the 
               oldest, sits on a bed.

                                     MARY AGNES
                         If people want to adopt one of us, 
                         they should have to take the oldest 
                         first.

                                     EDNA
                         Please, Mary Agnes! This is Hazel's 
                         special day--don't make her feel 
                         sad.

                                     MARY AGNES
                         Hazel's practically the youngest of 
                         us. She should be the *last* to leave!

                                     CLARA
                         At least Hazel can talk. Usually 
                         they take one of the stupid babies.

                                     MARY AGNES
                         They take the babies so they won't 
                         ever have to tell them that they 
                         were orphans!

                                     HAZEL
                              (begins to cry)
                         I'm not a baby!

                                     MARY AGNES
                         If you cry, Hazel, they'll just send 
                         you back.

                                     EDNA
                         Mary Agnes, that's not true!

               Hazel cries harder.

                                     MARY AGNES
                         That's what they did to me!

                                     EDNA
                         You *wanted* to come back--that's 
                         why you cried.
                              (to Hazel)
                         You can cry if you feel like it, 
                         Hazel. You cry as much as you want.

               INT. LARCH'S OFFICE - DAY

               Homer is in the corridor outside the office, overhearing 
               Larch's lecture to the couple adopting Hazel.

                                     LARCH
                         It is strictly for our orphans' sake 
                         that I destroy any record of their 
                         natural mothers. Of course they will, 
                         one day, want to know. But orphans, 
                         especially, should look forward to 
                         their *futures*. Not back to their 
                         pasts.

               INT. WINDOW, CORRIDOR - DAY

               Homer sees Curly standing all alone by a window in the 
               corridor; a suitcase is next to him.

                                     HOMER
                         Hi, Curly. You going somewhere?

               Curly shakes his head.

                                     CURLY
                         I thought they might take me.

                                     HOMER
                         They wanted a girl.

                                     CURLY
                         Nobody ever wants me!

               Homer embraces Curly and lifts him up, he grabs the suitcase 
               and continues down the corridor.

                                     HOMER
                         You're one of the best, Curly--we 
                         couldn't let just anyone take you.

                                     CURLY
                         Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone 
                         take *any* of us!

                                     HOMER
                         That's true.

                                     CURLY
                         Nobody's asked for me, have they?

                                     HOMER
                         Nobody special enough, Curly.

                                     CURLY
                         You mean somebody asked?

                                     HOMER
                         Only the right people can have you, 
                         Curly.

               Homer disappears into the boys' bunk room carrying Curly and 
               his suitcase, leaving the corridor empty.

               INT./EXT. ORPHANAGE - DAY

               Faces in the windows; the orphans watch Hazel walking across 
               the snowy lawn with her new parents.

               INT. GIRLS' DIVISION - NIGHT

               Edna (with the girls) gives her good-bye blessing to Hazel.

                                     EDNA
                         Let us be happy for Hazel. Hazel has 
                         found a family. Good night, Hazel.

                                     THE GIRLS
                         Good night, Hazel! Good night, Hazel! 
                         Good night, Hazel!

               INT./EXT. ORPHANAGE - FRONT DOOR - DAY

               The front door opens. The orphans excitedly run outside onto 
               the green lawn, into the warm weather of spring.

               INT. DISPENSARY - MORNING

               Angela is singing along with the song on the phonograph, a 
               more romantic song then before, which rouses Larch from his 
               ether. He is grumpy, but she sings the song in his ear and 
               won't give him back the ether cone; he rolls away from her, 
               but she tickles him and bites his ear, coaxing him into a 
               more playful mood.

                                     LARCH
                         I was dreaming about you. How 
                         beautiful you were!

                                     ANGELA
                         You weren't dreaming about me.

                                     LARCH
                         I was!

               Playfully, she slips out of his embrace.

                                     ANGELA
                         Then I wasn't beautiful.

                                     LARCH
                         You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.

                                     ANGELA
                         It was just the ether, Wilbur...

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

               Homer wheels a tray with glasses of water between the beds. 
               A DISTRAUGHT PREGNANT WOMAN stops him by her bed.

                                     HOMER
                         Are you okay? Can I get you anything?

                                     DISTRAUGHT WOMAN
                         No one but me ever put a hand on me, 
                         to feel that baby. Don't you want to 
                         touch it or put your ear down to it?

                                     HOMER
                         Okay.

               Homer touches the woman's belly.

                                     DISTRAUGHT WOMAN
                         Put your ear there. Go on.

               Homer cautiously lays his ear against her belly.

                                     DISTRAUGHT WOMAN
                         You shouldn't have a baby if there's 
                         no one who wants to put his face 
                         right there!

               She holds Homer's head against her belly; she presses his 
               face into her. She shuts her eyes. Homer's eyes stare widely. 
               Dr. Larch stops in the doorway; he watches with concern.

                                     DISTRAUGHT WOMAN
                         Stay right there. Right where you 
                         are. Stay right here. Right here.

               EXT. ST. CLOUD'S - TRAIN STATION - DAY

               Homer at the train station, staring down the empty tracks. 
               Buster is hanging around with him, kicking a rock.

                                     BUSTER
                         Do you ever think about leaving this 
                         place to go find them?

               Homer makes no response. As the train approaches, Homer and 
               Buster go sit on a loading cart. They see the distraught 
               woman (no longer pregnant) from Homer's experience of a few 
               nights ago; she is leaving St. Cloud's without her baby, 
               waiting for the approaching train. Her face is a mask. The 
               DISAPPROVING STATIONMASTER gives her a hard look.

                                     BUSTER
                         I mean your parents.

                                     HOMER
                         I know who you mean. I think about 
                         leaving here, but not to find *them*.

                                     BUSTER
                         Why not?

                                     HOMER
                         Whoever they were, they didn't *do* 
                         any of the things parents are supposed 
                         to do. Dr. Larch did those things, 
                         and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela.

                                     BUSTER
                         Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could 
                         meet mine, anyway.

                                     HOMER
                         What for, Buster? What would you do 
                         if you met them?

                                     BUSTER
                         Uh... I'd like to show them that I 
                         can cook, a little.

                                     HOMER
                         You cook very well!

                                     BUSTER
                         And that I can drive a truck!

                                     HOMER
                              (laughing)
                         Better than I can!

                                     BUSTER
                         Sometimes I want to meet them so I 
                         can kill them. Just sometimes.

               Buster is ashamed; he knows he's said the wrong thing.

                                     BUSTER
                         Homer, you know I would never kill 
                         anyone--you know I wouldn't.

                                     HOMER
                         I know.

               The slowly moving train has stopped. There are SOLDIERS 
               leaning out the windows. Buster turns to see Mary Agnes 
               walking past the train--she's doing her best to look grown-
               up, sophisticated. One of the soldiers reaches out and gently 
               tugs on  her hair. Mary Agnes is enraged; she spits at the 
               soldier.

                                     BUSTER
                         I think Mary Agnes could kill someone.

                                     HOMER
                         I doubt it. She's just an...

               Mary Agnes spits at *all* the soldiers.

                                     HOMER
                         ...emotional girl.

               The soldiers roll up the windows as Mary Agnes improvises 
               some verbal abuse.

                                     BUSTER
                         What's she so emotional about?

                                     HOMER
                              (shrugs)
                         I don't know. She got left here, 
                         like the rest of us, didn't she?

               Camera closes on Homer.

               INT. DINING HALL - NIGHT

               The orphans are watching King Kong, the part when the giant 
               ape first captures the screaming Fay Wray. Intercut Kong 
               with the orphans' rapt faces. Homer sits near the front, 
               mesmerized by the film. Dr. Larch and Angela sit by the 
               projector; Larch is reading a letter. Fuzzy points to the 
               screen.

                                     FUZZY
                              (coughing)
                         He thinks she's his *mother*!

               King Kong is undressing Fay Wray in the cave.

                                     COPPERFIELD
                         He doesn't think she's his mother, 
                         Fuzzy.

                                     FUZZY
                         He does so! He *loves* her!

                                     CARLA
                         How could she be his *mother*?

               Larch shakes the letter in front of Angela.

                                     LARCH
                              (a harsh whisper)
                         They want to replace me! The Board 
                         of Trustees wants to *replace* me!

                                     ANGELA
                              (whispering back)
                         They just want you to hire some new 
                         help.

                                     LARCH
                         Some new *things* would be useful. I 
                         don't need any "new help."

               The film breaks--to huge cries of disappointment from the 
               orphans. Fuzzy coughs and coughs while Larch fumbles with 
               the projector. Angela turns on the light while Larch squints 
               at the broken film. The orphans are chanting, "Kong! Kong!"

                                     LARCH
                         Homer! I need you!

               Homer gets up and walks to the projector.

                                     LARCH
                         I thought you took care of this. It 
                         always breaks in the same place. 
                         It's your splice, isn't it?

                                     HOMER
                              (angry)
                         It's *your* splice! You blame me for 
                         everything!

               Larch abruptly lets go of the film.

                                     LARCH
                         Angela, we need a new movie, a new 
                         projector, a new typewriter--*that's* 
                         what they should replace around here!

               Edna comes in; she speaks to Larch, then quickly leaves.

                                     EDNA
                         We have a delivery. Imminent, in my 
                         estimation...

               Larch turns to Homer.

                                     LARCH
                         Homer, would you get this one?

               Homer shifts his weight to the other foot; aggravated; he 
               stands there.

                                     HOMER
                         She's a patient, right? She should 
                         see a doctor.

               Homer and Larch stare at each other.

                                     LARCH
                              (trying to stay calm)
                         Homer, you are a skilled and gifted 
                         surgeon. You have near-prefect 
                         obstetrical and gynecological 
                         procedure.

               Homer is also trying to avoid a fight.

                                     HOMER
                         I just mean I'd rather fix the movie. 
                         Tonight.

               Larch can't hide his disappointment.

                                     LARCH
                         Sure. Okay. You splice. I'll deliver.

               It is an uneasy peace.

               INT. BOYS' DIVISION - NIGHT (LATER)

               Homer is adjusting Fuzzy's breathing tent as the other boys 
               climb into bed.

                                     FUZZY
                         Homer... doesn't King Kong think the 
                         woman is his *mother*?

                                     HOMER
                         Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, 
                         all right.

                                     FUZZY
                         That's why Kong loves her!

               Larch comes in and walks over to Homer and Fuzzy. Larch and 
               Homer exchange a look.

                                     HOMER
                         I thought it was my turn.

                                     LARCH
                         It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.

               Homer sits down with 'David Copperfield.' There is quiet 
               anticipation while Homer readies himself to read.

                                     HOMER
                              (reading)
                         "Whether I shall turn out to be the 
                         hero of my own life, or whether that 
                         station will be held by anybody else, 
                         these pages must show."

               Larch continues to adjust Fuzzy's breathing tent.

                                     HOMER
                         "I was a posthumous child. My father's 
                         eyes had closed upon the light of 
                         this world six months, when mine 
                         opened on it."

                                     FUZZY
                              (whispers to Larch)
                         His father's dead, right?

                                     LARCH
                              (whispering back)
                         That's right, Fuzz.

               Close on Fuzzy.

                                     HOMER (O.S.)
                              (continues reading)
                         "There is something strange to me, 
                         even now, in the reflection that he 
                         never saw me..."

               As Larch bends over Fuzzy to fix the breathing apparatus, 
               Fuzzy whispers.

                                     FUZZY
                         Is *your* father dead?

                                     LARCH
                              (nods, whispers)
                         Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the 
                         liver.

                                     FUZZY
                         *Liver* killed him?

                                     LARCH
                         *Alcohol* killed him--he drank himself 
                         to death.

                                     FUZZY
                         But did you know him?

                                     LARCH
                         Barely. It hardly mattered that I 
                         knew him.

                                     FUZZY
                         Did you know your mother better?

                                     LARCH
                              (nods, still whispers)
                         She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.

                                     FUZZY
                         What's a nanny do?

                                     LARCH
                         She looks after other people's 
                         children.

                                     FUZZY
                         Did you grow up around here?

                                     LARCH
                         No. She was an immigrant.

                                     FUZZY
                         What's an immigrant?

                                     LARCH
                         Someone not from Maine.

               EXT. ST. CLOUD'S - NIGHT

               The orphanage in moonlight. Not a sound.

               EXT. ST. CLOUD'S - MORNING

               The children are chasing a ball near the incinerator.

               A VERY FRIGHTENED GIRL---not one of the orphans--is lying 
               next to the incinerator.

               Edna kneels by the strange girl, who cringes with fear.

                                     EDNA
                         No one's going to hurt you, dear. 
                         Have you come to visit us? We have 
                         beds, you know. Have you had any 
                         breakfast? What's your name?

               The girl won't speak; when Edna touches the girl's forehead, 
               she pulls back her hand in alarm.

               INT. OPERATING ROOM - MORNING

               Edna is holding the head of the frightened young girl. The 
               girl is feverishly hot and whimpering; she keeps looking at 
               her feet in the stirrups as if she's an animal caught in a 
               trap. Larch and Homer stand on either side of her.

                                     EDNA
                         Her temperature is a hundred and 
                         four.

                                     LARCH
                              (very gently)
                         How old are you, dear? Thirteen?

               The girl shakes her head. The pain stabs her again.

                                     LARCH
                         Twelve? Are you twelve, dear?
                              (the girl nods)
                         You have to tell me how long you've 
                         been pregnant.
                              (the girl freezes)
                         Three months?

               Another stab of pain contorts the girl.

                                     LARCH
                         Are you *four* months pregnant?

               The girl holds her breath while he examines her abdomen; 
               Homer very delicately examines the girl's abdomen, too.

                                     HOMER
                              (whispers to Larch)
                         She's at least *five*.

               The girl goes rigid as Larch bends into position.

                                     LARCH
                         Dear child, it won't hurt when I 
                         look. I'm just going to *look*.

               Homer assists Larch with the speculum.

                                     LARCH
                         Tell me: you haven't done something 
                         to yourself, have you?

                                     TWELVE-YEAR-OLD GIRL
                         It wasn't me!

                                     LARCH
                         Did you go to someone else?

                                     TWELVE-YEAR-OLD GIRL
                         He said he was a doctor. I would 
                         never have stuck that inside me!

                                     HOMER
                         Stuck *what* inside you?

               Homer holds the girl still--she is babbling on and on while 
               Larch is examining her.

                                     TWELVE-YEAR-OLD GIRL
                         It wasn't me! I would never do no 
                         such thing! I wouldn't stick that 
                         inside me! It wasn't me!

               Larch, his wild eye peering into the speculum, makes an 
               audible gasp from the shock of what he sees inside the girl. 
               Larch tells Homer to have a look. Larch then whispers 
               something to Edna; she brings the ether bottle and cone 
               quickly. Larch starts putting the cone in place, over the 
               nose and mouth of the frightened girl. Homer bends to the 
               speculum.

                                     LARCH
                              (to the twelve-year-
                              old)
                         Listen, you've been very brave. I'm 
                         going to put you to sleep--you won't 
                         feel it anymore. You've been brave 
                         enough.

               Homer stares into the speculum; he closes his eyes. The girl 
               is resisting the ether, but her eyelids flutter closed.

                                     EDNA
                         That's a heavy sedation.

                                     LARCH
                         You *bet* it's a heavy sedation! The 
                         fetus is unexpelled, her uterus is 
                         punctured, she has acute peritonitis, 
                         and there's a foreign object. I think 
                         it's a crochet hook.

               Homer has pulled off his surgical mask. He leans over the 
               scrub sink, splashing cold water on his face.

                                     LARCH
                              (to Homer)
                         If she'd come to you four months ago 
                         and asked you for a simple D and C, 
                         what would you have decided to do? 
                         *Nothing*? *This* is what doing 
                         nothing gets you, Homer. It means 
                         that someone else is going to do the 
                         job--some moron who doesn't know 
                         *how*!

               Homer, furious, leaves the operating room. Edna lifts the 
               girl's eyelids for Larch so that he can see how well under 
               the ether she is.

                                     LARCH
                         I wish you'd come to *me*, dear child. 
                         You should have come to me, instead.

               INT. CORRIDOR - MORNING

               Homer storms down the hall, then stops, pulling off his white 
               coat. Angry, pacing, he kicks at nothing.

               EXT. ST. CLOUD'S - GRAVEYARD - EARLY MORNING

               Buster and Homer are digging the pit. Larch paces by the 
               coffin of the 12-year-old girl.

                                     BUSTER
                         What'd she die of?

                                     LARCH
                              (inhales deeply)
                         She died of *secrecy*, she died of 
                         *ignorance*...

               Buster nods, but he's totally bewildered.

                                     LARCH
                              (to Homer)
                         If you expect people to be responsible 
                         for their children, you have to give 
                         them the right to decide whether or 
                         not to *have* children. Wouldn't you 
                         agree?

               Buster doesn't get it. Homer has heard this too many times; 
               he rolls his eyes.

                                     HOMER
                         How about expecting people to be 
                         responsible enough to control 
                         themselves to begin with?

                                     LARCH
                         How about this child? You expect 
                         *her* to be responsible?

               Homer looks away.

                                     HOMER
                         I didn't mean her. I'm talking 
                         about... adults.
                              (annoyed)
                         You know who I mean!

               Larch studies him.

               EXT./INT. ST. CLOUD'S ROAD - TRUCK CAB - DAY

               Buster is driving the old pickup truck, with the shovels and 
               a wheelbarrow in the back. Larch and Homer are in the cab, 
               they are being bounced all over the cab by Buster's wild 
               driving. Larch looks at Homer; he stares at him with a curious 
               smile.

                                     HOMER
                         What?!

               Larch says nothing. Homer gives him a look.

                                     LARCH
                              (smiling)
                         It's just a marvel to me that you 
                         still have such high expectations of 
                         people.

                                     HOMER
                         I'm happy I amuse you.

                                     LARCH
                              (to Homer)
                         Try to look at it this way. What 
                         choice does Buster have? What are 
                         his options? Nobody will ever adopt 
                         him.
                              (Buster considers 
                              this)

                                     HOMER
                         Try to look at it *this* way. Buster 
                         and I are sitting right here beside 
                         you. We could have ended up in the 
                         incinerator!
                              (Buster grins)

                                     LARCH
                         Happy to be alive, under any 
                         circumstances--is that your point?

               Buster is distracted; he drives the truck into a ditch and 
               it bounces around, missing a tree by an inch. He is up on 
               the road again in a few seconds.

                                     HOMER
                         Happy to be alive... I guess so.

               They are all distracted by a luxurious convertible that 
               overtakes them on the hill to the orphanage. The fast car is 
               driven by a handsome man in the uniform of the Army Air Corps--
               a YOUNG OFFICER. From the passenger seat, a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG 
               WOMAN smiles at them, rendering them speechless.

               EXT. ORPHANAGE DRIVEWAY - DAY

               The luxurious convertible (now parked) has drawn all the 
               orphans to it. The handsome young officer (WALLY) and the 
               beautiful young woman (CANDY) stand confused by the car; 
               they are surrounded by the curious orphans, with whom they 
               are painfully self-conscious. They are overly friendly to 
               the children as they are anxious of Larch and Homer and Buster 
               (in their gravedigging attire), who are getting out of the 
               truck. Nervously, Wally gives the children chocolates.

                                     CANDY
                         So many children. Are they all 
                         orphans?

                                     WALLY
                         Well, this *is* an orphanage.

               The kids climb into Wally's car.

                                     CANDY
                         Oh, they're getting into the car... 
                         watch your fingers!

               Curly tugs on Candy's dress, staring up at her, his face 
               already smeared with chocolate.

                                     CURLY
                         I'm the best.

                                     CANDY
                              (sweetly)
                         You are?

                                     WALLY
                              (good with kids)
                         The best? Wow! The best at *what*?

                                     CURLY
                         I'm the best one.

               Curly's nose is streaming snot. Candy kneels beside him and 
               holds her handkerchief to his nose.

                                     CANDY
                         Here, blow...

               Curly tries to talk while she's holding his nose.

                                     CURLY
                         I really *am* the best, I just have 
                         a cold.

                                     CANDY
                         Blow! There, I bet that feels better.

                                     CURLY
                              (sniffs)
                         Yeah.

               The other orphans are dying with envy--Candy is so beautiful. 
               (Some, like Buster, are torn between Candy and the car.)

                                     LARCH
                         Curly, come here!

                                     CURLY
                              (to Larch)
                         *Tell* them! I'm the one.

               Virtually all the orphans have climbed into Wally's car.

                                     HOMER
                              (to Wally)
                         I'm sorry. They're not used to seeing 
                         a car like this.

                                     WALLY
                         It's okay--I don't mind.

               Larch, scowling, presents himself to the new couple.

                                     WALLY
                         We brought some chocolates for the 
                         kids.

                                     LARCH
                              (witheringly)
                         Chocolates. How *thoughtful*.

               Larch picks up Curly and carries him toward the boys' 
               division.

                                     CURLY
                         I'm the best! *Tell* them!

                                     LARCH
                         You're the best, Curly.

               INT. LARCH'S OFFICE - DAY

               Homer is seated in the desk chair. The impressive couple sit 
               in front of him.

                                     HOMER
                         So, Mrs...

                                     CANDY
                         Candy. Candy Kendall.

               Wally jumps up to his feet to shake Homer's hand.

                                     WALLY
                         Wally. Wally Worthington.

               Wally sits down. The three sit still for an awkward moment.

                                     HOMER
                              (to Candy)
                         How many months are you?

                                     CANDY
                              (whispers)
                         Two.

               Homer writes on a piece of paper. Candy and Wally exchange a 
               worried look.

                                     WALLY
                         So, now, uh... you're not... I mean, 
                         do *you* do the--

                                     HOMER
                         No. Dr. Larch will be performing the 
                         procedure.

                                     WALLY
                              (relieved)
                         Ah, well... okay. Good! I just 
                         wondered...

               Edna pokes her head in the door.

                                     EDNA
                         Excuse me, Homer. Dr. Larch said 
                         this one is your turn.

               Edna quickly sees that all three of them have misunderstood 
               her.

                                     EDNA
                         Oh, dear--I'm sorry. I meant the 
                         circumcision. That boy you delivered 
                         on Tuesday...

                                     HOMER
                         Sure. Fine. Have you prepped him?

                                     EDNA
                         I'll get started.

               Candy and Wally can't conceal how impressed they are with 
               the young Homer.

               INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

               Homer walks down the corridor, dressed in his operating gown, 
               as the door to the O.R. opens and Wally stumbles out, 
               hurriedly opening a window. Wally breathes deeply to regain 
               his composure.

                                     WALLY
                         I think it was the ether--the smell 
                         got to me.
                              (pause)
                         God. This is all my fault.

               Edna comes down the hall with a dirt-stained, crying Curly 
               who's covering one eye.

                                     EDNA
                              (over the din)
                         Steerforth got into the pantry--he's 
                         eaten all the pie dough.

                                     CURLY
                              (sobbing)
                         He wasn't sharing it, either.

                                     EDNA
                         He's down the hall, throwing up.

               Homer nods to Edna, who is marching off with Curly. Wally 
               smiles at Homer.

                                     HOMER
                         What kind of plane are you flying?

                                     WALLY
                         A B-24 Liberator.

                                     HOMER
                         Liberator...

                                     WALLY
                         Have you enlisted?

                                     HOMER
                         They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV--
                         I've got a heart defect.

                                     WALLY
                         Really! Is it serious?

                                     HOMER
                         No, it's not serious. I'm just not 
                         supposed to get excited. You know--
                         no strain, no stress. I try to keep 
                         calm all the time.

               Wally hears Homer's facetiousness--how tired he is of his 
               heart condition.

                                     WALLY
                         Oh, well. I don't imagine there's 
                         any strain or stress around *here*!

               Homer appreciates the joke.

               The door to the operating room that Wally exited opens into 
               the corridor; Candy is being wheeled out on a gurney by Larch 
               and Angela. Wally rushes to Candy's side. Homer follows 
               slowly. Candy is groggy, coming out of the ether.

                                     WALLY
                         How is she doing?

                                     LARCH
                         Just fine.

                                     CANDY
                              (slurred speech)
                         Boy or girl?

                                     ANGELA
                         It was nothing--it's all over.

                                     WALLY
                         It's all over, honey.

               They walk Candy on her gurney. Homer looks after them.

                                     CANDY
                              (slurred speech)
                         I would like to have a baby, one 
                         day. I really would.

                                     ANGELA
                         Why, of course--you can have as many 
                         children as you want. I'm sure you'll 
                         have very beautiful children.

               Larch wheels Candy behind a curtain.

                                     LARCH
                         You'll have Princes of Maine! You'll 
                         have Kings of New England!

               Larch has a different tone of voice when he speaks to Wally.

                                     LARCH
                         I suggest you find yourself some 
                         fresh air, Lieutenant.

               Wally is left alone in the corridor.

               INT. BOYS' DIVISION - DAY

               Cranked at three-quarters, Fuzzy sits in bed, wheezing and 
               coughing. He's drawing with great intensity, using crayons 
               on a piece of paper held by a clipboard. Homer sits on the 
               end of Fuzzy's bed, cleaning up Steerforth. Homer pauses to 
               look out of the window; he sees Wally, dashing and spotless 
               in his uniform beside his flashy car. A life Homer might 
               have had crosses his face.

                                     FUZZY (O.S.)
                         Homer, when is Halloween?

               Homer turns to Fuzzy, who holds up his picture--a big pumpkin 
               with a jack-o-lantern face.

                                     HOMER
                              (distracted)
                         Uh... it's the end of October.

                                     FUZZY
                         Is that soon?

               Homer looks at Fuzzy; his little body is working hard just 
               to breathe.

                                     STEERFORTH
                         That's a few months away, Fuzz.
                              (to Homer)
                         I still don't feel so good.

                                     FUZZY
                              (disappointed)
                         Oh. It's the best time! How come we 
                         only get pumpkins once a year?

               Fuzzy coughs and coughs.

                                     HOMER
                         Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.

                                     FUZZY
                         Why can't we have pumpkins for 
                         Christmas, too? We don't get any 
                         good presents at Christmas, anyway.

               Homer looks out the window at Wally again. His decision forms.

               EXT. ORPHANAGE DRIVEWAY - DAY

               Homer approaches the flashy car, where Wally is still pacing.

                                     HOMER
                         Has anyone offered you anything to 
                         eat?

                                     WALLY
                         Actually, someone did. I just didn't 
                         think I could eat anything.

               An awkward silence, which Homer covers by examining the car.

                                     HOMER
                              (trying to sound casual)
                         I wonder if you might give me a ride.

                                     WALLY
                         Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?

                                     HOMER
                              (unprepared)
                         Where are you going?

                                     WALLY
                         We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.

               Homer nods, but he has no idea where Cape Kenneth is.

                                     HOMER
                         Cape Kenneth...

               Wally nods.

                                     HOMER
                         That sounds fine.

               INT. STAIRWAY/CORRIDOR - DAY

               Homer runs up the stairs, two steps at a time; he races into 
               a corridor at full speed, exhilarated. Suddenly Dr. Larch 
               appears in front of him. Homer stops abruptly, out of breath, 
               unable to speak.

               INT. LARCH'S OFFICE - DAY

               As Homer stands guiltily, Larch rifles through an X-ray file, 
               holding various X rays up to the lit screen. He quickly finds 
               the one he's looking for, attaching it briefly to the screen 
               for a confirming look--a heart X ray, which Larch waves at 
               Homer as he talks.

                                     LARCH
                              (sarcastic)
                         Doubtless you'll let me know what 
                         immensely worthwhile or at least 
                         *useful* thing it is that you find 
                         to do.

                                     HOMER
                              (restrained)
                         I wasn't intending to leave here in 
                         order to be entirely useless--I expect 
                         I'll find some ways to be of use.

                                     LARCH
                         In other parts of the world, I suppose 
                         there are other ways.

                                     HOMER
                              (still restrained)
                         Of course.

                                     LARCH
                              (blows up)
                         Are you really so *stupid* that you 
                         imagine you're going to find a more 
                         gratifying life? What you're going 
                         to find is people like the poor people 
                         who get left here--only nobody takes 
                         care of them as well! And you won't 
                         be able to take care of them, either. 
                         There's no taking care of *anybody*--
                         not out there!

                                     HOMER
                              (feeling trapped)
                         You know I'm grateful for everything 
                         you've done for me...

                                     LARCH
                              (calmly)
                         I don't need your gratitude.

               Larch hands Homer the heart X ray.

                                     HOMER
                              (exasperated)
                         I don't need this--I know all about 
                         my condition.

                                     LARCH
                         It's your heart--you ought to take 
                         it with you.

               Camera closes on Homer with the X ray.

               INT. KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON

               Buster and Mary Agnes are serving the evening meal while 
               Larch rails at Angela and Edna, who are helping Buster and 
               Mary Agnes. The sound of children in the dining hall is 
               intermittent and chaotic.

                                     EDNA
                         Going where? Does he have a plan of 
                         some kind?

                                     ANGELA
                         Will he be back soon?

                                     LARCH
                         I don't know! He's just leaving--
                              (to Angela)
                         you're the one who says he needs to 
                         see the world!
                              (to Edna)
                         *That's* what he'll do--he'll see 
                         the world!

                                     EDNA
                              (stunned)
                         He's leaving...

                                     ANGELA
                         He'll need clothes... some money...

                                     LARCH
                         Let him try to *make* some money! 
                         That's part of "seeing the world," 
                         isn't it?

                                     ANGELA
                              (angrily)
                         Oh, just stop it! You knew this was 
                         going to happen. He's a young man.

                                     LARCH
                              (almost breaking)
                         He's still a boy--out in the world, 
                         he's still a boy.

                                     ANGELA
                         Just find him some clothes, Wilbur. 
                         He could use some clothes.

               Camera closes on Larch, fighting tears.

               INT. BOYS' DIVISION - AFTERNOON

               Homer is packing his things--we see the heart X ray, and 
               some photos of Larch and Edna and Angela.

               Larch approaches Homer with a small bundle of clothes.

                                     LARCH
                              (gently, almost 
                              reverently)
                         I think these will fit you.

               Homer is grateful and ashamed. Before he can speak, Edna is 
               there--a wad of bills in her hand. She tries to put the money 
               in his pocket; when he refuses it, she simply puts the money 
               in his open suitcase, stuffing the bills under his clothes.

                                     EDNA
                         You'll need some money--just a little 
                         something, until you find a job.

               Larch and Edna retreat from him, humbly, as if they were his 
               servants.

               EXT. DRIVEWAY - AFTERNOON

               As Homer puts his stuff in the truck of Wally's car, Angela 
               can't resist touching his face. She is too upset to speak.

               From a window, Larch is watching the departure. He sees Homer 
               saying goodbye to the children, embracing them.

               From another window, Fuzzy just stares. (Of course he's 
               coughing.)

               We see Wally carrying Candy to the car.

                                     CANDY
                              (groggy)
                         I'm okay--I can walk.

                                     WALLY
                         I don't want you to walk--I want to 
                         carry you. Should I put the top up? 
                         It might get cold.

                                     CANDY
                         No--keep it down. I want to feel the 
                         air.

               She speaks to Homer, touching his sleeve, like a sleepy 
               person, as Wally puts her gently in the backseat.

                                     CANDY
                              (still groggy)
                         Coming with us? It's always a good 
                         idea to have a doctor along for the 
                         ride.

               Homer gets in the passenger seat beside Wally, who starts 
               the car; suddenly there is Curly. Homer can't look at Curly, 
               who looks betrayed. Edna picks up Curly and carries him to 
               the passenger-side window. Curly is sobbing.

                                     HOMER
                         I have to go, Curly. I'm sorry.
                              (to Edna)
                         I couldn't find Buster. Will you 
                         tell him...

               He can't finish what he has to say. Edna kisses him good-
               bye.

               From the window, Larch watches the car leave.

               Buster, whittling a stick, isn't watching.

               INT./EXT. WALLY'S CAR - ON THE ROAD - AFTERNOON

               There is quiet as the journey gets underway. Wally keeps 
               glancing at Candy in the rear-view mirror; she seems distant, 
               lost in thought. Homer is taking everything in--the speed, 
               the road, the wind in his face.

               INT. BOYS' DIVISION - NIGHT

               Angela speaks to the boys.

                                     ANGELA
                         Let us be happy for Homer Wells...

               INT. GIRLS' DIVISION - NIGHT

               In the girls' washroom, in front of the mirror by the row of 
               sinks, Mary Agnes is repeatedly slapping her face. Angela's 
               benediction to the boys plays Over this scene of violent 
               self-abuse. Except for the sound of the slaps. Mary Agnes 
               doesn't make a sound.

                                     ANGELA (O.S.)
                         Homer Wells has found a family. Good 
                         night, Homer!

                                     ALL THE BOYS (O.S.)
                         Good night, Homer!

               INT. DISPENSARY - NIGHT

               On his bed, Larch is taking ether. We hear the refrain from 
               the boys in the bunk room Over.

                                     ALL THE BOYS (O.S.)
                         Good night, Homer! Good night, Homer! 
                         Good night, Homer Wells!

               INT. WALLY'S CAR - NIGHT

               The radio is playing. Candy is lying down, her knees drawn 
               up, in the backseat; she appears to be asleep, oblivious to 
               Homer and Wally's conversation.

                                     WALLY
                         Actually, the Army has given me leave 
                         twice. First when my father died, 
                         and now I'm on leave to help my mother--
                         I'm just trying to get her ready for 
                         the harvest. She's no farmer. Apples 
                         were my dad's business. And with the 
                         war on, she's short on pickers.

               Candy's eyes are open but her voice is groggy.

                                     CANDY
                              (to Homer)
                         Wally thinks apples are boring.

                                     WALLY
                              (to Homer)
                         I never said they were boring.

                                     CANDY
                         You said, "Apples aren't exactly 
                         flying."

                                     WALLY
                         Well, they aren't.

               Homer looks back at Candy. Her eyes close.

                                     HOMER
                         I think I'd probably like the apple 
                         business.

                                     WALLY
                         You're a little overqualified, aren't 
                         you?

                                     HOMER
                         No, I'm not. I need a job.

                                     WALLY
                         The only jobs are picking jobs. 
                         Picking apples is truly boring.

               Candy's eyes snap open and she sits up a little.

                                     CANDY
                         There! You said it was boring.

                                     WALLY
                         Well, *picking* them is! It's about 
                         as exciting as... walking!

               Candy seems irritated with Wally. Homer tries to engage her.

                                     HOMER
                         Is your family in the apple business, 
                         too?

                                     CANDY
                         No, but I work there--I like it. My 
                         dad's a lobsterman.

                                     HOMER
                         I've never seen a lobster.

                                     CANDY
                         Really?

                                     HOMER
                         I've never seen the ocean, either.

                                     WALLY
                              (amazed)
                         You've never seen the *ocean*?

               Homer shakes his head, smiles.

                                     WALLY
                         That's not funny... that's *serious*.

               EXT./INT. ROADSIDE/CAR - NIGHT

               The car is parked at the side of the road. Wally is half-
               hidden behind a tree. Candy and Homer are left alone in the 
               car; there's an awkward silence as Homer pretends not to 
               hear Wally's excessive peeing. Suddenly Candy starts to sob.

                                     CANDY
                         I couldn't have a baby with someone 
                         who's leaving me--I didn't know what 
                         else to do!

               Homer is a doctor--he's used to postabortion reactions.

                                     HOMER
                         I know.

                                     CANDY
                         He's going to be dropping bombs on 
                         Mandalay! They're going to be shooting 
                         at him!

                                     HOMER
                         Where's Mandalay?

                                     CANDY
                         Burma!

                                     HOMER
                         Oh...

                                     CANDY
                         I can't have a baby alone. I don't 
                         even know if he's coming back!

                                     HOMER
                         I understand.

               He doesn't, really. Wally returns. Wally leans over Candy to 
               hug her.

                                     WALLY
                         Honey, honey... of course I'll come 
                         back.

               Candy pounds on his chest with her fists.

                                     CANDY
                         You don't *know*, Wally. You have no 
                         *idea*!

               Wally backs away. Candy sobs uncontrollably.

                                     CANDY
                         Stay away from me!

               Wally signals to Homer to get out of the car.

               Later, Wally and Homer stand outside the car, overhearing 
               Candy's weeping. Homer is smoking nervously.

                                     HOMER
                              (strictly medical)
                         This is all normal. Don't worry. The 
                         abortion procedure... it affects 
                         you. It's the ether, too. It'll take 
                         a little time.

                                     WALLY
                         I don't *have* any time. There's a 
                         *war*!

                                     HOMER
                         It's all very normal.

               Wally looks at Homer, who takes a nervous drag on his 
               cigarette.

                                     WALLY
                         You ought to cut that shit out--it's 
                         terrible for you.

               Homer looks at Wally; he sees the authority in his eyes. 
               Homer drops his cigarette and puts it out with his foot.

               They notice that Candy has stopped crying. Wally finds Candy 
               asleep in the backseat.

               EXT. WALLY'S CAR - ON THE ROAD - LATE AT NIGHT

               The lone car on the road. Snatches of war news from the radio 
               are the only sound as the headlights illuminate the dark 
               highway.

               EXT. COAST OF MAINE - MORNING

               The car is parked, with Homer sleeping in it alone. The sounds 
               of the ocean increase as Homer opens his eyes. Homer gets 
               out of the car and walks toward the beach, enchanted. There 
               it is: his first view ever of an ocean, the horizon, the sun 
               glimmering on the water. Candy is lying on a blanket in the 
               sand. Wally is throwing rocks in the water. Homer takes it 
               all in. When Candy calls for him, Homer walks up to her.

                                     CANDY
                         I'm a little worried about the...
                              (she gestures below 
                              her waist)
                         ...about how much bleeding is okay.

                                     HOMER
                         It should taper off tomorrow, but it 
                         can come back again. You have cramps?
                              (Candy nods)
                         They'll ease up, almost entirely. As 
                         long as the bleeding isn't heavy, 
                         it's normal.

                                     WALLY (O.S.)
                         Catch!

               A football comes flying through the air toward Homer; it 
               bounces off his chest. Wally laughs.

                                     WALLY
                              (meaning the football)
                         Give it here!

               Homer throws the football; it's clear he's never thrown one 
               before.

                                     WALLY
                         What was *that*?! Come over here!

               Homer runs over to Wally, who proceeds to show him how to 
               pass the ball. Snatches of his instruction drift to Candy, 
               who closes her eyes. "Put your fingers on the laces--no, it 
               rests in your palm, like this! You want the laces up--yes, 
               like that!"

               EXT. COAST OF MAINE - DAY (LATER)

               Homer and Wally sit on the beach a short distance from Candy's 
               blanket. She appears to be asleep. Wally looks in her 
               direction before he speaks to Homer.

                                     WALLY
                         It's called the Burma run. It's about 
                         a seven-hour round-trip flight between 
                         India and China.

               Wally draws a crude map in the sand.

                                     HOMER
                         "Burma run" because you fly over 
                         Burma...

                                     WALLY
                         *And* over the Himalayas. That's 
                         called flying over the hump.

               On Candy's face: she's not asleep; she's listening.

                                     HOMER (O.S.)
                         At what altitude?

                                     WALLY
                         I've got thirty-five minutes to climb 
                         to fifteen thousand feet--that's the 
                         first mountain pass.

               Homer looks at Wally, thoughtfully.

                                     HOMER
                         What lousy luck--I mean your orders... 
                         to draw an assignment like that!

                                     WALLY
                              (conspiratorially)
                         Actually, I volunteered.

               Homer is shocked; he looks back at Candy, lowers his voice.

                                     HOMER
                         It's the flying, right? You love to 
                         fly, don't you?

               Wally nods; he also gives a look in Candy's direction before 
               he responds.

                                     WALLY
                         I love the bombing, too. But there's 
                         also the Himalayas--they have the 
                         most wicked air currents in the world. 
                         I wouldn't miss flying there for 
                         anything.

               Homer's smile suggests that he's impressed, but that he 
               wouldn't have Wally's enthusiasm for the task. Wally laughs 
               and puts his hand on Homer's shoulder.

                                     WALLY
                         Uh, look... if you're serious about 
                         wanting a job, picking apples isn't 
                         that boring.

                                     HOMER
                         Oh, I would love that, Wally.

               EXT. CAPE KENNETH - LOBSTER POUND - AFTERNOON

               The car is parked at a lobster pound. Homer sits in the car 
               watching Wally carrying Candy's bag to the door. Candy stands 
               outside the car; she shakes Homer's hand.

                                     CANDY
                         I guess I'll see you around the 
                         orchards. Thanks for everything.

                                     HOMER
                         Sure... I'll see you around.

               Candy turns and heads toward the house to catch up with Wally. 
               A lobsterman in his boat is approaching the dock. It's RAY, 
               Candy's father. Candy waves. "Hi, Daddy!" Homer glances at 
               Candy and Wally on the dock, kissing good-bye.

                                     CANDY
                              (whispering)
                         I love you, Wally.

                                     WALLY
                         I love you, too. See you tomorrow.

               EXT. OCEAN VIEW - WORTHINGTON HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

               Wally drives up to the Worthington house; he gets out of the 
               car. Homer sits in the car, admiring the beautiful farmhouse.

                                     WALLY
                         Come on. You have to meet my mom.
                              (conspiratorially)
                         If it comes up, I've been at a 
                         wedding. That's where I met you, at 
                         the wedding.

               INT. WORTHINGTON HOUSE - WALLY'S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

               Homer as never seen such a room: the sports trophies, the 
               photos of athletic teams, and of Candy with Wally. Model 
               airplanes are everywhere. Mrs. Worthington's voice comes 
               from the hall.

                                     OLIVE (O.S.)
                         Wally? I expected you earlier...

               She appears in the doorway of Wally's room. Mrs. Worthington 
               (OLIVE) is an elegant, fiftyish New Englander, as handsome 
               as Wally, but more reserved. She is surprised to see Homer.

                                     WALLY
                         This is Homer Wells--he's the most 
                         overqualified apple picker you'll 
                         ever meet, but he's dying to learn 
                         the apple business.

               Wally is taking his uniform off as he speaks, just dropping 
               it on the floor as he quickly puts on some farm clothes.

                                     OLIVE
                         How do you do, Homer Wells...

               Homer has never met anyone like her.

                                     HOMER
                         How do you do...

               Mrs. Worthington starts picking up her son's uniform from 
               the floor. She is politely curious about Homer.

                                     OLIVE
                         Were you a friend of the bride or 
                         the groom?

               Homer looks confused; he seems to have forgotten about the 
               alleged wedding. Wally puts his arm around Homer, urging him 
               into the hall.

                                     WALLY
                         Homer is everybody's friend, Mom... 
                         the bride's, the groom's, mine, 
                         Candy's, *everybody's*.

               Homer is embarrassed, but Olive is obdurately well-mannered.

                                     OLIVE
                         Well, perhaps you'll come to dinner, 
                         Homer...

               Wally calls to her as he pushes Homer down the hall.

                                     WALLY
                         Not tonight, Mom--he's got to meet 
                         *Mr. Rose*!

               EXT. CIDER HOUSE - DUSK

               Homer and Wally get out of the jeep at the cider house, a 
               barnlike building with adjacent sheds and, behind it, line 
               after line of trees--the apple orchards.

               Homer sees an outdoor shower where THREE BLACK MEN are 
               showering. It is a wooden stall that leaves the shower's 
               occupants visible above and below their midsections. A FOURTH 
               BLACK MAN is caught naked, running behind the cider house 
               and out of sight as he wraps a towel around himself.

                                     JACK
                         You already used up the hot water!

                                     MUDDY
                         You're usin' my soap, ain't you?

                                     JACK
                         I ain't usin' no soap--it's too cold 
                         to bother with soap!

                                     MUDDY
                         There ain't never enough hot water, 
                         soap or no soap.

                                     WALLY
                         They're migrants.

                                     HOMER
                              (no clue)
                         Migrants?

                                     WALLY
                         Yes. They pick fruit, all kinds. 
                         They travel up and down the coast 
                         with the seasons.
                              (leaning close to 
                              Homer)
                         The trick to Mr. Rose is, you have 
                         to let him be the boss.

               Homer wonders what that means as Wally reaches for the door 
               of the cider house. Before Wally can knock, a pretty young 
               black girl, ROSE ROSE, bumps open the screen door with her 
               hip and throws a bucket of water in the grass--almost hitting 
               Homer and Wally.

                                     ROSE ROSE
                         That sink's backed up again, Wally. 
                         I thought you was gonna get me a 
                         plumber.

                                     WALLY
                         Rose, this is Homer--Homer, this is 
                         Mr. Rose's daughter, Rose.

                                     HOMER
                         Rose Rose?

                                     ROSE ROSE
                         Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?

                                     WALLY
                         No, no--Homer is a new *picker*. 
                         He's going to stay here with you.

               This gets the attention of the men on their way from the 
               showers. They walk over, towels around their waists.

                                     ROSE ROSE
                              (suspiciously)
                         He's stayin' *here*?

               The screen door swings open and shut again, startling them 
               all, as MR. ROSE comes out of the cider house.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         That daughter of mine sure is Miss 
                         Hospitality, ain't she, Wally?

               Grinning, Mr. Rose shakes Wally's hand. Rose Rose goes back 
               inside the cider house as Mr. Rose shakes Homer's hand. Homer 
               introduces himself.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         You got lots of experience pickin', 
                         I suppose.

                                     WALLY
                         Homer's got no experience, Arthur, 
                         but he's smarter then I am. He's a 
                         fast learner.

               Mr. Rose looks briefly at the men, who wait for his reaction.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         This is history. Ain't that what 
                         you're sayin', Wally? I guess we 
                         makin' *history*... havin' this young 
                         man stay with us!

               Wally slaps Homer on the back; he goes inside the cider house 
               to help Rose Rose with the plumbing.

                                     WALLY
                              (over his shoulder)
                         See you later.

               Homer looks at Mr. Rose for instructions. Mr. Rose stares 
               back at him with his enigmatic smile.

                                     HOMER
                         So. What should I do now?

                                     MR. ROSE
                         Out back, there's a shed. It's just 
                         a mess. If that shed was better 
                         organized, I could put my truck in 
                         there.

               Homer looks at Mr. Rose with an uncomprehending expression.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         If you're as smart as Wally says, 
                         you know you sometimes gotta do one 
                         job before you do another.

               Homer thinks that over.

               Later, Homer is cleaning out the shed.

               EXT. CIDER HOUSE - EVENING

               The pickers all sit down to supper around a picnic table. 
               Homer with Mr. Rose, Rose Rose, and the other black pickers. 
               Mr. Rose takes an apple from a bowl on the table. Then he 
               pulls out a knife and opens it in one fluid motion; he's so 
               fast, the knife seems to come out of nowhere. He begins to 
               peel the apple. Homer eyes Mr. Rose, but Mr. Rose's focus is 
               riveted to his apple and the long, perfect strand of peel 
               dangling from it.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         You did a good job with that shed, 
                         Homer.

               Peaches breaks the awkward silence.

                                     PEACHES
                         What kind of a name is Homer?

                                     HOMER
                         It's the name of a cat. Originally. 
                         Well, not *originally*.

               Homer decides to stop. Another silence.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         Now, now--we all got names, sensible 
                         or not.
                              (to Homer)
                         Peaches is from Georgia, where we 
                         met him pickin' peaches. He's still 
                         better with peaches than hs is with 
                         apples.
                              (Peaches grins)
                         Jack here is new. And this here is 
                         Hero, 'cause he was a hero of some 
                         kind or other once. Ain't that right, 
                         Hero?

               There are some disrespectful suggestions from the pickers 
               concerning what his heroism might have been.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         And this here sensitive-lookin' fella 
                         is Muddy. The less said about Muddy, 
                         the better. Ain't that right, Muddy?

               Muddy scowls at Homer, but he smiles at Mr. Rose.

               INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT

               Homer unpacks his suitcase. (His bed should be nearest Muddy's 
               and Mr. Rose's.) Jack lies on his bed, smoking. Muddy, also 
               smoking, is sitting on his bed, sharpening a knife. Hero and 
               Peaches are playing cards on one of their beds. Mr. Rose is 
               finishing shaving. Rose Rose watches Homer unpack.

                                     ROSE ROSE
                         What's that?

                                     HOMER
                         It's just my heart.

                                     ROSE ROSE
                         What you got a picture of your heart 
                         for?

               He holds up the X ray, in order to show her.

                                     HOMER
                         There's a little something wrong 
                         with it. Just this part here--the 
                         right ventricle. It's slightly 
                         enlarged.

                                     ROSE ROSE
                         So what?

                                     HOMER
                         Yes, so what. It's nothing serious, 
                         really. Just a small defect.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         It's big enough to keep you out of 
                         the war, I suppose. Ain't that right?

                                     HOMER
                         Right.

               Rose Rose picks up the book that Homer has put on the bed. 
               She studies the cover; it's "Great Expectations" by Charles 
               Dickens. She puts it down, restlessly.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         They told me I was too old to serve.

                                     PEACHES
                         They told Muddy his feet was too 
                         flat!

               Everybody laughs, except Muddy.

                                     MUDDY
                              (to Peaches)
                         And you was "generally unfit," as I 
                         recall.

               Finished unpacking, Homer sits on his bed; he picks up "Great 
               Expectations" and begins to read. Rose Rose sits down next 
               to him, watching him read. Homer notices her interest.

                                     HOMER
                         Do you like to read?

                                     ROSE ROSE
                              (embarrassed)
                         I can't read. Nobody taught me.

               Homer smiles politely and goes back to his book. Rose Rose 
               keeps looking over his shoulder at the pages.

                                     ROSE ROSE
                              (pointing to the page)
                         What does it say there?

               Homer looks around at the pickers lying in their beds, 
               smoking, listening. (Like bedtime stories at the orphanage, 
               he thinks; however, the picker's attitude is suspicious, 
               reserved.)

                                     HOMER
                              (reading)
                         "I looked at the stars, and considered 
                         how awful it would be for a man to 
                         turn his face to them as he froze to 
                         death, and see no help or pity in 
                         all the glittering multitude."

               Homer looks up; there's no response.

                                     HOMER
                              (to Rose Rose)
                         More?

               Some muttering, some giggling, mostly silence. Rose Rose 
               wants more, but suddenly Jack jumps out of bed and stomps to 
               the kitchen end of the cider house, where a piece of paper 
               is tacked to the wall. Jack is talking to Homer all the way.

                                     JACK
                         Since you're the one who's smart 
                         enough to read... what's this?

               Jack points at the piece of paper. Homer gets up and looks 
               at it.

                                     HOMER
                         It's a list of rules, it seems.

               All the men groan--Jack swears and Peaches laughs.

                                     ROSE ROSE
                         *Whose* rules?

                                     MUDDY
                         They're for us, I suppose.

                                     JACK
                         Go on and read 'em, Homer.

                                     HOMER
                         "One. Please don't smoke in bed."

                                     ROSE ROSE
                         It's too late for that one!

               All the smokers laugh and cough in their beds.

                                     MR. ROSE
                              (uncharacteristically 
                              blunt)
                         Stop it, Homer. They aren't our rules. 
                         We didn't write them. I don't see no 
                         reason to read them.

                                     HOMER
                         Okay...

               Rose Rose stomps back to her bed. Her father absently snaps 
               his towel.

               INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT (LATER)

               Everybody is asleep, except Homer. He is staring at the 
               ceiling in the quiet semi-darkness, the book lying on his 
               chest.

                                     LARCH (O.S.)
                              (distant echoing)
                         Good night, you Princes of Maine! 
                         You Kings of New England.

               INT. BOYS' DIVISION - NIGHT

               Dr. Larch is standing in the doorway to the boys' room; he 
               closes the door.

               INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT

               Homer, on his bed, closes his eyes.

               INT. DISPENSARY - NIGHT

               Larch lies in bed with his eyes open. (No ether.)

               EXT. CIDER HOUSE - NIGHT

               The cider house and the apple orchard in the moonlight.

               EXT. ORCHARDS - MORNING

               Wally in his farm clothes at the wheel of the Jeep--he is 
               racing through the orchards, dodging trees, with Homer in 
               the passenger seat, hanging on for dear life.

                                     WALLY
                         Remember this! In the morning, when 
                         the tall grass is wet, you can make 
                         the Jeep slide on the grass. Can you 
                         feel it?

               Homer is excited as Wally weaves among the trees--faster and 
               faster.

                                     WALLY
                         It's almost like flying.

                                     HOMER
                         What about the trees?

                                     WALLY
                         The trees are flak--antiaircraft 
                         fire from those geeks on the ground.

               Wally brakes hard. The Jeep comes to a stop in the packing-
               house area.

               Candy has been waiting on the loading platform. The pickers 
               are working in the background.

                                     WALLY
                              (defensively to Candy)
                         I was just showing Homer the 
                         orchards... kind of a geography 
                         lesson.

                                     CANDY
                              (good-naturedly)
                         I know what you've been doing.

               She pulls an apple branch, with an apple to two, out of the 
               vehicle's grille--or else the branch is wedged in the front -
               bumper or headlight area. Candy playfully starts poking Wally 
               with the branch.

                                     CANDY
                              (to Wally)
                         You've been giving him a *flying* 
                         lesson!

                                     WALLY
                              (teasing her)
                         He *loved* it!
                              (to Homer)
                         Didn't you?

                                     HOMER
                         Yeah, it was great.

               Wally gets the apple branch away from Candy. He pins her 
               arms at her sides--he hugs her, kisses her. She doesn't 
               struggle.

                                     CANDY
                              (laughing to Homer)
                         He thinks people *like* to get whacked 
                         by branches.

                                     WALLY
                         *Homer* liked it!
                              (to Homer)
                         Didn't you?

                                     HOMER
                         Yeah, sure. There's no stress or 
                         strain around here...

               They all laugh. Homer observes the happy couple.

               EXT. ORCHARDS - DAY

               Homer is walking with Wally and Candy. The orchards are 
               beautiful.

               EXT. PACKING HOUSE - MORNING

               Much activity: the pickers are unloading apple crates from a 
               full flatbed trailer. An angry-looking VERNON gives Homer an 
               evil glare. Homer spills some apples lifting the crate to 
               the loading platform.

                                     VERNON
                         What's wrong with you?

               Mr. Rose takes Homer aside.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         That's Vernon. You best stay away 
                         from him until he gets to know you 
                         better--then you best stay away from 
                         him *more*!

               Wally, in full uniform, appears from inside the packing house; 
               he calls for Homer.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         Out lieutenant's calling you, Homer. 
                         Mind your ass.

               Homer smiles are runs toward Wally.

               INT./EXT. PACKING HOUSE - MORNING

               Homer and Wally walk through the packing house, where the 
               HEFTY, LOUD WOMEN sort through the apples rolling by on the 
               conveyor tracks. Wally snatches an apple from one of them, 
               giving it to Homer.

                                     WALLY
                              (to Homer)
                         You getting along okay?

               Before Homer can answer, the women interrupt.

                                     BIG DOT
                         Where is that Candy?

                                     FLORENCE
                         Did she leave you, Wally?

                                     DEBRA
                         Who's the boy?

               Wally makes an effort to introduce Homer, but he's 
               interrupted.

                                     FLORENCE
                         Wally, you can marry Debra if Candy 
                         leaves you!

                                     BIG DOT
                         Wally's gonna marry *me* if Candy 
                         leaves him!

                                     DEBRA
                         You can marry all three of us, Wally!

                                     FLORENCE
                         We can take turns.

               Wally puts his hand to his heart.

                                     WALLY
                         You girls make it hard for a guy to 
                         go off to war.
                              (points to Homer)
                         But I'll leave my best man here to 
                         pinch-hit for me.

               As the women are left behind giggling, Wally continues talking 
               to Homer.

                                     WALLY
                         Uh... I'm shipping out sooner than I 
                         thought. I just wanted to be sure 
                         you were settled in--and happy enough, 
                         considering...
                              (grabbing another 
                              apple from a crate)
                         Are you bored stiff? Or can you stick 
                         it out for a bit?

                                     HOMER
                         Uh... actually, picking apples is as 
                         much excitement as I want for a while. 
                         I'm grateful for the job.

                                     WALLY
                              (his hand on Homer's 
                              shoulder)
                         You're the one who's helping *me*, 
                         Homer. You're going to give my mom a 
                         little peace of mind while I'm gone. 
                         Candy, too.

                                     HOMER
                         Well, sure... that's good, then.
                              (awkward pause)
                         All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.

                                     WALLY
                         I don't think so, Homer. *I'm* the 
                         lucky one.

               Homer shakes his head. Wally stops walking; they both stop.

                                     WALLY
                              (more serious)
                         You want to fight about it?

               Homer is unfamiliar with this kind of kidding around; at 
               first he is startled, but then he laughs. Wally laughs, too. 
               They shake hands.

               Mr. Rose calls out to Homer from the tractor. The pickers 
               are impatiently waiting for him on the flatbed; they're going 
               back to the orchard. Homer has to run to catch up to them. 
               He jumps on the flatbed; he sees Wally waving good-bye.

               EXT. ORCHARDS - DAY

               High up in a tall tree on a couple of ladders, Mr. Rose and 
               Homer are picking side by side. Mr. Rose is picking with 
               high-speed perfection, but Homer is slower and fumbling--he 
               drops an occasional apple to the ground.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         You pickin' more cider apples then 
                         anythin' else. Them drops is good 
                         only for cider. And you pickin' the 
                         stems with the apples only half the 
                         time. They good only for cider, too--
                         if you don't pick them stems.
                              (Homer watches him)
                         The rule is, you wanna pick the apple 
                         *with* the stem, Homer. And see 
                         here... see that *bud* that's just 
                         above the stem? That's the bud for 
                         *next year's* apple--that's called 
                         the *spur*. You pick the spur, you 
                         pickin' two years in one--you pickin' 
                         next year's apple 'fore it have a 
                         chance to grow. You leave that on 
                         the branch, you hear?

               Homer nods; he picks more carefully, with more concentration.

                                     MR. ROSE
                              (approvingly)
                         That's better. I can tell you got 
                         yourself some education. Them's good 
                         hands you got, Homer. Them hands you 
                         got, they know what they're doin'--
                         ain't that right?

                                     HOMER
                         I guess so...

               Homer can see over the apple mart parking lot from the top 
               of the tree. He can see the driveway of the Worthington house, 
               where Candy and Olive are saying a tearful good-bye to Wally. 
               Distracted, Homer drops another couple of apples, which Mr. 
               Rose observes with a wry smile.

                                     ANGELA (O.S.)
                         Wilbur! Wilbur!

               Larch is doing something at his desk when Angela comes in.

                                     ANGELA
                         Wilbur, you should read this.

               Larch stares at Angela, who holds a letter.

                                     ANGELA
                         It's from the Board. Another letter.

               INT. LARCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Dr. Larch stands in front of a mechanical drawing easel. He 
               works intently with a calligraphic pen, but we don't see 
               what he's working on. Angela and Edna sit at the desk; they're 
               looking over the letter.

                                     ANGELA
                              (quoting the letter)
                         Uh... "merely suggesting that some 
                         new blood might benefit you all... 
                         someone with new ideas in the 
                         obstetrical and pediatric fields."
                              (she looks up at Larch)
                         I think they're just testing some 
                         ideas for our next meeting.

                                     EDNA
                         Dr. Holtz seems nice. I think he 
                         only wants to help...

                                     LARCH
                         He is a goddamn psychiatrist--of 
                         *course* he wants to "help"! He'd be 
                         happy if he could help *commit* me!

                                     ANGELA
                         It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to 
                         be careful of, Wilbur.

                                     LARCH
                         One has to be more than "careful" of 
                         Mrs. Goodhall--she has sufficient 
                         Christian zeal to start her own 
                         country! I'd like to give her a little 
                         ether.

                                     EDNA
                         So what are you going to do?

               Larch puts down the pen, comes around the easel, opens a 
               drawer in a filing cabinet, and hands Edna a folder containing 
               a few cleanly typed pages. Larch returns to the easel, to 
               his painstaking work. Edna opens the file; as she and Angela 
               read the contents, Larch recites from memory as he works.

                                     LARCH
                         "Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, 
                         March 2, 1915..."

                                     EDNA
                         Homer was born *here*, in, what was 
                         it, 1922?

                                     LARCH
                         "...graduated Bowdoin College, 1935, 
                         and Harvard School of Medicine, 1939."

                                     ANGELA
                         This is *your* life story, Wilbur! 
                         You just changed the dates!

                                     LARCH
                         "An internship and two years of 
                         training at the Boston Lying-in, 
                         South End Branch. For his age, he 
                         was judged an accomplished 
                         gynecological obstetrical surgeon; 
                         he is also experienced in pediatric 
                         care..."

                                     ANGELA
                         You *invented* him! You've completely 
                         made his up!

                                     LARCH
                         Don't you understand? The board is 
                         going to *replace* me! That's what 
                         the "new blood" is *for*!

                                     EDNA
                         You mean they'll replace you with 
                         someone who won't perform abortions.

                                     LARCH
                              (sarcastically)
                         Well, we can only guess about that, 
                         Edna. They *are* against the law.

                                     ANGELA
                         These *credentials* are against the 
                         law!

                                     LARCH
                         We all know who trained Homer--his 
                         credentials are as good as mine are. 
                         Don't you be holy to me about the 
                         *law*! What has the law done for any 
                         of us here?

               Edna and Angela think this over.

                                     LARCH
                              (points at file)
                         So here is my candidate. What do you 
                         think?

                                     EDNA
                         But what about school records? Homer 
                         doesn't have any *diplomas*...

               Larch turns the easel around. Attached is a parchment headed: 
               "HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL"--it's a diploma-in-progress.

                                     LARCH
                         He *will* have them, Edna.

               The women are shocked, awed.

                                     ANGELA
                         Oh, Wilbur, I don't know...
                              (sudden thought)
                         We don't even know where he is!

               EXT. CIDER HOUSE, ROOF - NIGHT

                                     ROSE ROSE (O.S.)
                         Where's that Homer?

               Homer stands in front of a ladder that leans against the 
               cider house; he starts to climb up, drawn by the murmuring 
               voices, the soft laughter.

                                     JACK (O.S.)
                         Who cares?

                                     MR. ROSE (O.S.)
                         Now, now. He's a good boy.

                                     JACK (O.S.)
                         Shit. We don't know what he is.

                                     MR. ROSE (O.S.)
                         Jack, you gotta watch your language 
                         'round my daughter.

               Homer arrives at the top and sees everyone sitting on a long 
               plank, a bench attached to the apex of the roof--obviously a 
               popular spot.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         Here he is.

               No one moves.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         Where's your manners? Make room for 
                         Homer, so's he can enjoy the view.

                                     MUDDY
                         What view?

               Peaches slides over and Homer sits down.

                                     HOMER
                         Are we supposed to be up here? The 
                         rules said...

                                     MR. ROSE
                         Homer, you the only one who's read 
                         them rules, so you the only one who 
                         feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong.

               The others laugh.

                                     MUDDY
                         *What* view?

                                     MR. ROSE
                         Well, Muddy, we can look at all these 
                         angry stars Homer's been readin' to 
                         us about.

               More laughter; Homer smiles, enjoying the teasing.

                                     JACK
                              (gesturing toward the 
                              Worthington farmhouse)
                         I bet the view looks better from the 
                         Worthin'tons'.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         You think so, Jack? Well... I wouldn't 
                         want to be in that Wally's shoes 
                         tonight.

                                     ROSE ROSE
                              (playfully, teasing 
                              him)
                         Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's 
                         shoes *every* night.

                                     MR. ROSE
                              (teasing her back)
                         You lucky you in your work boots 
                         tonight, girl...

                                     ROSE ROSE
                         What's lucky about that?

               Rose Rose is being physically affectionate with her father--
               lightly punching his arm, rubbing the top of his head.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         You know where that Wally is tonight, 
                         darlin'? He's up there in them angry 
                         stars.
                              (gesturing at the 
                              dark sky)
                         He's flyin' all around up there... 
                         with them Japs shooting at him.

               They all look up, imagining that. Homer more than the others. 
               Rose Rose, looking thoughtful, rests her head on her father's 
               shoulder. They are completely natural together.

               EXT. CAPE KENNETH - APPLE MART - DAY

               Homer and the pickers are loading crates of apples into a 
               shipping truck. Olive and Candy are consulting some papers 
               (the shipping tally) on a clipboard; Mr. Rose is standing 
               beside them.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         They all on board, Mrs. Worthin'ton.

                                     OLIVE
                         Thank you, Arthur.
                              (see is looking at 
                              Homer)
                         And how is our Homer working out?

               She catches Homer's eye; he smiles, then joins them. Mr. 
               Rose puts his arm around him.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         Oh, he's a smart young man, most of 
                         the time--Wally was right about him.

               Olive is looking over the rest of the picking crew.

                                     OLIVE
                         No rotten apples?

                                     MR. ROSE
                              (it's an old way of 
                              speaking that they 
                              have)
                         No, no--not this year. Well... maybe 
                         we got *one*, but it ain't Homer.

               He means Jack, who gives Olive and Candy and Mr. Rose a 
               furtive look. Olive smiles at Rose Rose, who comes up to her 
               and Candy. Olive touches Rose Rose with affection.

                                     OLIVE
                         Rose... dear girl, I'm sure I can 
                         find you some other clothes.
                              (to Candy)
                         You must have some things that would 
                         fit her.

               Candy takes Rose Rose by the shoulders and turns her around. 
               Rose Rose is enjoying this.

                                     CANDY
                         I have a *ton* of things that would 
                         fit you.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         Now, now, Candy--this girl don't 
                         need no more clothes, not for pickin'.

               He starts leading his daughter away.

                                     OLIVE
                              (charming)
                         Arthur, there's no such thing as a 
                         young woman who's got all the clothes 
                         she needs.

               Olive waves good-bye as she moves toward her car. Candy turns 
               to Homer.

                                     CANDY
                         So. Not bored yet?

                                     HOMER
                         I'm *never* bored! It's all very... 
                         different for me... here.

               Homer has the hardest time looking at Candy.

                                     HOMER
                         Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?

                                     CANDY
                         When I'm not thinking about Wally. 
                         I'm not good at being alone.
                              (realizing)
                         Oh, goodness. You meant... yes, I'm 
                         fine. I...
                              (struggling to change 
                              the subject)
                         ...I don't suppose you've seen a 
                         lobster yet.

               Homer shakes his head. He looks at the tractor and the empty 
               trailer. Mr. Rose and the pickers are just watching them.

                                     CANDY
                              (more seriously)
                         You have to come to my dad's lobster 
                         pound and see one, then.

                                     HOMER
                         Okay...

               Homer looks toward the pickers sitting on the flatbed when 
               he hears the tractor start. Candy follows his gaze.

                                     HOMER
                         I better go.

                                     CANDY
                         I don't think Mr. Rose would leave 
                         without you.

               Mr. Rose gestures for Muddy to drive off; the tractor trailer 
               pulls away.

                                     CANDY
                              (laughing)
                         Sorry!

               Homer has to run to catch up.

                                     CANDY
                              (calling)
                         Come next week!

               He jumps on the back of the departing flatbed between Mr. 
               Rose and Rose Rose, as Candy watches him.

               INT. BUNKHOUSE - DUSK

               An anxious-looking WHITE PLUMBER is fixing the kitchen sink 
               while the pickers (in their towels) stand around and watch.

               Homer is putting on his best shirt. Peaches admires the shirt 
               as Rose Rose cooks the night's supper on the wood stove.

                                     PEACHES
                         Whoa--look at that Homer! He's gettin' 
                         all dressed up for supper tonight!

                                     ROSE ROSE
                         He ain't gettin' dressed to have 
                         supper with *us*, Peaches!

               The pickers all look at Homer, who looks guilty as he leaves.

                                     MR. ROSE
                              (to the plumber)
                         Don't let us make you nervous or 
                         nothin'--we know you gotta job to 
                         do.

                                     MUDDY
                         Yeah, we can wait all night for the 
                         water to come back on--you just go 
                         on and take your time.

               EXT. INLAND ROAD - DUSK

               Homer pedals a bicycle down a dirt road.

               EXT. LOBSTER POUND - DUSK

               Ray holds a lobster up to the camera. We see the old-fashioned 
               wooden pens, floating dockside.

                                     RAY
                         Hungry?

               Homer looks uncertain.

               EXT. GANGPLANK, DOCK - DUSK

               Homer and Ray and Candy go up the gangplank from the dock to 
               the lobster pound.

                                     RAY
                         They're the garbage-eaters of the 
                         ocean's floor. The seagulls clean up 
                         the shore. The lobsters clean up the 
                         bottom of the sea.

                                     HOMER
                         They eat everything?

                                     RAY
                         Everything that falls to the bottom.

                                     CANDY
                         It's time somebody ate *them*.

                                     RAY
                              (to Candy)
                         I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I 
                         was gonna show it to Homer...
                              (to Homer)
                         They made him a captain already--
                         *Captain* Worthington!

                                     CANDY
                         Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.

                                     RAY
                         He mentions Homer, too, you know.

                                     CANDY
                              (awkwardly)
                         Wally said to say, "Hello."

                                     HOMER
                              (equally awkward)
                         Oh! That's... nice.

                                     RAY
                              (to Homer)
                         Wally said the most spectacular hits 
                         were in the oil fields at Yenangyat.

               Later, through the window of the lobster pound, we see them 
               eating lobster around a kitchen table. Laughter and some 
               unclear dialogue drift to us.

               EXT./INT. CAPE KENNETH/WALLY'S CAR - NIGHT

               With the bicycle stowed in the trunk, Candy is driving Homer 
               back to the cider house. They pass a drive-in movie theatre, 
               the marquee announcing "CLOSED FOR THE SEASON." Homer stares 
               in awe at the giant blank screen.

                                     HOMER
                         A movie *outside*?

                                     CANDY
                         Yes. But it's closed all the time 
                         now, because of the blackout.

                                     HOMER
                         People watched the movies in their 
                         cars?

                                     CANDY
                              (smiling)
                         When they watched at all. Do you 
                         like movies?

                                     HOMER
                         Yes! I've only seen one, though.

               Candy looks at him; he isn't joking.

                                     CANDY
                         You've seen only one movie? Which 
                         one?

                                     HOMER
                         "King Kong". It's really good.

               Candy laughs.

                                     CANDY
                         I haven't seen "King Kong" since I 
                         was a kid!

               Homer laughs a little self-consciously; around her, he feels 
               like he's *still* a kid.

               INT. DINING HALL - EARLY MORNING

               At one table, the children are happily eating apples; a few 
               of the kids are stuffing apples from a big bowl into their 
               pockets. At another table, Larch, Edna, and Angela sit around 
               an open packing crate of apples. Larch takes a bite from an 
               apple and spits it out. Angela takes the apple out of his 
               hand.

                                     ANGELA
                         That's a pie apple, Wilbur. Homer 
                         said you're not supposed to eat it!

               Angela hands him another apple.

                                     LARCH
                         So he's an apple expert, is he?

               Angela gives him a critical look as Larch takes a bite out 
               of the new apple.

                                     LARCH
                              (sarcastically)
                         Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior 
                         taste--and crisp, too! You know, so 
                         many apples are disappointingly mealy. 
                         I wonder of most of the apples in my 
                         life weren't meant for pies!

                                     ANGELA
                         Wilbur, he picked them for us 
                         himself...

                                     LARCH
                              (incredulous)
                         You don't find it depressing that 
                         Homer Wells is picking apples?

               Both Edna and Angela glower at him.

                                     LARCH
                         Or that he can't be bothered to write 
                         us a proper letter? A dissertation 
                         on apples, we don't need!

                                     EDNA
                              (annoyed)
                         He probably doesn't make much money 
                         picking apples--he must have had to 
                         pay to send them, too.

                                     LARCH
                         I wouldn't worry, Edna, that he 
                         doesn't have money. If he gets hungry, 
                         he can pick his dinner!

               Larch angrily tosses the half-eaten apple into the garbage.

                                     EDNA
                         Wilbur, it's a *gift*! How can you 
                         be angry with Homer for sending us a 
                         *gift*?

               Larch stares into space, depressed. Then he examines the 
               crate and finds the mailing label that says "OCEAN VIEW 
               ORCHARDS--CAPE KENNETH, MAINE." He rips it off, holds it up 
               triumphantly.

                                     LARCH
                         I'll show him a *gift*! I'll give 
                         him a gift he can *use*!

               Larch storms out of the room.

               INT. CAPE KENNETH - MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT

               A newsreel from the war is playing on the screen--soldiers 
               marching, smiling, waving to the camera. Homer and Candy sit 
               together watching. Homer is completely fascinated; Candy 
               watches Homer as much as the news. Her expression changes 
               when the newsreel cuts to footage from an air raid.

               EXT. CAPE KENNETH - MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT

               Candy and Homer walk out of the theatre, under the marquee 
               and past the poster for "Wuthering Heights."

                                     CANDY
                              (disappointed)
                         But you looked as if you liked it.

                                     HOMER
                              (smiling)
                         I *did* like it. All I said was, 
                         "It's not 'King Kong'."

               Candy makes a face, but in good fun.

                                     HOMER
                         First she loved him, then she didn't, 
                         then no one else could have him...

                                     CANDY
                         She *did* love him!
                              (teasing him)
                         How many women have you known?

               Homer is embarrassed; he ducks the question.

                                     HOMER
                         And what did she die of, exactly?

                                     CANDY
                         She was torn apart! She died of a 
                         broken heart.

                                     HOMER
                         Oh, sure!

               Homer smiles and shakes his head; Candy starts to laugh.

                                     HOMER
                         What's the *medical* explanation?

                                     CANDY
                         Well, she was in a weakened 
                         condition...
                              (laughs)
                         I don't know! What about "King Kong"?! 
                         Is that medically possible?

               Homer smiles; he knows she's teasing him, and he likes it.

                                     HOMER
                              (mock serious)
                         At least King Kong knew what he 
                         *wanted*.

               Candy pushes him playfully. They're both having a good time, 
               *too* good a time.

               EXT. ORCHARDS - DAY

               Homer is picking apples in a big tree; Rose Rose is on a 
               ladder in the tree right beside him. She's picking about 
               twice as fast as he is, and he keeps dropping his apples. In 
               another tree, Muddy is watching.

                                     ROSE ROSE
                         What is you *doin'* with that Candy, 
                         Homer?

                                     MUDDY
                              (imitating Mr. Rose)
                         He's makin' history, I suppose.

               From the surrounding trees, the other pickers laugh.

                                     ROSE ROSE
                         You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I 
                         hope.

                                     HOMER
                         No trouble.

               In adjacent trees, both Peaches and Hero are picking apples; 
               they can hear Homer and Rose Rose, too. (So can Mr. Rose.)

                                     PEACHES
                         That Candy--she's the nicest girl I 
                         know!

                                     MUDDY
                         She's about the most beautiful girl 
                         I ever seen--I don't know if she's 
                         the nicest.

                                     HOMER
                         She's the nicest *and* the most 
                         beautiful girl I've ever known.

               The men *oooh* and *aaah* at Homer's announcement--Mr. Rose, 
               too.

                                     ROSE ROSE
                         That sounds like you is in trouble 
                         already, Homer.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         That's right--that sounds like trouble 
                         to me.

                                     HOMER
                         I'm not in trouble.

                                     ROSE ROSE
                         Yeah, you is. I know when people is 
                         in trouble, and you is.

               Camera closes on Homer's face; he keeps picking.

                                     LARCH (O.S.)
                         His name is Homer Wells...

               INT. ST. CLOUD'S - DINING HALL - EVENING

               Edna and Angela face the Board of Trustees around a table. 
               Larch circles the table as everyone reads the contents of a 
               folder. Larch has provided a copy for each member. The three 
               elderly gentlemen on the Board don't speak; they just nod 
               their heads to everything Dr. Holtz or Mrs. Goodhall says.

                                     LARCH
                         ...and his *pathetic* resume is the 
                         best I've seen. Though I find it 
                         hard to believe the Board would be 
                         interested in this character.

                                     DR. HOLTZ
                         But he looks like an excellent young 
                         man, a first-rate candidate!

                                     LARCH
                         He looks like a bleeding-heart 
                         missionary *moron* to me, but that's 
                         going to be the problem with any 
                         doctor interested in coming here!

                                     MRS. GOODHALL
                         Do you know him?

                                     LARCH
                         *No*! I don't want to know him! He's 
                         doing *missionary* work--in *India*! 
                         I wrote him *weeks* ago, but he's 
                         either too holy or too busy to answer. 
                         Maybe he got killed in the war!

               Suddenly Steerforth bursts through the door, having been 
               pushed from behind by Mary Agnes. The two stop when they see 
               what's going on--not to mention Larch's stern expression. 
               They back out. Mary Agnes winking at Dr. Holtz before the 
               door closes. Mrs. Goodhall is ready to continue.

                                     MRS. GOODHALL
                         I fail to see how someone courageous 
                         enough to make a commitment to a 
                         foreign mission is automatically to 
                         be dismissed--that part of the world 
                         requires precisely the kind of 
                         dedication that is needed here.

                                     LARCH
                         Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter 
                         here and we'll be shipping him south, 
                         in a *coffin*!

                                     MRS. GOODHALL
                         You can't think that a man who has 
                         *served* under such conditions as 
                         exist over there will be in the 
                         slightest daunted by a little *snow*--
                         have you no idea how harsh and 
                         primitive and full of *disease* that 
                         part of the world is?

                                     LARCH
                         Then I suppose we can look forward 
                         to catching various diseases from 
                         him!

                                     DR. HOLTZ
                         But, Dr. Larch, he seems exceptionally 
                         qualified...

                                     LARCH
                         I'm not talking about his medical 
                         qualifications. It's the *Christian* 
                         thing that bothers me--I just don't 
                         see it being of much *use* around 
                         here.

                                     MRS. GOODHALL
                              (bitterly)
                         I fail to see how a little 
                         Christianity could *hurt* anyone 
                         here!

                                     LARCH
                         Anyway, I was just showing you this 
                         guy as an example of what's available--
                         I didn't think you'd be interested.

                                     DR. HOLTZ
                         We're *very* interested!

                                     MRS. GOODHALL
                         Yes, *very*!

                                     DR. HOLTZ
                         You wouldn't be opposed to meeting 
                         with him?

                                     LARCH
                         I suppose it wouldn't hurt to *meet* 
                         him. What's his name again?

                                     ANGELA
                         Dr. Homer Wells.

                                     LARCH
                              (mumbling)
                         I just hope he won't expect us to 
                         say *Grace* all the time.

               The three elderly gentlemen repeat the name.

                                     MRS. GOODHALL
                         It's a nice name, very New England.

                                     DR. HOLTZ
                         Very *Maine*, a very *local*-sounding 
                         name.

                                     EDNA
                         *Very*!

               INT. DISPENSARY - NIGHT

               A song plays on the old phonograph as a happy Larch and Angela 
               dance. Edna interrupts them.

                                     EDNA
                         I just wanted to ask you...

                                     LARCH
                         Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be 
                         foolish tonight.

                                     EDNA
                         Does he *know* he's supposed to be 
                         in India? Does he even *want* to 
                         come back?

               This causes Larch to take the needle off the record.

                                     LARCH
                              (angrily)
                         He's a field hand! What could possibly 
                         hold him there?

               EXT. CIDER HOUSE - RAINY DAY

               The rain beats down on Olive's car. Homer gets soaking wet 
               as he leans in to talk to Candy, who's behind the wheel. Mr. 
               Rose calls to Homer from the doorway of the mill room.

               INT. MILL ROOM - RAINY DAY

               Mr. Rose is instructing Homer as they stand bottling cider 
               in their yellow slickers and rubber boots. Rose Rose is hosing 
               down the pressboards; Muddy and Hero and Peaches are operating 
               the grinder and the press. Jack is stirring the vat. In a 
               defiant, contemptuous way, Jack keeps flicking the ash of 
               his cigarette into the vat. This make everyone uncomfortable; 
               only Mr. Rose doesn't appear to notice.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         Cider don't have no taste till later 
                         in October--it's too watery now, 
                         when we're usin' just them early 
                         Macs and them Gravensteins. You don't 
                         get no *good* cider till you're 
                         pickin' them Golden Delicious and 
                         them Winter Bananas, them Baldwins 
                         and them Russerts...

                                     HOMER
                         What about the worms? Most of these 
                         apples are the drops--off the ground, 
                         right? There have to be worms.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         Of *course* there's worms, Homer! 
                         And what is them worms, really? They 
                         just *protein*, them worms! They is 
                         *good* for you!

               Everyone but Jack laughs. He takes a last drag on his 
               cigarette, then deliberately drops it into the vat.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         That just ain't right, Jack--your 
                         cigarette's gonna end up in nine or 
                         ten gallons of this batch of cider! 
                         That ain't right.

                                     JACK
                         Them people drinkin' that cider, 
                         they don't know there's a cigarette 
                         in there!

                                     MR. ROSE
                         It's not that hard to find it in 
                         there, Jack--it'll take you just a 
                         minute. You just gotta go fishin'.

                                     JACK
                         You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' 
                         in that vat to fish out no cigarette!

                                     MR. ROSE
                         What business is you in, Jack? Just 
                         tell me what your business is...

               Jack looks for a translation from the other men, who are 
               nervous.

                                     MUDDY
                         Just say you're in the *apple* 
                         business, man. That's the only 
                         business you wanna be in. Just say 
                         it.

               Jack pulls a knife on Mr. Rose.

                                     PEACHES
                              (whispers excitedly 
                              to Jack)
                         You don't wanna go in the knife 
                         business with Mistuh Rose--just say 
                         you're in the *apple* business, Jack!

                                     JACK
                              (to Mr. Rose)
                         What business are *you* in?

               We never see Mr. Rose's knife. We see the men circle each 
               other: Jack takes a swipe at Mr. Rose's head--then he steps 
               back, his yellow slicker slashed open. His slicker is opened 
               up, right up the middle. His shirt underneath the slicker is 
               slashed open, too--he feels his bare chest and stomach, 
               feeling for the cut. But there's no cut--Jack's not bleeding, 
               he's not even scratched. Just his clothes have been slashed.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         I'm in the *knife* business, Jack. 
                         You don't wanna go in the knife 
                         business with me.

               Muddy turns Jack around and views his slashed clothes.

                                     MUDDY
                         You're lucky he didn't cut your 
                         *nipples* off, man.

                                     PEACHES
                         The good news, Jack, is you're half-
                         undressed for *swimmin'*...

                                     MUDDY
                         Yeah, that cigarette ain't hard to 
                         find when you're properly undressed.

               Jack starts to undress for the vat.

               Mr. Rose ushers Homer and Rose Rose outside.

               INT. BUNKHOUSE - RAINY DAY

               Mr. Rose has cut his own hand in the fight. Homer's 
               professionalism if offended to watch Rose Rose's amateurish 
               efforts to stitch up her father's wound, but clearly this 
               isn't the first time she's done it.

                                     HOMER
                         Give men that. I know how to do it.

                                     ROSE ROSE
                         Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?

                                     HOMER
                         Almost.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         I don't need no "almost" a doctor, 
                         Homer.

               Homer can't bear to watch Rose Rose at work with the needle.

                                     ROSE ROSE
                         We should drown that damn Jack in 
                         the vat!

                                     MR. ROSE
                         Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs 
                         to know what business he's in.

                                     ROSE ROSE
                         Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy--
                         you just about cut your own hand 
                         off, and all you cut off *him* was 
                         his clothes!

                                     MR. ROSE
                         You oughta know you don't go to jail 
                         for cuttin' a guy's *clothes*. Ain't 
                         that right, Homer?

               Homer winces at the stitching.

               INT. WALLY'S CAR - DRIVE-IN THEATRE - EARLY EVENING

               Wally's car comes bouncing along the ditches of the closed 
               drive-in. Homer is at the wheel; Candy calls out some driving 
               instructions. The car comes to a stop next to a speakerpost. 
               Candy leans out; she grabs the speaker and hangs it on the 
               window. Homer sits back and drapes his arms out the window 
               and over the seat. He feels great.

                                     CANDY
                         You're a natural. You were born to 
                         drive a car like this.

                                     HOMER
                         You think? Maybe I was.
                              (looks around)
                         I love this place!

               Homer looks up at the giant movie screen.

                                     HOMER
                         The screen is enormous! Imagine King 
                         Kong up *there*! Have you seen a lot 
                         of movies here?

                                     CANDY
                         Yes... and no. When you come here, 
                         you don't really care about the movie.

               Homer stares at Candy in disbelief.

                                     HOMER
                         You don't care about the movie?

               Candy looks at him for a moment.

                                     CANDY
                         What are you so crazy about the movies 
                         for?

                                     HOMER
                         It was my favorite night at the 
                         orphanage--movie night. We'd race 
                         into the dining hall. Of course 
                         everyone wanted to sit in front, so 
                         we'd be packed in so tight you could 
                         feel the kid next to you breathing.

                                     CANDY
                         At least you were never lonely.

                                     HOMER
                         I didn't say that. Growing up in an 
                         orphanage, you're always lonely. 
                         You're just never alone.

               Candy is moved. Homer feels exposed; he tries to change the 
               mood by making light of what he's said.

                                     HOMER
                         You're not alone in the bathroom, 
                         or... or in the shower... you're 
                         never alone in wanting the last piece 
                         of meatloaaf, or even in your own 
                         bed on a cold morning.

               Candy laughs.

                                     CANDY
                         You don't miss it?

                                     HOMER
                         I miss things. I miss... people.
                              (with certainty)
                         I miss reading to the boys.

                                     CANDY
                         But you had so much *responsibility*.

                                     HOMER
                         I never *asked* for any 
                         responsibility.

                                     CANDY
                         Just a little privacy.

               Homer laughs.

                                     CANDY
                         Privacy is exactly the point of drive-
                         in movies.

                                     HOMER
                         Did you come here with Wally--to 
                         *not* watch movies?

               At the mention of Wally they both look a little self-
               conscious.

                                     CANDY
                         Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.

                                     HOMER
                         Ah-ha.
                              (points to the speaker)
                         So what is that--a radio?

                                     CANDY
                         The *speaker*. For the movie sound.

               Candy looks at Homer.

                                     CANDY
                         Scrunch down like this.

               Candy scrunches down in her seat; Homer imitates her. Homer 
               is focused on the giant screen.

                                     HOMER
                         How could you not *care* about the 
                         movie?

                                     CANDY
                         You just cuddle. You come to hug... 
                         to kiss. You don't *come* here to 
                         watch the movie.

                                     HOMER
                              (teasing her)
                         That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd 
                         watch the movie.

                                     CANDY
                         Not with the right girl you wouldn't.

               Homer's expression changes from exhilarated to guilty. He 
               leans back in his seat and looks straight ahead at the screen. 
               Candy tentatively leans her head on his shoulder. Homer looks 
               afraid to breathe.

               From behind, with her head on his shoulder, they look like a 
               normal couple. We track in toward the huge screen until we 
               see only the screen. There are shadows on the black screen. 
               Suddenly the movie "King Kong" appears.

               INT. DINING HALL - NIGHT

               "King Kong" is playing against the bare, white wall. Fuzzy 
               is very weak, but he smiles at the sight of the love-struck 
               Kong holding the screaming Fay Wray in his giant hand. Dr. 
               Larch runs the projector; he sits close beside Fuzzy. When 
               the film breaks in the predictable place, Fuzzy makes no 
               protest. Dr. Larch looks at Fuzzy, who has stopped breathing; 
               his eyes are closed.

                                     LARCH
                         Fuzzy? Fuzzy?

               They are alone in the dining hall. Larch has wheeled in Fuzzy 
               for a private viewing.

               EXT. ST. CLOUD'S - GRAVEYARD - MORNING

               Buster helps Larch lower the small coffin into the grave. 
               The tiny gravestone says "F.S."

                                     BUSTER
                         What are you going to tell the little 
                         ones?

                                     LARCH
                         I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.

                                     BUSTER
                         Why would the little ones believe 
                         that *anyone* would adopt him?

                                     LARCH
                         They'll believe it because they want 
                         to believe it.

                                     BUSTER
                         Shouldn't we tell Homer?

                                     LARCH
                         If Homer wanted to know what was 
                         happening here, he could pick up a 
                         telephone and call us.

               INT. BOYS' DIVISION - NIGHT

               The boys in their beds listen to Buster inventing Fuzzy's 
               "family."

                                     BUSTER
                         It was a family with a better 
                         breathing machine then the one Dr. 
                         Larch built.

               INT. ST. CLOUD'S - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               Larch leans against the wall, covering his eyes, overhearing 
               the boys.

                                     BUSTER (O.S.)
                         The family that adopted Fuzzy, they 
                         *invented* the breathing machine. 
                         It's their business... breathing 
                         machines.

               Larch pauses; he waits to see if they believe this.

                                     CURLY (O.S.)
                         Lucky Fuzzy!

               Larch almost breaks with a sudden sharp breath.

                                     ALL THE BOYS (O.S.)
                         Good night, Fuzzy! Good night, Fuzzy! 
                         Good night, Fuzzy Stone!

               EXT. CIDER HOUSE - MORNING

               As the men sit at the picnic table eating their cornbread, 
               Rose Rose pours coffee. A jeep comes down the orchard road 
               toward them. It's Olive. Mr. Rose leads the "Good mornin', 
               Mrs. Worthin'ton!" greeting. Olive has an armful of clothing 
               and a fairly sizable package; she brings the latter over to 
               Homer.

                                     OLIVE
                         Some mail for you, Homer.

               Homer shakes the package; he puts the package beside the 
               table, unopened. Olive turns to Rose Rose.

                                     OLIVE
                         And some clothes for you, dear--
                              (nodding to the cider 
                              house)
                         let's go see if they fit.

               Mr. Rose watches Rose Rose and Olive disappear into the cider 
               house. The other men view Homer's package with curiosity, 
               especially Peaches.

                                     PEACHES
                         Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?

                                     MR. ROSE
                         Mind your own business, Peaches.

                                     PEACHES
                         Sorry, Homer...

               INT. BUNKHOUSE - LATE AT NIGHT

               Homer lies awake in bed; everyone else is asleep. Homer pulls 
               the package out from under his bed, opening it just enough 
               to see what it is; then he shoves it back under his bed.

               EXT. OCEAN/BEACH - DUSK

               The beach at sunset. Candy and Homer, dressed for cooler 
               weather, are alone at the water's edge. From a paper bag, 
               Candy is scattering some small, brightly colored pieces of 
               broken glass.

                                     HOMER
                         Aren't you worried that people will 
                         cut their feet?

                                     CANDY
                         Nobody will swim here until next 
                         summer. By then, the water will have 
                         rubbed the glass smooth against the 
                         sand--there won't be any sharp edges.

               She finds and old piece of glass among the stones and shells 
               at the high-tide mark.

                                     CANDY
                         See? That's last year's glass, or 
                         from some year before. I put glass 
                         here every year. The ocean makes it 
                         beautiful.

               Candy holds up a piece of glass to the sun for Homer to look 
               at. The ocean is a gray-green color, the glass a paler shade 
               of green.

                                     CANDY
                         Give me your hand.

               She rubs the smooth piece of glass against his hand, then 
               throws it toward the water. It falls short. Homer retrieves 
               it. Candy splashes him playfully. He chases her away from 
               the beach, into the pine trees. Homer locks his arms around 
               her, from behind. He can't let go. She lets him hold her, 
               then breaks his grip. She turns to face him. She is taller 
               then he is, older, obviously more experienced. She initiates 
               the kiss. They drop to the ground right there; they make 
               love by the roots of the tree, Candy guiding him.

               EXT. WALLY'S CAR - BEACH PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               They come out of the woods, walking toward the car, Candy 
               leading. We hear Candy talking just before we see her and 
               Homer.

                                     CANDY
                              (increasingly upset)
                         *Nobody* volunteers for the Burma 
                         run--he said so himself. And nobody 
                         knows *me* better than him! So how 
                         am I supposed to feel? He's a bomber 
                         pilot and I'm just selfish, I know. 
                         Well, I'm *not* a brave little girl 
                         and I'm *not* sorry.

               She sits in the passenger seat, Homer in the driver's seat.

                                     CANDY
                         I *know* this was right.
                              (pause)
                         I told you. I'm not good at being 
                         alone.
                              (pause; in a whisper)
                         I told him, too.

               Homer concentrates on starting the car.

                                     CANDY
                              (repeating herself)
                         I *know* this was right.

                                     HOMER
                         Right.

               Their expressions, as the car pulls away, belie their words.

               EXT. CIDER HOUSE - END OF DAY

               Homer and Mr. Rose sit opposite each other at the picnic 
               table. Rose Rose stands behind her father, her hands on his 
               shoulders, watching Homer snip out Mr. Rose's stitches--very 
               quickly.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a 
                         big hurry.

                                     HOMER
                         This is easy--I'm not hurrying.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         You still doin' it too fast!

               Job done, Homer leaves the table and hurries to the bicycle, 
               pedaling away. Rose Rose watches Homer go, as Mr. Rose flexes 
               his healed hand.

                                     ROSE ROSE
                         He's in a big hurry, all right. I 
                         told you he's in trouble.

               EXT. CAPE KENNETH - LOBSTER POUND - EVENING

               Candy and Homer sit on the dock. Candy still seems to be 
               wrestling with her conscience. Homer throws snails in the 
               sea. It's cold.

                                     HOMER
                         Just tell me. Do you want me to go? 
                         Do you want me to stay?

                                     CANDY
                         It will be okay.

                                     HOMER
                         *What* will be okay?

                                     CANDY
                         We have to wait and see. I think 
                         that, for *everything* in life, you 
                         have to wait and see.

               Homer throws a snail with more force.

                                     HOMER
                         I'll just move on, get another job 
                         somewhere.

               Ray comes out onto the dock; he sees Homer throwing another 
               snail.

                                     RAY
                         Every time you throw a snail off the 
                         dock, you're makin' someone start 
                         his whole life over.

               Candy throws a handful of snails into the water.

                                     CANDY
                         Maybe we're doing the snails a favor, 
                         Daddy.

               Ray looks at the two of them; he sighs.

                                     RAY
                         It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack 
                         it in.

                                     CANDY
                         Good night, Daddy.

               Ray nods good night; he leaves. Homer looks expectantly at 
               Candy.

                                     CANDY
                         We'll just have to wait and see.

               INT. WORTHINGTON HOUSE, DINING ROOM - NIGHT

               Olive and Homer sit at the dining-room table, the remnants 
               of an apple pie in front of them. Homer is still eating. 
               Pictures of Wally are on the wall.

                                     OLIVE
                         I used to hate it when Wally went 
                         back to college--even when it was 
                         just college! And this was when his 
                         father was still alive... I hated it 
                         even then. Naturally I hate this 
                         more.

               Homer nods in sympathy. His mouth is stuffed with apple pie.

                                     OLIVE
                         What I mean is... I would like it 
                         very much if you thought you could 
                         be happy here, Homer.

                                     HOMER
                              (wiping his mouth)
                         Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very 
                         lucky to be here.

                                     OLIVE
                         There's not a lot of work in the 
                         winter, and you'll have to tolerate 
                         Vernon--even Wally despises him, and 
                         Wally likes everyone.

               Olive's thoughts drift; her eyes look up at a photo of Wally.

                                     HOMER
                         I think Wally will be fine, Mrs. 
                         Worthington--he seems indestructible 
                         to me.

                                     OLIVE
                              (distracted)
                         I don't know.
                              (intently at Homer)
                         Just promise me one thing.

               Homer is tense. Does Olive suspect about Candy?

                                     HOMER
                         Uh... sure.

                                     OLIVE
                         Just promise me that, if there's a 
                         blizzard, you'll move into Wally's 
                         room until it's over.

               They both laugh, but Homer has a hard time looking her in 
               the eye.

               EXT. CIDER HOUSE - DAY

               The pickers are moving out; the harvest is over. Olive and 
               Homer stand near the door to the bunkhouse, talking--we can't 
               hear their conversation. Rose Rose and the other men walk 
               past them, carrying the last of their belongings to the truck. 
               Olive and Homer walk over to the truck.

                                     OLIVE
                         Good-bye. Have a safe trip home. 
                         Thank you, again, for all your hard 
                         work.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         You take care now, Mrs. Worthin'ton.

               They shake hands.

                                     OLIVE
                         Good-bye, Arthur.
                              (she hugs Rose Rose)
                         Homer, I'll see you tomorrow?

                                     HOMER
                         Right.

               Olive gets in her Jeep and waves as she drives off.

               The truck is packed. Muddy tugs on a rope that secures the 
               load.

                                     MUDDY
                              (to Mr. Rose)
                         We all set, I think.

               Mr. Rose nods and gets in behind the wheel. Rose Rose and 
               Muddy get in next to him. The others are bundled up for the 
               ride in the open back of the truck.

               As they're leaving, Homer waves good-bye--the pickers calling 
               out to him.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         You all take care of yourself, too, 
                         Homer!

                                     PEACHES
                         We see you next harvest.

                                     MUDDY
                         Don't freeze to death, Homer.

                                     JACK
                         Go on and freeze to death if you 
                         want to, Homer.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right.

                                     ROSE ROSE
                         You just stay out of trouble, Homer!

               Homer stands looking after them, after they're gone.

               INT. BUNKHOUSE - LATER THAT SAME DAY

               Homer is alone, rearranging his stuff--spreading out a bit, 
               making the place his own. (On the other beds, we see the 
               mattresses rolled up on the bare bedsprings.)

                                     CANDY (O.S.)
                         So, you're staying.

               Homer turns; he hadn't seen Candy come in.

                                     CANDY
                         Olive told me.
                              (awkward pause)
                         You might have told me yourself.

                                     HOMER
                         I'm just waiting and seeing. Like 
                         you said.

               She smiles. He goes to her; they embrace.

               BEGINNING A MONTAGE OF THE NEXT NINE OR TEN MONTHS.

               EXT. CIDER HOUSE ROOF - MORNING

               Homer, drinking coffee, is writing a letter on a note pad.

                                     HOMER (V.O.)
                         Dear Dr. Larch, thank you for your 
                         doctor's bag...

               EXT. RAY'S LOBSTER BOAT - DAY

               Homer is learning how to "haul" a lobster pot with Ray and 
               Candy's guidance.

                                     HOMER (V.O.)
                         ...although it seems that I will not 
                         have the occasion to use it.

               EXT. LOBSTER POUND, FLOATING PENS - EVENING

               Following Ray's example, Homer is trying to "disarm" the 
               lobsters' big claws by blocking them shut with the little 
               wooden wedges. Roy works quickly, never getting pinched. As 
               Candy watches, Homer gets pinched.

                                     HOMER (V.O.)
                         Barring some emergency, of course. I 
                         am not a doctor. With all due respect 
                         to your profession. I am enjoying my 
                         life here.

               INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT

               Homer and Candy are naked. They have pulled two beds together 
               and made a double bed. He can't take his eyes off her.

                                     HOMER
                         I've looked at so many women... I 
                         mean, I've seen *everything* about 
                         them, *everything*... but I never 
                         felt a thing. I felt nothing. Now... 
                         with you... it *hurts*... to look at 
                         you.

               INT. DISPENSARY - DAY

               Edna and Angela and Larch are all reading Homer's letter, 
               their lips moving silently as they read the words.

                                     HOMER (V.O.)
                         I am enjoying being a lobsterman and 
                         an orchardman--in fact, I have never 
                         enjoyed myself so much.

               INT. WORTHINGTON HOUSE, FIREPLACE - NIGHT

               Olive and Homer and Candy are playing a board game around 
               the fireplace.

                                     HOMER (V.O.)
                         The truth is, I want to stay here. I 
                         believe I am being of *some* use.

               INT. LARCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Edna and Angela view him anxiously from the doorway as Larch 
               furiously types and types.

                                     LARCH (V.O.)
                         My dear Homer, I thought you were 
                         over your adolescence, that period 
                         which I would define as the first 
                         time in our lives when we imagine we 
                         have something terrible to hide from 
                         those who love us.

               INT. WALLY'S CAR - DAY

               Candy is singing to the car radio, as animated and happy as 
               we've ever seen her. Homer, driving, can scarcely keep his 
               eyes on the road; he has to keep looking at her.

                                     LARCH (V.O.)
                         Do you think it's not obvious to us 
                         what's happened to you?

               INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT

               With the radio playing (a popular song), Homer hops across 
               the bare floor, pulling on his boxer shorts; he opens the 
               door to Olive, who's holding out an armload of blankets to 
               him. He sheepishly thanks her. When Homer closes the door, 
               we see a hidden (and stricken) Candy, naked from their 
               interrupted lovemaking.

                                     LARCH (V.O.)
                         You're fallen in love, haven't you? 
                         By the way, whatever you're up to 
                         can't be too good for your heart. 
                         Then again, it's the sort of condition 
                         that can be made worse by worrying 
                         about it. So don't worry about it!

               EXT. ORCHARDS - DAY

               Vernon and Homer are working under an apple tree; they are 
               poisoning mice.

                                     HOMER (V.O.)
                         Dear Dr. Larch, what I am learning 
                         here may not be as important as what 
                         I learned from you, but everything 
                         is new to me. Yesterday I learned 
                         how to poison mice. You use poison 
                         oats and poison corn.

               INT. DINING HALL - EVENING

               Supper chaos--Buster and Mary Agnes are doing their best to 
               stop a food fight while Larch and Angela and Edna are 
               completely absorbed reading Homer's letter.

                                     HOMER (V.O.)
                         Field mice girdle an apple tree. 
                         Pine mice kill the roots. I *know* 
                         what you have to do--you have to 
                         play God. Well... killing mice is as 
                         close as I want to come to playing 
                         God.

               INT. MOVIE THEATRE - CAPE KENNETH

               Homer and Candy are watching "Rebecca".

                                     LARCH (V.O.)
                         Do I interfere? When absolutely 
                         helpless women tell me that they 
                         simply *can't* have an abortion, 
                         that they simply *must* go through 
                         with having another--and yet another--
                         orphan... do I interfere? *Do* I? I 
                         do not. I do not even *recommend*. I 
                         just give them what they want: an 
                         orphan or an abortion.
                              (close on Homer)
                         You are my work of art, Homer. 
                         Everything else has been just a job. 
                         I don't know if you've got a work of 
                         art in you, but I know what your job 
                         is. You're a doctor!

               INT. BUNKHOUSE - DAY

               The radio is playing a slow, sexy dance number. The fat ladies 
               from the apple mart are dancing as they paint the interior 
               walls of the bunk house.

                                     HOMER (V.O.)
                         I am not a doctor.

                                     LARCH (V.O.)
                         You know everything I know, plus 
                         what you've taught yourself--you're 
                         a better doctor then I am and you 
                         know it!

               Homer is finishing up painting the kitchen walls. When he 
               gets to the list of rules, tacked on the wall, he removes 
               the list and finishes painting under where the rules were.

                                     LARCH (V.O.)
                         They're going to replace me, Homer! 
                         The Board of Trustees is looking for 
                         my *replacement*!

               Two of the ladies unroll the rolled-up mattresses on the 
               bare bedsprings, as Vernon enters with an armload of blankets 
               and pillows.

                                     HOMER (V.O.)
                         I can't replace you! I'm sorry...

               Homer holds up the list of rules, rereads it briefly; he 
               walks over to an unpainted beam, a support beam, and tacks 
               the rules on this beam.

               EXT. CIDER HOUSE, ROOF - MORNING

               Homer reads Larch's letter, sipping coffee.

                                     LARCH (V.O.)
                         Sorry? I'm not 'sorry'! Not for 
                         anything I've done. I'm not even 
                         sorry that I love you!

               INT. DISPENSARY - NIGHT

               Larch sits on his ether-bed with a letter from Homer in his 
               hand. He looks completely deflated. Angela is standing in 
               the doorway.

                                     LARCH
                         I think we may have lot him to the 
                         world. He's not coming back.

               END OF THE MONTAGE.

               INT. BUNKHOUSE - EARLY EVENING

               In the newly painted, spruced-up cider house, Homer and Candy 
               are dancing to another slow, sexy song on the radio. He is 
               untucking her blouse, feeling under her blouse--she starts 
               to unbutton his shirt. They kiss while they dance. But the 
               song changes abruptly on the radio to something fast and 
               silly.

               Homer responds to the music, dancing goofily--instantly out 
               of the mood. Candy laughs, but she picks up a pillow and 
               swings it at him, hitting him. He dances away from her. She 
               throws the pillow; he ducks--the pillow lands somewhere near 
               the door. Now Homer grabs a pillow and chases her from bed 
               to bed. She shrieks--they're both laughing. They each grab a 
               pillow and stand toe to toe whacking each other, laughing 
               all the while, until he pins her arms behind her and, 
               breathing hard--and despite the stupid music that broke the 
               mood--they are passionately kissing again.

               The sound of a truck is sudden and loud.

               EXT. CIDER HOUSE - DAY

               Mr. Rose's truck has arrived. The pickers are hopping out of 
               the truck, grabbing their gear.

               INT. BUNKHOUSE - DAY

               The door opens. Hero and Peaches barge in, as Homer and Candy 
               are struggling to return the pillows to the beds.

                                     HERO
                         Who's that?

                                     PEACHES
                         It's that Homer!

               Muddy is right behind them. He picks up a pillow, off the 
               floor, looking for which bed it belongs on.

                                     MUDDY
                         It's that Candy, too...

               Then comes Mr. Rose, slyly smiling, taking it all in--there's 
               no hiding what's going on. Homer and Candy are caught, their 
               shirts untucked and half-unbuttoned--they're still out of 
               breath. The pillows lie crazily on the beds, each one of 
               which has been stepped on.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         Don't this place look like home?

                                     PEACHES
                         It look nicer then home!

                                     MR. ROSE
                         What have you two been doin' to make 
                         it look so nice?

               Rose Rose enters. She looks hardened, toughened--not happy. 
               She plops down her stuff on her bed, looking only at Candy.

                                     ROSE ROSE
                         How is that Wally doing?

                                     CANDY
                         Oh, he's fine! I just heard from 
                         him. He's bombing all these places...

               Homer tries to help out.

                                     HOMER
                              (mumbling)
                         ...bridges, oil refineries, fuel 
                         depots...

               He peters out, knowing how sick of hearing this Candy is. He 
               tries to change the subject.

                                     HOMER
                         Where's Jack?

               There is an uncomfortable silence.

                                     MUDDY
                         He just wasn't up for the trip.

               More silence.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         That Jack just never knew what his 
                         business was.

               One look at Muddy and we know something pretty bad happened 
               to Jack.

               EXT. ORCHARDS - DAY

               The pickers on their ladders, all picking. Homer is now a 
               good picker; he looks over at Rose Rose. She is slumped 
               against the ladder, not picking, completely ignoring an 
               argument beneath them in the aisle between the trees. (Mr. 
               Rose is checking over the apples Peaches has just picked.)

                                     MR. ROSE
                         You pickin' nothin' but cider apples, 
                         Peaches--I hope you understand that.

                                     PEACHES
                         They ain't drops--I picked 'em off 
                         the tree!

                                     MR. ROSE
                         Then you pickin' 'em too fast--they 
                         ain't no better than drops to me. 
                         See that bruise, and that one? *Half* 
                         of these is bruised! Look at this 
                         one! It ain't got no stem! You might 
                         as well *step* on 'em, too--they 
                         only good for cider.

               EXT. ORCHARDS - DUSK

               In the aisle between the trees, Homer and Candy are arguing 
               in one of the work vehicles.

                                     CANDY
                         Do you think I'm having a good time? 
                         Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? 
                         Do you think I *know* whether I want 
                         you or Wally?

                                     HOMER
                         So we should "wait and see." For how 
                         long?

                                     CANDY
                         I grew up with Wally. I began my 
                         adult life with him.

                                     HOMER
                         Fine. That's all there is to it then.

                                     CANDY
                         No! That's not all there is to it! I 
                         love you, too--I *know* I do.

                                     HOMER
                         Okay, okay--I know you do, too.

                                     CANDY
                              (bitterly)
                         It's a good thing I didn't have that 
                         baby, isn't it?

               Her sudden hardness leaves him speechless as they go their 
               separate ways. Candy drives on.

               EXT. CIDER HOUSE - SUNNY MORNING

               Breakfast time at the picnic table. Rose Rose by herself, 
               away from the table. She does not look well; she suddenly 
               goes back inside the bunkhouse.

                                     PEACHES
                              (calling after her)
                         Ain't you eatin' with us, Rose?
                              (to the men)
                         She used to eat with us. Now we ain't 
                         good enough for her, I guess.

                         She ain't hungry, maybe.

                                     MUDDY
                         She ain't hungry every mornin' 'cause 
                         she's sick every mornin'.

               Homer gets up to take his dishes inside.

               INT. KITCHEN AND BUNKHOUSE - MORNING

               When Homer comes in, Rose Rose is throwing up in the sink.

                                     HOMER
                         You okay, Rose?

                                     ROSE ROSE
                         I guess you must like watchin' me be 
                         sick...

                                     HOMER
                         I don't like watching anyone be sick.

               Rose Rose lies down on her bed with the curtain open. There 
               is something familiar about the way Homer approaches her 
               bedside; he does so with the authority of a doctor. He sits 
               on the edge of her bed with such complete self-assurance 
               that she doesn't protest.

                                     HOMER
                         How many months are you?

               She just stares. But she doesn't stop him when he touches 
               her abdomen. It's as if she knows that he knows what he's 
               doing.

                                     HOMER
                         You're not yet three months, are 
                         you?

                                     ROSE ROSE
                         Not yet. What do you know about it?

                                     HOMER
                         I know more than I want to know about 
                         it. Who's the father?

                                     ROSE ROSE
                         Don't trouble yourself about it, 
                         Homer--this ain't your business.

                                     HOMER
                         But you don't look very happy.

                                     ROSE ROSE
                         *Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How 
                         am I supposed to take care of a baby! 
                         I can't have a baby.

                                     HOMER
                         Rose, please listen. Whatever you 
                         want to do, I can help you.

               She is taken back.

                                     HOMER
                         What I mean is, if you don't want 
                         to... keep the baby, I know a place 
                         where you can go.

                                     ROSE ROSE
                         You think Daddy's gonna let me go 
                         anywhere? I ain't going *nowhere*.

               She rolls over on the bed, facing away from him again.

                                     ROSE ROSE
                         Why don't you just go back to your 
                         pickin', Homer? I can take care of 
                         it myself!

                                     HOMER
                         Rose, listen--don't *do* anything. 
                         You know, I mean to yourself. Please 
                         listen...

                                     MR. ROSE (O.S.)
                              (calling)
                         Homer! Is this a workin' day or what?

               EXT. LOBSTER POUND - EVENING

               Homer and Candy are sitting at the dock.

                                     CANDY
                         We should take her to St. Cloud's. 
                         That much is obvious, isn't it? Let 
                         her make up her mind when she gets 
                         there...

                                     HOMER
                         I told her! She doesn't feel she can 
                         do that. Something about her father 
                         not letting her go anywhere...

                                     CANDY
                         Well, we have to help her!

               Homer doesn't respond.

                                     CANDY
                         We have to do *something*. Don't we?
                              (beat)
                         Homer?

               Homer looks out over the ocean; he remains unresponsive.

               EXT. CIDER HOUSE - MIDDAY

               Rose Rose is setting the picnic table for lunch when Candy 
               arrives.

                                     CANDY
                         Hi...

                                     ROSE ROSE
                         Hi...

               She keeps setting the table.

                                     CANDY
                         I've got some more clothes for you--
                         I just keep forgetting to bring them 
                         with me.

                                     ROSE ROSE
                         I don't need no more clothes, thank 
                         you.

                                     CANDY
                              (softly)
                         Rose, I know what's going on. Homer 
                         told me. I got pregnant, too--about 
                         a year ago.
                              (pause)
                         I've been through this.

               Rose Rose looks down.

                                     ROSE ROSE
                         You ain't been through what I been 
                         through, Candy.

                                     CANDY
                              (doesn't get it)
                         Yes, I *have*!

               Rose Rose dismissively waves her hand.

                                     CANDY
                         Who's the father, Rose?

               Rose looks at Candy and shakes her head.

                                     CANDY
                         You want to have the baby?

               Rose Rose shakes her head again, more emphatically.

                                     CANDY
                         I know where you can go. Homer and I 
                         can take you...

                                     ROSE ROSE
                         I can't go nowhere.

                                     CANDY
                         Why?

               Rose Rose stays silent.

                                     CANDY
                         Is it the father? Does he know?

               Rose Rose turns away from Candy.

                                     CANDY
                         You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's 
                         not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it 
                         Muddy?

                                     ROSE ROSE
                              (almost wistfully)
                         No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...

               Rose Rose stops; she can't even continue setting the table. 
               Her voice turns bitter, despairing.

                                     ROSE ROSE
                         It sure ain't Jack.

               There, suddenly, is Mr. Rose, walking past them. He is 
               uncharacteristically tentative.

                                     MR. ROSE
                              (to his daughter)
                         I'll be up top...

               Mr. Rose leaves Candy and Rose Rose alone again. Rose Rose 
               nods almost invisibly after her father. Rose Rose looks 
               pointedly at Candy, nodding. Candy slowly gets it. Mr. Rose 
               is the father! Rose Rose lets that sink in; she keeps looking 
               at Candy with an ashamed expression.

               EXT. ORCHARD - DAY

               The pickers are at work, on their ladders, when Candy runs 
               down the aisle between two rows of trees. She stops at the 
               bottom of Homer's ladder, out of breath. Muddy and Peaches 
               and Hero, in the treetops, are watching and listening.

                                     CANDY
                         She won't go to St. Cloud's!

                                     HOMER
                              (shrugging)
                         Well, we can't force her. It's her 
                         decision.

                                     CANDY
                         You don't understand! It's her 
                         father...

                                     HOMER
                         Mr. Rose *knows*?

                                     CANDY
                              (shouting)
                         He's the *father*! He's her baby's 
                         father!

               The pickers can't help but hear this, too. Candy starts to 
               leave, Homer running after her.

                                     HOMER
                         Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?

                                     CANDY
                         We've got to keep her away from that 
                         bastard!

               Candy leaves. Homer starts looking for Mr. Rose.

               EXT. ORCHARD, NEAR CIDER HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

               Smiling his enigmatic smile, Mr. Rose keeps slowly picking 
               while Homer stands at the foot of his ladder.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         I didn't see where you was pickin' 
                         this mornin', Homer, but you musta 
                         worked up a big appetite. You look 
                         like you're serious about gettin' to 
                         your lunch today!

                                     HOMER
                         Is it true?

               Mr. Rose stops picking, his eyes darting to see who's around.

                                     HOMER
                         Are you sleeping with your own 
                         daughter?

               Mr. Rose, with deliberate slowness, comes down the ladder.

                                     MR. ROSE
                              (slyly; still composed)
                         I think you been stayin' up too late 
                         at night, Homer.

                                     HOMER
                         You're actually having sex with your 
                         own little girl? Is that possible?

                                     MR. ROSE
                         Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my 
                         little girl, Homer--that's somethin' 
                         a father knows.

                                     HOMER
                         You're lying. How can you... with 
                         your own daughter!

               Mr. Rose switches from sly to threatening in a split second.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         Homer, don't you know what business 
                         you in? You don't wanna go into no 
                         business with me, Homer--ain't that 
                         right?

                                     HOMER
                         Go on, cut my clothes. I've got other 
                         clothes.

               Mr. Rose is indignant.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         You a fine one to be talkin' about 
                         lies. Shame! These people took you 
                         in. That boy Wally's at *war*!

               That takes some of the steam out of Homer's superiority.

                                     HOMER
                         But she's your *daughter*...

                                     MR. ROSE
                         And I *love* her! There ain't nobody 
                         else gonna treat her as good as I 
                         do!
                              (looks away)
                         I wouldn't do nothin' to hurt her, 
                         Homer--you must know that.

               Homer turns; he speaks over his shoulder as he walks away.

                                     HOMER
                         She's *pregnant*. Do you know *that*?

               By his expression--he looks as if he's been punched--it's 
               clear that Mr. Rose didn't *know that*.

               The other pickers are on their way to lunch; it's obvious 
               that Muddy, Peaches, and Hero already know that Mr. Rose is 
               sleeping with his daughter.

               EXT. CIDER HOUSE - PICNIC AREA - LUNCHTIME

               Rose Rose is sitting at the picnic table when the pickers 
               arrive for lunch, almost simultaneously with Homer. He looks 
               at, then looks away from, Rose Rose. Mr. Rose is the last to 
               sit down at the table as a very tense, wordless lunch begins.

               EXT. ORCHARD - DAY

               Homer is on a ladder picking apples. Muddy climbs a ladder 
               on the other side of the same tree.

                                     MUDDY
                         Don't mess in this, Homer, if you 
                         know what's good for you.

                                     HOMER
                         How long's this been going on, Muddy?

                                     MUDDY
                         Long enough. You ain't gonna stop 
                         it.

               Muddy looks all around for Mr. Rose; then he gives Homer his 
               knife.

                                     MUDDY
                         There's my knife, Homer. It ain't 
                         gonna do *me* no good. You give that 
                         knife to Rose Rose, you hear?

               Homer nods, pocketing the knife. As Muddy climbs down and 
               moves his ladder to an adjacent tree, he keeps talking to 
               Homer until he disappears in the leaves.

                                     MUDDY
                         You best just watch you ass, Homer! 
                         You don't wanna end up like Jack!

               Homer thoughtfully continues his work.

               INT. BUNKHOUSE - LATE AT NIGHT

               Homer lies awake in his bed.

               EXT. ORCHARD - LATE AFTERNOON, ANOTHER DAY

               The pickers on their ladders in the trees; nobody is talking. 
               In the late sun, the leaves have a reddish, fiery glow.

               EXT. ORCHARD - ANOTHER DAY

               It's much colder; the pickers are on their ladders in the 
               trees again, but they're dressed for the cold. Homer is high 
               on a ladder; he turns toward the view of the Worthington 
               house when he hears a car come to a screeching halt in the 
               driveway. Homer sees Candy get out of Wally's car; she leaves 
               the door open and runs toward the house. Parked in front of 
               Wally's car is an Army Jeep, with an ENLISTED MAN leaning 
               against it. The indifferent soldier smokes a cigarette as he 
               watches Candy run.

                                     CANDY
                         No! No!

               Homer descends the ladder and runs for the house, down as 
               aisle between the row of trees. The pickers watch him run.

               INT. WORTHINGTON HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Camera follows Homer into the Worthington house where, from 
               the front hall, he sees Olive and Candy (in profile) sitting 
               on the couch. We can't see who's talking, nor do we recognize 
               the voice. As Homer comes into the living room, we see MAJOR 
               WINSLOW sitting in a chair (also in profile), talking to 
               Olive and Candy.

               Major Winslow is a smooth, handsome well-briefed officer in 
               the casualty branch of the Army Air Corps; he's done his 
               homework, but he's not all business. He's painfully aware of 
               the delicate nature of his report.

                                     MAJOR WINSLOW
                         When the plane was hit, the crew 
                         chief and the radioman jumped close 
                         together. The copilot jumped third. 
                         All on Captain Worthington's orders--
                         the captain was still flying the 
                         plane. None of the men of the ground 
                         could see the sky--that's how thick 
                         the jungle was. They never saw the 
                         plane crash--they never *heard* it 
                         crash. They never saw Captain 
                         Worthington's parachute, either.

                                     OLIVE
                         Why was he missing for twenty days?

                                     MAJOR WINSLOW
                         Because the crew thought he'd gone 
                         down with the plane. They were 
                         hospitalized for almost a week in 
                         China before they were flown back to 
                         India. It wasn't until that they 
                         sorted through their gear...

                                     CANDY
                         Who cares about their *gear*?

                                     MAJOR WINSLOW
                         Three men jumped from the plane, but 
                         they had four compasses with them. 
                         One of the crew jumped with Captain 
                         Worthington's compass.

                                     CANDY
                         He was in Burma for twenty days 
                         without a compass?

                                     MAJOR WINSLOW
                         He followed the Irrawaddy River, all 
                         the way to Rangoon. Somehow he managed 
                         to avoid the Japs, but not the 
                         mosquitoes.

                                     OLIVE
                         Then it's malaria?

                                     MAJOR WINSLOW
                         It's encephalitis B. He's recovering 
                         at Mount Lavinia Hospital, Ceylon.
                              (pause)
                         Uh... Captain Worthington is 
                         paralyzed.
                              (Olive gasps)
                         Waist down. He won't walk.

               Candy stands and leaves the room.

                                     MAJOR WINSLOW
                              (to Olive)
                         I'm sorry.

                                     HOMER
                              (asks the major)
                         There are no autonomic effects, are 
                         there?

               Major Winslow has to consult his notes.

                                     MAJOR WINSLOW
                         No autonomic effects... that's 
                         correct.

                                     OLIVE
                         When will he be home, Major?

                                     MAJOR WINSLOW
                         Four weeks or so, right around 
                         Halloween.

               INT./EXT. WALLY'S CAR - LOBSTER POUND - END OF DAY

               Homer and Candy are sitting in the parked car in silence.

                                     HOMER
                              (finally)
                         There are no autonomic effects, just 
                         the paralysis of the lower 
                         extremities.

               Candy stares at him, uncomprehending.

                                     HOMER
                         Wally can have kids, a normal sex 
                         life...

               Candy cries.

               EXT. LOBSTER POUND - EVENING

               Ray is throwing snails in the water. Candy sits on the end 
               of the dock, slumped on Homer's shoulder.

                                     RAY
                         How about him not needin' the friggin' 
                         compass! How about that?

                                     CANDY
                         Daddy, *please*...

               Ray knows that she wants him to leave. He shuffles off the 
               dock, toward the house. He knows how they both must feel.

                                     RAY
                         Good night, kids. Don't catch cold--
                         it's gettin' cold already.

                                     CANDY
                         Good night, Daddy.

                                     HOMER
                         Good night, Ray.

               Homer tries to cuddle closer, but Candy sits up, preoccupied.

                                     HOMER
                         Just tell me. I'll do whatever you 
                         want to do.

                                     CANDY
                         Nothing.

                                     HOMER
                         Isn't that like waiting and seeing?

                                     CANDY
                         No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally 
                         to come home. I'm afraid to see him, 
                         too.

                                     HOMER
                         I know.
                              (he kisses her)
                         Is *that* nothing.

                                     CANDY
                         No, don't--that's something. Nothing 
                         is nothing.
                              (Homer's sad smile)
                         Don't even look at me. I want...

               Candy buries her face in his chest.

                                     CANDY
                         ...to do nothing.

               Homer holds her, doing nothing, while she sobs. As her crying 
               subsides, Homer's thoughts are far away. With Candy slumped 
               against him, hugging him, he doesn't look at her; instead, 
               he looks out to sea and at the darkening coast, Candy's words 
               resonating. An unfamiliar expression is on his face.

                                     HOMER
                              (mumbling to himself)
                         It's a tempting idea, I know... to 
                         do nothing.

               Candy is silent. Homer feels strangely agitated; he shifts 
               his position.

                                     CANDY
                              (groans)
                         Please don't move, don't go anywhere.

                                     HOMER
                              (overly genuine)
                         *Go* anywhere? Of course not! That 
                         would be *doing* something, wouldn't 
                         it? We wouldn't want to *do* 
                         something. Let's just sit here all 
                         night!

                                     CANDY
                              (irritated)
                         If you're trying to be funny, Homer...

                                     HOMER
                              (irritated, too)
                         I'm not trying to be anything--I'm 
                         just doing nothing! If I wait and 
                         see long enough, then--with any luck--
                         I won't *ever* have to make up my 
                         mind! Decisions can be painful, after 
                         all...

               Candy is angry; she gets to her feet and stares hard at him.

                                     CANDY
                         Stop it! Just cut it out!

                                     HOMER
                              (mock surprise)
                         You got up! You *did* something! If 
                         you keep this up, you might be in 
                         danger of making a *decision*!

                                     CANDY
                         For God's sake, Homer, Wally's been 
                         shot down!

               Candy sobs. Homer puts his face in his hands for a minute. 
               He regains his composure and stands up.

                                     HOMER
                              (genuinely contrite)
                         I know, I'm sorry.

                                     CANDY
                              (yelling and sobbing)
                         He's *paralyzed*!

                                     HOMER
                              (deadpan; just the 
                              facts)
                         He's *alive*. He still loves you.
                              (pause)
                         So do I.

                                     CANDY
                              (anguished)
                         What do you want me to *do*?

               He faces away from her.

                                     HOMER
                              (with calm resolve)
                         Nothing. You're not the one who has 
                         to do anything.

               EXT. CIDER HOUSE - NIGHT

               Homer is in semidarkness as he walks toward the cider house.

                                     MR. ROSE (O.S.)
                         Where do you think you're going?

                                     ROSE ROSE (O.S.)
                         You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...

               Homer walks faster. When he gets to the cider house, he sees 
               Mr. Rose and Rose Rose arguing. Rose is sitting on the 
               bicycle, a bundle of her clothes tied up behind the seat.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle 
                         of the night, girl!

                                     ROSE ROSE
                         I ain't your business no more, Daddy. 
                         Please let me go.

               Rose Rose starts to pedal away, but Mr. Rose stops her. She 
               starts to struggle.

                                     HOMER
                         Hey, hey! Stop it. Maybe I can help.

               They turn to see Homer.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         You just go inside, Homer. We don't 
                         need no help.

                                     ROSE ROSE
                         That's right, Homer. This ain't your 
                         business.

               She tries to break free from her father and pedal away, but 
               he stops her again. They keep struggling.

                                     HOMER
                         Please listen to me! *Both* of you...

                                     MR. ROSE
                         You forget yourself, Homer. This 
                         here's my daughter! You got your own 
                         mess to deal with--ain't that right?

               Homer steps between them, which makes Mr. Rose furious.

                                     MR. ROSE
                              (yelling)
                         What business is you in, Homer?

                                     HOMER
                         Mr. Rose, I'm in the *doctor* 
                         business.
                              (to Rose Rose)
                         If you want, I can help you. You 
                         don't have to go anywhere.

               Rose Rose and Mr. Rose stop struggling. Suddenly Homer is in 
               charge.

               INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT

               Muddy, Hero and Peaches smoke in their beds. Rose Rose opens 
               her curtain and peers out from her bed. She gets up and goes 
               toward the kitchen area in her nightshirt; she stops at an 
               unused bed, now covered with white rubber sheeting--Homer's 
               medical instruments are displayed and ready. Homer finished 
               scrubbing his hands in the sink. His surgical mask is loosely 
               tied around his neck.

               Mr. Rose is looking at Homer's surgical instruments when 
               Rose Rose joins him.

                                     MR. ROSE
                              (to Homer)
                         What's that? What's it called?

                                     HOMER
                         One cervical stabilizer, two sets of 
                         dilators--Douglas points. One medium-
                         sized curette, one small; one medium 
                         speculum, one large; two vulsellum 
                         forceps.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         There ain't no *almost* about this 
                         stuff, Homer--ain't that right?

               Homer ignores him; he keeps naming his equipment.

                                     HOMER
                         Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, 
                         gauze--lots of gauze.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         When it comes to this, you is the 
                         real thing--is that what you sayin'?

               Homer looks at Mr. Rose and Rose Rose.

                                     HOMER
                         No *almost* about it--I'm a doctor.

               Homer turns to Peaches, Hero, and Muddy.

                                     HOMER
                         Get out of here, please.

               Muddy herds Peaches and Hero out of the bunkhouse.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         I'm stayin', Homer.

                                     HOMER
                         Okay. Then you can be of use.

               INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT

               Mr. Rose wears a surgical mask; he is sweating, even in the 
               cold, and his eyes look stricken as he watches Homer, who is 
               performing the abortion. Mr. Rose holds the ether cone over 
               Rose Rose's face. He drips some ether from the bottle on the 
               cone.

               Cut quickly for Rose Rose's etherized face... to Mr. Rose's 
               eyes above his mask... to Homer working with his eyes trained 
               on the speculum...

               EXT. CIDER HOUSE - NIGHT

               ...to Muddy and Peaches and Hero huddled under the overhanging 
               roof in the rain.

               INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT

               Mr. Rose is having a hard time breathing.

                                     HOMER
                         You better get some air.

               EXT. CIDER HOUSE - NIGHT

               The cider house in the rain. Mr. Rose staggers out; he stands 
               there in the rain, trying to regain his composure. He starts 
               to scream.

               Another angle: huddled under the overhanging roof, Muddy and 
               Peaches and Hero are watching him.

               INT. BUNKHOUSE - RAINY DAY

               Rose Rose, curled in a fetal position, listens to the rain 
               on the roof. Candy sits on her bed beside her. She helps her 
               to sit up, to drink a glass of water; then Rose Rose lies 
               down again. Rose Rose's expression never changes while Candy 
               talks to her. Mr. Rose lies in his bed in the exact same 
               fetal position as his daughter; he too, is listening to Candy. 
               Homer is putting away his instruments.

                                     CANDY
                         The bleeding should taper off 
                         tomorrow, but it can come back again. 
                         The cramps will ease up, almost 
                         entirely. The bleeding is usually 
                         much lighter in two days. As long as 
                         the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal.

               Muddy enters the cider house from out of the storm. He glances 
               at Candy and Rose Rose; then at Homer. Then he speaks to Mr. 
               Rose.

                                     MUDDY
                         It's that Vernon--he keeps askin' 
                         where you and Homer and Rose Rose is 
                         at.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         Tell that Vernon to mind his own 
                         business, Muddy.

                                     MUDDY
                         I told him that you all is sick.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         Tell him what you want, Muddy--*you* 
                         is the crew boss today.

               Hero and Peaches, dripping wet, come inside. Peaches is 
               standing next to the list of rules tacked to the kitchen 
               support beam.

                                     PEACHES
                         Look at that. Them same damn rules 
                         is tacked up again!

               Homer has finished putting his instruments away.

                                     MUDDY
                         Why don't you put them damn rules in 
                         the wood stove, Peaches?

               As the men are murmuring their approval of this idea, Rose 
               Rose interjects.

                                     ROSE ROSE
                         I want to hear what they are, first.

               The men groan, but Mr. Rose won't oppose his daughter on 
               this subject--not this time. He just lies there.

                                     ROSE ROSE
                         Homer, let me hear what they are.

               Homer begins to read.

                                     HOMER
                         "One: Please don't smoke in bed."

                                     MUDDY
                         We heard that one already, Homer.

                                     HOMER
                         "Two: Please don't go up to the roof 
                         to eat your lunch."

                                     PEACHES
                         That's the best place to eat lunch!

                                     HOMER
                         "Three: Please--even if you are very 
                         hot--do not go up to the roof to 
                         sleep."

                                     HERO
                         What do they think? They must think 
                         we're crazy!

                                     MUDDY
                         They think we're dumb niggers so we 
                         need dumb rules--that's what they 
                         think.

                                     HOMER
                         This is the last one.

               The men groan, in mock disappointment.

                                     HOMER
                         "Four: There should be no going up 
                         on the roof at night."

                                     PEACHES
                         Why don't they just say, "Stay off 
                         the roof!"?

                                     HERO
                         Yeah, they don't want us up there 
                         *at all*!

               Homer crumples the list and throws it into the wood stove.

                                     ROSE ROSE
                              (to Homer)
                         That's *it*?

                                     HOMER
                         That's it.

                                     ROSE ROSE
                         It means nothin' at all! And all 
                         this time I been *wonderin'* about 
                         it!

                                     PEACHES
                         They're *outrageous*, them rules!

                                     MR. ROSE
                         Who *live* here in this cider house, 
                         Peaches? Who grind them apples, who 
                         press that cider, who clean up the 
                         mess, and who just plain *live* 
                         here... just breathin' in the vinegar?
                              (he pauses)
                         Somebody who *don't* live here made 
                         them rules. Them rules ain't for 
                         *us*. *We* the ones who make up them 
                         rules. We makin' our *own* rules, 
                         every day. Ain't that right, Homer?

                                     HOMER
                         Right.

               Camera closes on Candy.

               INT./EXT. WALLY'S CAR - DRIVE-IN THEATRE - EVENING

               Homer and Candy sit and stare at the blank screen; they don't 
               look at each other. Candy grips the steering wheel of the 
               parked car.

                                     CANDY
                         Please don't make me say it again.

                                     HOMER
                         No, that's not it--I just want to be 
                         sure I understand you.

               Candy slumps forward with her forehead on the steering wheel.

                                     HOMER
                         I *helped* you not to think about 
                         Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't 
                         stand worrying about him, about his 
                         being killed and not coming back--
                         but when you were with me, you could 
                         stop worrying... well, for a while, 
                         anyway. This is how I helped you, 
                         right?

                                     CANDY
                         Please... that's enough. I *loved* 
                         you, too--you know I did.

                                     HOMER
                         "...did." Well, okay.

                                     CANDY
                         Please don't...

                                     HOMER
                              (sarcastically)
                         And now that Wally's coming back, 
                         and because he'll certainly *need* 
                         you...

                                     CANDY
                         You say that as though it's some 
                         awful thing!
                              (angrily)
                         I never stopped loving Wally!

               Homer lets that sink in.

                                     HOMER
                              (still sarcastic)
                         At least there's no more waiting and 
                         seeing. At least I got to see the 
                         ocean.

               Candy covers her face in her hands and cries uncontrollably, 
               unstoppably. Homer's anger keeps him impervious to her tears--
               another "first" for him. He turns and looks at her with an 
               almost clinical curiosity; then he goes back to staring at 
               the blank screen.

               EXT. ORCHARD - IN FRONT OF THE APPLE MART - DAWN

               The rain has stopped but the grass is wet, the trees 
               glistening in the dawn light as Wally's car stops and Homer 
               gets out. The car exits the frame in one direction; Homer, 
               walking, exits the frame in another.

               EXT. CIDER HOUSE - DAWN

               As he walks toward the cider house, Homer sees Muddy and 
               Peaches and Hero waving to him from the roof.

                                     MUDDY
                         Rose Rose has runned away!

                                     PEACHES
                         She took off in the night!

                                     MUDDY
                         She took off on the bicycle, man.

               Homer starts jogging, then running toward the cider house. 
               Muddy comes down the ladder to meet him.

               INT. BUNKHOUSE - EARLY MORNING

               Rose Rose's bed is exposed. The curtains are flung open; her 
               bed is empty. Mr. Rose is still in his bed, in the fetal 
               position we have seen before. Mr. Rose's trancelike expression 
               doesn't change as Homer and Muddy enter.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         Ain't nobody gonna find her, Homer--
                         she's long gone.
                              (pause)
                         I swear, I didn't try and stop her--
                         I just wanna touch her hand before 
                         she go. That's all I wanna do, I 
                         swear.
                              (pause)
                         Where'd she get that knife, Muddy? 
                         That looked like *your* knife--what 
                         I seen of it.

               Muddy is scared; he looks to Homer for advice.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         If that was your knife, Muddy, I 
                         wanna thank you for givin' it to her--
                         no girl should be goin' *hitch-hikin'* 
                         if she don't got a good knife with 
                         her.

                                     HOMER
                              (seeing the blood)
                         Where'd she get you?

                                     MR. ROSE
                         She just plan misunderstand me--I 
                         was tryin' to give her my knife, I 
                         was just reachin' to touch her hand. 
                         But I understand if she misunderstand 
                         me--it's all my fault, ain't that 
                         right?

               Homer takes the blanket off him; Muddy gasps. Homer tries to 
               examine Mr. Rose's wound. Mr. Rose smiles at him.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         It's too late for the doctor now, 
                         Homer--ain't that right?

               Homer doesn't answer; he knows Mr. Rose is a goner.

                                     MR. ROSE
                              (proudly)
                         She's *good* with that knife! She's 
                         real fast. She's a lot better with 
                         that knife than *you* is, Muddy! And 
                         who do you suppose taught her?

                                     MUDDY
                         *You* taught her, I suppose...

                                     MR. ROSE
                         That's right! A girl's gotta know 
                         how to defend herself, don't she?

               He winces in pain at Homer's examination.

                                     HOMER
                              (surprised)
                         There's more than one laceration, 
                         more than one cut.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         That's 'cause I sticked my *own* 
                         knife in the wound--after she go, I 
                         sticked my *own* knife in there. I 
                         poked it all around, I just tryin' 
                         to find the same place she got me.

               Homer finds Mr. Rose's knife. There's blood everywhere.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         You listen to me: you tell them police 
                         how this happen, you tell it *this* 
                         way, you hear? My daughter, she runned 
                         off--and I so sad about it that I 
                         stabbed myself. I so unhappy that 
                         she gone, I killed myself--that what 
                         you say, you hear? That the true 
                         story--ain't that right?

               Homer and Muddy exchange a glance. Mr. Rose, with his blood-
               soaked hand, suddenly grabs Homer by the throat.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         Let me hear you say that! I so unhappy 
                         she runned away that I killed myself--
                         that what happen here, ain't that 
                         right?

                                     HOMER
                         Right?

                                     MUDDY
                         That what happen--you lost you only 
                         daughter so's you killed yourself! 
                         That's what we say, all right.

                                     MR. ROSE
                         That's right. I know you understand 
                         how I feel, Homer--you is breakin' 
                         them rules, too. Ain't that right?

               Mr. Rose dies. Muddy turns away. Homer closes Mr. Rose's 
               eyes.

               EXT. CIDER HOUSE, ROOF - MORNING

               Muddy and Hero and Peaches are sitting close together on the 
               roof, like banished children. It is from their perspective 
               that we see the police car and the ambulance--two men carrying 
               the body out of the cider house, and a cop or two talking to 
               Homer and Olive, and Homer talking to them. We hear no 
               dialogue.

               EXT. APPLE MART - DUSK

               Homer and the men load crates of apple jelly onto a truck. 
               The mood is solemn; they work with tired focus. Candy drives 
               up. The men are evasive with her; they find a reason to work 
               across the mart. Candy walks to Homer, stands next to him. 
               They say nothing for a moment, until Candy breaks the silence.

                                     CANDY
                         Do you think she'll be all right?

                                     HOMER
                         She knows how to take care of herself.

               Candy looks away; she can't think of what to say. She shoves 
               her hands into her pockets, finds a letter there, which she 
               hands to Homer.

                                     CANDY
                         This came for you a couple of days 
                         ago. Olive asked me to bring it. 
                         With everything happening, I guess 
                         she forgot.

                                     HOMER
                         Sure. Thanks.

               Homer looks at the letter from St. Cloud's; he puts it 
               unopened in his pocket without a second thought. Candy can't 
               let things end there.

                                     CANDY
                         I know you don't think much of being 
                         needed, or of me for that matter...

                                     HOMER
                         I'm sorry for what I said about Wally 
                         needing you. It was... unnecessary.

                                     CANDY
                         No, I'm the one who should be sorry. 
                         You have every right to be angry.

                                     HOMER
                         No. You warned me. I didn't listen, 
                         but you warned me.

               Candy looks surprised.

                                     HOMER
                         You told me you weren't any good at 
                         being alone.
                              (pause)
                         You told Wally, too. Right?

               Candy can only stare straight ahead.

                                     HOMER
                              (relenting)
                         He's going to be fine, Wally's going 
                         to be fine. I know he is.

               A tear rolls down Candy's cheek, Homer wipes it away; then 
               he stops touching her and looks off into the quiet orchards.

               INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT

               The pickers lie in their beds, smoking. Homer is undressing. 
               He pulls the letter out of his pocket and sits down on his 
               bed. Homer opens the letter without enthusiasm and begins to 
               read.

                                     ANGELA (V.O.)
                         Dear Homer, I am writing to tell you 
                         about Wilbur.

               INT. DISPENSARY - NIGHT

               Music is playing on the old phonograph as an exhausted Larch 
               gives himself ether.

               INT. GIRLS' DIVISION - NIGHT

               Edna is getting the girls ready for bed. Music continues 
               Over.

               INT. DISPENSARY - NIGHT

               Larch has twisted himself on the narrow bed so that his face 
               is unusually close to the windowsill, and when the ether 
               cone starts to fall off his face--and his slack hand trails 
               down, off the side of the bed--the cone becomes caught against 
               the windowsill.

               He tries to turn his face away from the cone, but he presses 
               his face into the sill--thus holding the ether-soaked cone 
               over his mouth and nose. His hands twitch, he's trying to 
               wake up; the hand that holds the ether bottle lets the bottle 
               fall. The bottle shatters against the sill; the ether spreads, 
               running red with blood from a cut on Dr. Larch's hand or 
               finger. Music continues Over. It's a funeral.

               INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               Buster is bringing in the wood as the music plays Over. Buster 
               smells the spilled ether. He heads toward the dispensary, 
               sniffing. Camera follows him into the dispensary.

               In the dispensary: Buster approaches Larch's ether-bed.

                                     BUSTER
                         Dr. Larch? Dr. Larch?

               He drops the armload of wood and runs for help.

               INT. DISPENSARY - NIGHT

               Angela enters. She feels for Larch's pulse; Larch is dead. 
               Angela opens a window. She pull's Larch's body away from the 
               windowsill. Buster joins her on the bed.

                                     ANGELA (V.O.)
                         I can assure you that the overdose 
                         was entirely accidental.

               INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT

               Homer finishes reading the letter; he puts it down, gets up, 
               and walks to a window. He stares into the night.

                                     ANGELA (V.O.)
                         Let us be happy for Dr. Larch. Dr. 
                         Larch has found a family.

                                     THE BOYS (V.O.)
                         Good night, Dr. Larch! Good night, 
                         Dr. Larch! Good night, Dr. Larch!

               Homer wipes a tear off his cheek.

               EXT. PICKERS' TRUCK - CIDER/PACKING HOUSE - MORNING

               The truck is packed for the long trip south; it passes by 
               the packing house, which looks closed for the season. No one 
               else is about. Muddy is driving slowly, his arm out the open 
               window. In the back, huddled among their belongings, are 
               Peaches and Hero (on one side) and Homer (on the other). The 
               pickers are trying to draw Homer into their conversation, 
               while Homer is giving the apple farm a good-bye look. He has 
               made up his mind about something.

                         You ever see a palm tree, Homer?

                         He ain't never been outta Maine!

                                     HERO
                         Ain't you sick of pine trees, Homer?

               Homer just smiles and shakes his head.

               EXT. WORTHINGTON HOUSE, DRIVEWAY - MORNING

               As the pickers' truck drives past, Homer is on the side of 
               the truck nearest the Worthington house and driveway; he 
               sees Olive and Candy and Ray helping Wally out of the car 
               and into a wheelchair. A NURSE stands by.

               Wally is wearing what appears to be an oversized officer's 
               coat or flight jacket, his face looking small in the overlarge 
               clothes. He can't move his legs at all, and his mouth is 
               drawn into a tight-lipped smile.

                                     PEACHES (O.S.)
                         Let me tell you somethin' about 
                         Florida, Homer.

                                     HERO (O.S.)
                         The Sunshine State!

                                     PEACHES (O.S.)
                         It's so nice 'n' warm down there, 
                         you can pick them grapefruits and 
                         oranges *naked*, if you want to.

               Olive is dissolved in tears. Candy is sobbing; she kisses 
               Wally, without ceasing, while he haltingly touches her face, 
               her hair.

               In the truck the smile is gone from Homer's face. He shakes 
               his head.

                                     HOMER
                         Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with 
                         you. But I've got to move on.

                                     MUDDY
                         Yeah, well... you could move on with 
                         *us*, man! You could move on somewhere 
                         *warm*!

                                     PEACHES
                         Homer, stayin' in Maine ain't movin' 
                         on!

               This makes all the pickers laugh, but Homer just smiles and 
               shakes his head. He watches the Worthington house disappear 
               from view.

               INT. MOVING TRAIN - PASSENGER CAR - NIGHT

               A CONDUCTOR, taking tickets, comes to Homer, who is better 
               dressed than we've ever seen him; he is looking at his sober 
               reflection in the black window-glass of the night train when 
               the conductor gets his attention. When the conductor moves 
               on, Homer takes Angela's letter out of his breast pocket; he 
               skips ahead to the end.

                                     ANGELA (V.O.)
                         Dr. Larch often wondered how the 
                         world was treating you.

               EXT. ST. CLOUD'S - GRAVEYARD - AFTERNOON

                                     ANGELA (V.O.)
                         He talked a lot about you, hoping 
                         you would be of use, whatever you 
                         were up to.

               Angela and Buster and Mary Agnes and Edna carry Larch's 
               coffin; they set it down by the raw hole. The pile of fresh 
               dirt stands out against the new snow; the hole is black 
               against the new white.

                                     EDNA (O.S.)
                         "Oh, Lord, support us all the day 
                         long..."

               We see the wheelbarrow with the gravestone.

                                     EDNA (O.S.)
                         "...until the shadows lengthen and 
                         the evening comes, and the busy world 
                         is hushed, and the fever of life is 
                         over, and our work is done."

               INT. GIRLS' DIVISION - NIGHT

               We see the faces of the girls praying for Larch (Mary Agnes, 
               too) as Edna finishes her favorite prayer.

                                     EDNA
                         "Then, in Thy mercy grant us a safe 
                         lodging, and a holy rest, and peace 
                         at the last."

               INT. MOVING TRAIN - PASSENGER CAR - NIGHT

               Camera closes on Homer, sleeping to the sound of the rocking 
               train. Angela's letter lies in his lap.

                                     THE GIRLS (O.S.)
                         Amen! Amen! Amen!

               EXT. ST. CLOUD'S - TRAIN STATION - EARLY MORNING

               The train stops, blowing snow. Homer steps off the train 
               carrying a suitcase and Dr. Larch's bag. The disapproving 
               stationmaster is still disapproving. Music plays Over, 
               something triumphant.

               EXT. ST. CLOUD'S - THE HILL - EARLY MORNING

               Homer makes his way up the hill toward the orphanage. Music 
               Over.

               EXT. ORPHANAGE - EARLY MORNING

               Edna is breaking up fights; this time, instead of fighting 
               over snowballs, the orphans are fighting over their pumpkins. 
               Suddenly Homer tops the brow of the hill and they all see 
               him. Buster is the first to catch sight of Homer; he runs 
               toward him. Mary Agnes also sees Homer; she immediately turns 
               away and runs inside. Music FADES OUT Over.

               INT. LAVATORY - EARLY MORNING

               Mary Agnes crashes into the bathroom and stumbles up to the 
               mirror; she starts to fix herself up with shaking hands.

               INT. ORPHANAGE, FRONT HALL - EARLY MORNING

               Everyone has heard the news; they come on the run. The 
               children flock around Homer, hugging him. Homer takes Angela 
               and Edna in his arms. Mary Agnes joins the group. Homer takes 
               in how changed, how attractive she is. They smile awkwardly 
               at each other.

               INT. BOYS' DIVISION - EVENING

               Homer's suitcase is open on the bed; we see Homer's hands as 
               he begins to unpack. Smaller hands reach in and root through 
               the clothes.

                                     CURLY (O.S.)
                         Did you bring something for me?

               Curly continues his search. Homer thinks for a second; then 
               reaches into his pocket and pulls out the piece of pale-green 
               glass.

                                     HOMER
                         You know what? I did.

               Homer hands the piece of glass to Curly.

                                     HOMER
                         It's from the ocean. It's for you.

               Curly is duly impressed; he walks away to examine his new 
               treasure. Homer continues unpacking. He pulls his X ray out 
               and puts it aside.

                                     BUSTER
                         What are you doing here?

               Homer turns to see Buster, Mary Agnes, Angela, and Edna in 
               the doorway.

                                     MARY AGNES
                         We made up a room for you.

                                     ANGELA
                         Wouldn't you be more comfortable by 
                         yourself?

               Homer smiles; he nods.

               Angela and Mary Agnes start to put Homer's things back in 
               his bag. Edna picks up the X ray and looks at it with a somber 
               expression.

                                     EDNA
                         Homer, do you know what this is?

                                     HOMER
                         Sure. It's my heart.

                                     ANGELA
                              (shakes her head)
                         Actually, it's Fuzzy's. There's 
                         nothing wrong with your heart.

                                     HOMER
                         Fuzzy's?!

                                     EDNA
                         Dr. Larch wanted to keep you out of 
                         the war, Homer--that's why he did 
                         it. That's why he told you it was 
                         yours.

               Homer is stunned; he puts his hand to his heart.

                                     ANGELA
                         I think he worried about his own 
                         heart. He said it would never stand 
                         up to Homer Wells going off to war.

               Homer takes that in; he nods. Mary Agnes touches him 
               sympathetically.

               INT. LARCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Homer looks at his fake diplomas; they are now framed and 
               hanging on the office wall. Homer surveys the office, as if 
               for the first time; he sits down in the desk chair, as if 
               slowly getting used to his new position.

               INT. BOYS' DIVISION - NIGHT

               Homer reads to the boys from "David Copperfield". While his 
               voice is strong--positive, optimistic, certainly reassuring 
               to the boys--there is in the conclusion of the chapter 
               something that distracts him. He seems to hesitate; he misses 
               a line or two, and perhaps he purposely skips one or two 
               others. (Possibly Homer's eyes wander ahead, to the title of 
               the next chapter: "I Make Another Beginning.")

                                     HOMER
                         "Thus I began my new life, in a new 
                         name, and with everything new about 
                         me... I felt... like one in a dream... 
                         The remembrance of that life is 
                         fraught with so much... want of 
                         hope... Whether it lasted for a year, 
                         or more, or less, I do not know. I 
                         only know that it was, and ceased to 
                         be; and... there I leave it."

               Homer stops and looks at the boys' faces.

                                     CURLY
                         What happens next?

               Homer smiles.

                                     HOMER
                         That's tomorrow, Curly. Let's mot 
                         give the story away.

               Homer puts out the lights and leaves the boys in the familiar 
               semi-darkness. Seconds, later, the closed door to the hall 
               is flung open, flooding the room with light from the hall, 
               and Homer, dressed in his long white laboratory coat and 
               looking every inch the doctor, delivers his best imitation 
               of Larch's popular blessing.

                                     HOMER
                         Good night, you Princes of Maine! 
                         You Kings of New England!

               On Copperfield and Steerforth and Curly as the door to the 
               hall is closed and semi-darkness prevails in the room again. 
               Copperfield, smiling, shuts his eyes. After a second, the 
               wide-eyed Steerforth shuts his eyes, too. Then Curly.

               The last to close his eyes is Buster.

                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

                                         THE END

	1  GIANCALDO. SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. EXT/INT. DAY
	
	The October sun slashes through the gray clouds, cuts across the
	shadow towards the sea, along the coast where the new suburbs of the
	city of Giancaldo have been built up.
	
	Bright light streams through the windows, glancing off the white
	walls in an almost blinding reflection. MARIA, a woman a little over
	sixty, is trying to find somebody on the phone.
	
				MARIA  
		...Salvatore, that's right, 
		Salvatore. Di Vita Salvatore
		...But, miss, what do you mean you 
		don't know him?!...I...Yes...
			(She gives a nervous sigh. 
			She has dialed her way 
			through endless numbers 
			but still hasn't managed 
			to speak to Mr. Di
			Vita. She finally heaves a 
			sigh of relief.)
		...That's right, good for you! 
		Oh!...yes...And I'm his
		mother. I'm calling from Sicily. Been 
		trying all day...Ah, he's not 
		there...But would you be so kind as 
		to give me...?...Yes...
			(She nods at another woman 
			around forty sitting 
			nearby: it is LIA, her 
			daughter, who jots down 
			the numbers her 
			mother dictates:)
		...Six, five, six, two, two, oh, 
		six...Thanks ever so
		much...Goodbye. Goodbye.
	
	She hangs up, takes the number LIA has jotted down, determined to have still 
	another try. LIA speaks to her as if she were a baby, to be more convincing.
	
				LIA  
		Look, Ma...It's useless calling him. 
		He'll be terribly busy, God knows 
		where he is. Besides he might not 
		even remember. Do as I say, forget 
		it...He hasn't been here for thirty 
		years. You know how he is. 
	
	MARIA pauses to think it over. The decision she has to make is important. Then, 
	stubbornly.
	
				MARIA  
		He'll remember! He'll remember! 
			(She puts on her glasses 
			and starts dialing 
			the number.)
		...I'm positive. I know him better 
		than you do. If he were to find 
		out we hadn't told him, he'd be 
		angry. I know. 
			(She takes off her 
			glasses.)
		...Hello? Good morning. Could I 
		please speak to Mr. Salvatore Di 
		Vita. I'm his mother...
	
	2  ROME. STREETS. EXT/INT. NIGHT
	
	It's late, but there is still traffic on the streets heading downtown.
	Inside a high-powered car, a man  around fifty is driving. It is
	SALVATORE Dl VITA. Elegant, just growing gray, a handsome face
	creased by deep wrinkles. His weary expression hides the determined,
	sell-assured manner of the successful self-made man. He must be a
	heavy smoker judging by the way he draws the last puffs on his
	cigarette.
	
	He stops at a red light. He stubs out the cigarette and rolls down the
	window, as a little Fiat Uno pulls up alongside. A rock tune plays full
	blast on the radio. SALVATORE turns instinctively to have a look at the
	man at the wheel  a BOY with a brush cut standing straight in the latest
	fashion. He studies the Boy's expression with almost exaggerated
	attention, but devoid of curiosity, coldly. The GIRL sitting beside him,
	lots of curly hair, overripe red lips, returns SALVATORE'5 look,
	provocatively. The BOY notices, turns to SALVATORE in a surly voice:
	
				BOY  
		Hey! What the fuck you looking at!?
	
	Green light. The Fiat Uno shoots off, leaving a trail of music in its wake.
	
	3  ROME. SALVATORE S APARTMENT. INT. NIGHT 
	
	The apartment is luxurious, tastefully furnished. There is no one waiting for 
	SALVATORE. Through the picture window on the terrace, the city can be seen 
	slumbering in the night. SALVATORE gets undressed on his way to the bedroom. He 
	moves quietly, as if to make no noise. He doesn't even turn on the light, 
	finishes getting undressed in the pale blue glow coming from the picture window. 
	A rustling sound, a movement on the bed, the voice of a woman waking up. 
	
				CLARA  
		Salvatore...But what time is it? 
	
	She turns on the bedside light. It is CLARA, a young woman around thirty. 
	SALVATORE climbs in beside her under the covers, kisses her sweetly, then in a 
	whisper.
	
				SALVATORE  
		It's late, Clara. Sorry, but I wasn't 
		able to let you know I wouldn't be 
		corning...
			(He fondles her, but he is 
			tired, feels like 
			sleeping.) 
		Go to sleep now. Sleep.
	
	He turns over on the other side. CLARA shuts her eyes, is about to drop off, 
	but whispers.
	
				CLARA  
		Your mother phoned. She took me for 
		somebody else...
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Surprised) 
		And what'd you tell her?
	
				CLARA  
		I played dumb, so as not to 
		disappoint her. We had a nice little 
		talk. She says you never go see her, 
		and when she wants to see you she has 
		to come to Rome...Is it true?
	
	SALVATORE doesn't answer. God only knows how often he's heard that question 
	before.
	
				SALVATORE  
		She phoned just to say that? 
	
	She reaches out to switch of the light, buries her head into the pillow.
	
				CLARA  
		She said a certain Alfredo had died. 
		And the funeral's taking place 
		tomorrow afternoon...
			(A strange look suddenly 
			comes into SALVATORE'S 
			eyes. The idea of going to 
			sleep has clearly left 
			him. It's a piece of news 
			he didn't expect. That's 
			taken him off-guard. CLARA 
			would like to carry on the 
			conversation, but 
			sleepiness makes 
			it almost impossible. An 
			she can manage is one last 
			question in a faint little 
			voice:)
		Who is it? A relative of yours?
	
				SALVATORE  
		No. Sleep. Go to sleep.
	
	She falls asleep in the dead silence of the night. SALVATORE is seized by a 
	sort of chill a deep, troubled feeling. He gazes through the window al the city, 
	with its shimmering lights still moving in the darkness, suddenly shrouded in a 
	heavy curtain of rain. But he gazes off, beyond the row of houses, beyond the 
	dark sky; the shadow of a wind chime plays across his face summoning up endless 
	memories, drawing forth from the infinite depths of oblivion a past that he 
	thought had vanished, been wiped out, and instead now re-emerges, comes back to 
	life, takes on light, superimposing itself on the mellow middle-aged features of 
	his face, in the shadow of the city shaken by the storm, until another image is 
	formed, an ancient, remote image...
	
	4  GIANCALDO. CHURCH AND SACRISTY. INT. MORNING
	
	An image from over forty years before. In the baroque church of
	Giancaldo. SALVATORE is nine years old. Dressed as an altar boy, he
	is kneeling by the altar with a little silver bell in his hands. The
	congregation is also kneeling. The PRIEST is consecrating the Host.
	Little SALVATORE has just got out of bed, is still half-asleep, yawns
	and doesn't notice that the PRIEST is standing there with the Host in
	the air glaring at him, as if trying to tell him something.
	
				PRIEST  
		Pss! Pssst!
	
	SALVATORE finishes yawning and opening his eyes meets the
	withering look of the PRIEST. He gets the message at once and
	rings the bell. Now the PRIEST can carry on, lifts the chalice and
	the bell is heard again.
	
						Cut to:
	
	The service is over. The PRIEST is in the sacristy removing his
	vestments. And SALVATORE is also there, removing his altar-boy
	tunic.
	
				PRIEST  
		But how can I make you understand? 
		Without the bell I just can't go on! 
		Always half asleep, you are! What do 
		you do at night anyway? Eat instead 
		of sleep?
	
				SALVATORE  
		Father, at my house we don't even eat 
		at noon. That's why I'm always 
		sleepy. That's what the vet says.
	
	The PRIEST has finished disrobing. He takes the bell
	SALVATORE was holding during the service and turns to leave.
	
				PRIEST  
		All right, Toto, get moving, I've got 
		things to do. Say hello to your 
		mother.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Can I...
	
				PRIEST  
			(Interrupting him) 
		And don't ask if you can come...
		Because you can't!! Shoo, shoo, off 
		with you!!
	
	SALVATORE gives a shrug and leaves. The PRIEST goes down a
	corridor, opens a door, another corridor, and finally a door
	leading to an outside courtyard. He cuts across it and disappears
	into another door.
	
	5  CINEMA PARADISO AND PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. MORNING
	
	The PRIEST enters a movie house. Not very big  200 seats on the main
	floor and another seventy in the balcony. Along the walls, posters of
	films to be shown are stuck up between the light fixtures. In one corner,
	a statue of the Virgin Mary with flowers. The CLEANING LADY has
	finished work and is leaving. Up in the balcony, over the last row of
	seats, are the holes of the projection booth. The middle hole is
	camouflaged by the huge head of a roaring lion, all in plaster, and the
	lens of the projector can be glimpsed between its sharp teeth.
	there are two smaller holes, through which the figure of a man can be
	made out, appearing and disappearing...It is ALFREDO, the
	projectionist. He is around forty, skinny and bony with a tough
	peasant face. He has finished loading the projector and is checking the
	carbons in the arc lamp. Then he removes the glass from one of the
	holes and looks down into the theatre, at the PRIEST who waves his
	hand.
	
				PRIEST  
		OK, Alfredo, you can start!!
	
	He sits down an by himself in the middle of the empty theatre.
	Up in the booth, ALFREDO lights the arc lamp and sets the
	projector going.
	
	Down in the theatre, the light goes off and out of the lion's mouth
	streams the glowing ray aimed al the screen. String music, sweet
	and ominous, spreads through the theatre. On the screen appear
	the credit titles of an American film of the 1940s. The PRIEST
	screws up his face and holds the bell in his right hand resting on
	the arm of his seat.
	
	At the back of the theatre, behind the last row, a curtain moves,
	opens a crack and SALVATORE'S gaunt little face appears. He
	has managed to sneak in somehow and stands there without a
	word, spellbound, watching the 'movie' on the glowing screen.
	The credit titles have long come and gone. The story is at a
	turning-point. 
	
	Up above, in the hole of the booth next to the lion,
	ALFREDO watches the film, but his eyes keep looking down at the
	PRIEST, who is now drumming the bell with his fingers. On the
	screen, the male and female lead, two Hollywood stars, are in
	close-up; the dialogue is passionate, romantic. SALVATORE,
	carried away by those faces, by the way they talk, by the beauty
	of the woman, slowly slips down the length of the curtain until he
	is sitting on the floor, his eyes glued to the screen. 
	
	The love scene reaches a climax, the music crescendos, and the love-struck 
	couple finally fall into each other's arms and kiss. Instinctively, the PRIEST 
	raises the bell into the air, as in some age-old ceremony, and gives it a loud 
	ring...
	
	Up in the booth ALFREDO hears the bell; it's the signal he's been
	waiting for. He takes a slip of paper from a pad prepared for that
	purpose and sticks it into the loops of the film containing that
	specific scene as it winds on to the reel. The projection
	continues...
	
	...And also the kiss of the two actors. The PRIEST'S nervous look lingers on 
	those black-and-white lips meeting and now pulling apart for one last 
	declaration of love before separating. SALVATORE is wide-eyed, he's probably 
	never seen a man and woman kiss before, it's a vision that for him has all the 
	attraction of forbidden fruit, the horror of sin. The screen is now filled with 
	the figure of a woman getting undressed, showing for one instant the white, 
	voluptuous flesh of her broad, naked shoulders. SALVATORE stares in open-mouthed 
	wonder. The PRIEST, in a fury, grabs the bell and shakes it for all he is worth. 
	From the sound of the bell to another sound...
	
	6  GIANCALDO. MAIN SQUARE. EXT. DAY 
	
	The tolling of the bell-tower rings out over the 
	square. It is noon. The vast square, pale and dusty, is alive with people. A 
	noisy line of men, women and cows waits in front of the fountain to get water. 
	Peddlers hawk their wares in mournful cries. People come and go in front of the 
	town hall. The working men's club is deserted. The entrance of the Cinema 
	Paradiso is shut. Hanging outside is the poster of the film that has just been 
	seen on screen. Up above, the windows of the projection booth are open. The hum 
	of the projector can be heard and the loud, lofty music typical of 'THE END'. 
	Then dead silence. The showing is over.
	
	7. CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. DAY
	
	Despite the speed, numerous white streaks spin around on the reel,
	created by the slips of paper ALFREDO has inserted into the loops. He
	is rewinding the film by hand on the film-winder. When he's not
	talking, ALFREDO usually sings to himself. SALVATORE stands beside
	him, taking in everything he does with those quick, thieving eyes of his
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Harshly, shouting) 
		You must not come here! How many 
		times do I have to tell you?
			(And he slows down the 
			reels with his hand. The 
			slips of paper
			are about to arrive. 
			Here's the first.)
		If the film catches fire, runt that 
		you are, you'd go up in a
		burst of flame...whoosh! And turn 
		into a piece of...
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Overlapping him)
		...and turn into a piece of 
		charcoal!!
	
	He's used to his terrorisms, pays no more attention. Not even his
	grim look scares him. Anyway, ALFREDO catches the joke, starts to give him a 
	slap, but instead reaches over and picks up a pair of scissors.
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Angrily) 
		Christ, that's a sassy little tongue 
		you've got! Watch out, or someday 
		I'll snip it off. 
	
	And he snips a piece of film, pastes the ends together and goes on turning the 
	handle. SALVATORE picks up the strip of film and gives it a closer look. He sees 
	a series of frames all alike with a man kissing a woman.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Can I have it? 
	
	ALFREDO snatches it out of his hand, furiously, at the end of his string. He 
	shouts.
	
				ALFREDO  
		No!!! Are you deaf or something? I've 
		got to put this back in when we wind 
		up the film again! You're a real pain 
		in the neck! 
	
	SALVATORE reaches into a basket full of strips of film. He takes out a handful: 
	all kisses that have been cut.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Then why didn't you put these back 
		when you wound up the films again? 
	
	ALFREDO is caught out. He stops the film where another slip of paper is stuck 
	in and cuts the scene:
	
				ALFREDO  
		'Cause sometimes you can't find the 
		right place any more and so...well, 
		actually...they stay here. 
			(Finding an excuse) 
		Besides, there are more kisses than 
		you can count.
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Excited) 
		So I can have these? 
			(ALFREDO explodes, flies 
			off the handle. He grabs 
			SALVATORE by the shoulders 
			and shakes him.)
	
				ALFREDO  
		Look, Toto! Before I kick your ass 
		all the way to China and back, let's 
		make a deal. These strips here are 
		yours, I give them to you. However! 
		One  you're not to stick your nose in 
		here any more. Two  I'll keep them 
		for you, because you can't take them 
		home for God forbid and save our 
		souls, if they catch fire, all hell 
		will break loose! OK? Oh!!! And now 
		scram! 
	
	He takes him and turns him towards the stairs. For him the matter is closed. He 
	returns to the film-winder. SALVATORE sneaks back and while ALFREDO's attention 
	is elsewhere, snatches up a handful of movie frames scattered on the counter, 
	stuffs them into his pocket and...
	
				SALVATORE  
		What sort of deal is this? The strips 
		are mine! So why can't I come see 
		them? 
	
	And he stares at ALFREDO with a sly, saucy look. ALFREDO clutches his hand, 
	darts forth like an arrow and is about to give him a kick in the ass. He 
	shrieks:
	
				ALFREDO  
		Get out!! And don't show your face 
		here again! 
	
	And before the kick reaches its destination, SALVATORE has already dashed off 
	down the spiral staircase.
	
	8  GIANCALDO. SALVATORE'S HOUSE. INT. EVENING
	
	That was not the first theft of film strips. SALVATORE's hand reaches
	into a flowery metal box jammed full of pieces of film. He takes out a
	few frames and holds them up against the kerosene lamp. Gazes at the
	figures that remind him of the films seen at Cinema Paradiso, and in a
	whisper mangles fragments of dialogue, the shooting of guns, the
	musical climaxes...
	
				SALVATORE  
		Bang! Bang! Bang! Shoot first, think 
		later! This is no job for weaklings! 
		Treacherous dog!
	
	The house has no lights, is gloomy and cold. SALVATORE's
	mother, MARIA, is leaning on the table in front of him. She is
	young, around thirty, and her pretty face is haggard, marred by
	all the sacrifices. She is sewing some clothes, is a seamstress. LIA,
	his four-year-old sister, is sleeping on a cot in one corner. The
	kerosene lamp projects the trembling shadow of the film strips on
	the wall, figures of prairies, gunslingers, thugs. SALVATORE's
	voice changes, turns even tougher.
	
				SALVATORE
		Hey there, you lousy bastard, take 
		your hands off that gold, You black-
		hearted pig, stay away from me, or 
		I'll smash your face in! 
		'Ntantatah!!!...
			(In the heap of movie 
			frames there are also 
			several photographs. 
			SALVATORE picks them up. 
			Family keepsakes. A man in 
			an army uniform. Then the 
			same man with a girl 
			beside him whose smiling 
			face can be recognized as 
			MARIA. SALVATORE takes a 
			closer look at the man's 
			face, then whispers to his 
			mother:)
		Ma, if the war's over, how come 
		Daddy's never come back?
	
	MARIA looks up at him with a sweet smile.
	
				MARIA  
		He'll be back, he'll be back...
		You'll see. One of these
		days...
	
	But there is not much conviction written on her face. She looks
	back down at her sewing. SALVATORE goes on looking at the
	photos.
	
				SALVATORE  
		I don't remember him any moreMa, 
		where's Russia?
	
				MARIA  
		It takes years to get there. And 
		years to come back...Now go to bed, 
		Toto, it's late.
	
	SALVATORE puts the photos back into the box and tucks the box
	under LIA's cot near the charcoal burner.
	
	9  GRADE SCHOOL. COURTYARD. EXT. DAY
	
	A noisy crowd of little children in black smocks, white collars and blue
	bows moves about the large courtyard where there are two tall palm
	trees. The boys head for one door, the girls towards the opposite one.
	The Janitors line them up two by two, ready to enter. Here and there,
	parents and relatives accompany the younger ones. Beneath one of the
	palms, SALVATORE pulls off the altar-boy tunic, stuffs it into the
	khaki-colored cardboard schoolbag, takes out the smock and puts it
	on, as one of his schoolmates passes by. It is MASINO, and he's crying
	desperately because he doesn't want to go to school. His FATHER drags
	him along, yelling:
	
				MASINO'S FATHER
		You can fool your mother but not me! 
		Get yourself a damn diploma and 
		become a policeman. You good-for-
		nothing!
	
				MASINO  
		I don't want to go to school'
			(The sound of the bell. 
			The black lines move up 
			the steps towards the 
			school.)
	
	1O  FOURTH GRADE. INT. DAY 
	
	SALVATORE is sitting at the front-row desk next to PEPPINO, 
	a little freckle-faced boy. His attention, like that of the whole class, is 
	concentrated on what is taking place at the blackboard. The TEACHER is standing 
	there, watching a plump little boy, shy and not quite all there, do a two-figure 
	multiplication  it is NICOLA SCORSONE, known as 'COLA'. He is red in the face, 
	has one purple ear and one white one. He stares in terror at that '255 x 15' 
	written on the blackboard. The TEACHER yells, waving a birch rod in her hand. 
	
				TEACHER  
		Well then?! Five times five 
		equals...? 
	
	COLA stops to think a moment, then... 
	
				COLA  
		Thirty!
	
	The TEACHER grabs him by the purple ear and bashes his head against the numbers 
	on the blackboard. A large thud echoes through the room, followed by a roar of 
	laughter. The TEACHER slams her rod on the desk.
	
				TEACHER  
		Silence!! 
			(Then to COLA) 
		The five times table. Dunce! One 
		times five, five!!
			(The class repeats with 
			the TEACHER, in a sing-
			song chorus:)
	
				TEACHER and CLASS  
		Two times five, ten! Three times 
		five, fifteen! Four times five, 
		twenty!
			(With a wave of the rod, 
			the TEACHER silences the 
			class, and finishes the 
			sing-song with the fateful 
			question.)
	
				TEACHER  
		Five times five?
	
				COLA  
			(Timidly) 
		Forty...?
	
	Another blow of the head on the blackboard. Hubbub.
	Slapping of the rod on the desk. SALVATORE secretly shows
	COLA the picture of a Christmas tree on one page of the book,
	and mouths the word 'twenty-five'. COLA smiles, he has finally
	caught on.
	
				TEACHER  
		I'm asking you for the last time, 
		blockhead! Five times five equals...?
			(COLA turns to her with 
			smiling eyes and answers 
			blissfully:)
	
				COLA  
		Christmas!!
	
	SALVATORE clutches his head in anger, watches the TEACHER
	flogging COLA on the back with the rod. COLA screams at every
	blow, and at every blow the laughter in the class grows louder.
	SALVATORE stares at the rod moving up and down rhythmically. But he is not 
	thinking of the pain his schoolmate is feeling, but is drawn, rather, by that 
	strange regular beat, finds it similar to another regular beat, that of...
	
	11  CINEMA PARADISO. BALCONY AND MAIN FLOOR. INT. DAY
	
	...the rolling pin ALFREDO uses to flatten out a reel of film that has just 
	been unloaded. SALVATORE carefully watches ALFREDO 5 every move. He is not in 
	the projection booth, but up in the balcony, standing on top of the last row of 
	seats. He peers through the hole next to the lion's head. His bright little eyes 
	fix in his mind the things ALFREDO does, as he loads the film into the 
	projector, shuts the fireproof housings, turns on the amplifier, checks the 
	carbons in the arc lamp, then lowers his head to have a look into the theatre 
	and finds himself face to face with SALVATORE.
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Sternly) 
		What are you doing here? 
	
				SALVATORE  
		I bought a ticket. I've come to see 
		the film.
			(Meanwhile the USHER comes 
			up behind him and grabs 
			him by the collar, and he 
			almost jumps out of his 
			skin. ALFREDO laughs.)
	
				USHER  
			(Yelling) 
		Go sit downstairs! You good-for-
		nothing sponger! ! 
			(To the audience) 
		Worse than rabbits they are!
	
	SALVATORE has run downstairs. The main floor is more
	crowded than the balcony, like every Sunday, and there is a greatdin. The BOY 
	selling ice-cream, soda pop and candy shouts and
	runs around like a chicken with its head off. Now the lights dim,
	the hubbub dies down and the performance starts. Before the film
	there is a preview for Stagecoach. The screen fills with images ofJohn Wayne, 
	the pursuit of the stagecoach by hostile Indians
	etc...
	
	SALVATORE is sitting in the front rows, right under the screen,
	next to BOCCIA, COLA, MASINO, PEPPINO and OTHER KIDS, all with their noses in 
	the air. BOCCIA, the biggest show off of the group, is smoking a cigarette. An 
	OLD MAN appears through the entrance curtain, takes a couple of steps and 
	shouts:)
	
				FIRST OLD MAN  
		Hello, everybody!
	
				AUDIENCE  
			(At once) 
		Ssssssh!!! Ssssssh! Silence!
	
				FIRST OLD MAN  
		Can't I say hello?
	
				USHER  
		It's a double-feature today.
	
				FIRST OLD MAN  
		I couldn't care less. I come here to 
		sleep.
	
	All at once, a chorus of shouts and whistles fills the theatre. Up
	on the screen, a globe of the world appears, spinning among the
	stars, the logo announcing the newsreel.
	
				AUDIENCE  
			(Hooting and whistling) 
		For Christ's sake! Cut it, 
		Alfredoooo!
	
	The CHILDREN in the front rows also yell, but SALVATORE goes
	on being alert. He turns and looks up at the holes of the projection
	booth, as if it were an impregnable fortress. He watches the crazy
	dancing of light in the glowing stream that opens towards him in a
	cone. And besides, that lion's head, mysterious, almost gruesome,
	emphasizes the enigmatic secret of the movies. In his dreamy eyes,
	that lifeless lion seems to wake up with a ferocious roar.
	
	SALVATORE has a frightened look...Another lion roaring. But up on the screen. 
	The MGM lion. The throng of children imitate the famous growl all together, 
	shaking their heads in unison.
	
				CHILDREN  
		Grrrr! Grrrrr! 
	
	The film starts: it is Visconti's La terra trema. SALVATORE is in bliss. His 
	wide eyes looking up at the magic square of light. The title music. Another OLD 
	MAN enters at the back of the theatre, but before sitting down, says hello in a 
	loud voice.
	
				SECOND OLD MAN  
		Greetings to one and all!
	
				AUDIENCE  
		SSSSSH' Drop dead! Silence! Hey, 
		kids, we're here to see the film! 
	
	Now there is an important sequence. The audience is silent. Concentrated on the 
	screen. BOCCIA passes the lighted cigarette to SALVATORE. He takes a puff and 
	hands it on to the others without ever taking his eyes off the screen. The 
	beautiful star of the film appears on screen. A different kind of attention 
	takes hold of the excited audience. SALVATORE and the others stare at her with 
	open mouths...She leans towards the leading man, a languid expression, their 
	profiles touch. But all at once, just at the best part, there is a sudden jolt. 
	
	The kiss isn't seen.
	
				AUDIENCE  
			(Disappointed) 
		Ahhh! What a shame! I've been going 
		to the movies for twenty years and I 
		never saw a kiss! 
	
	SALVATORE is the only one to laugh to himself. He knows what has happened.
	
				AUDIENCE  
		And when will we see one? 
	
	Up in the balcony, the audience is more sedate. The tickets cost more and the 
	people are richer, more refined. Among them, a MAN with a moustache, the look of 
	a public notary, is sitting right in front of the railing. Seriously, without 
	batting an eye, he spits down below with contempt. Right on the dot, a voice is 
	heard, followed by a chorus of protests.
	
				VOICE and AUDIENCE  
		Bugger!!! Ssssh!!! Silence!!
	
	12  SQUARE AND ENTRANCE OF CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. NIGHT
	
	The bell-tower rings midnight. The square is nearly deserted. Except
	for a landowner near the refreshment stand, with a moustache and a
	hat, DON VINCENZO by name, who is picking out from a group of
	labourers the men he'll be needing in the country at dawn. He chooses,
	points his finger, calls...
	
	People come out of the movie house after the last showing.
	The USHER locks the front door as ALFREDO climbs down from the
	projection booth. Among the crowd there is only one kid, SALVATORE.
	Tired, half-asleep. He's seen all the showings. He starts to walk away
	when he catches sight of his mother standing on the opposite corner,
	wrapped in an old coat. She's waiting for him, in a temper.
	SALVATORE drops his eyes to the ground, mortified. He knows what's
	coming. He goes over to her timidly, uncertain, gives her a questioning
	look.
	
				MARIA  
		I've been looking for you all day. 
		Did you buy the milk?
	
				SALVATORE  
		No...
	
				MARIA  
		Then where's the money?
	
				SALVATORE  
		Somebody stole it.
	
	MARIA gives him a slap. SALVATORE holds back the sobs, but
	his eyes brim with tears. ALFREDO and the USHER are nearby,
	have heard everything.
	
				MARIA  
		What'd you do with the money? Go to 
		the movies?
	
	SALVATORE nods his head and the sobs increase. MARIA, in
	despair, flies off the handle, slaps him again, but looks as if she
	doesn't really want to, as if deep down she forgives her son's
	escapade. ALFREDO catches on, speaks up on behalf of
	SALVATORE.
	
				ALFREDO  
		Signora Maria, don't do that. He's 
		just a kid. 
			(To SALVATORE) 
		And why are you telling fibs? 
			(To MARIA) 
		We let him in free. He must have lost 
		the money inside the movie
		theatre...
			(SALVATORE stares at him 
			in amazement, goes on 
			listening to him.)
		How much did you have?
	
				SALVATORE  
		Fifty lire...
			(MARIA wipes away his tears.)
	
				ALFREDO  
			(To the USHER) 
		What you find tonight on the floor 
		between the seats?
			(The USHER reaches into-
			his pockets, pulls out 
			some odds and ends.)
	
				USHER  
		A comb, two heel-savers, a box of 
		tobacco...
			(ALFREDO very skillfully 
			reaches out with fifty 
			lire he has taken
			from his pocket. And like 
			a magician he draws the 
			money out of
			the USHER'S hand.)
	
				ALFREDO 
		...and fifty lire! 
			(To MARIA) 
		See?
			(He hands over the money 
			under the USHER'S 
			astonished eyes.)
	
				MARIA  
		Thanks, Uncle Alfredo. Thanks. Good-
		night.
	
	She walks away, dragging SALVATORE by the hand. ALFREDO
	gives him a wink. SALVATORE smiles and winks back, but he's
	not very good at it; he can't manage to shut only one eye.
	Everybody leaves and the square empties, as the VILLAGE IDIOT
	comes up to the group of labourers, beside DON VINCENZO,
	motioning them all to get moving.
	
				IDIOT  
		It's midnight. I've got to shut down 
		the square! Go away.
		The square's mine! The square's 
		mine!!
	
	13  CEMETERY ROAD AND VILLAGE ROAD. EXT. DAY
	
	SALVATORE, dressed as an altar boy, walks alongside the PRIEST
	who is wearing the ceremonial vestments. They are tired, have walked
	a long way. Behind them a donkey pulls a wagon containing a little
	white coffin and a bunch of flowers. Behind that a little procession  the
	parents and relatives of the dead child. The road is very wide, covered
	with white earth. The spring sun is dazzling. The funeral procession
	kicks up a cloud of dust that makes everything blurred and hazy, like a
	dream, rimmed around the horizon by the blue line of the sea. The
	procession now turns into the large gate of the cemetery. ALFREDO,
	working in the fields, takes his hat off and watches the coffin as it passes by.
	
						Cut to:
	
	The funeral is over. The PRIEST and SALVATORE are walking back
	to the village. ALFREDO appears out of the countryside on e bicycle
	with a hoe and other farm tools in the basket. He comes pedaling up
	beside them.
	
				ALFREDO  
		Good morning, father. It's hard on 
		the feet, huh?
	
				PRIEST  
			(Breathless) 
		Yeah!...Getting there's downhill and 
		all the saints help you. But coming 
		back! The saints stand there watching 
		you, that's all! God's will be done.
	
	SALVATORE is about to open his mouth, wants to say something
	to ALFREDO, but he doesn't have time. ALFREDO pedals harder
	and rides off.
	
	SALVATORE is crestfallen. He looks et the PRIEST, then at the bicycle riding 
	away. His eyes light up  an idea! He suddenly yells:
	
				SALVATORE  
		Ouch! Ouch! My foot! I can't walk!
	
	He limps. Throws himself to the ground as if a snake had bitten him. The PRIEST 
	leans over in alarm. Up ahead in the distance, ALFREDO turns around to look.
	
						Cut to:
	
	There is a smile on SALVATORE'S face. He is riding on the crossbar of ALFREDO's 
	bicycle. On their way back lo the village.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Alfredo, did you know my father?
	
				ALFREDO  
		Of course I knew your father. He was 
		tall, thin, pleasant, and had a 
		moustache like mine. Always smiling. 
		He looked like Clark Gable. 
	
	There's something SALVATORE wants to talk about, but he doesn't know how to 
	start. He has a try with an innocent stratagem.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Alfredo, now that I'm older, I'm not 
		saying I can start coming to the 
		projection booth, to the movie 
		house...But...maybe, why don't we 
		become friends? 
	
	ALFREDO knows exactly what the little rascal is up to, and answers in a 
	strange, theatrical tone, as if he were repeating something he knows by heart, a 
	remark taken from some old film.
	
				ALFREDO  
			'I choose my friends for their 
		looks, and my enemies for their 
		brains...' 
			(Laughs) 
		You're too smart to be my friend. 
		Besides, as I always tell my kids, be 
		careful to pick the right friends!
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Surprised) 
		But you don't have any kids!!!
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Spluttering) 
		All right, all right! When I've got 
		kids that's what I'm telling them! 
			(The outlying houses of 
			Giancaldo finally heave 
			into sight.)
	
	14  SALVATORE S HOUSE. EXT. DAY
	
	LIA, SALVATORE'S kid sister, is crying outside the front door, terror
	stricken. Her face is smeared with smoke and her little dress half
	scorched and soaking wet. MARIA is distraught, damp with sweat, and
	tries to console her, hugging her in her arms.
	
				MARIA  
		Stop crying...The fire is out...I'm 
		here...That'll do, that'll do...
			(ALFREDO and SALVATORE 
			come up behind them. 
			SALVATORE has barely leapt 
			off the bicycle when his 
			mother sails into him like 
			a fury, shrieking:)
		Miserable boy! You're the ruin of me! 
		Your sister would have been burnt 
		alive if I hadn't been there! And all 
		your fault!
	
	SALVATORE darts off, chased by his mother, swift as a deer.
	ALFREDO doesn't understand what has happened, leans over
	LIA, who goes on bawling her eyes out, and sees on the ground, in
	the middle of the water, a flowery box all charred and still
	smoking, and all around scraps of film reduced to ashes and
	several singed photographs, the photos of SALVATORE s father.
	ALFREDO gets the message now, looks up at MARIA, who has
	caught SALVATORE and is dragging him home, hitting and
	slapping him all the way. SALVATORE covers his head with his
	hands to stave off the blows. MARIA turns to ALFREDO, in a
	stern, indignant voice.
	
				MARIA
		But aren't you ashamed of yourself, 
		Uncle Alfredo, playing with a little 
		boy at your age?!
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Cowed) 
		But...what's it got to do with 
		me?...
	
				MARIA  
		And who gave him all those films? 
		Promise you won't give him any more 
		of this trash! Don't let him set foot 
		any more in the movie house. The 
		boy's crazy! Crazy! All he talks 
		about is movies and Alfredo' Alfredo 
		and movies!! 
	
	ALFREDO is crestfallen, didn't think that SALVATORE'S craziness, his morbid 
	passion for movies, could go this far.
	
				ALFREDO  
		I give you my word, Donna Maria. 
			(MARIA now turns one last 
			time to her son.)
	
				MARIA  
		God's got to grant me one wish! Send 
		your father back home! And he'll see 
		you get what's coming to you! 
			(SALVATORE lowers his 
			hands, looks at her and 
			with the dreadful 
			sincerity of children:)
	
				SALVATORE  
		Daddy's not coming back...He's dead. 
			(An icy flash runs through 
			MARIA'S eyes.)
	
				MARIA  
		It's not true! No! It's not true!!! 
		I'll show you he's coming back!
	
	And she beats him desperately, as if to enforce her stubborn hope, slap after 
	slap. This time ALFREDO doesn't step in, lets MARIA give vent 
	to her rage and fury, but SALVATORE'S cries make him feel guilty.
	
	15:SQUARE AND PROJECTION BOOTH. EXT/INT. DAY 
	
	Another Sunday. A crowd of men has gathered in the square around the café where 
	there is a loudspeaker. They are listening to the running commentary of the 
	soccer games. They check their Sisal pools coupons. NICOLO CAROSIO'S VOICE 
	...We're at the seventh minute of the second half. Turin is leading one to 
	zero. The goal was scored by...(The scene is seen from above, by ALFREDO who 
	peers out of the window of the projection booth. CAROSIO'S voice drowns out the 
	soundtrack of the film being shown. ALFREDO is bored. He goes over to the 
	projector, looks through the hole...It's the last sequence of the film. The 
	music swells to a climax as 'THE END' appears on the screen. Swift as ever, 
	ALFREDO turns on the lights in the theatre' stops the projector. Looks back 
	through the hole, to see...)
	
	16:CINEMA PARADISO. INT/EXT. DAY
	
	...the house packed to the rafters. Voices and laughter of the children. Smoke, 
	ice-cream, soft drinks. The USHER has opened the emergency exits to let in air. 
	He fights off the gate-crashers who are trying to get in free. The sound of the 
	sports commentary fills the theatre. The village BLACKSMITH is sleeping in his 
	seat, his head thrown back and his mouth wide open. The KIDS blow up the empty 
	ice-cream sacks and pop them next to his ears. Bang! The BLACKSMITH wakes up 
	with a start, in a sea of laughter. He yells:  
	
				BLACKSMITH  
		Ah! I'll wring all your necks!! Or my 
		good name means nothing! !! Lousy 
		brats! 
	
	SALVATORE doesn't laugh. He is sad. He turns and looks up at the projection 
	booth. He sees ALFREDO through the lion's mouth. ALFREDO also catches sight of 
	him. SALVATORE gives him a timid wave of the hand, as if asking if he can come 
	up a moment. The look on ALFREDO'S face is unmistakable, irrevocable: N0! 
	SALVATORE'S not surprised; after what happened it won't be easy to win him over. 
	Yet there must be some way. But what is it? As usual, SALVATORE is smart as the 
	devil when he's out to get something. Through the emergency exit he sees a woman 
	pass by with a packet in her hand. It is ALFREDO's WIFE, and the packet is his 
	supper. SALVATORE leaps to his feet and runs out to her.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Signora Anna!
	
	17  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION ROOM AND SQUARE. INT/EXT. DAY
	
	ALFREDO starts up the projector. It's time for the documentaries and
	cartoons. SALVATORE peers in from the top of the stairs. He's scared of
	ALFREDO'S reaction, but pricks up his courage and shows him the
	packet. ALFREDO sees him, is about to pounce on him...
	
				SALVATORE  
			(On the defensive) 
		Your wife told me to bring you this. 
	
	His expression betrays the 'put on'. ALFREDO sighs, realizes it's another one of 
	his little games.
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Sternly) 
		Give it to me!...
	
	He takes the packet, unwraps it and lifts the lid, shuts it again and puts the 
	container inside the lamp of the projector to keep it warm. SALVATORE hasn't 
	missed a single gesture, but speaks with his eyes 
	to the poor.
	
				SALVATORE  
		I told my mother you weren't the one 
		who gave me the films. That it 
		wasn't your fault. But I thought you 
		said the film could catch fire just 
		to scare me. Now that I know, I won't 
		steal any more from you. That's all I 
		wanted to say. I'm going. 
			(He turns to leave but 
			ALFREDO takes him by the 
			shoulder and stops 
			him.)
	
				ALFREDO  
		Toto, come here. 
	
	All things considered, there is something in that little boy, maybe his 
	feverish passion, that strikes him. He'll talk to him seriously, without 
	resorting to terrorism, try to convince him. He lowers the volume of the 
	monitor, sits down on the stool. SALVATORE raises his eyes from the floor and 
	looks at him at last...
	
				ALFREDO  
		Now listen to what I've got to say. I 
		took up this profession when I 
		was ten years old. In those days 
		there weren't these modern machines. 
		The films were silent. The projectors 
		were run by hand, like this, with a 
		crank. And you wound the crank all 
		day long. It was really rough going! 
		If you got tired and slowed down' 
		boom! Everything would go up in 
		flames!
	
				SALVATORE  
		Then why don't you want to teach it 
		to me too? Now that there's no more 
		cranking, and it's easier?
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Firmly) 
		Because I don't want to, Toto! This 
		is not a job for you. It's like being 
		a slave. You're always alone. You see 
		the same film over and over again, 
		because you have nothing else to do. 
		And you start talking to Greta Garbo 
		and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work 
		on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. 
		Only on Good Friday are you free. But 
		if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a 
		cross...You'd work Good Fridays too! 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Then why don't you change jobs? 
			(ALFREDO sighs, irritated. 
			He reaches out to turn the 
			knob of the carbon rods. 
			He gazes at SALVATORE as 
			if he were a grown-up, 
			somebody who's making 
			things hard for him.)
	
				ALFREDO  
		Because I'm an idiot. How many other 
		guys in town know how to be a 
		projectionist? None! Only a jerk like 
		me could do it. Besides I wasn't 
		lucky. When I was a kid there was the 
		war! When I grew up, another war! Now 
		it's all different. Times have 
		changed. And you want to be a dope 
		like me? Huh? Answer me!
	
				SALVATORE  
		No...
	
				ALFREDO  
		Good for you, Toto. Good for you...
		I'm only saying this for your own 
		good...
			(He gets up and, speaking 
			all the while, goes into a 
			closet with a bucket 
			in it, the toilet of the 
			booth. He turns his back 
			and pees. )
		Cooped up in here you die of heat in 
		the summer and of cold in the winter. 
		You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and 
		earn practically nothing. 
			(SALVATORE listens to 
			him, but taking advantage 
			of the fact he can't be 
			seen, he turns the knob of 
			the carbon rods, just as 
			he had seen done a moment 
			before...)
	
				SALVATORE  
			(In a loud voice) 
		But don't you like anything about 
		what you do? 
			(SALVATORE gazes at the 
			photos on the wall: 
			Keaton, Garbo, Snow 
			White. ALFREDO 
			smiles to himself. Sure, 
			there's something about 
			that damn job he likes:)
	
				ALFREDO  
		With time...you get used to it. 
		Besides, when you hear from up here 
		that there's a full house and that 
		people are laughing, having fun...
		Then you're happy too.
			(ALFREDO is lost in 
			thought, doesn't notice 
			that the documentaries
			and cartoons have 
			finished. The screen is 
			blank. And down in the
			theatre laughter is not 
			heard but an uproar of 
			whistling and
			swearing. SALVATORE'S eyes 
			sparkle, he seizes the 
			opportunity.
			He turns on the lights and 
			stops the projector, just 
			as ALFREDO
			would have done. At which 
			ALFREDO buttons up his 
			pants in a
			hurry and rushes over 
			alarmed, but sees that 
			everything is in order.
			SALVATORE looks at him all 
			smiles, as if he expected 
			a medal for
			civil bravery. Instead, 
			ALFREDO reacts like a wild 
			animal.)
		So I've been wasting my breath? You 
		pretend to agree with
		me, but as soon as my back is turned, 
		you do what you want!
			(He gives SALVATORE a kick 
			in the ass, shrieking:)
		Get out of here! I don't want to lay 
		eyes on you again! This is
		the last straw! Your mother's right, 
		you're crazy!!
			(He pushes him towards the 
			stairs. SALVATORE suddenly
			vanishes, scared out of 
			his wits. ALFREDO talks to 
			himself, in a
			fury:)
		But how'd he do it? The little 
		bastard! By watching, he's
		learned! It's incredible!
			(He peers out of the 
			window, yelling, as he 
			sees SALVATORE
			running through the 
			square. )
		I'm letting the box office know  
		you're not to set foot even into
		the theatre! There are no more 
		tickets for you! And I'm also
		talking to Father Adelfio! You won't 
		be an altar boy any more
		either!!! You little runt!
			(SALVATORE looks at him. 
			Hates him. Yells something 
			offensive:)
	
				SALVATORE  
		Alfredo, go fuck yourself!!! 
			(But his words are drowned 
			out by the sudden shouting 
			of the people outside the 
			café.)
	
				CROWD  
		Goal!! Holy Mother of God!!! 
			(A MAN in the crowd 
			crumples to the ground. 
			The others swarm around 
			him, alarmed. They hold up 
			his head. His face is 
			pale. They check the 
			coupon he is clutching in 
			his hand. A voice rises 
			like a siren from the 
			crowd.)
	
				MAN  
		Ciccio Spaccafico's won the 
		Sisal!!!!!
			(The yell can be heard...)
	
	I8  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. DAY
	
	...inside the movie house. The audience murmurs. Somebody opens
	an emergency exit...
	
				SPECTATOR'S VOICE  
		The Neapolitan's won the lottery!!! 
		Let's go see, kids!!! Northerners are 
		always lucky!
			(The whole audience leaps 
			up and heads for the exit. 
			Pushing. Shouting. 
			Laughing and Joking. )
	
	19  SQUARE AND VILLAGE. EXT. MORNING 
	
	Summer has come. The village has a different look. The peddlers sing their 
	monotonous refrains in the village streets. In one street, women are busy 
	canning tomatoes. In one corner of the square, the SHEARER has finished clipping 
	the donkey and is now shaving the hair of a row of bare-chested URCHINS with 
	nothing on but their underwear. Then another MAN disinfects them by spraying 
	them with the hand pumps used to spray trees in the country. The URCHINS 
	laugh. The BILL-POSTER is hanging up the posters of a new film, 'TODAY AT CINEMA
	PARADISO .
	
	20  GRADE SCHOOL DINING HALL. INT. MORNING 
	
	The fifth-grade exams. In the vast dining hall all the children are seated, one 
	for each desk, under the watchful eyes of the teachers. SALVATORE, BOCCIA, 
	PEPPINO, MASINO and COLA have taken places here and there, as nervous as 
	everybody else. The EXAMINING BOARD MEMBER is dictating the text of the 
	arithmetic problem. 
	
				EXAMINING BOARD MEMBER  
		A merchant owns two stores. In the 
		first he sells fruit and vegetables. 
		In the second he sells nails and 
		cement...
			(The PRINCIPAL comes in, 
			interrupts the dictation.) 
	
				PRINCIPAL  
		Excuse me, professor. Here are the 
		men taking the exam for the 
		elementary school certificate. 
			(Turning to the door) 
		Come in, please...
			(All the children turn to 
			look. A MAN around thirty 
			enters, ill at ease. The 
			children recognize him and 
			laugh mischievously. The 
			second is the BLACKSMITH, 
			the one who falls asleep 
			at the movies. The third 
			is a twenty-year-old-boy, 
			ANGELO. The fourth is 
			ALFREDO, embarrassed and 
			red in the face. SALVATORE 
			is speechless. Gives a 
			slightly ironic laugh. 
			There is a look of revenge 
			in his shrewd little 
			eyes.)
	
						Cut to:
	
	The assignment is now being carried out. There is dead silence in the 
	hall. 
	
	TEACHERS and the PRINCIPAL moue about, checking to be sure there are no notes 
	being handed around or other forms of 'collaboration'. The four outsiders are 
	having a hard time. It can be seen on their faces. ALFREDO is also in trouble, 
	doesn't know how to solve the problem, the calculations are too diff cult. He 
	looks at the desk next to him, where SALVATORE is sitting. SALVATORE is about to 
	look up at him, but ALFREDO immediately looks away, too proud to let himself be 
	seen. 
	
	The exchange of glances continues, grotesque, almost comical. SALVATORE 
	meanwhile writes down numbers and operations quite quickly. ALFREDO can't stand 
	it any longer, is nervous, beaded with sweat. He's sorry he ever showed up. 
	SALVATORE laughs up his sleeve, now he has the upper hand. ALFREDO tries 
	sneaking a look at his exercise book in order to copy something. But SALVATORE 
	turns his back, hiding it from sight. ALFREDO tries sneaking a look at somebody 
	else's exercise book, but the damn kid also covers it. It looks like a 
	conspiracy against him. ALFREDO has no way out. He has to accept the idea of 
	eating humble pie. He looks at SALVATORE, motions him with his eyes in a 
	conversation of glances. He asks for help, but SALVATORE stands firm, 
	implacable. 
	
	ALFREDO tries to put it into words in a low voice.
	
				ALFREDO 
		YOU jerk. Tell me how to solve this 
		fucking problem! 
	
				TEACHER  
		Ssssh! Silence back there!! 
	
	ALFREDO insists with his eyes. SALVATORE makes him understand with gestures 
	that he could help him maybe, but...on one condition. He imitates the gesture 
	of winding the crank of the projector. ALFREDO gets the message. It's pure 
	blackmail. He rubs his hand over his sweating face, raises his eyes to the 
	ceiling as if he were swearing. Then he surrenders, accepts the condition. 
	SALVATORE is serious, does not flaunt his victory, but you can tell he is happy. 
	He takes out a sheet of paper he had already prepared, with the solution to the 
	problem, rolls it up into a tiny ball and as soon as the TEACHER passes by, 
	takes aim and flicks it to him. ALFREDO'S hand catches the precious and dearly 
	bought message in mid-air. Their quarrel is over.
	
	2I  VARIOUS SETTINGS. INT. DAY/EVENING
	
	A bright, lilting tune marks the rhythm of the quick, blurred images, as
	in a dance, the images of ALFREDO teaching SALVATORE all the
	secrets of the projectionist trade.
	
	ALFREDO slips the reel on to the projector, unrolls the trailer and hands
	it to SALVATORE. SALVATORE mounts the film on the sprockets.
	Now SALVATORE sets the projector into motion, opens the shutter and
	stands on tip-toe to see the screen from the hole...
	
	A shot from In nome della legge. The main-floor audience applauds a
	line spoken by Massimo Gironi. And from the balcony, the same little
	MAN with the face of a public notary spits below.
	
				MAIN FLOOR VOICE  
		Bastard!! Pencil-pusher!!
	
	ALFREDO shows SALVATORE the running of the film. He points
	to a place on the projector.
	
				ALFREDO  
		Pay attention. This is where it can 
		easily catch fire. If it
		happens, the first thing you've got 
		to do is break it off, here
		and here, so the whole reel doesn't 
		go up in fames.
	
	On the screen, a shot from Riso amaro. A kiss. Unrelenting, the PRIEST rings his 
	bell. SALVATORE licks the film on one side, then on the other. He laughs.
	
				ALFREDO 
		You understand which side the 
		gelatin's on?
	
				SALVATORE  
		It tastes wonderful!
	
	A shot of Amedeo Nazzari in La figlia del capitano. A jump,
	an out-of-rack frame. The audience whistles.
	
				AUDIENCE  
		Fraaaame!! Wake up, Alfredo!
			(SALVATORE tries to do a 
			hand-binding. ALFREDO 
			winds the film, hangs a 
			slip on a nail in the 
			wall.)
	
				ALFREDO  
		These are the shipping invoices for 
		the film. They are always to be kept. 
		You see?
	
				SALVATORE  
		OK, Alfredo.
	
	Down on the main floor, a scene from Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.
	Everyone screams and hides their faces when Hyde looks at the
	camera.
	
				AUDIENCE  
		Holy Mother! What a face! So ugly!
	
	One young man, ANGELO, doesn't hide his face. He looks up at
	a young woman, ROSA, in the balcony, who turns and smiles at
	him.
	
	ALFREDO gives SALVATORE a wooden stool. He's had it made especially for him, so 
	he can be high enough to reach the reels of the projector and the arc lamp. 
	SALVATORE climbs up on it. He laughs, all excited. 
	
				ALFREDO  
		Now you can run it by yourself. 
	
	SALVATORE gives another smile. He is posing in a photographer's studio . He is 
	all dressed up for first communion, holding a white lily. The flash goes off 
	like lightning during a storm. Now SALVATORE is posing next to his mother and 
	little sister. They smile without hugging. Another flash of light. Click!
	
	22  FIFTH GRADE. INT. DAY
	
	Another click. The transparency of Rita Hayworth in her black gown
	from Gilda. MASINO is pasting it inside a minute pair of plastic field
	glasses. Other pupils crowd around him in excitement.
	
				MASINO  
			(In a whisper) 
		Christ, what a piece of ass!!!
	
	But there is not a cheerful atmosphere in the class - on the
	contrary, a strange silence. The pupils are all standing around the
	teacher's desk, having received their end-of-the-year report cards.
	PEPPINO, who shared SALVATORE s desk, is saying goodbye to
	his schoolmates. BOCCIA, COLA, the others. They have serious,
	sad expressions. He and SALVATORE kiss like grown-ups. The
	TEACHER is standing among them. One of the schoolmates does
	not respond lo PEPPINO's goodbye gesture. He takes a few steps
	back, serious, scared, his eyes lowered.
	
				TEACHER  
		Di Francesco, aren't you saying 
		goodbye to your schoolmate?
			(DI FRANCESCO gives his 
			head a little shake. The 
			TEACHER leans over to 
			him.)
		But why?
			(DI FRANCESCO whispers, 
			almost into her ear.)
	
				DI FRANCESCO  
		My father says he's a Communist...
	
	23  SQUARE AND PROJECTION BOOTH, CINEMA PARADISO. EXT/INT. DAY 
	
	Another farewell scene in the square. PEPPINO to his grandparents. His father 
	and mother are also there, saying goodbye to the old folks. There are tears. The 
	cardboard suitcases tied with string are loaded on to the luggage rack of the 
	black car. The scene is watched by SALVATORE and ALFREDO, up in the window of 
	the projection booth. They look like old friends. On the sound monitor, the 
	strains of some American musical comedy tune. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Will they really find work in 
		Germany? 
	
				ALFREDO  
		Who knows?...It's like an adventure. 
			(In a theatrical voice) 
		Hope springs eternal...
			(PEPPINO from the distance 
			gives one last wave at the 
			window of the 
			projection booth. 
			SALVATORE waves back.) 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Peppinoooo! Come back sooon!! 
			(The black car drives off, 
			leaving a cloud of dust 
			that envelops the 
			suppressed sobs of the 
			grandparents standing 
			there waving 	
			handkerchiefs. SALVATORE 
			watches the car drive off. 
			He mumbles:) 
		Good thing Germany's closer than 
		Russia. 
	
	ALFREDO rubs his hand through his hair.
	
	24  CINEMA PARADISO. BALCONY AND BOOTH. INT. EVENING
	
	The lion's head with the beam of light, seen from the balcony.
	SALVATORE'S face appears in the hole beside it, as he peers down at the
	images of the Settimana Incom newsreel.
	The audience is distracted. The snoring of a man sleeping can be heard.
	A pair of urchins pick up a cockroach with their hands, tip-toe down the
	aisle. The sleeping man is the same old BLACKSMITH, with his head
	thrown back. A little hand drops the cockroach into the gaping mouth.
	The URCHINS take to their heels. The BLACKSMITH squirms, wake up
	with a start. Spits, while everybody laughs. The newsreel is now about
	missing soldiers in Russia.
	
				COMMENTATOR  
		The Defense Minister has announced a 
		new listof names of Italian soldiers, 
		so far considered missing and now
		confirmed as dead. Families concerned 
		will be notified directly by military 
		authorities.
	
	SALVATORE pays careful attention, sees the black-and-white
	shots of the last war. The Russian campaign. The troops in the
	snow. Now in detail a heap of personal objects found on the
	corpses. Documents, clothing, glasses, photographs. One quick
	detail catches SALVATORE's eye  among those photographs, for one
	instant he sees one he thinks he recognizes. He quickly sticks a slip of paper 
	into the take-up reel, as when marking the kisses to be cut.
	
	25  PREFECTURE. CITY. INT. DAY
	
	The hands of an OFFICIAL tear off several forms and give them to
	MARIA who is sitting in front of the desk. She is dressed in black.
	SALVATORE stands beside her, holding her hand. They have black
	bands on their arms. An empty stare in their eyes.
	MARIA is pale, a cold look in her sunken eyes. Her heart is bursting in
	her breast. And a lump in her throat prevents her from speaking. She
	looks at her husband's belongings, identifies them  a gold chain, an ID
	card and the photograph, the one SALVATORE saw in the newsreel.
	MARIA strokes it with her fingers. SALVATORE comes up and looks, as
	the OFFICIAL concludes:
	
				OFFICIAL 
		...Unfortunately we don't know what 
		war cemetery he's buried in...This 
		is the form for the pension. If you'd 
		like to sign it...
	
	26  PREFECTURE AND CITY STREET. EXT. DAY 
	
	MARIA walks through the city. She holds SALVATORE by the hand. SALVATORE looks 
	up, trying to catch her eye. He sees her crying, in silence. The heartbroken 
	tears of someone who has lost the one last hope, but held back, so as not to be 
	seen by the child. SALVATORE presses close and puts his arm around her waist. 
	They turn the corner, and walk off in the noisy city, disfigured by the ruins of 
	war. A poster for Gone with the Wind catches SALVATORE's eye. He smiles.
	
	27  CINEMA PARADISO. BOX OFFICE. PROJECTION BOOTH. SQUARE. INT/EXT. EVENING 
	
	Winter has returned. On the screen, a sequence from I pompieri di Viggiu. The 
	theatre is jam full. The sea of heads sways and shakes at the irresistible jokes 
	of Toto. 
	
	Some people have climbed up on the window-sills. The aisles are crammed, an the 
	way down to the screen, where grown-ups and children sit on the floor, their 
	noses in the air. Some people munch crusts of bread they've brought along from 
	home. Almost everybody is smoking. A woman laughs, holding the baby she is 
	nursing. In one corner, at the end of one of the aisles jammed with people 
	standing, a girl laughs, but every now and then her expression reveals a look of 
	deep pleasure. 
	
	Her body moves slightly. Clinging to her from the rear is a man bathed in sweat. 
	
	They are making love standing there among the crowd, which notices nothing and 
	goes on laughing.
	
	In the balcony ANGELO is holding hands with ROSA.
	The curtain over the entrance is open. People are also standing there,
	seeing what they can from the distance, even a corner of the screen
	through the forest of heads. But the line continues on outside...All the
	way to the entrance of the movie house, out in the square. There are
	crowds of people, shivering from the cold, who protest, shove, risk
	provoking incidents. The PRIEST, Father Adelfio, is exhausted, tries to
	calm them down.
	
				PRIEST  
		Don't shove! There's no room! For 
		heaven's sake! I can't
		give another showing, it's late!
	
				VOICES IN CROWD  
		Father Adelfio, we've been here for 
		an hour! There are people inside 
		who've seen it twice! ! ! Move on!!
		Ouch!! My foot!!!
	
	It has just stopped raining, the bell-tower rings eleven o'clock. On
	the poster of the film a ' LAST DAY' sticker. The PRIEST, the
	TICKET-SELLER, the USHER and TWO CARABINIERES push the crowd back, close the 
	front door. The protest grows louder. Fists pound the door.
	
				CROWD  
		Open up!!! Father Adelfio!!
			(The audience in the 
			theatre hears the uproar. 
			Reacts:)
	
				AUDIENCE  
		Ssssh! Sssssh! Be quiet out there!! 
		What the hell!
			(From the window of the 
			projection booth, ALFREDO 
			and SALVATORE look at the 
			crowd down below, yelling 
			and complaining. Some of 
			the people look up at 
			them. )
	
				VOICES IN CROWD  
		Alfredooo! We want to get in!...
		Tomorrow you're taking it off!
			(ALFREDO spreads his arms 
			out as if to say there s 
			nothing he can do.)
	
				SALVATORE  
		Why can't we show the same film 
		tomorrow?
	
				ALFREDO  
		It's got to be sent to another town. 
		And if we don't the owner of that 
		movie house gets pissed off.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Too bad!
	
	The crowd sways nervously. The CARABINIERES give order.
	
				CARABINIERES  
			(Exasperated) 
		Stop! Go home, all of you! Otherwise 
		somebody's going to end up in jail!' 
		That's enough!
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Dramatically) 
		'Joe! A mob doesn't think, doesn't 
		know what it's doing...'
			(SALVATORE gives him a 
			curious, inquisitive look. 
			ALFREDO smiles.)
		Spencer Tracy said it in Fury. 
			(Mischievously) 
		What'd you say if we let these poor 
		devils see the film, Toto? 
			(SALVATORE stares at him 
			in amazement, all 
			excited.) 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Wonderful! But how can it be done? 
	
	ALFREDO turns away from the window. He gives a smirk, imitates the tough 
	American movie stars.
	
				ALFREDO  
		You don't believe my words, but 
		you'll have to believe your own 
		eyes!...And now get your ass off 
		that damn stool, boy! 
	
	SALVATORE laughs, eagerly, as if he were about to see a whole new movie. He 
	climbs off the stool. Both of them move towards the projector...
	
	28  PROJECTION BOOTH AND SQUARE. INT/EXT. EVENING
	
	Trying not to put his hand in front of the lens, ALFREDO removes the
	frame with the glass that protects the projection. He wheels it around
	and motions SALVATORE to look...On the wall behind the projector:
	the film picture appears gradually, reflected by the glass, moves as the
	glass moves all the way over to the window looking out over the square.
	There it disappears. SALVATORE can barely believe his eyes, as if it
	were a piece of magic. He takes a quick look through the hole to see if
	the film is still showing on the screen. It is.
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Mysteriously) 
		Go to the window, boy, and have a 
		look...
	
	SALVATORE goes over to the window. Looks out. The reflected
	beam of light ends up on the white row of houses facing the
	square. It's like another screen. Except the images are
	backwards, like when you look in a mirror. And here and there
	are the windows of the houses...For SALVATORE, it's a
	wonderful spectacle, like a dream, ravishing.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Alfredo, it's beautiful.
			(A voice is heard in the 
			crowd of people jammed 
			around the entrance to the 
			movie house.)
	
				VOICE IN CROWD  
			(Shouting) 
		Hey, look there!! The movie!!
			(All heeds turn to look at 
			the house behind them.)
	
				CROWD  
		Oh, praise the Lord!! It's true! 
		Look! The movie!! There's Toto!! 
		Hurry! Hurry!...THANKS, ALFRED0000!!
	
	And everybody runs over to the other side of the square, in front
	of the strange new screen. ALFREDO and SALVATORE watch with glittering eyes. 
	SALVATORE lays his hand on the shoulder of his great pal.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Good for you, Alfredo! 
	
	A close-up of Toto projected on the houses, and one of the windows opens. A MAN 
	appears, in his pajamas. Dazzled by the light, he shades his eyes with his hand. 
	He sees all those people looking at him and laughing together.
	
				CROWD  
		Shut the window!! Shut the window! Go 
		to bed!! 
	
	The MAN is dazed. Doesn't now what's going on. Looks around, and sees the 
	black-and-white figures of the film dancing around him. He pops back inside, 
	slams the window shut, almost cared.
	
				VOICES IN CROWD  
			(To ALFREDO) 
		Sound!!! Sound!! Alfredooooo!!
	
				ALFREDO  
		What do you say, should we make them 
		happy?
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Smiling) 
		Sure, sure! 
	
	ALFREDO takes the loudspeaker of the monitor, rings it over to the window, 
	turns it around towards the square. He turns up he volume and the sound-track 
	fills the square. A chorus of approval.
	
				CROWD  
		Aaaaaaaa! At last!
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Looking at SALVATORE) 
		Do you want to go down there? 
			(SALVATORE gives a 
			contented nod.) 
		Go on. 
	
	SALVATORE runs on. ALFREDO looks wistfully towards the huge image in the 
	square. Down in the square SALVATORE heads for the crowd, his eyes trained on 
	the house-front screen. Behind him, the door of the movie house opens. The 
	PRIEST, Father Adelfio, sees the film being projected on the house front, 
	the people standing or sitting on the ground, laughing. His eyes nearly pop out 
	of his head. Then he motions over the TICKET-SELLER, whispers something into his 
	ear. The TICKET-SELLER strides over to the shivering spectators, pulls the pad 
	of tickets out of his pocket.
	
				TICKET-SELLER  
		Ladies and gentlemen! You have to buy 
		tickets! Reduced rate! 
	
	An irresistible chorus of Bronx cheers washes over him. SALVATORE looks around, 
	highly amused.
	
				CROWD  
		Fuck off!! The square belongs to 
		everybody! 
			(The VILLAGE IDIOT peers 
			Out Of the crowd, all 
			worked up.) 
	
				VILLAGE IDIOT  
		No!!! The square's mine!!! Come on, 
		kids, no joking around here!!! 
		Otherwise...
	
	The crowd roars with laughter. SALVATORE laughs too, as if carried away by it 
	all. And over the general merriment looms the shadow of ALFREDO, standing in the 
	window of the projection booth. All at once, on the house-front screen, the 
	image of Toto slows down for an instant, a white blister appears and spreads 
	until it fills the whole screen. The crowd gives a start of bewilderment and 
	fear. SALVATORE jerks his head around to look at the booth.
	
	29  PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. DAY 
	
	The film bursts violently into flame among the gears and sprockets of the 
	projector. ALFREDO is taken off-guard. He breaks the film running into the take-
	up reel, but is unable to do it for the delivery reel. He grabs the film which 
	is catching fire and pulls it out quickly, tries to stop the flames from 
	reaching the reel in the f reproof housing. A desperate race against the speed 
	of the fire. The flames on the floor burn his legs. ALFREDO gives a jump, slows 
	down the movement of his hands for an instant and inevitably the flames run 
	ahead, reach the upper housing. It's like an explosion. The flames leap out, 
	striking him full in the face. ALFREDO doesn't have time to scream, struggles 
	desperately and falls to the floor. Meanwhile the flames envelop everything.
	
	30  SQUARE.EXT.EVENING 
	
	The flash of the flames flares up in the windows of the projection booth. 
	SALVATORE is appalled, elbows his way through the moving 
	crowd. Inside the movie house the murmuring of the audience can be heard, 
	growing louder and louder. A scream...
	
	3I:CINEMA PARADISO. INT. EVENING 
	
	A violent spurt of flames leaps out of the mouth of the plaster lion's head, 
	into the darkness broken by the screams of people rushing for the exits.
	
	32  SQUARE AND CINEMA PARADISO ENTRANCE. EXT. EVENING 
	
	The crowd streaks out of the movie house, enveloped in a cloud of black smoke. 
	
				CROWD  
		Heeeelp! Run for your lives!!! 
	
	In the general panic, SALVATORE tries in vain to get inside, elbows his way 
	towards the street with the stairs leading to the projection booth. The audience 
	clashes against him, knocks him to the ground, almost trampling him underfoot. 
	He is suddenly seized by a superhuman force; gets up, claws his way desperately 
	ahead, with people falling on top of him and to the floor. He finally succeeds, 
	starts up the stairs...
	
	33  CINEMA PARADISO. STAIRS AND PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. EVENING 
	
	The place is filled with smoke. The air is suffocating. SALVATORE streaks up the 
	stairs, gasping for breath. The projection booth is enveloped inflames. 
	ALFREDO's body on the floor, burning. SALVATORE moves quickly, throws a blanket 
	over his shoulders, drags him by the feet over to the stairs, as boxes and other 
	objects fall on him. Using the same blanket, he stamps out the flames that have 
	seared ALFREDO'S clothes. With the force of desperation, he drags him further 
	down the stairs which have been reached by the smoke but not by the flames. 
	ALFREDO doesn't move, his face is burnt. SALVATORE looks at him and only now is 
	panic-stricken, lets out a terrified shriek, like a wounded colt. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Alfredo! Heeeelp! Help!!!
	
	34  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. EVENING 
	
	The plaster lion looks like a dragon spitting fire and smoke. The statue of the 
	Virgin Mary is also in flames. And the movie screen.
	
	35  SQUARE AND CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. EVENING 
	
	The fire has been put out. Nothing remains of the movie house but the skeleton. 
	Everything has gone up in smoke. 
	
	People stand around, dismayed. They gather around the PRIEST, who is at once 
	grieved and shocked, to express their solidarity and comfort. 
	
				VOICES  
		What a pity! Poor Alfredo! What a 
		terrible thing!! Cheer up, Father, is 
		there something we can do?'
	
				VILLAGE IDIOT  
			(Laughing) 
		Burnt up...Burnt up. 
	
				PRIEST  
		What'll we do now! The town will have 
		to get along without movies! Who's 
		got the money to rebuild it? 
	
	CICCIO SPACCAFICO, the man who won the Sisal pools, comes up, dressed in style. 
	He looks up at the charred cinema. It looks like a battlefield after an enemy 
	attack. From the smoke and ashes to...
	
	36  CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. EVENING
	
	...The great lighted sign of the CINEMA PARADISO . The movie house has been 
	rebuilt. New facade. New billboards. There are people 
	moving about the entrance. It is the evening of the inauguration...
	
	37  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. EVENING 
	
	The lobby is crowded with people, authorities, special guests. There is the 
	MAYOR, FATHER ADELFIO and the new owner, CICCIO SPACCAFICO, dressed to the 
	teeth. The MAYOR cuts the ribbon. Flashbulbs pop. Clapping. 
	
				GUESTS  
		Cheers' Congratulations, Don Ciccio! 
	
	The procession advances towards the stairs leading into the theatre. FATHER 
	ADELFIO, with a nostalgic sigh, blesses the lobby, then the corridor. Lastly, 
	the new auditorium, which resounds with toasts and cheers.
	
				AUDIENCE  
		To the Cinema Paradiso! 
	
	The PRIEST sprinkles the new seats, the walls, the screen with holy water...
	
	38  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. EVENING 
	
	Now FATHER ADELFIO is blessing the brand-new projection booth. He also blesses 
	the new projectionist: SALVATORE. He is very nervous, but serious, self-
	possessed. His worried-looking mother is also there for the occasion. The PRIEST 
	turns to SPACCAFICO. 
	
				PRIEST  
		How'd you solve his being under age? 
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		I took out a license as 
		projectionist, thanks to friends down 
		at the guild offices. But I don't 
		know a thing about it. Officially, I 
		do the job...
			(Smiling at Salvatore)
		...but Toto earns the money. 
	
				PRIEST  
		Fine. 
			(To SALVATORE) 
		Always be careful, my boy. Don't ever 
		go to sleep. Be sure another accident 
		doesn't happen. Do everything poor 
		Alfredo taught you. And may God bless 
		you. 
	
	SALVATORE nods his head seriously, assuming a responsible expression. His 
	mother kisses the PRIEST's hand.
	
				MARIA  
		Thanks, Father. Thanks. 
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		And now enough of this gloomy 
		atmosphere. Life goes on! I want to 
		see you happy and smiling!
	
	39  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. EVENING
	
	Laughter. The laughter of the large audience at the first showing of the
	inauguration film. Among the spectators, SALVATORE'S mother, MARIA, and his kid 
	sister, El A. Up on the screen, a man and a woman kiss. The first time a kiss 
	has been seen at the Cinema Paradiso. The audience murmurs, surprised and 
	excited.
	
				AUDIENCE  
		Ooooooh! They're kissing!! Look at 
		that!! Christ, that's news!!
	
	An OLD LADY sitting next to the MAYOR, crosses herself, flabbergasted. CICCIO 
	SPACCAFICO chuckles. Rubs his hands: these are going to be golden times for him. 
	FATHER ADELFIO gets up and stalks out of the theatre, indignant; he'll
	never set foot in the place again. The love theme gets louder and
	louder...
	
	40  PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. EVENING
	
	The same music spreads through the booth from the monitor. SALVATORE is by 
	himself. He is watching the film through the hole but strangely enough, the 
	story doesn't absorb him. ALFREDO'S absence makes him nervous, he gazes at the 
	stool he used to sit on. Il has been repainted. A voice from the rear of the 
	cabin:
	
				ANNA'S VOICE  
		Toto?...
	
	SALVATORE turns and at the top of the stairs sees SIGNORA
	ANNA and behind her, ALFREDO, her husband. He is wearing a
	pair of dark glasses and walks with the kelp of a cane. He has
	lost his sight, but not his spirit. He smiles:
	
				ALFREDO  
		Any room for me in this Cinema 
		Paradiso?
			(SALVATORE runs over and 
			embraces him.)
	
				SALVATORE  
		Come in, Alfredo.
	
				ANNA  
			(to SALVATORE) 
		Toto, will you bring him home when 
		you close down?
	
				SALVATORE  
		Yes. Signora Anna. 
			(To ALFREDO) 
		I'm glad you came.
	
						Cut to:
	
	ALFREDO is now sitting there immobile. He listens to the soundtrack of the film. 
	SALVATORE studies the way he stares into empty space, and the idea of darkness 
	frightens him. There is something new in ALFREDO'S manner, as if having grazed 
	death and the loss of his sight had endowed him with a deeper knowledge of men 
	and life.
	
				ALFREDO  
		How's school?
	
				SALVATORE  
		OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, 
		I'11 probably stop going...
	
				ALFREDO  
		Don't do that...Sooner or later 
		you'll be left empty-handed.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Why? What do you mean?
	
				ALFREDO  
		Toto, this isn't for you. For the 
		moment, the Cinema Paradiso needs 
		you, and you need the Cinema 
		Paradiso. But it won't last...Some 
		day you'll have other things 
		to do, more important things...
			(He reaches out and 
			touches SALVATORE'S face 
			to 'feel' his expression.)
		That's right, more important. I know 
		it. Now that I've lost my sight I see 
		more. 
		I see everything I didn't see 
		before...
			(As ALFREDO moves his hand 
			from SALVATORE's face, we 
			see that he is now a young 
			man, and that ALFREDO is 
			older, grayer.) 
		And it's all thanks to you, who saved 
		my life. And I'll never forget it...
			(SALVATORE doesn't 
			understand his strange 
			words. ALFREDO can 'feel' 
			he is troubled.)
		And don't put on that look. I haven't 
		gone off my head yet. You want proof?
	
	And he gives a joking smile. SALVATORE is curious, expects one of his fiendish 
	tricks.
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Smiling) 
		Yes. I want proof.
	
				ALFREDO  
		For example, at this moment the 
		film's out of focus. Go see. 
	
	SALVATORE stands up in disbelief. He looks through the hole, and indeed the film 
	is out of focus. He puts it back into focus, flabbergasted.
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Smiling) 
		It's hard to explain, Toto...
	
	41  CAFE IN THE SQUARE. INT/EXT. MORNING
	
	As the BILL-POSTER attaches to the café door a poster of Catene - the
	coming attraction at the Cinema Paradiso - CICCIO SPACCAFICO is
	speaking on the phone in the phone booth. He is clearly peeved.
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Only two days? Are you joking?!...
		What do I care if all the copies 
		are reserved?...Catene for only two 
		days in a place like this! Why, 
		people will eat me alive!...
			(Standing beside him 
			listening is SALVATORE. He 
			is carrying school 
			books under his ann. In 
			the café, several curious 
			ONLOOKERS laugh as through 
			the café window they watch 
			some unemployed PEASANT 
			MEN dancing together at 
			the club. SPACCAFICO 
			listens nervously, then 
			shrieks as if he were 
			about to eat the phone.)
		...I know, I know. But even if I 
		start showing at eight in the morning 
		it wouldn't be enough! This is a big 
		town now and you people at the 
		Titanus know it perfectly well! I'm 
		your sole agent and if I get pissed 
		off I'll write straight 
		to Lombardo, in Rome!! I'll give you 
		guys a good run-around!! If I get my 
		dander up, I can let fly, if my 
		name's Spaccafico!! 
	
						Cut to:  
	
	SPACCAFICO AND SALVATORE are now outside the café, head towards the square. In 
	front of the movie house, the CHARWOMAN is at work. SPACCAFICO is so nervous he 
	lights two cigarettes without noticing it. SALVATORE is turning something over 
	in his mind.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Don Ciccio, I've got an idea...You 
		remember that old abandoned movie 
		house where they're supposed to build 
		those low-rent houses?
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		So what's that got to do with it?
	
				SALVATORE  
		The projector's all rusty, but I 
		could fix it in two or three days. 
		Give the place a good cleaning, put 
		in some seats and bring in a 
		projectionist and we'll show Catene 
		in two houses.
	
				SPACCAFICO  
			(Shrieking) 
		What the fuck you talking about? You 
		getting into the act too, Toto? 
		Titanus has trouble giving me even 
		one copy and I have to say thanks! If 
		I ask for two, the least they'll do 
		is cut off my head and play ball with 
		it! 
	
	A shrewd look glitters in SALVATORE s eyes. He smiles.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Who says we need two copies?
	
	42  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. DAY 
	
	The house is jammed with people. Almost bursting at the seams. The last scenes 
	of Catene move across the screen. Tears stream down the faces of the men and 
	women. The children are unusually silent. Even the BLACKSMITH is awake, indeed 
	whispers ahead of time all the lines of Nazzari and Yvonne Sanson, knows them by 
	heart. Among the crowd in the balcony there is ALFREDO and his wife, the MAYOR, 
	DON VINCENZO the landowner, the schoolteachers. Now the music is loud, heart-
	rending. 'THE END' appears on screen. The lights go on. And there is a great 
	din and uproar as one audience leaves and another arrives. The race for empty 
	seats. Quarrels. The CARABINIERES help the USHER maintain order and persuade the 
	people who want to see the film again to get up and leave. 
	
				USHER  
			(Exasperate]) 
		That's enough now! You've seen it ten 
		times! I need the seats! I wish you'd 
		all get the galloping runs! 
	
				CARABINIERES  
		Easy! Easy! Through the emergency 
		exits, quick! Stop the jabbering!!
	
	43  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. 
	
	The end of the film slips through the sprockets. SALVATORE switches off the 
	motor. He is particularly fast in taking the reel out of the housing. And even 
	faster in dropping it into the sack BOCCIA is holding open for him. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Now get running and bring me the 
		first reel. Meanwhile I'll start 
		showing the news! 
	
				BOCCIA  
		OK, Toto!
	
	44  VILLAGE STREETS AND COUNTRYSIDE. EXT. DAY 
	
	BOCCIA speeds like an arrow on his bicycle through the village streets. Tied to 
	the parcel-rack is the sack containing the second part of Catene. He now turns 
	off the main street and takes a short-cut down a country road. He pedals as fast 
	as he can. Until he disappears into the distance, beyond the trees.
	
	45  ENTRANCE OLD ABANDONED MOVIE HOUSE. EXT. DAY 
	
	BOCCIA finally reaches the old movie house, which has been more or less spruced 
	up. Here too people are lined up in front of the posters of Catene. CICCIO 
	SPACCAFICO is waiting impatiently on an outside staircase. He too is holding a 
	sack, containing the first part of the film. The bicycle pulls up in front of 
	him. The sacks are exchanged. 
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Quick! Give it to me! Here's the 
		first part. Get moving! 
	
	BOCCIA heads back to the Cinema Paradiso, to take the first part to SALVATORE. 
	SPACCAFICO dashes up the stairs, and hands the sack to a MAN standing in the 
	door, through which the bare projection booth can be seen, and the projector 
	which SALVATORE has put back into working order. SPACCAFICO yells in excitement. 
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Here you are! Quick, quick!! People 
		are waiting!
	
	46  OLD ABANDONED MOVIE HOUSE. INT. DAY 
	
	In fact, inside the old freezing cold movie house, the audience is grumbling. 
	Everyone is wrapped in overcoats and woollen scarves and are sitting on chairs 
	they've brought from home and wooden benches. The hum of the projector is heard 
	at last. The lights go down. The grumbling subsides. The words 'PART TWO' appear 
	on screen and then the images of the film.
	
	47  VARIOUS COUNTRY ROADS AND VILLAGE STREETS. EXT. DAY/SUNDOWN
	
	Meanwhile BOCCIA pedals his way swiftly through the countryside on his way to 
	the Cinema Paradiso...
	
						FADE.
	
	Now BOCCIA is on his way back to the old movie house. To carry out another 
	exchange of sacks containing the reels of film.
	
						FADE.
	
	Another race back to Cinema Paradiso. BOCCIA starts looking tired, his breath is 
	short. And daylight starts fading into the colours of sundown.
	
						FADE.
	
	The last fading light of sundown.-BOCCIA is pedalling once more back
	to the old movie house. With the same sack tied to the parcel-rack. He
	is exhausted. On his last legs. He slows down, then stops.
	
	48  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. EVENING
	
	The lights are still on. In the thick blanket of smoke, the crowd stirs
	nervously. Shouting. Whistling.
	
				AUDIENCE  
		Hey, when's it starting!! We've got 
		ploughing to do in the morning!! 
		Toto, get a move on!! Heeey!!
	
	49  PROJECTION BOOTH. INT/EXT. EVENING
	
	In the booth, the projector is turned off. SALVATORE looks nervously
	out of the window...at the square. But not a sign of BOCCIA. A CARABINIERE 
	peers in through one of the holes.
	
				CARABINIERE  
		What are we going to do, Toto? The 
		whole place here is up in arms. 
		They've been waiting more than a half 
		hour.
	
				SALVATORE  
		What can I do?
	
	50  OLD ABANDONED MOVIE HOUSE. INT. EVENING
	
	Here too the audience is up in arms. They're waiting for Part Two tostart. 
	CICCIO SPACCAFICO tears his hair with rage.
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Where's the fucking bastard got to?
	
				SPECTATOR  
		Let's get one thing straight, Don 
		Ciccio! I'm waiting ten minutes 
		more, and if you haven't started...
		you're giving me my money back!!
	
				AUDIENCE  
			(In chorus) 
		Well said! Well said! We want our 
		money back!!
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Easy! Easy! What about my showing you 
		the first part again? Huh? 
	
	People shout, whistle, give Bronx cheers.
	
	
				AUDIENCE  
		No! First part, my foot! We want to 
		see how the story ends!! 
	
	Down in the front row, PASQUALE, the man who sells black market cigarettes, 
	stands up.
	
				PASQUALE  
		I've seen the whole works! You want 
		me to tell you how it ends? 
	
	A shoe comes flying at him.
	
				AUDIENCE  
		Nooo! No! Shut up, you jerk!!
	
	5I  VILLAGE STREETS AND COUNTRY ROADS. EXT. EVENING
	
	SALVATORE has got himself a bicycle and is going off to look for
	BOCCIA. He pedals fast, turns into the country short cut. Looks
	around  not a sign of Boccia. By now it is dark. He sees a MAN in the window of 
	a farmhouse, calls out to him. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Boccia! Boccia! 
	
	SALVATORE rides on. Now he's in the open country. All of a sudden he seems to 
	hear something. He stops. Pricks up his ears. It's a sort of moan - he can't 
	figure out if it's an animal or a man. He turns on the flashlight he has brought 
	along. Takes a closer look around. 
	
	Catches sight of a bicycle wheel on the ground behind a bush. That's where the 
	moan is coming from! He creeps over in alarm. Next to the bicycle he now catches 
	sight of the sack with the film. And the moaning gets louder. 
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Alarmed) 
		Boccia, what's wrong? 
			(He runs over to help his 
			friend. Behind the bush he 
			discovers BOCCIA humped up 
			between the legs of 
			TERESA, a prostitute. He 
			moves with all the fury 
			of his young years. 
			SALVATORE has never seen 
			people making love before 
			and is speechless.)
		Damn you, what are you doing? 
	
				BOCCIA  
			(Shouting) 
		Oh, Christ, it's so good!!! 
			(And he goes on ramming it 
			home.) 
	
				TERESA  
		Hey, cut it out! Go away. Shoo! 
	
	With a confused look on his face, SALVATORE picks up the sack and walks away, 
	looking over his shoulder at the couple who go on tossing around more and more 
	frantically.
	
	BOCCIA lets out a shriek of pleasure that rings through the countryside, as 
	SALVATORE pedals off like a madman and disappears into the trees. 
	
	52  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. DAY/EVENING 
	
	Music and the naked body of Brigitte Bardot. A row of youngsters on the main 
	floor stare at the naked actress, all excited. A regular rhythmic tremor runs 
	through them, half-hidden by the back of the seats.
	
	A scene from a horror film. The frightened faces of the audience. Off in one 
	corner, the door of the men's toilet opens and a MAN with a contented look comes 
	out, followed by TERESA, who motions another one to come in. In the projection 
	booth, SALVATORE is eating the meal his mother has brought him.
	
	A gangster film. The tense faces of the audience. A gun battle. Rounds of 
	machine-gunfire in the night. The shots echo through the theatre. A LITTLE BOY 
	claps his hands over his ears. Alternating with the machine-gunfire on screen, a 
	real pistol shoots the back of one of the spectators, the landowner DON 
	VINCENZO, who slumps down in his seat without anybody noticing...The shooting 
	continues up on screen...
	
	SALVATORE'S hand holds a lighted match under a piece of film, before the 
	horrified eyes of SPACCAFICO and the USHER, and the puzzled expression of 
	ALFREDO. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch 
		fire! 
	
				ALFREDO  
		Progress! It always arrives too late!
	
	A scene from Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. The only empty seat
	in the theatre is the one where DON VINCENZO was killed. A flower
	has been tied to it with string. All the other seats are taken.
	
						Fade to:
	
	ROSA and ANGELO are sitting next to each other. They are watching a
	different film. But she has a baby in her arms  they have got married,
	have set up a family.
	
	In the balcony, the MAN with the face of a public notary spits down
	below with a contented look. But this time the main floor takes its
	revenge and a blob of shit hits him square in the face.
	
	53  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. MORNING 
	
	In the morning the theatre is empty. All the doors are shut. Light filters in 
	through the open windows up above, illuminates the posters of coming attractions 
	and the yellowish screen. Off-screen, a woman's voice 
	and a boy's voice are heard. 
	
				TERESA'S VOICE  
			(Off-screen) 
		Come on...That's right...relax...
			(Laughing)
		...Don't be scared...
	
				SALVATORE'S VOICE  
			(Off-screen) 
		Is it true that if I bleed I've got 
		to squeeze lemon juice on it? 
	
				TERESA'S VOICE  (Off-screen) 
			(A loud laugh) 
		Lemon juice?...That's a new one for 
		you! Who tells you this crap...Take 
		it easy...That's right...You see, 
		it's not painful, is it?
	
	Slow pan along the walls of the theatre, the empty aisles,
	discovers SALVATORE on the floor between the seats with
	TERESA, the prostitute who has already been seen. SALVATORE is
	making love for the first time in his life. He is awkward and
	clumsy. There is an uncertain look in his eyes, his livid face is
	dripping with sweat.
	
				TERESA 
		...There you are! That's right, 
		that's right! Keep going...
			(SALVATORE is quicker, has 
			learned the lesson. TERESA 
			goads him on.)
		Ah!!! There, now you're a real man! A 
		man! ? A real calf!
			(SALVATORE's panting 
			slackens into a deep sigh 
			of pleasure.)
	
	54  VARIOUS SETTINGS. INT/EXT. DAY 
	
	The blade of a knife, clutched in a hardened hand. A blow. A cry of pain. A calf 
	falls like a dead weight to the ground...SALVATORE photographs the animal in 
	the throes of death with his 8mm movie camera. As well as the faces of the MEN 
	who now bleed and skin it quickly. In the vast slaughter-house, the voices of 
	the men and animals mingle together.
	
	SALVATORE'S eye is quick to catch the most unexpected expressions of ordinary 
	people. His movie camera is always ready, like a hunter's rifle. Now he is 
	shooting...
	
	A meeting in the square: the passionate reactions of the peasants listening to a 
	speaker who flails his arms around.
	
	At school: the old SCHOOLMISTRESS sitting at her desk, sunk in God knows what 
	dreams, her eyes staring off into empty space, as a tear runs down her pale, 
	unhappy face, and the unknowing STUDENTS carry out their assignments.
	
	At the railroad station: the nervous excitement of the people waiting on the 
	platforms. SALVATORE pans his camera on to TWO MEN fighting. But an arriving 
	train comes in between. Salvatore follows the train, pans along the cars. The 
	train stops. 
	
	-A door opens and the passengers climb out. Several TRADERS, a CARABINTERE, a 
	group of commuting STUDENTS, the TICKET-COLLECTOR, a distinguished looking 
	COUPLE and lastly, a GIRL who stops in the middle of the viewfinder. SALVATORE 
	is immediately attracted by her face. He goes on shooting without leaving it a 
	moment. He follows her through the lens. She is very beautiful, must be around 
	sixteen, a simple, sweet face, blue eyes. She is certainly the daughter of the 
	distinguished looking COUPLE who got off just before she did. The little family 
	moves off down the platform. Salvatore follows the girl's movements, as if 
	hypnotized. Now she passes by him, turns towards him for one moment, as if 
	trying to figure out where he is aiming that funny-looking gadget. SALVATORE 
	smiles at her, entranced.
	
	55  HIGH SCHOOL. COURTYARD. ENTRANCE. EXT. MORNING
	
	The JANITOR is ringing the bell. In the courtyard, on the other side of
	the gate, the STUDENTS prepare to enter. SALVATORE is with a group
	of schoolmates, including BOCCIA. And they all stare, wide-eyed, at
	the GIRL from the station. She has her books under her arm and is
	walking by herself.
	
				SALVATORE  
		You know that one there?
	
				BOCCIA  
		She's new. Not bad though. Nice-
		looking.
			(SALVATORE has the look of 
			somebody seeking for an 
			idea, some way of picking 
			up a conversation with 
			her.)
	
				SECOND STUDENT  
		Her father s the new bank director. 
		Loaded, luxury and easy living!
	
				FIRST STUDENT  
		People who jerk off with a shirt so 
		they won't get their hands dirty. 
			(Laughs.)
	
	All at once, BOCCIA and SALVATORE notice that the GIRL drops
	her lunch without noticing as she is about to enter the school. They
	fly off, swift as arrows. It's a chance not to be missed. BOCCIA is
	the quicker, is already in the lead. SALVATORE gives an angry
	gesture. A flash come into his eyes, the same flash he had as a little
	boy when he finds the right way to hit home. He picks up his step,
	trips BOCCIA and brings him to the ground. He pounces on him
	and lets go with his fist. He starts running again. Picks the
	bundle off the ground. Catches up with the GIRL from the
	station, nervous and inexperienced, but polite.
				SALVATORE  
		Look, you dropped this.
	
	And he hands her her lunch with a smile. She recognizes him.
	
				ELENA  
		Oh, thanks. I hadn't noticed...
	
	She takes the bundle as SALVATORE touches her hand delicately.
	
				SALVATORE  
		My name's Salvatore...And yours?
	
				ELENA  
			(Smiling) 
		Elena. My name's Elena.
	
	SALVATORE is very flustered. He feels as if all his blood were
	throbbing in his head. He tries to say something else, but the words
	catch in his throat.
	
				SALVATORE  
		I...I...The other time at the 
		station.
	
	BOCCIA suddenly grabs him by the collar and yanks him away. ELENA is frightened, 
	puts her hand over her eyes so as not to see.
	
	56:CINEMA PARADISO.PROJECTION BOOTH.INT.AFTERNOON 
	
	SALVATORE has a black eye, swollen shut. He is setting up a little 8mm projector 
	on a stool. ALFREDO is sitting in one corner. He has come to keep him company. 
	He listens to the sound-track of the movie being shown. 
	
				ALFREDO
		Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto? 
	
				SALVATORE  
		That's right, Modern Times. 
	
				ALFREDO  
		I've shown it so many times I know it 
		by heart. The first time I showed 
		it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first 
		wife died. They kept it hidden from 
		me all day so they wouldn't have to 
		close down the movie house. I only 
		found out that night, after the last 
		show. Those are things you never 
		forget...
			(Changing his tone.) 
		So, Toto, how are these home movies 
		going? 
			(SALVATORE has switched on 
			the little projector and a 
			square of light appears on 
			the wall beside ALFREDO, 
			with the scenes shot in 
			town.) 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Yes. 
			(The shots of the 
			slaughter-house have 
			appeared.) 
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Whispering) 
		What is it, what is it? What's the 
		picture? 
	
				SALVATORE  
		It's people in the slaughter-house 
		killing a calf. There's blood all 
		over the floor, like a lake. And 
		through this lake another calf passes 
		by on its way to die. 
	
	ALFREDO is concentrated, as if SALVATORE'S description transmitted the 
	real image to him, the colours, the forms. The railway station has appeared on 
	the wall, and the sequence of ELENA. SALVATORE does not move, does not say a 
	word, as he gazes at those blue eyes looking into the camera. ALFREDO senses 
	something funny in the boy's s11ence.
	
				ALFREDO  
		Now what can you see?
	
				SALVATORE  
		Nothing, there's nothing. It's all 
		out of focus.
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Smiling) 
		Is there a woman?...Tell me the 
		truth...
			(SALVATORE is shamed, 
			uncertain, doesn't know 
			whet to say. A tender look 
			filters through ALFREDO's 
			dark glasses. He has 
			obviously caught on and 
			whispers:) 
		There is a woman.
	
	SALVATORE is forced to admit it, with a sigh.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Yes, it's a girl I saw at the 
		station.
	
				ALFREDO  
		What's she like? What's she like?...
	
	And as other shots of ELENA appear on the screen, SALVATORE describes her. As 
	only somebody in love could.
	
				SALVATORE  
		She's nice. My age...Slender, with 
		long hair, brunette. She had big blue 
		eyes, a simple expression and a 
		little beauty mark on her lip, but 
		really tiny. You can only see it 
		close-up. And when she smiles...She 
		makes you feel...
	
	He stops. Only now does he realize that he has let himself be carried away by 
	passion, by the desire to talk about her. ALFREDO smiles, spellbound...
	
				ALFREDO  
		Eh! Love...what a mystery!
			(SALVATORE turns off the 
			projector and heaves a 
			deep sigh, almost of 
			liberation. ALFREDO'S 
			sympathy does him a lot of 
			good. It's nice to be 
			understood. He moves over 
			closer to him. ALFREDO 
			runs his hand through his 
			hair, whispers:)
		I understand you, Toto...The ones 
		with blue eyes are the
		most beautiful. Whatever you do, you 
		can't make friends with
		them.
			(SALVATORE is comforted by 
			the way he talks. He 
			didn't think it
			was possible to put into 
			words the things he has 
			felt since meeting
			ELENA. He nods his head. 
			ALFREDO sighs.)
		Eh, there's nothing to be done about 
		it! The heavier a man is,
		the deeper his footprints. And if 
		he's in love, he suffers,
		because he knows he's up a one-way 
		street. Because love is a
		meaningless thing when a man gets it 
		into his head to do what
		he wants...
			(SALVATORE is touched by 
			his sensitivity, by his 
			intense, passionate, sweet 
			way of speaking.)
	
				SALVATORE  
		What you say is wonderful! But sad...
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Smiling) 
		They're not my words. John Wayne said 
		it in Shepherd of the Hills.
	
	SALVATORE suddenly changes expression, as if discovering he was being made fun 
	of.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Stinking two-timer!! 
			(And they burst out 
			laughing.)
	
	57:CINEMAPARADISOANDVARIOUSSTREETS.EXT.DAY
	
	A grey, windy day. It is opening-time and the shutters of the movie
	house are being rolled up. SALVATORE is about to enter through the
	small door of the spiral staircase, when in the distance he catches sight
	of...
	
	ELENA crossing a street with her books under her arm. She is alone.
	SALVATORE doesn't stop to think twice, dashes off, runs through streets
	full of dust, another square, turns the corner, but has lost sight of her.
	He looks around in all directions  there she is! He starts running again.
	And finally catches up with her, all out of breath, practically
	speechless with emotion.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Hi, Elena!
	
				ELENA  
		Hi. Why are you running?
	
				SALVATORE  
		No particular reason...
			(He is entranced by her 
			eyes. He wants to tell her 
			all sorts of
			things, say all the words 
			he has memorized a 
			thousand times. But
			now he can't get them out. 
			His knees tremble. He does 
			his best to
			overcome his confusion, 
			but all that comes out 
			is:)
		Nice day, huh?
			(A gust of wind envelops 
			them in a cloud of dust 
			and a clap of
			thunder rends the air. 
			ELENA laughs, amused by 
			the blunder.)
	
				ELENA  
		Yes, nice day.
			(SALVATORE laughs too. He 
			gazes at her long hair 
			tossed by the wind. She 
			turns to leave.)
		...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Bye-bye, Elena.
			(ELENA walks away. And 
			SALVATORE also turns to 
			leave. Only now is he 
			seized by disappointment,  
			regret at not having made
			the best of the 
			opportunity. He talks to 
			himself.)
		...What an idiot! What an idiot! 
		'Nice day'! Christ!!
	
	58:SALVATORE'S BEDROOM.INT.DAY 
	
	SALVATORE projects images of ELENA on his wall. He lies across his bed gazing at 
	her image.
	
				SALVATORE  
		You probably don't believe me, but 
		I'm going to become the leading man 
		in your life. Sure, I don't look like 
		Marlon Brando, but look at me, really 
		look at me. Am I really so ugly? So 
		should I try once more? Maybe It'll 
		succeed. What do you 
		say? 
	
	ELENA seems to be saying, Yes. As SALVATORE kisses ELENA, her image disappears. 
	He is left with his face against the wall in the white light from the 
	projector.
	
	59:PHONEB00TH AND ELENA'S HOUSE.INT.DAY
	
	SALVATORE is in a phone booth. The telephone will certainly help him feel less 
	nervous.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Hello, can I speak to Elena, please?
	
				WOMANS VOICE  
		Yes. 
			(SALVATORE recognizes 
			ELENA's voice, changes his 
			tone, turns sweeter, more 
			personal.)
	
				SALVATORE 
		Is that you, Elena?
	
				WOMAN'S VOICE  
		Yes...
	
				SALVATORE  
		Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't recognize 
		your voice. This is Salvatore, 
		remember?
	
				WOMAN'SVOICE  
		Yes...
	
	SALVATORE finally speaks, says everything all in one breath, without stopping, 
	without hesitating, in order to leave no room for shyness.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Listen, I know that every time we see 
		each other I make a fool of myself, 
		but I'm not like that, I swear. It's 
		just that when I see you, I feel shy, 
		the right words don't come to me, I 
		don't have the courage to say that 
		all I do is think about you...
			(He has finally got it 
			out. He's dripping with 
			sweat, but happy at having 
			succeeded. He continues.) 
		That's right, Elena, you're the last 
		thing I think of when I go to sleep 
		and the first when I wake up in the 
		morning. And at night I always dream 
		of you. I know, it's not good on the 
		phone. But please, don't get me 
		wrong. Because I love you very 
		much...
	
				WOMAN'SVOICE  
			(Interrupting him) 
		If you don't stop phoning her, I'm 
		calling the police!
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Stunned) 
		But excuse me, who's speaking?
	
	At ELENA'S house, a WOMAN who is visibly in a state is speaking on the phone.
	
				ELENA'S MOTHER  
		I'm Elena's mother, you filthy pig! 
	
	SALVATORE feels like dropping through the floor, tries to get a word in to 
	explain, to apologize, but the flood of insults overwhelms him.
	
				SALVATORE  
		I'm sorry, Signora, maybe there's a 
		misunderstanding...I...
	
				WOMAN'S VOICE  
		And don't call my daughter any more. 
		Never! 
	
	SALVATORE has no choice but to hang up, disappointed, defeated. He's so mad he 
	starts slapping himself.
	
	60:ALFREDO'S HOUSE.EXT.AFTERNOON
	
	Good Friday. ALFREDO comes out of his house, leaning on
	SALVATORE's shoulder. They go off down the street, towards the
	church. SALVATORE has finished recounting his misadventure.
	
				ALFREDO  
		I told you, the blue-eyed ones are 
		the most difficult.
	
				SALVATORE  
		But why? There must be some way to 
		make her understand!
	
				ALFREDO  
		Don't think about it, Toto. Don't 
		even try. With feelings, there's 
		nothing to understand. 
	
	SALVATORE gives an angry gesture. This time ALFREDO'S words do not quiet his 
	frenzy, don't help him. He moves away from him a few steps.
	
	ALFREDO stands there motionless in the middle of the road.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Stop it! I've had enough of your 
		sermons! You act as if you created 
		the world! 
			(A bicycle streaks by 
			ALFREDO, who gives a 
			startled jump, as if it 
			were about to 
			run into him. He raises 
			his voice, panic-
			stricken.)
	
				ALFREDO  
		Heeey! Totooooo! Don't get pissed off 
		with me now! Come here! I don't 
		know where the fuck I have to go. 
			(A MAN on a bicycle almost 
			collides with ALFREDO. 
			SALVATORE fumes, goes over 
			to him listlessly. ALFREDO 
			puts his hand back on his 
			shoulder and they start 
			walking again. ALFREDO has 
			calmed down, but his voice 
			is determined.) 
		And the next time be careful how you 
		talk. Not to take credit away 
		from the Lord, but if I had created 
		the world, in all modesty, certain 
		things would have come out better. 
		But unfortunately such was not the 
		case.
	
				SALVATORE 
			(Laughing) 
		You see, it s like I say. You always 
		have an answer for everything.
	
				ALFREDO  
		I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm 
		going to tell you a story. 
			(And he squeezes 
			SALVATORE'S shoulder. It's 
			the signal for taking a 
			rest. They sit in a 
			doorway. ALFREDO starts 
			telling his story, and his 
			way of speaking is 
			hypnotic, magical. With 
			those eyes lost in empty 
			space, it's as if his 
			thoughts and his words 
			came in from some other 
			dimension, mysterious, 
			hidden...) 
		Once upon a time a king gave a feast 
		and there were all the most beautiful 
		princesses of the realm. Basta, one 
		of the guards, saw the king's 
		daughter: she was the loveliest of 
		all! And he immediately fell in love 
		with her. But what could a poor 
		soldier do compared with a king's 
		daughter?!...One day he managed 
		to meet her and told her he couldn't 
		live without her. The princess was so 
		struck by the depth of his feeling 
		that she said to the soldier  'If you 
		will wait a hundred days and a 
		hundred nights beneath my balcony, 
		then in the end I'll be yours.' 
		Christ, the soldier ran off there and 
		waited! One day, two days, 
		ten, twenty...Every night she looked 
		out of her window, but he never 
		budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never 
		budged! The birds shat on him and the 
		bees ate him alive! After ninety 
		nights he was gaunt and pale and 
		tears streamed from his eyes but he 
		couldn't hold them back. He didn't 
		even have the strength to sleep any 
		more. The princess kept watch...And 
		on the ninety-ninth night, the 
		soldier got up, picked up his chair 
		and left!
	
				SALVATORE  
		No! You mean right at the end? 
			(SALVATORE is amazed, 
			dumbfounded; that ending 
			has made a deep 
			impression. They 
			start walking again.)
				ALFREDO  
		That's right, Toto, right at the end? 
		And don't ask me what it means. If 
		you figure it out, let me know...
	
				SALVATORE  
		I'll be damned'
	
	6I:CHURCH.INT.EVENING
	
	Before the high altar, the Virgin Mary in tears clutches three spikes inher 
	hand. And beside her is another statue  Christ descended from the
	cross. MEN and WOMEN stand in line to kiss Christ's wounds. Many people are 
	sitting between the pews. SALVATORE helps ALFREDO take a seat, and at that 
	moment catches sight at the far end of ELENA on her way to the confessional. 
	
	She kneels down on one side, just as FATHER ADELFIO comes out of the middle 
	booth and goes to the altar to say something to the sacristan. SALVATORE'S eyes 
	light up. He has had a brainstorm. 
	
	He leans over and whispers something into ALFREDO's ear. ALFREDO nods his head. 
	SALVATORE is so happy that he gives him a pat on the cheek, like a caress. Then 
	he hurries over to the PRIEST. Says something in a low voice, gesticulates with 
	some agitation, points to the pew where ALFREDO is sitting. The PRIEST tries to 
	say he can't now, but SALVATORE insists, and wins. The PRIEST goes over to 
	ALFREDO, leans over. 
	
				PRIEST  
		What is it, Alfredo? Right now, of 
		all times! 
	
				ALFREDO  
			(In a grave voice) 
		Father Adelfio, I have a very serious 
		doubt that is torturing my soul. And 
		you've got to help me, because I've 
		lost all peace of mind...
	
	SALVATORE watches from a distance. He sees the PRIEST put on an alarmed 
	expression and then sit down beside ALFREDO. Everything's ready. He creeps over 
	to the confessional. ELENA is there, kneeling down waiting for the PRIEST to 
	arrive. In an instant, without anyone noticing, SALVATORE pops inside the 
	confessional. He shuts the little door below and draws the purple curtain. On 
	the other side of grille, only a few inches away, those eyes that keep him awake 
	all night. 
	
				ELENA  
		Father, I have sinned...
	
				SALVATORE  
			(In a low voice) 
		We'll talk about that later. 
	
				ELENA  
			(Surprised) 
		But...who...
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Interrupting her) 
		Sssssh, Be quiet, pretend 
		everything's normal. I'm Salvatore. 
	
	ELENA'S eyes pop in amazement.
	
				ELENA  
		What are you doing here?
	
	Meanwhile ALFREDO and the PRIEST continue their unusual and animated discussion. 
	The PRIEST is appalled, crosses himself. 
	
				PRIEST  
		But Alfredo, what you're saying is 
		horrifying! 
	
				ALFREDO  
		I know. But take the-miracle of the 
		loaves and fishes, for example! I 
		think about it a lot...How is it 
		possible for...
	
	In the confessional, the whispered conversation between SALVATORE and ELENA 
	continues.
	
				ELENA  
			(Annoyed) 
		There was a terrible rumpus at home. 
		My mother told my father. And how 
		could you have mistaken my voice?!
	
	SALVATORE is mortified, on tenterhooks, keeps an eye on ALFREDO and the PRIEST 
	through a crack in the curtain.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Forgive me, Elena. It was stupid of 
		me. But I had to talk to you. 
	
	She looks up at him and her eyes are even more beautiful in the candlelight. 
	This time SALVATORE finds the courage to speak to her calmly, with 
	determination. That grille probably helps him, allows him to see without being 
	seen.
	
				SALVATORE  
		You're so beautiful, Elena...That's 
		what I wanted to tell you. When I 
		meet you, I can't put two words 
		together because...you give me the 
		shivers. I don't know what you do in 
		these situations, what you're 
		supposed to say. It's the first time. 
		But I think I'm in love with you. 
	
	ELENA gazes through the grille at the two shining specks of his eyes. She is 
	bewildered by that flood of passion. At that moment, an OLD WOMAN kneels down on 
	the other side of the confessional and her face appears behind the grille.
	
				OLD WOMAN  
		Father, I have sinned...
			(SALVATORE turns lo her, 
			instinctively.)
	
				SALVATORE  
		I absolve you in the name of the 
		Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. 
		Go in peace, my daughter. 
			(And he slams the panel 
			shut in her face. ELENA is 
			barely able to control her 
			laughter.) 
		When you laugh, you're even more 
		beautiful. 
	
	She pulls herself together again and puts on a serious, but tender look.
	
				ELENA  
		Salvatore, it's awfully sweet of you. 
		And even though I don't know you, I 
		like you. But...I'm not in love with 
		you. 
	
	For SALVATORE, it's as if a knife had plunged straight into his heart. He sits 
	there gazing into her eyes, at the beauty mark on her lip, without moving. Then 
	through the crack sees ALFREDO and the PRIEST conversing nervously, God knows 
	what they're saying. And he turns back to her.
	
				SALVATORE  
		I don't care. I'll wait.
	
				ELENA  
		For what?
	
				SALVATORE  
		For you to fall in love with me too. 
		Listen carefully. Every night, when I 
		get off work, I'll come and wait 
		beneath your window. Every night. 
		When you change your mind, open your 
		window. That's all. I'll 
		understand...
	
	He smiles at her. She is upset by those exaggerated words, but also intrigued.
	
	The PRIEST has meanwhile solved the problem that ALFREDO has made up as an 
	excuse.
	
				PRIEST  
			(Exhausted) 
		You understand now? You see it 
		clearly?
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Hypocritically) 
		Oh yes, father. Now everything's 
		clear.
	
				PRIEST  
		And the next time don't go around 
		saying such heresy. You survived the 
		fire at the movie house. But no one 
		can save you from the fire of Hell!
	
	62:SQUARE AND ELENA'S HOUSE. EXT. NIGHT
	
	Sweet poignant music accompanies SALVATORE's long waits beneath the window of 
	ELENA'S room... A warm early summer night. The last spectators wander off into 
	the streets. The VILLAGE IDIOT makes his rounds of the square.
	
	SALVATORE is beneath her window. He waits. The shutters are open,
	but not the windows with the curtains. ELENA peers at him through a
	dark crack...
	
						Fade to:
	
	A rainy night. SALVATORE is back there again. Determined,
	headstrong. A dog keeps him company, taking shelter under an
	overhanging roof. The window is shut...
	
						Fade to:
	
	SALVATORE'S hand adds another check to an endless row of checks on
	the calendar. A check a day...
	
						Fade to:
	
	Another night. Wind. The window is still shut. SALVATORE's eyes are
	the eyes of a lovesick man prepared to face the hardest battles, just to
	win, just to conquer his loved one. She peeks at him through the crack,
	but he can't see her...
	
						Fade to:
	
	The paces of the calendar are covered with checks. Several months
	have gone by. SALVATORE adds a check on the last page, on 30 December. Tomorrow 
	night will be...New Year's Eve. The streets are empty. Loud merry voices can be 
	heard coming from the houses. Old discarded objects hail down from balconies. 
	Firecrackers explode here and there. SALVATORE is there in the same old place, 
	as usual. The shutters are open, but not the windows, and all is darkness 
	inside. SALVATORE is wrapped in a large overcoat and stamps his feet to keep 
	warm...
	
	63:SALVATORES HOUSE. GIANCALDO. INT. NIGHT
	
	Toasts are being prepared in SALVATORE's house. MARIA is there
	with her daughter, LIA, then ALFREDO with his wife, ANNA.
	SALVATORE is the only one missing for the "family" to be complete.
	The bottle of spumante and the Christmas cake are ready. The radio is
	on with the New Year's Eve programme.
	
				MARIA  
			(Nervously) 
		But why hasn't Toto shown up? The 
		movie house is closed at this hour!
	
	ALFREDO has a know-all look. He tries to put her mind at rest.
	
				ALFREDO  
		He had to do something for me...
	
	Over the radio, music and merrymaking
	
	64:ELENA'S HOUSE.EXT.NIGHT 
	
	More sounds of merrymaking, coming from ELENA's house. SALVATORE listens to it, 
	sees the shadows of her parents and relatives, maybe even hers, ready to 
	celebrate, welcome in the New Year. But further on, that window remains dark and 
	shut. SALVATORE gazes at it again. 
	
	There is a new look in his eyes, like a gleam of hope. Maybe it's the 
	specialness of that night, maybe it's the fire crackers, the festive atmosphere, 
	but something tells him that's going to be the right night. The night when 
	she'll open her window. In fact, a light suddenly goes on in the room. 
	SALVATORE'S eyes sparkle, have already taken on the hue of victory. 
	
	The window is pulled open, and his heart starts pounding like a drum. The music 
	reaches its climax. Two hands come out. SALVATORE shuts his eyes for a moment, 
	to hold back the flood of feeling. He opens them again and sees......The hands 
	reach out and take hold of the shutters and pull them shut. The light goes out. 
	It is midnight. An echoing voice does the countdown.
	
				RADIO VOICE  
		Six, five, four, three, two, one, 
		zero! Happy New Year! Happy New Year! 
	
	And a roar of voices, shouts, explosions, fills the air. SALVATORE has remained 
	standing there immobile, speechless. Disappointed. Defeated.
	
	65  SALVATORE S HOUSE. GIANCALDO. INT. NIGHT
	
	At his house, glasses are about to be raised. There is a strange, tense 
	merriment. MARIA is unable to conceal her concern, her presentiment. She glances 
	at the door, hoping to see SALVATORE appear.
	
				ALFREDO  
			(To Maria) 
		There's nothing to worry about. He's 
		probably with his friends. 
			(To all) 
		Let's toast!
	
				EVERYBODY  
			(Toasting) 
		Here's to you! Here's to you! Happy 
		New Year!
	
				MARIA  
		For Toto too, here's to you!! Happy 
		New Year! !
	
	Everybody echoes MARIA'S toast...
	
	66  ELENA S HOUSE. EXT. NIGHT 
	
	But SALVATORE is not happy in these first few minutes of the New Year. He feels 
	hurt, humiliated, rejected. He walks off amidst the old discarded objects flying 
	down from the terraces. That was his last night. He's not showing up beneath 
	that balcony any more.
	
	67  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. AFTERNOON 
	
	Outside there is a violent thunderstorm. The pounding of the rain and the 
	rumbling of the thunder drown out the sound-track of the film being shown. Two 
	buckets are on the floor to catch the water dripping through the roof. SALVATORE 
	is alone. For the first time he feels he hates the profession he's got into. He 
	is tearing up the calendar where he checked off the nights he spent waiting for 
	ELENA. He tears it into a thousand pieces, as if trying to wipe out the traces 
	of his grief. He is so absorbed in his thoughts that he doesn't notice that 
	someone has appeared at the top of the stairs and quietly entered the room. And 
	now stands there watching him in silence. The thunder is deafening. That someone 
	is ELENA. She comes up behind him, realizes he is thinking 
	about her. Whispers. 
	
				ELENA  
		Salvatore...
	
	Loud passionate music is heard on the monitor. SALVATORE turns and sees her as 
	if in a dream. It is a sudden blow to the heart. The look on her face is 
	wonderfully sweet, the look of somebody who knows she is madly loved and 
	who now realizes at last that she is in love too. For SALVATORE it is an 
	overwhelming, almost unbearable moment...A long passionate embrace that is 
	never-ending. They are happy, cling to each other never to leave each other 
	again. 
	
	They spin around, end up against the wall where strips of film are hanging, the 
	first-part endings and the trailers. Another intense look, their eyes 
	locked...And it is their first kiss. A kiss at first timid, hesitant, almost 
	clumsy, and then becomes resolute, poignant. Amidst the film strips dangling 
	around and touching their young faces. Meanwhile the film has finished, the 
	projector turns uselessly...Down below the screen is blank, the audience 
	whistles...But SALVATORE hears nothing, neither the whistles nor the useless 
	whirring of the reels in the projector. All he hears is her breathing, an he 
	feels is the warmth of her 
	skin.
	
	68  VARIOUS SETTINGS. INT/EXT. DAY
	
	The happiest, most vivid moments SALVATORE and ELENA spend
	together:
	
	A country outing. They eat a lavish salad using the flat branches of the
	prickly pear for plates.
	
	A chase through an endless field of wheat.
	In the projection booth. A cake with seventeen lighted candles.
	SALVATORE and ELENA blow them out together. And then a kiss.
	
	69  ROAD AT THE EDGE OF TOWN.EXT. DAY
	
	SALVATORE is driving an old beaten-up Balilla he bought from a
	car-wrecker. ELENA sits beside him, having the time of her life. They
	roar with laughter. The car jolts, moves by fits and starts, jarred by the
	holes in the road, and besides SALVATORE is not such a hot driver. She
	fondles him.
	
				ELENA  
			(Ironically) 
		You have a great future as a driver. 
		If they don't arrest you first!!
	
				SALVATORE  
		That's nothing to do with it, it's 
		the car that's still being run in...
	
	He has barely finished the last sentence when the car gives a
	sudden violent shudder. A sharp report. A cloud of white smoke issues from the 
	motor. And the Balilla stops dead in its tracks. ELENA and SALVATORE cannot 
	smother their wild laughter. They embrace. 
	
				ELENA  
		SO now how do we get home? 
	
						Cut to:  
	
	The two of them are standing beside the empty road, looking bored, as they have 
	already been waiting a long time for someone to go by, a car, a wagon. When all 
	at once a car comes around the bend, heading for town. SALVATORE and ELENA flag 
	it down. 
	
	The DRIVER slows down. The back door opens, a MAN gets out. An alarmed and 
	startled look comes over ELENA's face  that man is her FATHER. She sees him 
	stride over in a rage. 
	
	He has almost reached SALVATORE, who tries lo be polite, to make the best of the 
	situation. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Hello, Dr Mendola...Hem...
	
	ELENA buries her face in her hands, so as not to see...
	
	70  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. EVENING
	
	SALVATORE has a bruise on his cheek and two Band-aids on his face.
	He got himself a good thrashing, and then some. The house is jammed,
	as on the great occasions. Curiosity is written all over the faces of the
	audience. But what they're seeing is not a film, but an instalment of
	Double or Nothing. SALVATORE is standing by a teleprojector which
	has been set up in the central aisle of the balcony. It is a machine that
	makes it possible to project television show on the screen. ALFREDO is
	sitting beside him.
	
				ALFREDO  
			(In a low voice) 
		Toto, are you pulling my leg or 
		something? How is it possible to see 
		this television without film?
	
				SALVATORE  
		Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any. 
		And if you buy a television set, you 
		can watch it at home, without any 
		fuss...
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Sceptically) 
		Could be...But I don't like this
		business. It smells fishy to me.
	
	ELENA is sitting in one corner of the balcony with her parents. Sitting beside 
	her FATHER is the owner of the movie house, SPACCAFICO, who thanks him.
	
				SPACCAFICO  
			(In a low voice) 
		You see what a bright idea, Dr 
		Mendola? But without the bank loan 
		how could I have bought the machine? 
		If we don't get organized around 
		here, in this day and age, we'll meet 
		the same end as the Punch and Judy 
		shows! 
	
	ELENA is not very interested in the TV show. She sneaks a look at SALVATORE. 
	From the looks on their faces, it is clear that things are not going very well. 
	He gives her a nod, as if to say he wants to speak to her and that she should 
	figure out some way! ELENA leans over to her MOTHER, whispers something into her 
	ear.
	
	7I  CINEMA PARADISO. TOILET. INT. EVENING
	
	ELENA's MOTHER stands waiting in front of the women's toilet,
	gazing at Mike Bongiorno emceeing the TV show in the distance.
	
	Inside the toilet, ELENA is standing on the toilet seat whispering to
	SALVATORE, who is standing on the 20ilet seat of the men's toilet.
	
	Their eyes are barely able to peek over the flush tank which they have
	uncovered. ELENA is worried.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Could it be your father doesn't like 
		the work I do...That my family's too 
		poor...Is that it? 
	
	She gives a nod of the head, but only faintly, so as no2 to wound his 
	vulnerability. SALVATORE sighs.
	
				ELENA'S MOTHER  
			(Off-screen) 
		Elena!
	
				ELENA  
		All right! ! 
			(To Salvatore, in a 
			whisper) 
		For the moment it's impossible to see 
		each other...As soon as school is 
		out, we're going to go stay with 
		friends in Tuscany. We'll be there 
		all summer...Maybe if you came up, 
		we could meet in secret...
				SALVATORE  
			(Crestfallen) 
		But we're opening the outdoor movie 
		theatre this summer. What will I do 
		all this time without seeing you?!
				
				ELENA  
		I'll write to you every day. Don't 
		worry. I love you. The summer'll be 
		over and I'll be back...
	
	They reach out to kiss each other. Who knows when they'll be able to see each 
	other again?
	
				ELENA'S MOTHER  
			(Off-screen) 
		Elena! 
	
	ELENA climbs down, pulls the chain and walks off, leaving SALVATORE standing 
	there on the toilet seat.
	
	Summer has come. A bevy of barefoot children chase after the carts carrying the 
	carters' families to the beach to go swimming. SALVATORE, helped by the USHER, 
	has finished loading the disassembled projector on to a wagon in order to carry 
	it to the outdoor movie house. The USHER has hung a sign on the Cinema Paradiso 
	to the effect that 'Showings to continue at the Imperia Arena', and now climbs 
	into the wagon. 
	
	The horse moves off slowly and the monotonous clatter of its hoofs reminds 
	SALVATORE that the summer is going to be long this year, longer than ever. And 
	he leans on the projector that totters and lurches from the jolting of the 
	wheels. A cart carrying a cheerful and noisy family pulls up alongside the 
	wagon. There are the MEN from the slaughter-house. They recognize SALVATORE. 
	
				SLAUGHTER-HOUSE MAN 
		Well, look who's here!! Cecil B. De 
		Mille! Hey, Toto!! When are you 
		coming to shoot another film?!? 
	
	And they laugh, with their gaping toothless mouths. SALVATORE doesn't feel like 
	joking, not even like answering. He looks away, so as not to see their leers. He 
	wants to be by himself. 
	
	73  BEACH AND IMPERIA ARENA. EXT. DAY 
	
	
	The beach is almost deserted, dotted here and there with groups of bathers. The 
	carts and horses are scattered in the sand, near the Imperia Arena, where some 
	WORKMEN are putting on the finishing touches for the new opening. The wagon 
	arrives and SALVATORE and the USHER unload the projector.
	
	74  BEACH. IMPERIA ARENA. PROJECTION BOOTH. EXT.EVENING
	
	A sultry evening. The jacklights of the octopus fishers twinkle on the
	dark horizon. The sound-track of a comic film reverberates over the sea,
	the laughter of the audience mingles with the sound of the shallow waves
	breaking on the rocks. A group of LITTLE BOYS in a boat pulls away
	from shore. They join some more boats standing still in the water, all of
	them crammed with LITTLE BOYS all looking in the same direction...
	towards the screen of the open-air movie at the water's edge. There is a
	funny scene.
	
				LITTLE BOYS  
		All seats are sold out! Free entrance 
		and payment on the way out!! Sssssh!!
	
	And they guffaw noisily. Their laughter is echoed by more
	laughter, in the distance...
	
	...the laughter of the Arena audience, scattered among the
	metal chairs. By dint of laughing, the people in one of the rows
	of chairs tip over backwards. Screams, laughs, whistles.
	The projection booth has a door at the back with stairs leading
	down to the rocks. SALVATORE is sitting on the ground, bare
	chested, tired and sticky with sweat. He is reading a letter from
	ELENA. He is so engrossed the words can almost be read on his
	face.
	
				ELENA'S VOICE  
			(Off-screen) 
		Salvatore, my darling, here the days 
		never end. I find your name 
		everywhere if I read a book, do a 
		crossword puzzle, thumb through a 
		newspaper...You're always before my 
		eyes. Today I've got some rather bad 
		news. At the end of October we're 
		moving to the city where I'll attend 
		the University. It'll be hard to see 
		each other every day. But don't 
		worry, whenever I can get away I'll 
		always come running to you, to the 
		Cinema Paradiso.
	
	On the Arena screen, with its potted plants and palm trees, a
	very funny scene is being shown. The audience again bursts into
	wild laughter. And the audience of LITTLE BOYS in the boats also laugh. One
	of them, laughing himself to tears, loses his balance and falls
	into the water. The others howl with laughter. A voice rises up
	out of the carousel of boats.
	
				URCHIN  
		Fuck me! I've caught an octopus! An 
		oooooctopus!
	
						FADE
	
	75  VARIOUS SETTINGS. INT/EXT. DAY 
	
	The August sun is blazing hot. People are forced to stay inside when the sirocco 
	blows. The streets are empty. And there is a strange silence. Nothing can be 
	heard except far in the distance, from somewhere in the country, the love song 
	of some carter...SALVATORE hears it too, stretched out on the floor of his 
	room, his eyes fixed on the ceiling where flies buzz around nervously. The 
	MAILMAN comes down the street on his bicycle, rides up to SALVATORE and hands 
	him a letter...Sitting in the shade of a white wall, SALVATORE reads the 
	letter. Next to him, the dog that kept him company at night, beneath ELENA's 
	window. He gazes up at him as if looking for news of her.
	
	76:ARENA IMPERIA. PROJECTION BOOTH. EXT/INT.EVENING
	
	The Arena is crowded with sun-burnt faces. On screen, scenes from
	Ulysses. On a shelf in the projection booth, there is an enormous pack of 
	letters. SALVATORE is worn out. The waiting has destroyed him. He looks
	like a madman. As he winds up one of the parts of the film, he repeats
	her name obsessively, under his breath.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Elena...Elena...Elena...
	
	Now he is sitting outside on the back steps, a few yards from the
	sea. There is a breeze this evening, the waves are rather high and
	the boats of 'gate-crashers' can be seen out in the water, rolling
	fitfully but not dangerously. SALVATORE stretches out, gazes up
	at the inky sky and talks to himself, just like a madman,
	whispering...
	
				SALVATORE  
		When will this shitty summer be over? 
			(Half shutting his eyes) 
		In a film it'd already be finished...
			(Smiling)
		...Fade-out and cut to a nice 
		thunderstorm!!! Huh? that'd be 
		perfect!
	
	A clap of thunder explodes in the air. Loud, rumbling. SALVATORE'S eyes pop 
	open. The Arena audience looks up in alarm at the sky...The 'gate-crashers' in 
	the boats also look up and see a streak of lightning ushering in another clap of 
	thunder. One of those storms is building up that ruins late summer 
	nights. SALVATORE gives a contented smile as the cloudburst pours down 
	violently, suddenly... The Arena audience scatters with a howl and scurries 
	over to the overhanging roofs of the projection booth, to take shelter and to go
	on watching the film despite the rain...
	
	The LITTLE BOYS in the boats quickly pull tarpaulins over their
	heads...But SALVATORE does not get up. He lets the rain fall on him,
	goes on laughing, incredulous and stunned as if a real miracle had
	taken place. And as he shuts his eyes and lifts his head up, to
	catch more rain on his face, and gives himself up to that marvellous feeling of 
	joy, a mouth comes to rest passionately on his lips it is ELENA. SALVATORE opens 
	his eyes in utter amazement, it seems like a vision, another hallucination 
	created by the rain...Instead no, it is really her! 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Elena!...But when...
	
				ELENA  
		I got back today. You can't imagine 
		the excuses I had to make up to be 
		here...
	
	SALVATORE's lips interrupt her. It is an intense, a stupendous kiss. They've 
	probably never been so happy as they are at that moment. They cling to each 
	other as the rain goes on streaming over their bodies, mingling her hair with 
	his, binding them ever closer.
	
	77  CINEMA PARADISO. ENTRANCE. EXT. DAY
	
	Autumn has arrived. In the streets, the PEASANTS prepare the barrels
	for preserving the grape must. ALFREDO is sitting in front of the Cinema 
	Paradiso with SPACCAFICO and the USHER. It is a quiet moment, they chat, while 
	the humming of the projector and the sound track of the film can be heard 
	through the window of the booth. The MAILMAN stops and hands SPACCAFICO a folded 
	sheet of paper.
	
				MAILMAN  
		Don Ciccio, this is for Toto. Give it 
		him...
			(And he pedals off on his 
			bicycle.)
	
				ALFREDO  
		What is it?
	
	SPACCAFICO unfolds it, reads it, claps his hands on his head, in alarm.
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Holy blood of Judas! Now what am I 
		going to do??!
	
	78  UNIVERSITY. EXT. DAY
	
	ELENA is waiting near the University. She paces nervously back and
	forth. Glances at her watch. He's late. She looks around in all
	directions and sees him at last. He comes running up to her. They
	embrace...
	
				ELENA  
		So what'd they say?
	
				SALVATORE  
		The army says that, as a war orphan, 
		I don't have to serve in the 
		military, but nothing can be done. 
		It's a bureaucratic error. I have to 
		leave. Day after tomorrow morning. 
		They're sending me to Rome. But 
		they'll discharge me ten days later. 
		Let's go...
	
	He takes her hand, turns to go to a café. ELENA holds back. She has caught sight 
	of her FATHER's car approaching. ELENA turns to look and in a faint voice 
	reveals the reason for her nervousness.
	
				ELENA  
		No, Salvatore. You'd better go. It's 
		my father.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Good, this way we can finally talk. 
		I'll convince him this time.
	
				ELENA  
		He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He 
		has other plans for me.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Who?
	
				ELENA  
		The son of one of his colleagues. 
		Don't act that way. We'll talk about 
		it later. Wait for me Thursday at the 
		Cinema Paradiso. I'll be coming with 
		the five o'clock bus. 
	
	SALVATORE looks with longing as ELENA drives away with her father. 
	ELENA gives him a meaningful look through the window. SALVATORE returns the 
	look, but stands there motionless, with a grim expression, like someone who 
	knows how to take the treacherous blows of life. The car drives off and with it 
	ELENA. Their eyes hang on the same thread. The thread of hope and now of fear.
	
	79  CINEMA PARADISO. ENTRANCE. EXT. MORNING
	
	The poster of Il Grido hangs on the billboard outside the theatre.
	SPACCAFICO replaces 'THURSDAY' with a 'TODAY' sticker. The
	CHARWOMAN is washing the floor of the lobby. SPACCAFICO shouts
	up to SALVATORE, who is in the projectionist's booth. SPACCAFICIO
	says that tomorrow he'll be leaving and today is his last day on the job,
	and he's sorry.
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Toto, this is no film for the common 
		herd. One day'll be more than 
		enough...So tonight, please set up 
		tomorrow's film, so the projectionist 
		who is coming will find it ready.
	
				SALVATORE  
		OK...
	
	SPACCAFICO understands SALVATORE's sadness.
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Cheer up, Toto. I'll be here waiting 
		for you. No one's taking your job 
		away from you. Don't worry!
	
	80  SQUARE AND PROJECTION BOOTH, CINEMA PARADISO. EXT/INT. DAY
	
	The bus has pulled into the square but among the people getting out
	there is no sign of ELENA. SALVATORE stands nervously up in the window of the 
	projection booth, glances at his watch. It's already five-thirty and she hasn't 
	come. He checks the projector. The first part has just begun and the reel is 
	full of film.
	
	The first part is now about to finish, the reel is almost empty, and ELENA still 
	isn't there. SALVATORE is extremely nervous, worried, mortified by his meeting 
	with her FATHER. 
	He sees ELENA's face pulling away in the car. Thinks back over her 
	terrible confession. He paces back and forth, as if he were in a prison cell, 
	thinking up solutions...The stair light finally goes on; there she is SALVATORE 
	dashes over and down the stairs to meet her. He comes down the final turn of the 
	spiral staircase and finds himself face to face with ALFREDO, who is slowly 
	making his way up with the help of his cane. SALVATORE freezes to the spot. 
	ALFREDO senses his disappointment. 
	
				ALFREDO  
		You weren't expecting me? 
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Nervously) 
		No, Alfredo, I was coming to help 
		you...
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Smiling) 
		You were expecting her? Huh? 
			(SALVATORE doesn't answer. 
			He's too worried, too 
			upset. ALFREDO climbs 
			another step, whispering.)
		...It's a nasty business waiting by 
		yourself. In company it's better. 
		No?...Then I'll leave. 
	
	As usual ALFREDO'S sweetness comforts SALVATORE, indeed suddenly gives him a 
	bold idea, one that quiets his nervousness. He puts a hand on ALFREDO'S 
	shoulder.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Alfredo, I need your help!
	
	8I  ROAD TO THE CITY. EXT. AFTERNOON 
	
	The Balilla speeds as fast as it can down the road to the city, where ELENA s 
	family has gone to live. SALVATORE drives along in a state of agitation. The 
	idea of having to leave without seeing ELENA is his obsession. An obsession he 
	refuses to accept...
	
	82 CINEMA PARADISO.PROJECTION BOOTH.INT.AFTERNOON
	
	The second part has begun, the reel is full. For the first time in many
	years, ALFREDO is alone in the booth, sitting in front of the projector,
	and he feels helpless. Not only because he's blind, but also because
	there is nothing he can do for SALVATORE. A strange agitation comes over him, as 
	if he were experiencing the same anxiety troubling his 'Toto' at that moment. 
	Meanwhile, the film roll on and with it, time, minutes...
	
	83  CITY.EXT.AFTERNOON
	
	SALVATORE has already reached the city. He slows down at the bus
	terminus. Looks at the people waiting, but she is not there...
	He asks several girls in front of the University. But they haven't seen
	her...
	
	He phones from a phone booth. But nobody answers. His self-control
	is about to give way to desperation...
	
	84  CINEMA PARADISO.PROJECTION BOOTH.INT.AFTERNOON
	
	On the reel there is less film. Like an hourglass with the sand trickling
	through...
	
	85:ELENAS HOUSE IN THE CITY.EXT/INT.AFTERNOON 
	
	SALVATORE comes streaking up in front of her house. He screeches to a stop, 
	dashes out like greased lightning. His nerves are tense, a slight tremor runs 
	through his whole body. He rings the bell, but nobody answers. A MAN who lives 
	in the building opens the front door and comes out. 
	
	SALVATORE seizes the chance and climbs up to the third floor. He pounds on the 
	door furiously, almost cracking his knuckles. But all to no avail; there is 
	nobody at home. He shrieks, panic stricken. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Open up! Open up! Elenaaa! 
	
	And in fact, there is somebody inside: ELENA's MOTHER. She sits there immobile, 
	without a word. 
	
	The pounding on the door reverberates in the room, but she does not budge, 
	determined to ignore that desperate message.
	
	86:CINEMA PARADISO.PROJECTION BOOTH.INT.AFTERNOON
	
	The reel spins faster. The film is almost ended. By now there is very
	little time...
	
	87  ROAD TO THE VILLAGE. EXT. SUNDOWN 
	
	And SALVATORE is on his way home, defeated. Be drives as fast as he can. Be is 
	in a terrible state, can't figure out what's happened. Can't explain it. And 
	that's what hurts. 
	
	88  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. SUNDOWN
	
	The words 'THE END' appear on the screen...and the film runs out, leaving the 
	projector turning uselessly. ALFREDO is alarmed. He can hear that the film is 
	finished, but doesn't know where to begin. He gropes around. He's scared. Like a 
	little boy calls his mother when he's lost in a crowd, so old ALFREDO calls 
	SALVATORE. 
	
				ALFREDO  
		TotooooO! TotooooO! 
	
	The few people down in the audience start whistling and complaining about the 
	film they haven't understood. 
	
				SPECTATORS  
		Lights! Christ, what a piece of 
		crap!! We want OUT money back!!! 
		Heeeeey!! Bandits!! 
	
	Others are shouting that they like the film.
	
	89  CINEMA PARADISO. ENTRANCE. EXT. SUNDOWN 
	
	The Balilla screeches to a stop in front of the theatre. SALVATORE darts out and 
	runs to the stairs...
	
	90  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. SUNDOWN 
	
	SALVATORE turns the lights on in the theatre and turns off the projector, trying 
	to calm down ALFREDO, who has got to his feet, frightened. 
	
				ALFREDO  
		But where'd you go, Toto?!! 
	
				SALVATORE  
		I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy! 
			(And he folds him into his 
			arms, like calming down a 
			little boy who has had a 
			nightmare. Be whispers, 
			still out of breath:) 
		Sit down, sit down...
			(ALFREDO quiets down as 
			SALVATORE lowers him into 
			a chair, and asks him the 
			only question upon which 
			his last hope depends.) 
		Did she come? 
	
				ALFREDO  
		No, nobody came. 
			(And he embraces him, 
			almost as if to comfort 
			him in his great 
			disappointment.)
	
	For SALVATORE it's really the end: she's not coming. Tomorrow he'll be leaving 
	without having seen her again. 
	
	SALVATORE'S hands remove the photographs of Amedeo Nazzari and of ELENA from the 
	wall, slip them into one of his pockets. 
	
	Now the hands open the metal containers of tomorrow's film, take . 
	out the reels to set them up, pick up the receipt - his last before leaving - 
	and with the same mechanical gesture, hang it on a nail, as usual.
	
	91  ROME. VARIOUS SETTINGS, MILITARY LIFE. EXT/ INT. DAY/NIGHT 
	
	A wild frenetic sequence, set to the pace of military life...SALVATORE, in 
	uniform with close-cropped hair, answers his superior, shouts: 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Radio Operator Di Vita Salvatore! 
		Third Battalion, Ninth Company, 
		sir!!!
	
	Target practice. SALVATORE fires all the shots in the cartridge, one after the 
	other... 
	
	A SECOND LIEUTENANT barks out a march rhythm in the blazing sun. 
	
				SECOND LIEUTENANT  
		One, two, one, two!! Attention! Left 
		march! 
	
	SALVATORE sneaks out of line, goes over and slips a letter into 
	the mailbox and hurries back to his place.
	
	On one of the public phones in a square of Rome, SALVATORE is phoning ELENA. 
	Nobody answers. He slams down the receiver, as the line of SOLDIERS waits its 
	turn...
	
	Night-time. A large plastic bag full of water. A thud. SALVATORE wakes up with a 
	start in a lake of ice water. He lets out a terrified shriek as the others 
	laugh, protected by the dark. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Aaaaaaah! Heeeeeelp!! 
	
	In the large dormitory, the SERGEANT is handing out the mail. He 
	throws a pile of letters on SALVATORE'S bunk. They are his letters to ELENA, 
	stamped 'ADDRESS UNKNOWN'.
	
	Mess duty. SALVATORE is washing Up, in a sea of water and grease.
	He rimes a pan full of tomato sauce with a tap hose. A spurt of red water 
	splatters him in the face. 
	
	A training run. Another letter which SALVATORE drops into the mailbox...
	
	A cold, rainy night. SALVATORE stands stiff as a poker in front of the 
	Ammunition depot. It is his first guard duty. Soaked to the skin, gazing wide-
	eyed into empty space. 
	
	COLONEL'S office. 
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Aggressively) 
		Colonel, I was supposed to spend ten 
		days here and it's been about a year, 
		and I haven't ever gone borne. I'd 
		like a furlough, at least! 
	
	SALVATORE is in the guardhouse. A cold, dark, filthy cell. His nerves start to 
	give way. He bows his head in despair. 
	
	Hospital. SALVATORE is exhausted, run-down. The night-stand is jammed with 
	medicines. He lies in bed without moving, staring off into empty space, and 
	repeats obsessively in a low voice, as if talking to himself. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Elena...Elena...Elena...
			(He has touched the 
			extreme of suffering, a 
			young man who has 
			been denied love and 
			affection, his rights, 
			freedom. A NURSE comes 
			up.) 
	
				NURSE  
		Di Vita Salvatore, get ready, your 
		discharge has come through.
	
	SALVATORE registers this information with his eyes and nods absently.
	
	92  GIANCALDO. SQUARE AND STREETS. EXT. DAY 
	
	The bus disappears around the corner leaving SALVATORE standing there alone. It 
	is a blazing hot day. The sirocco wind blows the yellow dust in all directions. 
	The square is empty, the billboard in front of the closed movie house announces 
	a Western. SALVATORE puts his suitcase on the ground, looks around. Everything 
	exactly the same, immobile. Only one new feature  in the cafe there's a jukebox 
	playing 'Estate' sung by Milva. 
	
	SALVATORE turns towards the Cinema Paradiso. The projectionist is at the 
	window of the booth, smoking a cigarette. Who knows who he is, where he came 
	from. A hot flurry of dust. SALVATORE turns and sees a dog leaping around kim, 
	wagging its tail. It's the dog that kept him company during his nights beneath 
	the window. SALVATORE gives a start of joy, drops his suitcase and leans over to 
	stroke him. Then he hugs him, as if he were an old friend. 
	
	93  ALFREDO'S HOUSE. INT. AFTERNOON 
	
	SALVATORE goes to see ALFREDO. He is still in bed, has just woken up. He is glad 
	to hear his 'Toto'. He feels his forehead, his eyes and cheeks, as if to 'see' 
	him. 
	
				ALFREDO  
		You 're thinner...You can tell 
		you've not been treated well. 
			(As usual, you can't hide 
			anything from ALFREDO. 
			SALVATORE senses something 
			different in him that he 
			can't figure out, like 
			same wild restlessness 
			within). 
	
				SALVATORE  
		They tell me you never go out, never 
		talk to anybody. Why?
				
				ALFREDO  
		Toto, sooner or later there comes a 
		time when talking or keeping quiet is 
		the same thing. So it's better to 
		shut up. 
			(Changing his lone) 
		It's hot in here. Toto, take me to 
		the beach. 
	
	94  BEACH AND WATERFRONT. EXT. AFTERNOON 
	
	The sea is ruffled and the air is less sultry, easier to breathe. 
	SALVATORE and ALFREDO walk slowly along the waterfront. ALFREDO totters 
	slightly, holds on to SALVATORE, who is telling him something very funny. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		At the Christmas party the lieutenant 
		pinches a girl's ass. The girl turns 
		around: it's the daughter of the 
		commanding officer. The lieutenant is 
		scared to death and says: 'Miss, if 
		your heart is as hard as what I have 
		just touched, I'm done for! 
	
	And they roar with laughter. They look like two old school buddies telling each 
	other dirty jokes. They stop beside a low wall. ALFREDO knows that those laughs 
	are simply a way of uselessly dancing around the countless things that are 
	troubling SALVATORE. And he breaks the ice, while SALVATORE is still 
	laughing.
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Seriously) 
		Did you ever see her again? 
			(SALVATORE'S laughter dies 
			away, taken off-guard as 
			he is. Then he lights a 
			cigarette.)
	
				SALVATORE  
		No. And nobody knows where she is. 
	
				ALFREDO  
		It was probably meant to be like 
		this. Each of us has a star to 
		follow. So now what are you thinking 
		of doing? 
	
	It's a terrible question, and SALVATORE has no answer to it. In fact, would 
	rather not even talk about it. He changes his tone, as if he hadn't heard it, 
	laughs, trying again to ding to the funny jokes he heard during military 
	service.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Listen to this one...The commander 
		says to the sergeant: 'You 
		remember that windmill that used to 
		be there?' 'Yes, sir, I remember the 
		mill's gone but the wind's still 
		there!' 
			(And he bursts into 
			nervous laughter. But this 
			time ALFREDO remains cold, 
			unmoved, does not laugh 
			with him. SALVATORE 
			gradually falls silent. He 
			doesn't know what to say. 
			For the first time in his 
			life, he doesn't know what 
			goal to aim for, doesn't 
			know what to do. The cloud 
			of smoke wreaths his 
			nervous face, now he seems 
			to relax, whispers:) 
		You remember the story of the soldier 
		and the princess? 
			(ALFREDO nods his head.) 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Now I understand why the soldier went 
		away just before the end. That's 
		right, just one more night and the 
		princess would have been his. But 
		she, also, could not have kept her 
		promise. And...that would have been 
		terrible, he would have died from it. 
		So instead, for ninety-nine nights at 
		least he had lived with the illusion 
		that she was there waiting for him...
			(This time SALVATORE is 
			the one to explain 
			something to ALFREDO. And 
			ALFREDO realizes how 
			bitter his story is and, 
			above all, that the boy 
			standing there is no 
			longer a boy...) 
	
				ALFREDO  
		Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! 
		This land is cursed. 
			(They are now leaning 
			against a boat on the 
			beach. ALFREDO goes on 
			whispering his words.) 
		When you're here every day you feel 
		like you're at the center
		of the universe, it seems like 
		nothing ever changes. Then you go 
		away, one year, two...And when you 
		come back, everything's different. 
		The thread has broken. You don't 
		find those you were looking for, your 
		things no longer exist. Isn't that 
		the case?...You've got to go away a 
		long time, for many, many years, 
		before coming back and finding your 
		people again, the land where 
		you were born...But not now, it's 
		impossible. Now you're blinder than I 
		am.
			(Intense words, straight 
			from the heart, and 
			SALVATORE is spellbound. 
			He whispers with a smile:) 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Who said that? Gary Cooper, James 
		Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh? 
			(ALFREDO also gives a 
			gentle smile) 
	
				ALFREDO  
		No, Toto, nobody said it. I say it! 
		Life's not like you saw it in the 
		movies. Life...is harder. 
			(He lays his hand on 
			SALVATORE'S shoulder, 
			gives it a hard squeeze.) 
		Get out! Go back to Rome. You 're 
		young, the world is yours! And I'm 
		old...I don't want to hear you talk 
		any more, I want to hear talk about 
		you. 
	
	SALVATORE gives a shudder that runs through his very soul. The setting sun lies 
	colorless on the horizon.
	
	95  VARIOUS SETTINGS. EXT/INT. NIGHT 
	
	Night. The square is empty. SALVATORE is sitting on the church steps. 
	His head in his hands. He has to make a decision leave or stay. And why?... 
	'What decision will he make?' is the question that keeps ALFREDO awake, in his 
	hot dark bedroom...
	
	MARIA, his mother, also can't get to sleep. She knows, senses, that her son is 
	on the verge of an important turning-point. But what will he decide? What will 
	happen?...
	
	Also LIA, his sister, feels a strange, heavy tension in the air. And 
	doesn't sleep. She's probably wondering where SALVATORE is at that 
	hour... 
	
	He's sitting on the ground. But even if he were to go to bed he wouldn't 
	sleep. He rubs his face with his hand. The church bell chimes four a.m...
	
	ALMOST THIRTY YEARS LATER, another distant bell is chiming four a.m. And 
	SALVATORE is once again wide awake. He is thinking, with his hand on his face, 
	just like then. And the same decision to make: what to do? Stretched out beside 
	a sleeping WOMAN, he goes on staring at the window. Outside, the storm has 
	passed. The long memory has almost faded, only the sound of a train surfaces in 
	his mind...
	
	96  GIANCALDO RAILWAY STATION. EXT. DAY
	
	It's the train that THIRTY YEARS EARLIER had pulled into the station
	of his home town before leaving for Rome. SALVATORE hugs his 
	MOTHER and SISTER. The moment has come to say goodbye to  
	ALFREDO. The old man is deeply moved. A heart-rending trembling
	comes into his husky voice. 
	
				ALFREDO  
		Don't come back any more, don't think 
		about us, don't turn round, don't 
		write, don't give in to nostalgia. 
		Forget us all. If you can't hear it 
		and come back, don't come looking for 
		me, I won't let you into the house, 
		you understand? 
	
	They clasp each other tightly, as if they knew they wouldn't be meeting 
	again...
	
				SALVATORE  
		Thanks for all you've done for me. 
	
				ALFREDO  
		Whatever you do, love it like you 
		loved that projection booth of the 
		Paradiso when you were little...
			(The train moves now. 
			Hands wave in the air, 
			drawing further and 
			further away. The PRIEST 
			has arrived at the last 
			moment and waves goodbye 
			from the distance.)
	
				PRIEST  
			(Shouting) 
		Goodbye, TotooooooO!!! I got here too 
		late. What a shame! 
	
	The figure of ALFREDO and the others can no longer be distinguished. Only a 
	distant blur at the end of the track. 
	
	97  PUNTA RAISI AIRPORT. EXT. DAY 
	
	THIRTY YEARS LATER, a plane flies over Sicily. It lands on the 
	runway char seems to emerge from the sea and flatten out towards the slopes of 
	the dark mountains. Salvatore's face appears among the clouds reflected in one 
	of the plane windows. He has the tense look of the man who suddenly comes home 
	after the adventure of life has carried him afar, wandering the world, where he 
	has forgotten everything. From the plane window to another window...
	
	98  SUPERHIGHWAY. INT/EXT. DAY 
	
	...the window of the taxi-cab driving SALVATORE to his home town. The scenery 
	moving by on either side of the road summons up sweet memories. A lot of things 
	have changed, but the colors are still the same. The yellow running through the 
	entire landscape is unmistakable. And all those black birds perched in a row on 
	the guard-rail are crows. 
	
	The cab now approaches the outskirts of Giancaldo. But if the sign, 
	hadn't been there with the name on it, it could be an entirely different 
	place...
	
	99  SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. EXT/INT. DAY
	
	The house where SALVATORE'S MOTHER lives is also new, nearer the 
	sea. 
	
	The old lady is sitting alone in an armchair in the parlor, knitting a white 
	sweater. Her hands move very swiftly, almost mechanically. 
	
	The hands of a woman who is waiting. The front doorbell rings twice. MARIA stops 
	short. That is what she has been waiting for. She mumbles in excitement. 
	
				MARIA  
		It's Toto...I knew it...
	
	And she scrambles to her feet, dropping her knitting in the chair, one needle 
	dangling over the edge. She hurries off, forgetting that she still has the ball 
	of white yarn in her apron pocket. And the yarn runs off the needles and the 
	knitting comes undone quickly as she moves about the house, goes down the stairs 
	to the front door.   
	
	There the yam stops and MARIA' s excited voice is heard.
	
				MARIA 'S VOICE  
			(Off-screen) 
		Toto!...
	
				SALVATORE'S VOICE (Off-screen) 
		How are you, Mamma?... 
	
	The camera now moves, discovering them through the parlor window, hugging each 
	other outside the front door. Under the curious eyes of an old bored dog.
	
	100  SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. INT. DAY 
	
	MARIA is no longer wearing an apron. Mother and son are sitting side 
	by side at the kitchen table...
	
				MARIA  
		Lia'll be so glad to see you, you'll 
		see. And you won't recognize the 
		kids any more, they're grown up by 
		now. 
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Smiling) 
		They're always writing to me saying 
		they want to come to Rome!
	
	SALVATORE looks around; It's a place he's never seen before, and yet it's 
	his mother's house.)
	 
				MARIA  
		See how pretty the house is? We did 
		everything over.
			(Smiling) 
		If it hadn't been for you! 
			(Getting up) 
		Come, I have a surprise.... 
			(She takes him by the hand 
			and leads him out to the 
			hallway. SALVATORE looks 
			at her and feels a pang. 
			She seems smaller, age 
			withers the body, she is 
			slightly stooped, her hair 
			is gathered into a knot at 
			the back other head.)
		You must be tired. If you want to 
		rest, there's time before the 
		funeral. 
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Interrupting her) 
		No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by 
		air, you know. 
	
				MARIA  
			(Smiling, ironically) 
		You shouldn't tell me that now. After 
		all these years! 
			(SALVATORE gets the 
			message, feels guilty. 
			Thinking about it, it 
			seems incredible that he 
			has never come before. 
			MARIA opens a door, steps 
			aside to let her son in, 
			whispers:) 
		I put all your things in here. Go in, 
		go in...
	
	SALVATORE lakes a few steps, is flabbergasted at the sight of his old room 
	perfectly reconstructed and preserved. It looks like a museum, the museum of the 
	past. Despite the bed, the clothes in the cupboard, the books on the shelves, it 
	is perfectly clear that no one has ever lived in it and never will live in it. 
	MARIA senses his perturbation, remains standing in the doorway as if to leave 
	him alone...SALVATORE goes over to the bed, looks around  the old 8mm movie 
	camera, the projector, his documentaries, the bicycle hanging on the wall, the 
	photographs of his favorite movie stars. But what mostly catches his eye is a 
	tiny framed photograph: SALVATORE as a little boy and ALFREDO, standing smiling 
	in front of the Cinema Paradiso. Strange, at that time ALFREDO was younger than 
	he is now! It's as if he were standing there before him one last time. That 
	impressive figure, his good-natured bur firm look, touches his heart. From 
	ALFREDO'S smiling face to...
	
	101  GIANCALDO. MAIN STREET AND SQUARE. EXT. DAY 
	
	...the coffin where his old blind friend rests for ever. The funeral
	procession winds its way down the main street. At the intersections, , 
	cars stop to let the black hearse pass by. People cross themselves. The old men 
	remove their hats. Store shutters are lowered. Then, when the procession has 
	passed by, the cars start up again, the old men put their hats back on, the 
	shutters are pulled up. 
	
	SALVATORE is in the front row with his MOTHER, next to ALFREDO'S WIDOW. 
	SIGNORA ANNA says in a whisper, her eyes fixed on the coffin.  
	
				ANNA  
		He would have been happy you came, 
		Toto. He always talked about you. 
		Always! Right to the end! He was 
		terribly fond of you...
			(Tears come to her, she is 
			unable to say any more. 
			SALVATORE gives her a hug, 
			deeply touched by her 
			words.) 
		He left two things for you. Come see 
		me before you leave. 
	
	SALVATORE nods his head. He gazes intensely at the coffin covered with flowers 
	and is grieved as if he were ashamed never to have come to see the man who had 
	been like a father to him. But why had he forgotten him? Up in front, leading 
	the procession, he sees a young PRIEST with an altar boy beside him, and these 
	figures are also like chisels scraping the rust off his soul and bringing old 
	feelings to light again. 
	
	The procession reaches the square. The dark column stands etched in the dazzling 
	early-afternoon light. SIGNORA ANNA motions the driver and the procession comes 
	to a halt. It is ALFREDO'S last farewell to the place where he had spent the 
	best years of his life  the Cinema Paradiso. Everyone turns to look and 
	SALVATORE also turns, taken by surprise...It has fallen to pieces: doors and 
	windows boarded shut, crumbling walls, a piece of the sign dangling down, weeds 
	and mildew in the cracks and on the roof. The square has changed completely, is 
	unrecognizable. Buildings, stores, sign boards and lines of cars creeping at a 
	snail's pace in a deafening chorus of honking horns. And the central square has 
	turned motorcycles. SALVATORE turns slowly to look behind him, towards the small 
	crowd, and is entranced by the unexpected sight of faces that he recognizes at 
	once, despite the many years that have gone by:  the MAN AT THE BOX OFFICE, the 
	USHER who also served as bill-poster, the CHARWOMAN, the CARABINIERE SERGEANT, 
	and further on behind ROSA and ANGELO, the lovebirds who had met in the movie 
	house and then got married. They all have white hair. And they too have 
	recognized him, give little hello nods and gestures. Another face 
	he seems to recognize: why sure, it's SPACCAFICO, the owner. How old he's 
	become! He also looks up and his eyes meet SALVATORE'S. A hello nod. 
	SALVATORE makes his way over to him through the crowd. They shake hands 
	heartily, without a word, both touched. The procession starts up again. 
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Under his breath) 
		How long's it been shut? 
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Six years ago this May. No one came 
		any more. You "know better than me, 
		Mr. Di Vita, the crisis, television, 
		videos. By now the movie business is 
		only a dream. The city's bought it 
		now to make a new parking lot. Next 
		Saturday they're 
		tearing it down...A pity!...
	
	SALVATORE is disconcerted, irritated by that 'Mr. Di Vita'. Besides, finding 
	out that the movie house is to be torn down depresses him, after all, it's a 
	piece of his life...And all those curious faces staring at him.
	
				SALVATORE  
		But why do you call me 'Mr. Di Vita'? 
		It didn't used to be that way...
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Well, it's hard to call an important 
		person by his first name. But if it 
		really matters to you, I'11 call 
		you...
			(Smiling) 
		Toto!...
	
	SALVATORE smiles at that. Meanwhile, the procession has reached the church. 
	SALVATORE excuses himself and goes over to the hearse. Old SPACCAFICO watches 
	him go, then says, almost to himself) 
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Bless you, Toto. 
	
	The coffin is unloaded. SALVATORE has asked to be one of the 
	bearers into the church. As he moves off slowly with that weight 
	on his shoulder, somebody catches his eye on the other side of the sidewalk. An 
	old woman, sixty or seventy years old, with a plastic bag in her hand. She 
	crosses herself quickly. SALVATORE recognizes her  she was the one he made love 
	with for the first time. TERESA, the prostitute. The coffin is carried into the 
	church, followed by the little procession. 
	
	102  SALVATORE' S MOTHER'S HOUSE. EXT/INT. EVENING 
	
	The little house is sunk in the darkness of evening and the ground floor
	windows are lit up. The rustling of the sea can be heard. The family is having 
	supper. The table is set with the finest silver and the company china has been 
	brought out. LIA is also there with her husband, ALFIO, and their two children. 
	FILIPPO, fifteen, and SARA, thirteen. The television is on, but the sound has 
	been turned practically all the way down. SALVATORE'S presence arouses a special 
	excitement. The children look at their uncle with a certain awe, after all they 
	don't really know him. 
	
				SARA  
			(Playfully) 
		Uncle, the next time Granny comes to 
		Rome, I want to come along too. I 
		want to see what you do when you 
		work...
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Smiling) 
		Fine. But I warn you, there isn't 
		much to see. I sell much more smoke 
		than fire...
	
	The CHILDREN laugh. At the sight of them, LIA, ALFIO and MARIA also smile.
	
				ALFIO 
			(To SALVATORE) 
		Watch out, don't get too familiar 
		with those two 
			(indicating the children)
		they're worse than cannibals. They'll 
		take advantage. 
	
	Everybody laughs again. Even MARIA laughs a lot. SALVATORE looks at her; he had 
	never seen her laugh like that, amused, at peace.
	
				FILIPPO  
		You leaving tomorrow, Uncle? 
	
	SALVATORE doesn't know what to say. He feels drunk. It has been a day of violent 
	upheavals, a series of almost overwhelming emotions and now he knows nothing  on 
	the one hand, he' d like to stay, let himself drift on the sweet tide of family 
	life, be completely carried off by the rolling waves of his own past: on the 
	other, he wishes he had never come. He forces himself to smile again.
	
				SALVATORE  
		I don't know, Filippo. I don't 
		know...
	
	They go on eating, but SALVATORE isn't very hungry. Re peers at LIA eating out 
	of the comer of his eye, feels deeply bound to her  she has a few white hairs 
	and light wrinkles line her face. 
	
	Then he looks at her husband, ALFIO, he's going bald but he tries to hide it by 
	combing over the little hair left. Who knows what their marriage is like, he 
	wonders. He looks back at LIA, and it's as if she sensed it, she looks up, 
	guesses the nature of his thoughts, imagines what he is trying to figure out, a 
	blush colors her cheeks and she smiles. SALVATORE returns a conniving smile.
	The ringing of a phone. SARA starts to get up to go and answer it, hut MARIA 
	stops her with a glance of the eye.
	
				MARIA  
			(To SALVATORE) 
		It must be for you...They've been 
		calling all afternoon. They wanted to 
		know if you're leaving this evening 
		or tomorrow...
	
	Everyone turns to SALVATORE with questioning looks, making him feel even more 
	restless and undecided. The phone goes on ringing.
	
	103  CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. DAY . 
	
	The TRAFFIC cops are trying to break the front door down with their
	shoulders. Once, twice, and at last, the door flies open with a screech, 
	kicking up a cloud of dust. SALVATORE enters by himself...
	
	104  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. DAY 
	
	SALVATORE'S silhouette stands out against the light in the open door. S lowly he 
	makes his way into the empty theatre. A thick layer of dust lends everything a 
	gray, rarefied look. The light streaming in from the windows up above teems with 
	strange mates of dust, like a haze. 
	
	Cobwebs hang like long veils from the ceiling. SALVATORE walks down the middle 
	aisle. The rows of seats are unhinged, what was once the wooden veneer has 
	warped from the dampness. He looks around as if he Were thumbing through the 
	album of his memories.  
	
	The screen dangles from its frame. The emergency exits are boarded 
	and nailed shut. Observing the emptiness of the theatre, SALVATORE 
	has the feeling he can hear the howling, the whistling and voices of the . 
	audience, as he remembers it. But only for one brief moment, then the silence 
	returns. A mouse creeps along one wall, stops near a pile of dust. SALVATORE is 
	attracted by that little gray mass. He goes over as the mouse scampers off, 
	takes a closer look and recognizes the shape of half a lion's head covered with 
	dust. He moves it with his foot, then looks up at the projection booth, 
	repeating the same gesture of bygone years. But the lion's head is no longer 
	there, only the outline of it on the wall, and cobwebs have covered the hales of 
	the booth, those little square openings that had caused him such long suffering 
	as a little boy...SALVATORE now climbs up the spiral staircase. Each step kicks 
	up a little cloud of dust. 
	
	The little booth, yellow with fumes, appears before him again. Now it 
	looks like some big, empty cave. The projector is no longer there, nor 
	the equipment. Who knows where they junked them?! The only thing left is a clump 
	of film strips still attached to the wall: trailers, Part One 
	endings, etc...There he had kissed ELENA for the first time, and
	strips of film like those had grazed their faces. Now they are caught up
	in the coils of cobwebs. And where the film-winder once stood, the
	nails remain with thousands of yellowing receipts. Of all the films 
	shown at the Cinema Paradiso Palace. And three more boxfuls of 
	them are on the floor. 
	
	And the windows overlooking the square are bolted shut and the glass   
	broken. SALVATORE peers out of one of the cracks in the window and
	sees the village...which is now a city. A different world he no longer 
	knows. 
	
	105  CAFÉ IN SQUARE. INT/EXT. DAY 
	
	The cafe in the square has been completely renovated. The CASHIER and BARMEN 
	have young, unfamiliar faces. SALVATORE holds out the receipt with a tip. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		A double whisky, please. 
	
	Several BOYS are sitting at the comer tables, talking about girls. Others stand 
	playing 'war games', shake around to the obsessive strains of same electronic 
	tune. 
	
	A man comes up to SALVATORE and asks for his autograph. Then SALVATORE turns to 
	the plate-glass window overlooking the main street, where the workers' club once 
	was. And like a flash, a shudder freezes him to the spot.... Two steps away 
	from 
	him, through the glass, a stunning vision, which casts him beyond time, chills 
	his blood: there before him is ELENA! But she is still young, young as she was 
	then! Sweet, luminous, alluring, exactly the way he saw her the first time at 
	the station. 
	
	She is waiting to go across the street with a bunch of books under her 
	arm...Have the passing years had no effect on her? Or is she an hallucination? 
	No! It's a dream! Or is he dead too, like ALFREDO? SALVATORE doesn't know how to 
	explain it. And he is suddenly seized by a feeling of panic. His glass drops to 
	the floor...As the GIRL walks off... 
	
	106  GIANCALDO. STREET. EXT. DAY 
	
	At the age of fifty-five, SALVATORE feels no scruples about wandering
	the streets of his home town, spying from a distance on an eighteen- year-old 
	girl. There's nothing he can do about it. He stares at her with the amazement of 
	someone who discovers that miracles exist. Now he is nearer to her. How lovely 
	she is! It's her, no doubt about it! Exactly the same. Except she has a 
	different hair-do and is wearing different clothes:  ELENA didn't wear slacks. 
	The GIRL goes up to a parked motorcycle. She removes the padlock and fastens her 
	books to the rack. SALVATORE is standing there a few steps away, and without 
	stopping to think, moves a little closer, discreetly, politely.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Excuse me, Miss...
			(She turns to look at him, 
			indifferent, but friendly. 
			He looks at her wonderful 
			blue eyes.) 
		I'm so sorry, I thought you were 
		someone else. 
			
				GIRL  
			(Shrugging) 
		Well. 
	
	She has already started the motor of her bike. A flip of the accelerator and 
	off she goes, her hair flying in the wind. 
	
	SALVATORE follows her with his eyes until she disappears around the corner.
	
	107  SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. INT. AFTERNOON 
	
	The old shots of ELENA getting off the train and walking away, casting a curious 
	look at the camera...SALVATORE is watching her again, projected on the white 
	wall of his room. He also watches the other shots of those happy long-gone days  
	the picnic,. she at the beach, smiling, joyful...And again SALVATORE doesn't 
	understand, or doesn't want to understand. But these scenes could have been shot 
	yesterday, so identical to ELENA is the girl he saw on the street...And the 
	wound which he thought had healed years ago, starts bleeding again. 
	
	The lingering note of suffering for a romance that had ended without his ever 
	knowing why, and the endless explanations that had been sifted through by his 
	young mind, start slipping through his soul again, like those shots 
	slipping again through an old 8mm projector. 
	
	Through the crack of the door, MARIA sees those images on the wall, SALVATORE 
	rocking his head back and forth slowly, like he used to do as a boy when he 
	cried. She somehow feels his grief, his bitterness, lowers her eyes and walks 
	away without a word, as the little shiny rectangle on the wall remains blank, 
	empty...And SALVATORE sits there gazing at it, as if he saw other scenes which 
	his camera never set down on film, only his memory. 
	 
	108  HIGH SCHOOL. STREETS AND LITTLE SQUARE. EXT. DAY 
	
	The HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS are coming out after school. Happy young faces. That 
	GIRL 's motorcycle can be seen in a rear-view mirror. SALVATORE is at the wheel 
	of the car ALFIO has lent him. He has obviously followed that motorcycle before. 
	He waits with an eagerness he thought he had long lost, a determination to 
	understand, to get to the bottom of the matter, which frightens him and at the 
	same time overwhelms him hopelessly. 
	
	And here she comes. She unlocks the padlock and prepares to speed off. SALVATORE 
	starts the motor and follows her a short distance away. The GIRL heads for the 
	new residential district on the outskirts. 
	
	109  SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. INT. DAY 
	
	MARIA is setting the table. LIA and her family are eating at her 
	house today. SALVATORE is sitting again, with a lighted cigarette, 
	gazing through the window at the shrubs tossing in the wind and the 
	rolling sea. The air whistling through the cracks of the windows lends a 
	heaviness to the silence, like the troubled look on his face. MARIA glances at 
	him. 
	
				MARIA  
		What are you thinking, Toto? 
	
	SALVATORE looks at the old woman's lovely face, a faint smile. on his lips. 
	There was always something like an unspoken rule between them, the rule of 
	silence, of unconfessed complicity. And now he feels that rule has to be broken. 
	He speaks quietly, as if to curb the tumult of his feelings of guilt.
	
				SALVATORE  
		I was thinking...that we've never 
		talked, Mamma...When I was little I 
		saw you as if you were already old. 
		That's probably true with all kids...
		Who knows? 
			(She nods, then sits down 
			before him. He strokes her 
			old, skinny, heavily 
			veined hands...) 
		But only now do I realize you were 
		young, you were beautiful, had a 
		whole life before you. But how...
			(Sighing) 
		...how could you have lived alone 
		all that time, with no one to look 
		after you? You could have 
		remarried...Why not? At the time I 
		probably wouldn't have understood, 
		but I would have later...
	
	MARIA doesn't answer, but she is not troubled. An inner peace lends her a sweet, 
	quiet expression. Then she too agrees to break the rule of silence. 
	
				MARIA  
		I never had anybody. If that's what 
		you think...I didn't want anybody. I 
		always remained faithful. First to 
		your father, then to you, to Lia. 
			(With a shrug) 
		That's the way I'm made, there's 
		nothing I can do about it. 
			(Smiling) 
		And you're like me, you're too honest 
		and too attached to the things you
		love...But I don't know if that's a 
		good thing. Faithfulness is a bad 
		business. If you're faithful, you're 
		always alone! 
			(SALVATORE is immersed in 
			the profound truth of 
			those words. And he says 
			nothing. The silence is 
			broken by the ringing of 
			the phone. A menacing 
			sound, which SALVATORE 
			cannot bear. He knows they 
			are calling him from Rome, 
			gives a nervous gesture, 
			stands up and pulls out 
			the plug. The silence 
			returns, the whistling of 
			the wind. MARIA lowers her 
			eyes.) 
		It's my fault! It would have been 
		better if I hadn't called you... 
	
	SALVATORE sits down again, leaning closer to her. He stubs out his cigarette in 
	the already overflowing ashtray.
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Whispering) 
		No...It's nothing to do with you. 
		It's just that I was scared of coming 
		back. Now, after all these years, I 
		thought I was strong, that I had 
		forgotten lots of things. Instead, I 
		find it's quite the opposite, as if I 
		had never left. And yet, I look at 
		Lia and feel as if I didn't know her, 
		and you, Mamma...I abandoned you, 
		ran away like a thief, thought only 
		of myself, and never gave you 
		an explanation...
	
				MARIA  
			(Interrupting him) 
		And I never asked for one! You have 
		nothing to explain. I always thought 
		that what you did was right, and that 
		was that. With no beating around the 
		bush...
			(Smiling, playing it down) 
		Only one thing made me suffer: 
		bolting the door shut before going to 
		bed at night...
	
				SALVATORE  
		You never used to do that! 
	
	She smiles like a little girl who is about to confess the fibs she has told.
	
				MARIA  
		No, no...When you used to work at 
		the movies, I could never get to 
		sleep at night until you came home. 
		Then when you arrived, I pretended to 
		be asleep, but I heard all your 
		movements. Then when you fell asleep, 
		I'd get up and bolt the door. Then, 
		when you left, every time I did it, I 
		felt as if I had left somebody 
		outside the door, far away.... 
			(SALVATORE listens to his 
			MOTHER'S words, surprised 
			and entranced by the 
			poetry of her way of 
			speaking...) 
		But you were right to leave. You 
		succeeded in doing what you wanted to 
		do...
			(Sighing) 
		When I call you, a different, woman 
		always answers. I pretend I know them 
		so they won't have to go through the 
		embarrassment of introducing 
		themselves. 
			(Smiling) 
		I'm sure they take me for a crazy old 
		woman. But so far I've never heard 
		one voice that really loves you...I 
		would have known. And yet, I'd like 
		to see you...settled down...fall in 
		love...
			(Gazing into his eyes) 
		But your life's there. Here there are 
		nothing but ghosts, Toto! Let it go. 
	
	She has said this with a subtle allusiveness in her voice. And SALVATORE 
	realizes she has always known everything. But he doesn't' answer her. 
	They look at each other a Long time without speaking. Their rule of conniving 
	silence has come back into play, as before, forever. It is her expression that 
	tells him to leave, to take the plane and fly away...
	
	110  SMALL SQUARE AND HOUSE. INT/EXT. EVENING 
	
	But SALVATORE has not taken his MOTHER'S advice. Re has not left. Something 
	holds him there still, leads him to go on looking. 
	
	The GIRL'S motorcycle is parked in the courtyard beyond the gate of a small 
	house. He is studying it from inside the car parked in a corner of the small 
	square, near a café. Re has been there some while, but is not nervous, waits 
	there with determination...
	
	Several windows in the house are lit, but no one can be seen through 
	the curtains. Nothing but shadows pass by every now and then. Now the light in 
	one of the windows goes out, and the light on the stair goes on. The front door 
	opens and the GIRL comes out with a tall, sturdy- looking, elegantly dressed 
	GENTLEMAN around fifty. 
	
	They converse bur are too far away for their voices to be heard. SALVATORE 
	watches them come out the gate and climb into a car. They look like father and 
	daughter. The car now drives off and passes right by him. A gleam of light, 
	the reflection from the headlights, falls on the GENTLEMAN'S face. He recognizes 
	him at once, from the birthmark on his temple...
	
				SALVATORE  
			(To himself) 
		Boccia! 
	
	His eyes flash, he's afraid he's understood. And now the craze to get to the 
	bottom of it all gnaws away at him. There is no turning back. 
	
	111 CAFÉ. AND SMALL SQUARE. INT/EXT. EVENING 
	
	SALVATORE'S hands rifle through a phone directory. He is in the cafe, on the 
	other side of the glass door leading to the little square. His finger 
	runs down the column of names...
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Mumbling) 
		His last name was Lo Meo, Vincenzo. 
	
	He has already put the token into the slot and dials the number, looking at the 
	two lit upstairs windows of that house, where the mystery of his life may be 
	hiding. SALVATORE hears the first ring, his heart in his throat...A shadow 
	appears in one of the windows. And a voice answers. 
	
				VOICE ON TELEPHONE  
		Hello? 
			(It's a woman's voice. 
			SALVATORE shuts his eyes, 
			is about to speak, but the 
			lump in his throat 
			silences him...) 
	
				VOICE ON TELEPHONE  
		Hello? Hello? 
	
	He still hesitates, can' t get a word out, as if he had lost his voice or 
	didn't know what to say. He hangs up. The shadow at the window also hangs up, 
	then disappears... 
	
	SALVATORE is at a loss, sits down at one of the rabies near the 
	phone in the almost empty cafe. At the far end, a group of five people watching 
	television.
	
				BARMAN  
		You want something? 
	
	And he turns back to the television. SALVATORE lights a cigarette. He is 
	uncertain. Once again he has to lake an important decision  redial the number 
	and seek a face behind that shadow? Or forget the whole thing, the GIRL, BOCCIA, 
	the shadow, and go away? Yes, best go away. He gets up and leaves. He can be 
	seen through the window turning the comer. A pack of cigarettes and a lighter 
	lie on the table, he has forgotten them. And the lighted cigarette bums down in 
	the ashtray. A few moments have gone by. Footsteps, and a hand picks up the 
	lighter and the cigarettes. It is SALVATORE who now, on a sudden urge, slips 
	another token into the slot. The shadow reappears at the window. The same voice 
	as before.
	 
				VOICE ON TELEPHONE  
		Hello, who's speaking? 
	
	SALVATORE answers at last, keeping his eyes shut, whispering:
	 
				SALVATORE  
		I'd like to speak to Signora Elena...
	
				VOICE ON TELEPHONE  
		Speaking. Who is it, please? 
	
	SALVATORE feels a terrible pang, continues:
	
				SALVATORE  
		Salvatore. 
	
	Silence, charged with tension. Then the voice continues weakly, as if puzzled.
	
				VOICE ON TELEPHONE  
		Salvatore...who? 
	
	He runs his hand over his forehead, his eyes, as if to soothe the turmoil he 
	feels inside.
	
				SALVATORE 
		Di Vita. Salvatore Di Vita. Do you 
		remember? 
			(Another pause chilly, 
			heavy. SALVATORE opens his 
			eyes, looks at the window. 
			Her shadow is motionless, 
			as if cut out of 
			cardboard.) 
		Elena, I'm here, in the bar, across 
		the street from your house. 
	
	The shadow moves slowly, a hand pulls aside the curtain. It's a moment of heart-
	rending emotion...She appears. And they see each other from a distance, after 
	thirty years, each of them with a phone receiver to their ear. But she is 
	somewhat in the dark, against the light, it's impossible to make out her 
	features. Her voice gives a sudden start, instantly controlled.
	 
				VOICE ON TELEPHONE  
		Certainly, I remember...
	
	SALVATORE'S eyes glisten, try to pierce the distance and the darkness to get a 
	better look, but in vain. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Elena. I'd like to see you...Let's 
		meet. 
	
	ELENA lets the curtain drop and goes back to being a shadow. She whispers the 
	words.
	
				VOICE ON TELEPHONE  
		It's been so long. Why should we 
		meet? What good would it do? 
	
				SALVATORE 
		Please, don't say no.. . 
	
	But her voice is firm, unshakeable, even if quivering with emotion.
	
				VOICE ON TELEPHONE  
		I'm old, Salvatore. And you too. It's 
		best not to meet. Goodbye. 
	
	The shadow hangs up, disappears. The light goes off.
	
	112  DIFFERENT SETTINGS. INT/EXT. EVENING 
	
	The wind is stronger now, the streets and the square are empty. SALVATORE 
	is at the wheel of the car, driving aimlessly around the town. He has 
	rediscovered the woman who conditioned his whole life and they hadn't had the 
	courage to meet. An obsessive musical heat, fraught with rage, pours out of the 
	car radio. 
	
	113  SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. INT. EVENING 
	
	A phone ringing drowns out the sound of the television and the wind  
	whistling outside. In the half-darkened room, MARIA picks up the receiver...  
	
				MARIA  
		Hello?
	
	No one answers, but she can sense the presence of someone who now hangs up. 
	MARIA is alarmed. Who could it be at this hour? And where is Toto?
	
	114  SEAFRONT AND PIER. EXT/INT. CAR. EVENING 
	
	SALVATORE stands motionless on the pier, facing the storm-tossed sea. He feels 
	relieved by the roar of the waves that dispels his bitter thoughts, blurs them, 
	but does not wipe out the look of suffering in his eyes. A flashing light seems 
	to approach behind his back. SALVATORE turns and is blinded by the headlights of 
	a car parked at the beginning of the pier. The splattering waves lend the scene 
	a hazy cast and diffuse the glare of the flashing headlights. Now the lights 
	move towards him. And SALVATORE also lakes a few timid steps forward... 
	They are close. The car has almost stopped. But it is impossible to make out the 
	person at the wheel who now reaches over to open the other door. A voice can be 
	barely heard over the raging sea. It is ELENA's voice. 
	
				ELENA  
		Salvatore! 
	
	SALVATORE approaches, accepting the invitation, enters the car and shuts the 
	door. The headlights go off and the car remains there suspended between the open 
	sea and the harbor with its rocking boats. Inside the car, not a word. Two dark 
	figures gaze at each other, unintelligible, as if the night were trying to 
	further delay that meeting. The glowing reflection of a wave higher than the 
	others now lights up their faces. ELENA was right, they are no longer the faces 
	of teenagers, but of people on in years who study each other, searching for a 
	truth. The howling of the wind and the crashing of the waves are louder, but 
	ELENA and SALVATORE /rear nothing, sit glued to their seats, fixed in the 
	endless gaze that envelops them. He is the first to break the silence in a faint  
	voice.
	
				SALVATORE  
		How'd you know I'd be here? 
	
	ELENA  I don't know how many years have gone by, but some things about you I do 
	remember. There weren't many, places you could have gone. I looked around...
	
	SALVATORE turns on the light of the rear-view mirror. Finally 
	they can see better. They look at each other a little ill at ease, 
	making the inevitable comparisons with the memory of their young faces. 
	SALVATORE carefully observes her graying hair, her blue eyes lined 
	with wrinkles, the somewhat faded beauty mark on her lip.
	
				SALVATORE  
		You're still beautiful...
	
				ELENA  
		Don't be silly...I'm old.
			(She looks down troubled 
			by the way he has of 
			gazing into her eyes, 
			speaks almost mumbling her 
			words.) 
		Don't look at me like that, please. 
			(And she switches off the 
			light. But this time it is 
			less dark, things can be 
			seen.) 
		Why'd you come back? 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Alfredo died. Do you remember him? 
	
				ELENA  
		Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. 
		You were terribly fond of him. 
	
	A moment of silence. It's hard to find something to say.
	
				SALVATORE  
		I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! 
		Who knows how many Salvatores 
		must be running after her...
	
				ELENA  
			(Smiling) 
		One or two. Bur there're not all that 
		many Salvatores. 
			(SALVATORE also smiles, 
			but a puzzled smile as if 
			what she has said had 
			thrown him off-guard.) 
		I've got a son, too...he's older. 
		And you, do you have children? 
	
				SALVATORE  
		No. And I'm not married. 
			(ELENA sits there in 
			silence. A veil of sadness 
			clouds her eyes. 
			SALVATORE'S 
			too...) 
		Are you happy? 
	
				ELENA  
		All things considered, yes. Even if 
		it wasn't what I dreamt of then...
	
	Again SALVATORE is thrown off-guard, as if the round key of 
	his enquiry had met with only square locks. She continues.
	 
				ELENA  
		My husband...you know him. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Sure, sure! Boccia...
			(With a bitter smile) 
		What's he do? 
	
				ELENA  
		Politics. He's the district 
		representative. We met at the 
		University in Pisa. 
	
	Then instinctively, in a shy voice, SALVATORE asks the question 
	that he probably wouldn't have asked a moment later.
	
				SALVATORE  
		And...how come you never married 
		that guy from Tuscany? 
	
	The white foam of the waves splashes up over the wall of the pier, dashing 
	against the car windows. The shadow of the trickling water is superimposed on 
	the agony of their faces. ELENA hides her embarrassment beneath a faint but 
	haughty smile.
	
				ELENA  
		I didn't want to...I had to fight 
		tooth and nail. But in the end I 
		won...
			(SALVATORE is unable to 
			smile. It's as if the void 
			were growing and swelling 
			within. Thunder and 
			lightning shatter the 
			roaring of the wind and 
			sea, hut it does not rain. 
			Now her smile Jades away.)
		At that time...I was waiting for 
		you...
	
	There is no resentment in her words. She has said them fondly. With the serenity 
	of someone who has suffered greatly and then found a strong convincing way of 
	suffering no more. For SALVATORE, it's as if one of those thunderbolts had 
	pierced his heart. He leans over, gazing into her shining eyes. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		But I've never forgotten you, Elena! 
	
				ELENA  
			(Whispering) 
		Nor have I. Even though you 
		disappeared...
			(SALVATORE is staggered, 
			feels as if he were 
			plunging into the void. 
			What she has said strikes 
			him as grotesque. ELENA 
			strokes his hair, as if to 
			restrain his sinking 
			heart, gives a sweet 
			smile.) 
		But what's the point of talking about 
		it? We risk being pathetic and 
		ridiculous. 
			(And she tries to change 
			the subject.) 
		You still live in Rome? 
	
	But SALVATORE ignores the question. He doesn't want to change the subject. 
	He feels that everything is crumbling inside him, the alibis and excuses he had 
	had to give himself in order to accept the end of their romance. And instead, 
	now the tables seem to have completely turned. Without realizing, he shouts 
	desperately, staring wildly at her and shaking her by the 
	shoulders.
	
				SALVATORE  
		What do you mean, you were waiting 
		for me?! What are you saying? 
			(He controls himself at 
			once, continues, breathing 
			heavily.) 
		The last time we saw each other, we 
		made a date to meet at the Cinema 
		Paradiso. You remember? And you 
		didn't come, you disappeared without 
		leaving a trace, nothing! I'll tell 
		you how many years have gone by: more 
		than thirty!!! 
	
	Quiet rears stream down Elena's face, glisten with the reflections of the 
	lightning and the waves.
	
				ELENA  
		I kept that date. 
			(SALVATORE laughs at the 
			absurdity of it. A 
			nervous, heartbroken 
			laugh, which slowly melts 
			away as she goes on to 
			say:) 
		But I was late...
			(Tears continue to stream 
			out of her blue eyes, but 
			she tells her story in a 
			calm voice.) 
		I had a fight with my family. I tried 
		to convince them again that they 
		couldn't separate us. But it was 
		futile. They had decided to leave 
		Sicily once and for all. Which is 
		what we did. I didn't know what to do 
		any more, what to say. And I said 
		yes, I'd do whatever they wanted. In 
		return, my father promised to let me 
		see you one last time, to say 
		goodbye. But I hoped that by seeing 
		each other we could take advantage of 
		it and make a decision...I thought 
		we would run away together. 
			(She holds back her sobs. 
			Dries her tears with the 
			back of her hand, and 
			continues:) 
		My father drove me to the movie 
		theatre. But you weren't in the 
		projection booth. Only Alfredo...
	
	Her voice continues over the scene of same thirty years before...
	
	115  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. AFTERNOON Flashback. 
	
				ELENA'S VOICE  
			(Off-screen) 
		And I didn't have time to wait for 
		you to comeback... 
	
	From the bottom of the spiral staircase, ELENA'S FATHER is waiting nervously, 
	yells up at the projection booth.
	
				ELENA' S FATHER  
		Elena! Hurry up!! 
	
				YOUNG ELENA  
		All right, Daddy!...
	
	In the projection booth, ALFREDO is sitting on a stool, near the
	projector. Seen from the rear, the YOUNG ELENA is leaning over 
	beside him, she is excited, her eyes are red and swollen with tears.
	
				ELENA'S VOICE  
			(Off-screen) 
		So I told Alfredo how things stood 
		and fiat I was leaving the same 
		evening, and I asked him to tell you 
		everything. He was very kind, he 
		listened carefully, then... 
	
	ALFREDO answers YOUNG ELENA, stroking her hair.
	
				ALFREDO  
		Easy, easy. 
			(Sighing) 
		Listen carefully to what I have to 
		say. If you want me to tell Toto what 
		you've told me, I will. But if you 
		want my advice, forget it. It's 
		better for both of you if you don't 
		see each other...
			(YOUNG ELENA gives a start 
			of resentment, listens 
			with surprise.) 
		Dear girl, fire always turns into 
		ashes! Even the deepest love ends 
		sooner or later. And after that other 
		loves appear, lots of them. Toto, he 
		can't understand fiat now. If I tell 
		him he won't believe it, he' d be 
		capable of killing me...But you can 
		understand, you've got to 
		understand...Do it for him! 
	
	116  WATERFRONT. INT. CAR. EVENING 
	
	SALVATORE sits there without moving, pale as a sheet, looks as if he had
	grown even older. As if the whole world has fallen in on him. For ELENA, it was 
	a painful but liberating story. She dries her last tears. 
	
				ELENA  
		It's the first time I've had to 
		chance to tell the story. I never 
		mentioned it to anybody. 
	
				SALVATORE  
			(In a daze) 
		Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell 
		on you too! 
	
				ELENA  
		I told him I'd take his advice. But 
		before I went away I left you that 
		note...
			(SALVATORE gives her a 
			quick look, a questioning 
			look. He listens.) 
		I was on my way down the stairs...
			(Her voice continues, laid 
			over the...) 
	
	117  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. AFTERNOON Flashback
	
	ELENA has already said goodbye to ALFREDO, is on her way down the stairs, but 
	stops short. 
	
				ELENA' S VOICE  
			(Off-screen) 
		I thought Alfredo couldn't see me. So 
		I snuck back up...
			(She tip-toes back without 
			making any noise. Goes 
			over to the film-winder. 
			Takes out a pen, looks for 
			a scrap of paper, but 
			doesn't see any. Her eyes 
			fall on the film receipts 
			hanging on the nail. She 
			tears off the top one, 
			turns it over and 
			scribbles a message on the 
			back.) 
		I wrote you where you could find me, 
		and that I'd wait for you. 
	
	She hangs the scrap of paper back on the nail, well in sight. She creeps out, 
	glancing at ALFREDO, who hasn't noticed a thing.
	
	118  WATERFRONT. EXT/INT. CAR. EVENING 
	
	ELENA finishes telling her story. She heaves a Jeep sigh. 
	
				ELENA  
		But you disappeared all the same. 
	
	There is a haunted look in SALVATORE's eyes, he is searching his memory for 
	something he can't find, then suddenly sees, as if in a dream...his hand thirty 
	years before going through the routine gesture of hanging a receipt on the nail, 
	over the others, mechanically, without even looking...and he shuts his eyes as 
	if fearing the truth. Her last words have wounded him. He shakes his head, then 
	in a faint voice:
	
				SALVATORE  
		Oh, how I looked for you, Elena! 
		You'll never know. I wrote, 
		telephoned, nothing. Nobody ever 
		answered. But I dreamt of you for 
		years! That's why I went away...and 
		never came back here. 
			(And his anguish breaks 
			free, dissolving into 
			quiet, almost childish 
			tears. ELENA is startled 
			by his reaction. She 
			caresses him, 	
			passionately. They embrace 
			and remain like that, she 
			with her face buried in 
			his shoulder, he leaning 
			on hers with his tear-
			filled eyes.)
		Even as the years passed, in all the 
		women I met, I was only looking for 
		you. I had success it's true, but 
		there was always something missing...
			(She is deeply moved, goes 
			on caressing him gently 
			until he calms down. The 
			car windows are steamed 
			up. The sea, the harbor, 
			the waves have 	
			disappeared. Nothing 
			remains but the sound of  
			the storm. SALVATORE takes 
			her face between his 
			hands. They gaze at each 
			other, their faces 
			practically touching. He 
			murmurs:) 
		I'd never have imagined that all this 
		had to end because of the man who was 
		like a father to me. A crazy lunatic!  
			(She gives a faint smile.) 
	
				ELENA  
		He wasn't crazy. In the beginning I 
		was upset. I think I really hated 
		him. But then, with time, I 
		understood what he said...and your 
		silence too. 
	
	SALVATORE whispers one last dreadful revelation. And it's as if he had got a 
	terrible weight off his chest.
	
				SALVATORE  
		But I never saw that note! 
			(He squints, as if to 
			stress the absurdity of 
			the idea.) 
		I must have covered it with my hand, 
		without realizing it, that's the only 
		explanation...
			(But strangely enough, 
			ELENA is not surprised.) 
	
				ELENA  
		What difference does it make to find 
		an explanation? That's the way it 
		went. But Alfredo didn't betray you, 
		he was the only one who really 
		understood you. Salvatore, if you had 
		chosen to be with me, you'd have 
		never made your films. And that would 
		have been a pity! Because they're 
		wonderful, I've seen them all. 
			(Her eyes glitter with 
			joy, then she smiles, 
			almost ironically.) 
		But you shouldn't have gone and 
		changed your name. You should have 
		kept your own. 
	
	Tears stream down Salvatore's cheeks. He gives her a look of longing, of 
	desire. 
	
	ELENA embraces him. They kiss with heartrending tenderness, with the same 
	passion of their first kiss amidst the strips of film brushing their faces, so 
	many years ago. And they make love, clasped in the cramped quarters of the car, 
	like two teenagers. Passionate kisses, embraces, deep sighs. Their hair 
	damp with sweat, their hands clasping, their fingers interweaving. Then the 
	frenzy subsides into a deep, tumultuous pleasure, of immense loving and immense 
	grief...As outside the wind and the waves go on rating around that car which 
	seems suspended in empty space.) 
	
	 
	119  ALFREDO'S WIDOW'S HOUSE. INT. DAY 
	
	SIGNORA ANNA'S hands place an old wooden stool and a rusty round 
	metal can on the table.
	
				ANNA  
		These are the things he left to 
		you...
	
	SALVATORE is sitting by the table. He has finished the cup of coffee SIGNORA 
	ANNA has prepared for him. He picks up the stool, recognizes it at once: it's 
	the one ALFREDO had made for him as a little boy so he could climb up and put 
	the reels on the projector. 
	
				ANNA  
		When they showed your films on 
		television, he was happy. He'd plop 
		himself down there and all his 
		ailments were forgotten. He knew all 
		the words by heart, every one, and 
		I'd describe what was going on. And 
		when the papers talked about 
		you, I had to read them two or three 
		times...
	
	SALVATORE examines the can, wonders what it can be. He opens it: inside is a 
	reel of film, wrapped in a plastic bag, well preserved. Those objects bring a 
	pang to his heart, and the things that ANNA said, but he feels disappointed, as 
	if he expected to find something else.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Did he ever think of meeting me? 
	
				ANNA  
		No, never! One time your mother said 
		that if he wanted, you'd have surely 
		come. He got furious and said  'No, 
		Toto mustn't come back to Giancaldo, 
		never!!' He didn't say it to be mean. 
		He was a decent man. Who knows what 
		he could have been thinking? Towards 
		the end he'd say such strange things. 
		And a moment before he shut his eyes, 
		he told your mother not to let you 
		know. 
	
	120  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. DAY 
	
	A cloud of yellowed scraps of paper flutters into the air and as it falls slowly 
	to the ground another handful is flung up. SALVATORE is in the projection booth, 
	looking through the countless yellowed receipts, stuffed away in boxes. He looks 
	at them one by one, then throws them into the air. A desperate search, almost a 
	defiance of the passing of time. He continues with greater determination, flings 
	piles of receipts into the air, glances at a few dates, a film title, tries to 
	discover the oldest dates at the bottom. He moves swiftly, his hands plunge in, 
	then fling up a nimbus of paper and dust. But to no avail...He stops, short of 
	breath. His eyes go over to the nails in the wall, where other stacks of 
	receipts are hanging. He gets up and goes to look at them, thumbs " it through 
	them hastily, in anger... 
	
	He yanks off two or three packs, which come off, nail and all. Only then does he 
	notice that at the bottom of those blocks of yellowed paper, there are same more 
	sheets, much older, almost brown. His eyes concentrate on the mildewed scraps of 
	paper. He leans over, picks themup and goes through them one by one, delicately, 
	because they crumble in his fingers...And then all of a sudden, some film 
	titles 
	he recognizes from that time. He goes on thumbing through them, and all at once 
	an astonished look appears on his face  in his hands is a receipt that has been 
	turned over. It's the one! The message scribbled on it can still be seen. He 
	reads it. 
	
				SALVATORE'S VOICE  
			(Off-screen) 
		Salvatore, forgive me. I'll explain 
		later what happened. Not finding you 
		here was terrible. Unfortunately, 
		this evening, my mother and I are 
		leaving for Tuscany. We're moving 
		there. But you' re the only one I 
		love, I'll never be with anybody 
		else, I promise. Here's the address 
		of a girlfriend of mine where you 
		can write to me. Don't abandon me. 
		Love and kisses, Elena. 
	
	He clasps the scrap of paper, and his brimming eyes darken with regret.
	
	121  CAFÉ~ IN SQUARE AND ELENA'S HOUSE. INT/EXT. DAY 
	
	ELENA stands near the window overlooking the little square, listening on the 
	phone to SALVATORE'S voice. She can see him through the transparent curtain 
	speaking on the phone down below in the café. 
	
				ELENA  
		When are you leaving? 
	
	SALVATORE opens his eyes, tosses away his cigarette.
	
				SALVATORE  
		This afternoon. Elena, in the future 
		maybe we could...
	
	ELENA interrupts him, speaks softly, tenderly.
	
				ELENA  
		No, Salvatore...there is no future. 
		There's only the past. Even meeting 
		last night was nothing but a dream, a 
		beautiful dream. 
			(Smiling) 
		We never did it when we were kids, 
		remember? 
			(Down in the cafe, 
			SALVATORE nods his head 
			slowly, desperately.) 
		Now that it's happened, I don't think 
		there could have been a better 
		ending.
			(It's farewell. SALVATORE 
			glances one last time at 
			that window.) 
	
				SALVATORE  
		I'll never agree with you. Never, 
		Elena. 
	
	122  CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. DAY 
	
	The square, unusually empty. There is no one, and no cars and motorcycles are 
	parked in the middle. The stores are shut. And there is an unreal silence. The 
	houses on the two streets on either side of the theatre are covered by enormous 
	pieces of gray canvas. 
	
	Only now does the camera discover in the distance, a crowd of curious onlookers 
	waiting in front of the movie house, kept at a safe distance by firemen and 
	policemen. Old SPACCAFICO is in the crowd. SALVATORE is also there. Be gazes at 
	the front of the old movie theatre...
	
	123  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. DAY 
	
	The inside of the theatre, completely empty...All of a sudden, a blinding flash 
	and...
	
	124  SQUARE AND CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. DAY 
	
	...a deafening roar rends the air, accompanied by a surge of amazement in the 
	crowd. And the Cinema Paradiso suddenly collapses, folds inward and disappears 
	for ever in a gigantic cloud of white smoke that rises into the air, carried by 
	the wind towards the crowd...
	
	125  ELENA' S HOUSE. INT. DAY 
	
	The echo of the explosion is also heard in ELENA'S house. She is alone. 
	And the bang distresses her, as if something had burst inside her. From her face 
	to...
	
	126  SQUARE AND CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. DAY 
	
	SALVATORE's face, stiff, unmoving, his eyes fixed on those falling ruins, on 
	that season of his life turning into smoke and dust. Enveloped in the white 
	cloud, SPACCAFICO stands crying in silence. 
	
	Mice dart out of the ruins in terror, scamper nervously into the square. A group 
	of youngsters scream, amused and excited. Among them, ELENA'S DAUGHTER, 
	smiling... SALVATORE sees her joking with friends and pointing to some boys  
	chasing the mice across the square, hooting and laughing. As a white-haired OLD 
	TRAMP, filthy and covered in rags, makes his way through the crowd. There is an 
	empty look in his eyes and he repeats obsessively in a low voice:
	
				VILLAGE IDIOT  
		The square's mine, the square's mine, 
		the square's mine... 
	
	SALVATORE recognizes him, it's the VILLAGE IDIOT, the one who used to close down 
	the square at night. Be watches him walk off, raving, with nobody even noticing. 
	The crowd now moves over to the huge empty space where the movie house once 
	stood. The murmuring voices are drowned out by the deafening roar of an 
	airplane. From the ruins of the Cinema Paradiso, fade to...
	
	127  ROME. STUDIO VIEWING-ROOM. INT. DAY 
	
	...SALVATORE'S hands giving a STUDIO PROJECTIONIST the rusty metal can left him 
	by ALFREDO. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Please check the splices. As soon as 
		you're ready you can start. 
	
				PROJECTIONIST  
		OK. Congratulations on your film. 
		It's terrific. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Thanks. 
	
	A COLLEAGUE of SALVATORE comes up behind him.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Well? 
	
				COLLEAGUE  
		The distributor is opening up the 
		film earlier. The press conference is 
		in the afternoon. The actors will 
		also be there, the producer, just 
		about everyone. 
	
	An ASSISTANT comes up to them.
	
				ASSISTANT  
		The official notification of the 
		award just came out, but we've 
		already received a mountain of 
		telegrams. Aren't you happy? 
	
				SALVATORE  
		It's all right. We'll talk about it 
		later. 
	
	SALVATORE walks off towards the viewing theatre. 
	
	SALVATORE is by himself in the small viewing theatre. Now the lights go down. 
	The beam of light shines out of the little square hole of the projection booth 
	and the screen lights up. A number trailer goes by and then SALVATORE sees the 
	first shots. 
	
	A start of intense amazement and joy suddenly runs through him, astounds him, 
	delights him. It's the best piece of film he has ever seen...  
	
	It consists of all the kisses ALFREDO cut out of the films and kept for him, 
	when he was a little boy. They have been spliced together, one , after the 
	other, at random, same of them even upside down. And yet it looks like a first-
	rate editing job. 
	
	In rapid sequence the passionate kisses between actors and actresses, names 
	famous and names unknown in the history of movies. Greta Garbo, Gary Cooper, 
	Alida Valii, Rudolph Valentino, Ingrid Bergman, Clark Gable, Anna Magnani, 
	Humphrey Bogart, Marlene Dietrich, Amedeo Nazzari, Luisa Ferida, Vittorio De 
	Sica, Rita Hayworth, Tyrone Power, Doris Durante, Massimo Gironi, Marta Abba, 
	Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, Assia Noris...
	
	A whole movie season summed up in a few fragments, a few seconds. A bizarre, 
	poignant, melancholy parade. 
	
	SALVATORE is overwhelmed, moved to tears. It is the most profound act of love he 
	has ever seen. He laughs as tears shine in his eyes. Up on the screen, another 
	kiss, the last kiss marking the happy ending of a film. And the age-old words 
	appear 'THE END'.

	1  GIANCALDO. SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. EXT/INT. DAY
	
	The October sun slashes through the gray clouds, cuts across the
	shadow towards the sea, along the coast where the new suburbs of the
	city of Giancaldo have been built up.
	
	Bright light streams through the windows, glancing off the white
	walls in an almost blinding reflection. MARIA, a woman a little over
	sixty, is trying to find somebody on the phone.
	
				MARIA  
		...Salvatore, that's right, 
		Salvatore. Di Vita Salvatore
		...But, miss, what do you mean you 
		don't know him?!...I...Yes...
			(She gives a nervous sigh. 
			She has dialed her way 
			through endless numbers 
			but still hasn't managed 
			to speak to Mr. Di
			Vita. She finally heaves a 
			sigh of relief.)
		...That's right, good for you! 
		Oh!...yes...And I'm his
		mother. I'm calling from Sicily. Been 
		trying all day...Ah, he's not 
		there...But would you be so kind as 
		to give me...?...Yes...
			(She nods at another woman 
			around forty sitting 
			nearby: it is LIA, her 
			daughter, who jots down 
			the numbers her 
			mother dictates:)
		...Six, five, six, two, two, oh, 
		six...Thanks ever so
		much...Goodbye. Goodbye.
	
	She hangs up, takes the number LIA has jotted down, determined to have still 
	another try. LIA speaks to her as if she were a baby, to be more convincing.
	
				LIA  
		Look, Ma...It's useless calling him. 
		He'll be terribly busy, God knows 
		where he is. Besides he might not 
		even remember. Do as I say, forget 
		it...He hasn't been here for thirty 
		years. You know how he is. 
	
	MARIA pauses to think it over. The decision she has to make is important. Then, 
	stubbornly.
	
				MARIA  
		He'll remember! He'll remember! 
			(She puts on her glasses 
			and starts dialing 
			the number.)
		...I'm positive. I know him better 
		than you do. If he were to find 
		out we hadn't told him, he'd be 
		angry. I know. 
			(She takes off her 
			glasses.)
		...Hello? Good morning. Could I 
		please speak to Mr. Salvatore Di 
		Vita. I'm his mother...
	
	2  ROME. STREETS. EXT/INT. NIGHT
	
	It's late, but there is still traffic on the streets heading downtown.
	Inside a high-powered car, a man  around fifty is driving. It is
	SALVATORE Dl VITA. Elegant, just growing gray, a handsome face
	creased by deep wrinkles. His weary expression hides the determined,
	sell-assured manner of the successful self-made man. He must be a
	heavy smoker judging by the way he draws the last puffs on his
	cigarette.
	
	He stops at a red light. He stubs out the cigarette and rolls down the
	window, as a little Fiat Uno pulls up alongside. A rock tune plays full
	blast on the radio. SALVATORE turns instinctively to have a look at the
	man at the wheel  a BOY with a brush cut standing straight in the latest
	fashion. He studies the Boy's expression with almost exaggerated
	attention, but devoid of curiosity, coldly. The GIRL sitting beside him,
	lots of curly hair, overripe red lips, returns SALVATORE'5 look,
	provocatively. The BOY notices, turns to SALVATORE in a surly voice:
	
				BOY  
		Hey! What the fuck you looking at!?
	
	Green light. The Fiat Uno shoots off, leaving a trail of music in its wake.
	
	3  ROME. SALVATORE S APARTMENT. INT. NIGHT 
	
	The apartment is luxurious, tastefully furnished. There is no one waiting for 
	SALVATORE. Through the picture window on the terrace, the city can be seen 
	slumbering in the night. SALVATORE gets undressed on his way to the bedroom. He 
	moves quietly, as if to make no noise. He doesn't even turn on the light, 
	finishes getting undressed in the pale blue glow coming from the picture window. 
	A rustling sound, a movement on the bed, the voice of a woman waking up. 
	
				CLARA  
		Salvatore...But what time is it? 
	
	She turns on the bedside light. It is CLARA, a young woman around thirty. 
	SALVATORE climbs in beside her under the covers, kisses her sweetly, then in a 
	whisper.
	
				SALVATORE  
		It's late, Clara. Sorry, but I wasn't 
		able to let you know I wouldn't be 
		corning...
			(He fondles her, but he is 
			tired, feels like 
			sleeping.) 
		Go to sleep now. Sleep.
	
	He turns over on the other side. CLARA shuts her eyes, is about to drop off, 
	but whispers.
	
				CLARA  
		Your mother phoned. She took me for 
		somebody else...
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Surprised) 
		And what'd you tell her?
	
				CLARA  
		I played dumb, so as not to 
		disappoint her. We had a nice little 
		talk. She says you never go see her, 
		and when she wants to see you she has 
		to come to Rome...Is it true?
	
	SALVATORE doesn't answer. God only knows how often he's heard that question 
	before.
	
				SALVATORE  
		She phoned just to say that? 
	
	She reaches out to switch of the light, buries her head into the pillow.
	
				CLARA  
		She said a certain Alfredo had died. 
		And the funeral's taking place 
		tomorrow afternoon...
			(A strange look suddenly 
			comes into SALVATORE'S 
			eyes. The idea of going to 
			sleep has clearly left 
			him. It's a piece of news 
			he didn't expect. That's 
			taken him off-guard. CLARA 
			would like to carry on the 
			conversation, but 
			sleepiness makes 
			it almost impossible. An 
			she can manage is one last 
			question in a faint little 
			voice:)
		Who is it? A relative of yours?
	
				SALVATORE  
		No. Sleep. Go to sleep.
	
	She falls asleep in the dead silence of the night. SALVATORE is seized by a 
	sort of chill a deep, troubled feeling. He gazes through the window al the city, 
	with its shimmering lights still moving in the darkness, suddenly shrouded in a 
	heavy curtain of rain. But he gazes off, beyond the row of houses, beyond the 
	dark sky; the shadow of a wind chime plays across his face summoning up endless 
	memories, drawing forth from the infinite depths of oblivion a past that he 
	thought had vanished, been wiped out, and instead now re-emerges, comes back to 
	life, takes on light, superimposing itself on the mellow middle-aged features of 
	his face, in the shadow of the city shaken by the storm, until another image is 
	formed, an ancient, remote image...
	
	4  GIANCALDO. CHURCH AND SACRISTY. INT. MORNING
	
	An image from over forty years before. In the baroque church of
	Giancaldo. SALVATORE is nine years old. Dressed as an altar boy, he
	is kneeling by the altar with a little silver bell in his hands. The
	congregation is also kneeling. The PRIEST is consecrating the Host.
	Little SALVATORE has just got out of bed, is still half-asleep, yawns
	and doesn't notice that the PRIEST is standing there with the Host in
	the air glaring at him, as if trying to tell him something.
	
				PRIEST  
		Pss! Pssst!
	
	SALVATORE finishes yawning and opening his eyes meets the
	withering look of the PRIEST. He gets the message at once and
	rings the bell. Now the PRIEST can carry on, lifts the chalice and
	the bell is heard again.
	
						Cut to:
	
	The service is over. The PRIEST is in the sacristy removing his
	vestments. And SALVATORE is also there, removing his altar-boy
	tunic.
	
				PRIEST  
		But how can I make you understand? 
		Without the bell I just can't go on! 
		Always half asleep, you are! What do 
		you do at night anyway? Eat instead 
		of sleep?
	
				SALVATORE  
		Father, at my house we don't even eat 
		at noon. That's why I'm always 
		sleepy. That's what the vet says.
	
	The PRIEST has finished disrobing. He takes the bell
	SALVATORE was holding during the service and turns to leave.
	
				PRIEST  
		All right, Toto, get moving, I've got 
		things to do. Say hello to your 
		mother.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Can I...
	
				PRIEST  
			(Interrupting him) 
		And don't ask if you can come...
		Because you can't!! Shoo, shoo, off 
		with you!!
	
	SALVATORE gives a shrug and leaves. The PRIEST goes down a
	corridor, opens a door, another corridor, and finally a door
	leading to an outside courtyard. He cuts across it and disappears
	into another door.
	
	5  CINEMA PARADISO AND PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. MORNING
	
	The PRIEST enters a movie house. Not very big  200 seats on the main
	floor and another seventy in the balcony. Along the walls, posters of
	films to be shown are stuck up between the light fixtures. In one corner,
	a statue of the Virgin Mary with flowers. The CLEANING LADY has
	finished work and is leaving. Up in the balcony, over the last row of
	seats, are the holes of the projection booth. The middle hole is
	camouflaged by the huge head of a roaring lion, all in plaster, and the
	lens of the projector can be glimpsed between its sharp teeth.
	there are two smaller holes, through which the figure of a man can be
	made out, appearing and disappearing...It is ALFREDO, the
	projectionist. He is around forty, skinny and bony with a tough
	peasant face. He has finished loading the projector and is checking the
	carbons in the arc lamp. Then he removes the glass from one of the
	holes and looks down into the theatre, at the PRIEST who waves his
	hand.
	
				PRIEST  
		OK, Alfredo, you can start!!
	
	He sits down an by himself in the middle of the empty theatre.
	Up in the booth, ALFREDO lights the arc lamp and sets the
	projector going.
	
	Down in the theatre, the light goes off and out of the lion's mouth
	streams the glowing ray aimed al the screen. String music, sweet
	and ominous, spreads through the theatre. On the screen appear
	the credit titles of an American film of the 1940s. The PRIEST
	screws up his face and holds the bell in his right hand resting on
	the arm of his seat.
	
	At the back of the theatre, behind the last row, a curtain moves,
	opens a crack and SALVATORE'S gaunt little face appears. He
	has managed to sneak in somehow and stands there without a
	word, spellbound, watching the 'movie' on the glowing screen.
	The credit titles have long come and gone. The story is at a
	turning-point. 
	
	Up above, in the hole of the booth next to the lion,
	ALFREDO watches the film, but his eyes keep looking down at the
	PRIEST, who is now drumming the bell with his fingers. On the
	screen, the male and female lead, two Hollywood stars, are in
	close-up; the dialogue is passionate, romantic. SALVATORE,
	carried away by those faces, by the way they talk, by the beauty
	of the woman, slowly slips down the length of the curtain until he
	is sitting on the floor, his eyes glued to the screen. 
	
	The love scene reaches a climax, the music crescendos, and the love-struck 
	couple finally fall into each other's arms and kiss. Instinctively, the PRIEST 
	raises the bell into the air, as in some age-old ceremony, and gives it a loud 
	ring...
	
	Up in the booth ALFREDO hears the bell; it's the signal he's been
	waiting for. He takes a slip of paper from a pad prepared for that
	purpose and sticks it into the loops of the film containing that
	specific scene as it winds on to the reel. The projection
	continues...
	
	...And also the kiss of the two actors. The PRIEST'S nervous look lingers on 
	those black-and-white lips meeting and now pulling apart for one last 
	declaration of love before separating. SALVATORE is wide-eyed, he's probably 
	never seen a man and woman kiss before, it's a vision that for him has all the 
	attraction of forbidden fruit, the horror of sin. The screen is now filled with 
	the figure of a woman getting undressed, showing for one instant the white, 
	voluptuous flesh of her broad, naked shoulders. SALVATORE stares in open-mouthed 
	wonder. The PRIEST, in a fury, grabs the bell and shakes it for all he is worth. 
	From the sound of the bell to another sound...
	
	6  GIANCALDO. MAIN SQUARE. EXT. DAY 
	
	The tolling of the bell-tower rings out over the 
	square. It is noon. The vast square, pale and dusty, is alive with people. A 
	noisy line of men, women and cows waits in front of the fountain to get water. 
	Peddlers hawk their wares in mournful cries. People come and go in front of the 
	town hall. The working men's club is deserted. The entrance of the Cinema 
	Paradiso is shut. Hanging outside is the poster of the film that has just been 
	seen on screen. Up above, the windows of the projection booth are open. The hum 
	of the projector can be heard and the loud, lofty music typical of 'THE END'. 
	Then dead silence. The showing is over.
	
	7. CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. DAY
	
	Despite the speed, numerous white streaks spin around on the reel,
	created by the slips of paper ALFREDO has inserted into the loops. He
	is rewinding the film by hand on the film-winder. When he's not
	talking, ALFREDO usually sings to himself. SALVATORE stands beside
	him, taking in everything he does with those quick, thieving eyes of his
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Harshly, shouting) 
		You must not come here! How many 
		times do I have to tell you?
			(And he slows down the 
			reels with his hand. The 
			slips of paper
			are about to arrive. 
			Here's the first.)
		If the film catches fire, runt that 
		you are, you'd go up in a
		burst of flame...whoosh! And turn 
		into a piece of...
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Overlapping him)
		...and turn into a piece of 
		charcoal!!
	
	He's used to his terrorisms, pays no more attention. Not even his
	grim look scares him. Anyway, ALFREDO catches the joke, starts to give him a 
	slap, but instead reaches over and picks up a pair of scissors.
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Angrily) 
		Christ, that's a sassy little tongue 
		you've got! Watch out, or someday 
		I'll snip it off. 
	
	And he snips a piece of film, pastes the ends together and goes on turning the 
	handle. SALVATORE picks up the strip of film and gives it a closer look. He sees 
	a series of frames all alike with a man kissing a woman.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Can I have it? 
	
	ALFREDO snatches it out of his hand, furiously, at the end of his string. He 
	shouts.
	
				ALFREDO  
		No!!! Are you deaf or something? I've 
		got to put this back in when we wind 
		up the film again! You're a real pain 
		in the neck! 
	
	SALVATORE reaches into a basket full of strips of film. He takes out a handful: 
	all kisses that have been cut.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Then why didn't you put these back 
		when you wound up the films again? 
	
	ALFREDO is caught out. He stops the film where another slip of paper is stuck 
	in and cuts the scene:
	
				ALFREDO  
		'Cause sometimes you can't find the 
		right place any more and so...well, 
		actually...they stay here. 
			(Finding an excuse) 
		Besides, there are more kisses than 
		you can count.
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Excited) 
		So I can have these? 
			(ALFREDO explodes, flies 
			off the handle. He grabs 
			SALVATORE by the shoulders 
			and shakes him.)
	
				ALFREDO  
		Look, Toto! Before I kick your ass 
		all the way to China and back, let's 
		make a deal. These strips here are 
		yours, I give them to you. However! 
		One  you're not to stick your nose in 
		here any more. Two  I'll keep them 
		for you, because you can't take them 
		home for God forbid and save our 
		souls, if they catch fire, all hell 
		will break loose! OK? Oh!!! And now 
		scram! 
	
	He takes him and turns him towards the stairs. For him the matter is closed. He 
	returns to the film-winder. SALVATORE sneaks back and while ALFREDO's attention 
	is elsewhere, snatches up a handful of movie frames scattered on the counter, 
	stuffs them into his pocket and...
	
				SALVATORE  
		What sort of deal is this? The strips 
		are mine! So why can't I come see 
		them? 
	
	And he stares at ALFREDO with a sly, saucy look. ALFREDO clutches his hand, 
	darts forth like an arrow and is about to give him a kick in the ass. He 
	shrieks:
	
				ALFREDO  
		Get out!! And don't show your face 
		here again! 
	
	And before the kick reaches its destination, SALVATORE has already dashed off 
	down the spiral staircase.
	
	8  GIANCALDO. SALVATORE'S HOUSE. INT. EVENING
	
	That was not the first theft of film strips. SALVATORE's hand reaches
	into a flowery metal box jammed full of pieces of film. He takes out a
	few frames and holds them up against the kerosene lamp. Gazes at the
	figures that remind him of the films seen at Cinema Paradiso, and in a
	whisper mangles fragments of dialogue, the shooting of guns, the
	musical climaxes...
	
				SALVATORE  
		Bang! Bang! Bang! Shoot first, think 
		later! This is no job for weaklings! 
		Treacherous dog!
	
	The house has no lights, is gloomy and cold. SALVATORE's
	mother, MARIA, is leaning on the table in front of him. She is
	young, around thirty, and her pretty face is haggard, marred by
	all the sacrifices. She is sewing some clothes, is a seamstress. LIA,
	his four-year-old sister, is sleeping on a cot in one corner. The
	kerosene lamp projects the trembling shadow of the film strips on
	the wall, figures of prairies, gunslingers, thugs. SALVATORE's
	voice changes, turns even tougher.
	
				SALVATORE
		Hey there, you lousy bastard, take 
		your hands off that gold, You black-
		hearted pig, stay away from me, or 
		I'll smash your face in! 
		'Ntantatah!!!...
			(In the heap of movie 
			frames there are also 
			several photographs. 
			SALVATORE picks them up. 
			Family keepsakes. A man in 
			an army uniform. Then the 
			same man with a girl 
			beside him whose smiling 
			face can be recognized as 
			MARIA. SALVATORE takes a 
			closer look at the man's 
			face, then whispers to his 
			mother:)
		Ma, if the war's over, how come 
		Daddy's never come back?
	
	MARIA looks up at him with a sweet smile.
	
				MARIA  
		He'll be back, he'll be back...
		You'll see. One of these
		days...
	
	But there is not much conviction written on her face. She looks
	back down at her sewing. SALVATORE goes on looking at the
	photos.
	
				SALVATORE  
		I don't remember him any moreMa, 
		where's Russia?
	
				MARIA  
		It takes years to get there. And 
		years to come back...Now go to bed, 
		Toto, it's late.
	
	SALVATORE puts the photos back into the box and tucks the box
	under LIA's cot near the charcoal burner.
	
	9  GRADE SCHOOL. COURTYARD. EXT. DAY
	
	A noisy crowd of little children in black smocks, white collars and blue
	bows moves about the large courtyard where there are two tall palm
	trees. The boys head for one door, the girls towards the opposite one.
	The Janitors line them up two by two, ready to enter. Here and there,
	parents and relatives accompany the younger ones. Beneath one of the
	palms, SALVATORE pulls off the altar-boy tunic, stuffs it into the
	khaki-colored cardboard schoolbag, takes out the smock and puts it
	on, as one of his schoolmates passes by. It is MASINO, and he's crying
	desperately because he doesn't want to go to school. His FATHER drags
	him along, yelling:
	
				MASINO'S FATHER
		You can fool your mother but not me! 
		Get yourself a damn diploma and 
		become a policeman. You good-for-
		nothing!
	
				MASINO  
		I don't want to go to school'
			(The sound of the bell. 
			The black lines move up 
			the steps towards the 
			school.)
	
	1O  FOURTH GRADE. INT. DAY 
	
	SALVATORE is sitting at the front-row desk next to PEPPINO, 
	a little freckle-faced boy. His attention, like that of the whole class, is 
	concentrated on what is taking place at the blackboard. The TEACHER is standing 
	there, watching a plump little boy, shy and not quite all there, do a two-figure 
	multiplication  it is NICOLA SCORSONE, known as 'COLA'. He is red in the face, 
	has one purple ear and one white one. He stares in terror at that '255 x 15' 
	written on the blackboard. The TEACHER yells, waving a birch rod in her hand. 
	
				TEACHER  
		Well then?! Five times five 
		equals...? 
	
	COLA stops to think a moment, then... 
	
				COLA  
		Thirty!
	
	The TEACHER grabs him by the purple ear and bashes his head against the numbers 
	on the blackboard. A large thud echoes through the room, followed by a roar of 
	laughter. The TEACHER slams her rod on the desk.
	
				TEACHER  
		Silence!! 
			(Then to COLA) 
		The five times table. Dunce! One 
		times five, five!!
			(The class repeats with 
			the TEACHER, in a sing-
			song chorus:)
	
				TEACHER and CLASS  
		Two times five, ten! Three times 
		five, fifteen! Four times five, 
		twenty!
			(With a wave of the rod, 
			the TEACHER silences the 
			class, and finishes the 
			sing-song with the fateful 
			question.)
	
				TEACHER  
		Five times five?
	
				COLA  
			(Timidly) 
		Forty...?
	
	Another blow of the head on the blackboard. Hubbub.
	Slapping of the rod on the desk. SALVATORE secretly shows
	COLA the picture of a Christmas tree on one page of the book,
	and mouths the word 'twenty-five'. COLA smiles, he has finally
	caught on.
	
				TEACHER  
		I'm asking you for the last time, 
		blockhead! Five times five equals...?
			(COLA turns to her with 
			smiling eyes and answers 
			blissfully:)
	
				COLA  
		Christmas!!
	
	SALVATORE clutches his head in anger, watches the TEACHER
	flogging COLA on the back with the rod. COLA screams at every
	blow, and at every blow the laughter in the class grows louder.
	SALVATORE stares at the rod moving up and down rhythmically. But he is not 
	thinking of the pain his schoolmate is feeling, but is drawn, rather, by that 
	strange regular beat, finds it similar to another regular beat, that of...
	
	11  CINEMA PARADISO. BALCONY AND MAIN FLOOR. INT. DAY
	
	...the rolling pin ALFREDO uses to flatten out a reel of film that has just 
	been unloaded. SALVATORE carefully watches ALFREDO 5 every move. He is not in 
	the projection booth, but up in the balcony, standing on top of the last row of 
	seats. He peers through the hole next to the lion's head. His bright little eyes 
	fix in his mind the things ALFREDO does, as he loads the film into the 
	projector, shuts the fireproof housings, turns on the amplifier, checks the 
	carbons in the arc lamp, then lowers his head to have a look into the theatre 
	and finds himself face to face with SALVATORE.
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Sternly) 
		What are you doing here? 
	
				SALVATORE  
		I bought a ticket. I've come to see 
		the film.
			(Meanwhile the USHER comes 
			up behind him and grabs 
			him by the collar, and he 
			almost jumps out of his 
			skin. ALFREDO laughs.)
	
				USHER  
			(Yelling) 
		Go sit downstairs! You good-for-
		nothing sponger! ! 
			(To the audience) 
		Worse than rabbits they are!
	
	SALVATORE has run downstairs. The main floor is more
	crowded than the balcony, like every Sunday, and there is a greatdin. The BOY 
	selling ice-cream, soda pop and candy shouts and
	runs around like a chicken with its head off. Now the lights dim,
	the hubbub dies down and the performance starts. Before the film
	there is a preview for Stagecoach. The screen fills with images ofJohn Wayne, 
	the pursuit of the stagecoach by hostile Indians
	etc...
	
	SALVATORE is sitting in the front rows, right under the screen,
	next to BOCCIA, COLA, MASINO, PEPPINO and OTHER KIDS, all with their noses in 
	the air. BOCCIA, the biggest show off of the group, is smoking a cigarette. An 
	OLD MAN appears through the entrance curtain, takes a couple of steps and 
	shouts:)
	
				FIRST OLD MAN  
		Hello, everybody!
	
				AUDIENCE  
			(At once) 
		Ssssssh!!! Ssssssh! Silence!
	
				FIRST OLD MAN  
		Can't I say hello?
	
				USHER  
		It's a double-feature today.
	
				FIRST OLD MAN  
		I couldn't care less. I come here to 
		sleep.
	
	All at once, a chorus of shouts and whistles fills the theatre. Up
	on the screen, a globe of the world appears, spinning among the
	stars, the logo announcing the newsreel.
	
				AUDIENCE  
			(Hooting and whistling) 
		For Christ's sake! Cut it, 
		Alfredoooo!
	
	The CHILDREN in the front rows also yell, but SALVATORE goes
	on being alert. He turns and looks up at the holes of the projection
	booth, as if it were an impregnable fortress. He watches the crazy
	dancing of light in the glowing stream that opens towards him in a
	cone. And besides, that lion's head, mysterious, almost gruesome,
	emphasizes the enigmatic secret of the movies. In his dreamy eyes,
	that lifeless lion seems to wake up with a ferocious roar.
	
	SALVATORE has a frightened look...Another lion roaring. But up on the screen. 
	The MGM lion. The throng of children imitate the famous growl all together, 
	shaking their heads in unison.
	
				CHILDREN  
		Grrrr! Grrrrr! 
	
	The film starts: it is Visconti's La terra trema. SALVATORE is in bliss. His 
	wide eyes looking up at the magic square of light. The title music. Another OLD 
	MAN enters at the back of the theatre, but before sitting down, says hello in a 
	loud voice.
	
				SECOND OLD MAN  
		Greetings to one and all!
	
				AUDIENCE  
		SSSSSH' Drop dead! Silence! Hey, 
		kids, we're here to see the film! 
	
	Now there is an important sequence. The audience is silent. Concentrated on the 
	screen. BOCCIA passes the lighted cigarette to SALVATORE. He takes a puff and 
	hands it on to the others without ever taking his eyes off the screen. The 
	beautiful star of the film appears on screen. A different kind of attention 
	takes hold of the excited audience. SALVATORE and the others stare at her with 
	open mouths...She leans towards the leading man, a languid expression, their 
	profiles touch. But all at once, just at the best part, there is a sudden jolt. 
	
	The kiss isn't seen.
	
				AUDIENCE  
			(Disappointed) 
		Ahhh! What a shame! I've been going 
		to the movies for twenty years and I 
		never saw a kiss! 
	
	SALVATORE is the only one to laugh to himself. He knows what has happened.
	
				AUDIENCE  
		And when will we see one? 
	
	Up in the balcony, the audience is more sedate. The tickets cost more and the 
	people are richer, more refined. Among them, a MAN with a moustache, the look of 
	a public notary, is sitting right in front of the railing. Seriously, without 
	batting an eye, he spits down below with contempt. Right on the dot, a voice is 
	heard, followed by a chorus of protests.
	
				VOICE and AUDIENCE  
		Bugger!!! Ssssh!!! Silence!!
	
	12  SQUARE AND ENTRANCE OF CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. NIGHT
	
	The bell-tower rings midnight. The square is nearly deserted. Except
	for a landowner near the refreshment stand, with a moustache and a
	hat, DON VINCENZO by name, who is picking out from a group of
	labourers the men he'll be needing in the country at dawn. He chooses,
	points his finger, calls...
	
	People come out of the movie house after the last showing.
	The USHER locks the front door as ALFREDO climbs down from the
	projection booth. Among the crowd there is only one kid, SALVATORE.
	Tired, half-asleep. He's seen all the showings. He starts to walk away
	when he catches sight of his mother standing on the opposite corner,
	wrapped in an old coat. She's waiting for him, in a temper.
	SALVATORE drops his eyes to the ground, mortified. He knows what's
	coming. He goes over to her timidly, uncertain, gives her a questioning
	look.
	
				MARIA  
		I've been looking for you all day. 
		Did you buy the milk?
	
				SALVATORE  
		No...
	
				MARIA  
		Then where's the money?
	
				SALVATORE  
		Somebody stole it.
	
	MARIA gives him a slap. SALVATORE holds back the sobs, but
	his eyes brim with tears. ALFREDO and the USHER are nearby,
	have heard everything.
	
				MARIA  
		What'd you do with the money? Go to 
		the movies?
	
	SALVATORE nods his head and the sobs increase. MARIA, in
	despair, flies off the handle, slaps him again, but looks as if she
	doesn't really want to, as if deep down she forgives her son's
	escapade. ALFREDO catches on, speaks up on behalf of
	SALVATORE.
	
				ALFREDO  
		Signora Maria, don't do that. He's 
		just a kid. 
			(To SALVATORE) 
		And why are you telling fibs? 
			(To MARIA) 
		We let him in free. He must have lost 
		the money inside the movie
		theatre...
			(SALVATORE stares at him 
			in amazement, goes on 
			listening to him.)
		How much did you have?
	
				SALVATORE  
		Fifty lire...
			(MARIA wipes away his tears.)
	
				ALFREDO  
			(To the USHER) 
		What you find tonight on the floor 
		between the seats?
			(The USHER reaches into-
			his pockets, pulls out 
			some odds and ends.)
	
				USHER  
		A comb, two heel-savers, a box of 
		tobacco...
			(ALFREDO very skillfully 
			reaches out with fifty 
			lire he has taken
			from his pocket. And like 
			a magician he draws the 
			money out of
			the USHER'S hand.)
	
				ALFREDO 
		...and fifty lire! 
			(To MARIA) 
		See?
			(He hands over the money 
			under the USHER'S 
			astonished eyes.)
	
				MARIA  
		Thanks, Uncle Alfredo. Thanks. Good-
		night.
	
	She walks away, dragging SALVATORE by the hand. ALFREDO
	gives him a wink. SALVATORE smiles and winks back, but he's
	not very good at it; he can't manage to shut only one eye.
	Everybody leaves and the square empties, as the VILLAGE IDIOT
	comes up to the group of labourers, beside DON VINCENZO,
	motioning them all to get moving.
	
				IDIOT  
		It's midnight. I've got to shut down 
		the square! Go away.
		The square's mine! The square's 
		mine!!
	
	13  CEMETERY ROAD AND VILLAGE ROAD. EXT. DAY
	
	SALVATORE, dressed as an altar boy, walks alongside the PRIEST
	who is wearing the ceremonial vestments. They are tired, have walked
	a long way. Behind them a donkey pulls a wagon containing a little
	white coffin and a bunch of flowers. Behind that a little procession  the
	parents and relatives of the dead child. The road is very wide, covered
	with white earth. The spring sun is dazzling. The funeral procession
	kicks up a cloud of dust that makes everything blurred and hazy, like a
	dream, rimmed around the horizon by the blue line of the sea. The
	procession now turns into the large gate of the cemetery. ALFREDO,
	working in the fields, takes his hat off and watches the coffin as it passes by.
	
						Cut to:
	
	The funeral is over. The PRIEST and SALVATORE are walking back
	to the village. ALFREDO appears out of the countryside on e bicycle
	with a hoe and other farm tools in the basket. He comes pedaling up
	beside them.
	
				ALFREDO  
		Good morning, father. It's hard on 
		the feet, huh?
	
				PRIEST  
			(Breathless) 
		Yeah!...Getting there's downhill and 
		all the saints help you. But coming 
		back! The saints stand there watching 
		you, that's all! God's will be done.
	
	SALVATORE is about to open his mouth, wants to say something
	to ALFREDO, but he doesn't have time. ALFREDO pedals harder
	and rides off.
	
	SALVATORE is crestfallen. He looks et the PRIEST, then at the bicycle riding 
	away. His eyes light up  an idea! He suddenly yells:
	
				SALVATORE  
		Ouch! Ouch! My foot! I can't walk!
	
	He limps. Throws himself to the ground as if a snake had bitten him. The PRIEST 
	leans over in alarm. Up ahead in the distance, ALFREDO turns around to look.
	
						Cut to:
	
	There is a smile on SALVATORE'S face. He is riding on the crossbar of ALFREDO's 
	bicycle. On their way back lo the village.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Alfredo, did you know my father?
	
				ALFREDO  
		Of course I knew your father. He was 
		tall, thin, pleasant, and had a 
		moustache like mine. Always smiling. 
		He looked like Clark Gable. 
	
	There's something SALVATORE wants to talk about, but he doesn't know how to 
	start. He has a try with an innocent stratagem.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Alfredo, now that I'm older, I'm not 
		saying I can start coming to the 
		projection booth, to the movie 
		house...But...maybe, why don't we 
		become friends? 
	
	ALFREDO knows exactly what the little rascal is up to, and answers in a 
	strange, theatrical tone, as if he were repeating something he knows by heart, a 
	remark taken from some old film.
	
				ALFREDO  
			'I choose my friends for their 
		looks, and my enemies for their 
		brains...' 
			(Laughs) 
		You're too smart to be my friend. 
		Besides, as I always tell my kids, be 
		careful to pick the right friends!
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Surprised) 
		But you don't have any kids!!!
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Spluttering) 
		All right, all right! When I've got 
		kids that's what I'm telling them! 
			(The outlying houses of 
			Giancaldo finally heave 
			into sight.)
	
	14  SALVATORE S HOUSE. EXT. DAY
	
	LIA, SALVATORE'S kid sister, is crying outside the front door, terror
	stricken. Her face is smeared with smoke and her little dress half
	scorched and soaking wet. MARIA is distraught, damp with sweat, and
	tries to console her, hugging her in her arms.
	
				MARIA  
		Stop crying...The fire is out...I'm 
		here...That'll do, that'll do...
			(ALFREDO and SALVATORE 
			come up behind them. 
			SALVATORE has barely leapt 
			off the bicycle when his 
			mother sails into him like 
			a fury, shrieking:)
		Miserable boy! You're the ruin of me! 
		Your sister would have been burnt 
		alive if I hadn't been there! And all 
		your fault!
	
	SALVATORE darts off, chased by his mother, swift as a deer.
	ALFREDO doesn't understand what has happened, leans over
	LIA, who goes on bawling her eyes out, and sees on the ground, in
	the middle of the water, a flowery box all charred and still
	smoking, and all around scraps of film reduced to ashes and
	several singed photographs, the photos of SALVATORE s father.
	ALFREDO gets the message now, looks up at MARIA, who has
	caught SALVATORE and is dragging him home, hitting and
	slapping him all the way. SALVATORE covers his head with his
	hands to stave off the blows. MARIA turns to ALFREDO, in a
	stern, indignant voice.
	
				MARIA
		But aren't you ashamed of yourself, 
		Uncle Alfredo, playing with a little 
		boy at your age?!
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Cowed) 
		But...what's it got to do with 
		me?...
	
				MARIA  
		And who gave him all those films? 
		Promise you won't give him any more 
		of this trash! Don't let him set foot 
		any more in the movie house. The 
		boy's crazy! Crazy! All he talks 
		about is movies and Alfredo' Alfredo 
		and movies!! 
	
	ALFREDO is crestfallen, didn't think that SALVATORE'S craziness, his morbid 
	passion for movies, could go this far.
	
				ALFREDO  
		I give you my word, Donna Maria. 
			(MARIA now turns one last 
			time to her son.)
	
				MARIA  
		God's got to grant me one wish! Send 
		your father back home! And he'll see 
		you get what's coming to you! 
			(SALVATORE lowers his 
			hands, looks at her and 
			with the dreadful 
			sincerity of children:)
	
				SALVATORE  
		Daddy's not coming back...He's dead. 
			(An icy flash runs through 
			MARIA'S eyes.)
	
				MARIA  
		It's not true! No! It's not true!!! 
		I'll show you he's coming back!
	
	And she beats him desperately, as if to enforce her stubborn hope, slap after 
	slap. This time ALFREDO doesn't step in, lets MARIA give vent 
	to her rage and fury, but SALVATORE'S cries make him feel guilty.
	
	15:SQUARE AND PROJECTION BOOTH. EXT/INT. DAY 
	
	Another Sunday. A crowd of men has gathered in the square around the café where 
	there is a loudspeaker. They are listening to the running commentary of the 
	soccer games. They check their Sisal pools coupons. NICOLO CAROSIO'S VOICE 
	...We're at the seventh minute of the second half. Turin is leading one to 
	zero. The goal was scored by...(The scene is seen from above, by ALFREDO who 
	peers out of the window of the projection booth. CAROSIO'S voice drowns out the 
	soundtrack of the film being shown. ALFREDO is bored. He goes over to the 
	projector, looks through the hole...It's the last sequence of the film. The 
	music swells to a climax as 'THE END' appears on the screen. Swift as ever, 
	ALFREDO turns on the lights in the theatre' stops the projector. Looks back 
	through the hole, to see...)
	
	16:CINEMA PARADISO. INT/EXT. DAY
	
	...the house packed to the rafters. Voices and laughter of the children. Smoke, 
	ice-cream, soft drinks. The USHER has opened the emergency exits to let in air. 
	He fights off the gate-crashers who are trying to get in free. The sound of the 
	sports commentary fills the theatre. The village BLACKSMITH is sleeping in his 
	seat, his head thrown back and his mouth wide open. The KIDS blow up the empty 
	ice-cream sacks and pop them next to his ears. Bang! The BLACKSMITH wakes up 
	with a start, in a sea of laughter. He yells:  
	
				BLACKSMITH  
		Ah! I'll wring all your necks!! Or my 
		good name means nothing! !! Lousy 
		brats! 
	
	SALVATORE doesn't laugh. He is sad. He turns and looks up at the projection 
	booth. He sees ALFREDO through the lion's mouth. ALFREDO also catches sight of 
	him. SALVATORE gives him a timid wave of the hand, as if asking if he can come 
	up a moment. The look on ALFREDO'S face is unmistakable, irrevocable: N0! 
	SALVATORE'S not surprised; after what happened it won't be easy to win him over. 
	Yet there must be some way. But what is it? As usual, SALVATORE is smart as the 
	devil when he's out to get something. Through the emergency exit he sees a woman 
	pass by with a packet in her hand. It is ALFREDO's WIFE, and the packet is his 
	supper. SALVATORE leaps to his feet and runs out to her.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Signora Anna!
	
	17  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION ROOM AND SQUARE. INT/EXT. DAY
	
	ALFREDO starts up the projector. It's time for the documentaries and
	cartoons. SALVATORE peers in from the top of the stairs. He's scared of
	ALFREDO'S reaction, but pricks up his courage and shows him the
	packet. ALFREDO sees him, is about to pounce on him...
	
				SALVATORE  
			(On the defensive) 
		Your wife told me to bring you this. 
	
	His expression betrays the 'put on'. ALFREDO sighs, realizes it's another one of 
	his little games.
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Sternly) 
		Give it to me!...
	
	He takes the packet, unwraps it and lifts the lid, shuts it again and puts the 
	container inside the lamp of the projector to keep it warm. SALVATORE hasn't 
	missed a single gesture, but speaks with his eyes 
	to the poor.
	
				SALVATORE  
		I told my mother you weren't the one 
		who gave me the films. That it 
		wasn't your fault. But I thought you 
		said the film could catch fire just 
		to scare me. Now that I know, I won't 
		steal any more from you. That's all I 
		wanted to say. I'm going. 
			(He turns to leave but 
			ALFREDO takes him by the 
			shoulder and stops 
			him.)
	
				ALFREDO  
		Toto, come here. 
	
	All things considered, there is something in that little boy, maybe his 
	feverish passion, that strikes him. He'll talk to him seriously, without 
	resorting to terrorism, try to convince him. He lowers the volume of the 
	monitor, sits down on the stool. SALVATORE raises his eyes from the floor and 
	looks at him at last...
	
				ALFREDO  
		Now listen to what I've got to say. I 
		took up this profession when I 
		was ten years old. In those days 
		there weren't these modern machines. 
		The films were silent. The projectors 
		were run by hand, like this, with a 
		crank. And you wound the crank all 
		day long. It was really rough going! 
		If you got tired and slowed down' 
		boom! Everything would go up in 
		flames!
	
				SALVATORE  
		Then why don't you want to teach it 
		to me too? Now that there's no more 
		cranking, and it's easier?
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Firmly) 
		Because I don't want to, Toto! This 
		is not a job for you. It's like being 
		a slave. You're always alone. You see 
		the same film over and over again, 
		because you have nothing else to do. 
		And you start talking to Greta Garbo 
		and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work 
		on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. 
		Only on Good Friday are you free. But 
		if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a 
		cross...You'd work Good Fridays too! 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Then why don't you change jobs? 
			(ALFREDO sighs, irritated. 
			He reaches out to turn the 
			knob of the carbon rods. 
			He gazes at SALVATORE as 
			if he were a grown-up, 
			somebody who's making 
			things hard for him.)
	
				ALFREDO  
		Because I'm an idiot. How many other 
		guys in town know how to be a 
		projectionist? None! Only a jerk like 
		me could do it. Besides I wasn't 
		lucky. When I was a kid there was the 
		war! When I grew up, another war! Now 
		it's all different. Times have 
		changed. And you want to be a dope 
		like me? Huh? Answer me!
	
				SALVATORE  
		No...
	
				ALFREDO  
		Good for you, Toto. Good for you...
		I'm only saying this for your own 
		good...
			(He gets up and, speaking 
			all the while, goes into a 
			closet with a bucket 
			in it, the toilet of the 
			booth. He turns his back 
			and pees. )
		Cooped up in here you die of heat in 
		the summer and of cold in the winter. 
		You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and 
		earn practically nothing. 
			(SALVATORE listens to 
			him, but taking advantage 
			of the fact he can't be 
			seen, he turns the knob of 
			the carbon rods, just as 
			he had seen done a moment 
			before...)
	
				SALVATORE  
			(In a loud voice) 
		But don't you like anything about 
		what you do? 
			(SALVATORE gazes at the 
			photos on the wall: 
			Keaton, Garbo, Snow 
			White. ALFREDO 
			smiles to himself. Sure, 
			there's something about 
			that damn job he likes:)
	
				ALFREDO  
		With time...you get used to it. 
		Besides, when you hear from up here 
		that there's a full house and that 
		people are laughing, having fun...
		Then you're happy too.
			(ALFREDO is lost in 
			thought, doesn't notice 
			that the documentaries
			and cartoons have 
			finished. The screen is 
			blank. And down in the
			theatre laughter is not 
			heard but an uproar of 
			whistling and
			swearing. SALVATORE'S eyes 
			sparkle, he seizes the 
			opportunity.
			He turns on the lights and 
			stops the projector, just 
			as ALFREDO
			would have done. At which 
			ALFREDO buttons up his 
			pants in a
			hurry and rushes over 
			alarmed, but sees that 
			everything is in order.
			SALVATORE looks at him all 
			smiles, as if he expected 
			a medal for
			civil bravery. Instead, 
			ALFREDO reacts like a wild 
			animal.)
		So I've been wasting my breath? You 
		pretend to agree with
		me, but as soon as my back is turned, 
		you do what you want!
			(He gives SALVATORE a kick 
			in the ass, shrieking:)
		Get out of here! I don't want to lay 
		eyes on you again! This is
		the last straw! Your mother's right, 
		you're crazy!!
			(He pushes him towards the 
			stairs. SALVATORE suddenly
			vanishes, scared out of 
			his wits. ALFREDO talks to 
			himself, in a
			fury:)
		But how'd he do it? The little 
		bastard! By watching, he's
		learned! It's incredible!
			(He peers out of the 
			window, yelling, as he 
			sees SALVATORE
			running through the 
			square. )
		I'm letting the box office know  
		you're not to set foot even into
		the theatre! There are no more 
		tickets for you! And I'm also
		talking to Father Adelfio! You won't 
		be an altar boy any more
		either!!! You little runt!
			(SALVATORE looks at him. 
			Hates him. Yells something 
			offensive:)
	
				SALVATORE  
		Alfredo, go fuck yourself!!! 
			(But his words are drowned 
			out by the sudden shouting 
			of the people outside the 
			café.)
	
				CROWD  
		Goal!! Holy Mother of God!!! 
			(A MAN in the crowd 
			crumples to the ground. 
			The others swarm around 
			him, alarmed. They hold up 
			his head. His face is 
			pale. They check the 
			coupon he is clutching in 
			his hand. A voice rises 
			like a siren from the 
			crowd.)
	
				MAN  
		Ciccio Spaccafico's won the 
		Sisal!!!!!
			(The yell can be heard...)
	
	I8  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. DAY
	
	...inside the movie house. The audience murmurs. Somebody opens
	an emergency exit...
	
				SPECTATOR'S VOICE  
		The Neapolitan's won the lottery!!! 
		Let's go see, kids!!! Northerners are 
		always lucky!
			(The whole audience leaps 
			up and heads for the exit. 
			Pushing. Shouting. 
			Laughing and Joking. )
	
	19  SQUARE AND VILLAGE. EXT. MORNING 
	
	Summer has come. The village has a different look. The peddlers sing their 
	monotonous refrains in the village streets. In one street, women are busy 
	canning tomatoes. In one corner of the square, the SHEARER has finished clipping 
	the donkey and is now shaving the hair of a row of bare-chested URCHINS with 
	nothing on but their underwear. Then another MAN disinfects them by spraying 
	them with the hand pumps used to spray trees in the country. The URCHINS 
	laugh. The BILL-POSTER is hanging up the posters of a new film, 'TODAY AT CINEMA
	PARADISO .
	
	20  GRADE SCHOOL DINING HALL. INT. MORNING 
	
	The fifth-grade exams. In the vast dining hall all the children are seated, one 
	for each desk, under the watchful eyes of the teachers. SALVATORE, BOCCIA, 
	PEPPINO, MASINO and COLA have taken places here and there, as nervous as 
	everybody else. The EXAMINING BOARD MEMBER is dictating the text of the 
	arithmetic problem. 
	
				EXAMINING BOARD MEMBER  
		A merchant owns two stores. In the 
		first he sells fruit and vegetables. 
		In the second he sells nails and 
		cement...
			(The PRINCIPAL comes in, 
			interrupts the dictation.) 
	
				PRINCIPAL  
		Excuse me, professor. Here are the 
		men taking the exam for the 
		elementary school certificate. 
			(Turning to the door) 
		Come in, please...
			(All the children turn to 
			look. A MAN around thirty 
			enters, ill at ease. The 
			children recognize him and 
			laugh mischievously. The 
			second is the BLACKSMITH, 
			the one who falls asleep 
			at the movies. The third 
			is a twenty-year-old-boy, 
			ANGELO. The fourth is 
			ALFREDO, embarrassed and 
			red in the face. SALVATORE 
			is speechless. Gives a 
			slightly ironic laugh. 
			There is a look of revenge 
			in his shrewd little 
			eyes.)
	
						Cut to:
	
	The assignment is now being carried out. There is dead silence in the 
	hall. 
	
	TEACHERS and the PRINCIPAL moue about, checking to be sure there are no notes 
	being handed around or other forms of 'collaboration'. The four outsiders are 
	having a hard time. It can be seen on their faces. ALFREDO is also in trouble, 
	doesn't know how to solve the problem, the calculations are too diff cult. He 
	looks at the desk next to him, where SALVATORE is sitting. SALVATORE is about to 
	look up at him, but ALFREDO immediately looks away, too proud to let himself be 
	seen. 
	
	The exchange of glances continues, grotesque, almost comical. SALVATORE 
	meanwhile writes down numbers and operations quite quickly. ALFREDO can't stand 
	it any longer, is nervous, beaded with sweat. He's sorry he ever showed up. 
	SALVATORE laughs up his sleeve, now he has the upper hand. ALFREDO tries 
	sneaking a look at his exercise book in order to copy something. But SALVATORE 
	turns his back, hiding it from sight. ALFREDO tries sneaking a look at somebody 
	else's exercise book, but the damn kid also covers it. It looks like a 
	conspiracy against him. ALFREDO has no way out. He has to accept the idea of 
	eating humble pie. He looks at SALVATORE, motions him with his eyes in a 
	conversation of glances. He asks for help, but SALVATORE stands firm, 
	implacable. 
	
	ALFREDO tries to put it into words in a low voice.
	
				ALFREDO 
		YOU jerk. Tell me how to solve this 
		fucking problem! 
	
				TEACHER  
		Ssssh! Silence back there!! 
	
	ALFREDO insists with his eyes. SALVATORE makes him understand with gestures 
	that he could help him maybe, but...on one condition. He imitates the gesture 
	of winding the crank of the projector. ALFREDO gets the message. It's pure 
	blackmail. He rubs his hand over his sweating face, raises his eyes to the 
	ceiling as if he were swearing. Then he surrenders, accepts the condition. 
	SALVATORE is serious, does not flaunt his victory, but you can tell he is happy. 
	He takes out a sheet of paper he had already prepared, with the solution to the 
	problem, rolls it up into a tiny ball and as soon as the TEACHER passes by, 
	takes aim and flicks it to him. ALFREDO'S hand catches the precious and dearly 
	bought message in mid-air. Their quarrel is over.
	
	2I  VARIOUS SETTINGS. INT. DAY/EVENING
	
	A bright, lilting tune marks the rhythm of the quick, blurred images, as
	in a dance, the images of ALFREDO teaching SALVATORE all the
	secrets of the projectionist trade.
	
	ALFREDO slips the reel on to the projector, unrolls the trailer and hands
	it to SALVATORE. SALVATORE mounts the film on the sprockets.
	Now SALVATORE sets the projector into motion, opens the shutter and
	stands on tip-toe to see the screen from the hole...
	
	A shot from In nome della legge. The main-floor audience applauds a
	line spoken by Massimo Gironi. And from the balcony, the same little
	MAN with the face of a public notary spits below.
	
				MAIN FLOOR VOICE  
		Bastard!! Pencil-pusher!!
	
	ALFREDO shows SALVATORE the running of the film. He points
	to a place on the projector.
	
				ALFREDO  
		Pay attention. This is where it can 
		easily catch fire. If it
		happens, the first thing you've got 
		to do is break it off, here
		and here, so the whole reel doesn't 
		go up in fames.
	
	On the screen, a shot from Riso amaro. A kiss. Unrelenting, the PRIEST rings his 
	bell. SALVATORE licks the film on one side, then on the other. He laughs.
	
				ALFREDO 
		You understand which side the 
		gelatin's on?
	
				SALVATORE  
		It tastes wonderful!
	
	A shot of Amedeo Nazzari in La figlia del capitano. A jump,
	an out-of-rack frame. The audience whistles.
	
				AUDIENCE  
		Fraaaame!! Wake up, Alfredo!
			(SALVATORE tries to do a 
			hand-binding. ALFREDO 
			winds the film, hangs a 
			slip on a nail in the 
			wall.)
	
				ALFREDO  
		These are the shipping invoices for 
		the film. They are always to be kept. 
		You see?
	
				SALVATORE  
		OK, Alfredo.
	
	Down on the main floor, a scene from Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.
	Everyone screams and hides their faces when Hyde looks at the
	camera.
	
				AUDIENCE  
		Holy Mother! What a face! So ugly!
	
	One young man, ANGELO, doesn't hide his face. He looks up at
	a young woman, ROSA, in the balcony, who turns and smiles at
	him.
	
	ALFREDO gives SALVATORE a wooden stool. He's had it made especially for him, so 
	he can be high enough to reach the reels of the projector and the arc lamp. 
	SALVATORE climbs up on it. He laughs, all excited. 
	
				ALFREDO  
		Now you can run it by yourself. 
	
	SALVATORE gives another smile. He is posing in a photographer's studio . He is 
	all dressed up for first communion, holding a white lily. The flash goes off 
	like lightning during a storm. Now SALVATORE is posing next to his mother and 
	little sister. They smile without hugging. Another flash of light. Click!
	
	22  FIFTH GRADE. INT. DAY
	
	Another click. The transparency of Rita Hayworth in her black gown
	from Gilda. MASINO is pasting it inside a minute pair of plastic field
	glasses. Other pupils crowd around him in excitement.
	
				MASINO  
			(In a whisper) 
		Christ, what a piece of ass!!!
	
	But there is not a cheerful atmosphere in the class - on the
	contrary, a strange silence. The pupils are all standing around the
	teacher's desk, having received their end-of-the-year report cards.
	PEPPINO, who shared SALVATORE s desk, is saying goodbye to
	his schoolmates. BOCCIA, COLA, the others. They have serious,
	sad expressions. He and SALVATORE kiss like grown-ups. The
	TEACHER is standing among them. One of the schoolmates does
	not respond lo PEPPINO's goodbye gesture. He takes a few steps
	back, serious, scared, his eyes lowered.
	
				TEACHER  
		Di Francesco, aren't you saying 
		goodbye to your schoolmate?
			(DI FRANCESCO gives his 
			head a little shake. The 
			TEACHER leans over to 
			him.)
		But why?
			(DI FRANCESCO whispers, 
			almost into her ear.)
	
				DI FRANCESCO  
		My father says he's a Communist...
	
	23  SQUARE AND PROJECTION BOOTH, CINEMA PARADISO. EXT/INT. DAY 
	
	Another farewell scene in the square. PEPPINO to his grandparents. His father 
	and mother are also there, saying goodbye to the old folks. There are tears. The 
	cardboard suitcases tied with string are loaded on to the luggage rack of the 
	black car. The scene is watched by SALVATORE and ALFREDO, up in the window of 
	the projection booth. They look like old friends. On the sound monitor, the 
	strains of some American musical comedy tune. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Will they really find work in 
		Germany? 
	
				ALFREDO  
		Who knows?...It's like an adventure. 
			(In a theatrical voice) 
		Hope springs eternal...
			(PEPPINO from the distance 
			gives one last wave at the 
			window of the 
			projection booth. 
			SALVATORE waves back.) 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Peppinoooo! Come back sooon!! 
			(The black car drives off, 
			leaving a cloud of dust 
			that envelops the 
			suppressed sobs of the 
			grandparents standing 
			there waving 	
			handkerchiefs. SALVATORE 
			watches the car drive off. 
			He mumbles:) 
		Good thing Germany's closer than 
		Russia. 
	
	ALFREDO rubs his hand through his hair.
	
	24  CINEMA PARADISO. BALCONY AND BOOTH. INT. EVENING
	
	The lion's head with the beam of light, seen from the balcony.
	SALVATORE'S face appears in the hole beside it, as he peers down at the
	images of the Settimana Incom newsreel.
	The audience is distracted. The snoring of a man sleeping can be heard.
	A pair of urchins pick up a cockroach with their hands, tip-toe down the
	aisle. The sleeping man is the same old BLACKSMITH, with his head
	thrown back. A little hand drops the cockroach into the gaping mouth.
	The URCHINS take to their heels. The BLACKSMITH squirms, wake up
	with a start. Spits, while everybody laughs. The newsreel is now about
	missing soldiers in Russia.
	
				COMMENTATOR  
		The Defense Minister has announced a 
		new listof names of Italian soldiers, 
		so far considered missing and now
		confirmed as dead. Families concerned 
		will be notified directly by military 
		authorities.
	
	SALVATORE pays careful attention, sees the black-and-white
	shots of the last war. The Russian campaign. The troops in the
	snow. Now in detail a heap of personal objects found on the
	corpses. Documents, clothing, glasses, photographs. One quick
	detail catches SALVATORE's eye  among those photographs, for one
	instant he sees one he thinks he recognizes. He quickly sticks a slip of paper 
	into the take-up reel, as when marking the kisses to be cut.
	
	25  PREFECTURE. CITY. INT. DAY
	
	The hands of an OFFICIAL tear off several forms and give them to
	MARIA who is sitting in front of the desk. She is dressed in black.
	SALVATORE stands beside her, holding her hand. They have black
	bands on their arms. An empty stare in their eyes.
	MARIA is pale, a cold look in her sunken eyes. Her heart is bursting in
	her breast. And a lump in her throat prevents her from speaking. She
	looks at her husband's belongings, identifies them  a gold chain, an ID
	card and the photograph, the one SALVATORE saw in the newsreel.
	MARIA strokes it with her fingers. SALVATORE comes up and looks, as
	the OFFICIAL concludes:
	
				OFFICIAL 
		...Unfortunately we don't know what 
		war cemetery he's buried in...This 
		is the form for the pension. If you'd 
		like to sign it...
	
	26  PREFECTURE AND CITY STREET. EXT. DAY 
	
	MARIA walks through the city. She holds SALVATORE by the hand. SALVATORE looks 
	up, trying to catch her eye. He sees her crying, in silence. The heartbroken 
	tears of someone who has lost the one last hope, but held back, so as not to be 
	seen by the child. SALVATORE presses close and puts his arm around her waist. 
	They turn the corner, and walk off in the noisy city, disfigured by the ruins of 
	war. A poster for Gone with the Wind catches SALVATORE's eye. He smiles.
	
	27  CINEMA PARADISO. BOX OFFICE. PROJECTION BOOTH. SQUARE. INT/EXT. EVENING 
	
	Winter has returned. On the screen, a sequence from I pompieri di Viggiu. The 
	theatre is jam full. The sea of heads sways and shakes at the irresistible jokes 
	of Toto. 
	
	Some people have climbed up on the window-sills. The aisles are crammed, an the 
	way down to the screen, where grown-ups and children sit on the floor, their 
	noses in the air. Some people munch crusts of bread they've brought along from 
	home. Almost everybody is smoking. A woman laughs, holding the baby she is 
	nursing. In one corner, at the end of one of the aisles jammed with people 
	standing, a girl laughs, but every now and then her expression reveals a look of 
	deep pleasure. 
	
	Her body moves slightly. Clinging to her from the rear is a man bathed in sweat. 
	
	They are making love standing there among the crowd, which notices nothing and 
	goes on laughing.
	
	In the balcony ANGELO is holding hands with ROSA.
	The curtain over the entrance is open. People are also standing there,
	seeing what they can from the distance, even a corner of the screen
	through the forest of heads. But the line continues on outside...All the
	way to the entrance of the movie house, out in the square. There are
	crowds of people, shivering from the cold, who protest, shove, risk
	provoking incidents. The PRIEST, Father Adelfio, is exhausted, tries to
	calm them down.
	
				PRIEST  
		Don't shove! There's no room! For 
		heaven's sake! I can't
		give another showing, it's late!
	
				VOICES IN CROWD  
		Father Adelfio, we've been here for 
		an hour! There are people inside 
		who've seen it twice! ! ! Move on!!
		Ouch!! My foot!!!
	
	It has just stopped raining, the bell-tower rings eleven o'clock. On
	the poster of the film a ' LAST DAY' sticker. The PRIEST, the
	TICKET-SELLER, the USHER and TWO CARABINIERES push the crowd back, close the 
	front door. The protest grows louder. Fists pound the door.
	
				CROWD  
		Open up!!! Father Adelfio!!
			(The audience in the 
			theatre hears the uproar. 
			Reacts:)
	
				AUDIENCE  
		Ssssh! Sssssh! Be quiet out there!! 
		What the hell!
			(From the window of the 
			projection booth, ALFREDO 
			and SALVATORE look at the 
			crowd down below, yelling 
			and complaining. Some of 
			the people look up at 
			them. )
	
				VOICES IN CROWD  
		Alfredooo! We want to get in!...
		Tomorrow you're taking it off!
			(ALFREDO spreads his arms 
			out as if to say there s 
			nothing he can do.)
	
				SALVATORE  
		Why can't we show the same film 
		tomorrow?
	
				ALFREDO  
		It's got to be sent to another town. 
		And if we don't the owner of that 
		movie house gets pissed off.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Too bad!
	
	The crowd sways nervously. The CARABINIERES give order.
	
				CARABINIERES  
			(Exasperated) 
		Stop! Go home, all of you! Otherwise 
		somebody's going to end up in jail!' 
		That's enough!
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Dramatically) 
		'Joe! A mob doesn't think, doesn't 
		know what it's doing...'
			(SALVATORE gives him a 
			curious, inquisitive look. 
			ALFREDO smiles.)
		Spencer Tracy said it in Fury. 
			(Mischievously) 
		What'd you say if we let these poor 
		devils see the film, Toto? 
			(SALVATORE stares at him 
			in amazement, all 
			excited.) 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Wonderful! But how can it be done? 
	
	ALFREDO turns away from the window. He gives a smirk, imitates the tough 
	American movie stars.
	
				ALFREDO  
		You don't believe my words, but 
		you'll have to believe your own 
		eyes!...And now get your ass off 
		that damn stool, boy! 
	
	SALVATORE laughs, eagerly, as if he were about to see a whole new movie. He 
	climbs off the stool. Both of them move towards the projector...
	
	28  PROJECTION BOOTH AND SQUARE. INT/EXT. EVENING
	
	Trying not to put his hand in front of the lens, ALFREDO removes the
	frame with the glass that protects the projection. He wheels it around
	and motions SALVATORE to look...On the wall behind the projector:
	the film picture appears gradually, reflected by the glass, moves as the
	glass moves all the way over to the window looking out over the square.
	There it disappears. SALVATORE can barely believe his eyes, as if it
	were a piece of magic. He takes a quick look through the hole to see if
	the film is still showing on the screen. It is.
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Mysteriously) 
		Go to the window, boy, and have a 
		look...
	
	SALVATORE goes over to the window. Looks out. The reflected
	beam of light ends up on the white row of houses facing the
	square. It's like another screen. Except the images are
	backwards, like when you look in a mirror. And here and there
	are the windows of the houses...For SALVATORE, it's a
	wonderful spectacle, like a dream, ravishing.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Alfredo, it's beautiful.
			(A voice is heard in the 
			crowd of people jammed 
			around the entrance to the 
			movie house.)
	
				VOICE IN CROWD  
			(Shouting) 
		Hey, look there!! The movie!!
			(All heeds turn to look at 
			the house behind them.)
	
				CROWD  
		Oh, praise the Lord!! It's true! 
		Look! The movie!! There's Toto!! 
		Hurry! Hurry!...THANKS, ALFRED0000!!
	
	And everybody runs over to the other side of the square, in front
	of the strange new screen. ALFREDO and SALVATORE watch with glittering eyes. 
	SALVATORE lays his hand on the shoulder of his great pal.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Good for you, Alfredo! 
	
	A close-up of Toto projected on the houses, and one of the windows opens. A MAN 
	appears, in his pajamas. Dazzled by the light, he shades his eyes with his hand. 
	He sees all those people looking at him and laughing together.
	
				CROWD  
		Shut the window!! Shut the window! Go 
		to bed!! 
	
	The MAN is dazed. Doesn't now what's going on. Looks around, and sees the 
	black-and-white figures of the film dancing around him. He pops back inside, 
	slams the window shut, almost cared.
	
				VOICES IN CROWD  
			(To ALFREDO) 
		Sound!!! Sound!! Alfredooooo!!
	
				ALFREDO  
		What do you say, should we make them 
		happy?
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Smiling) 
		Sure, sure! 
	
	ALFREDO takes the loudspeaker of the monitor, rings it over to the window, 
	turns it around towards the square. He turns up he volume and the sound-track 
	fills the square. A chorus of approval.
	
				CROWD  
		Aaaaaaaa! At last!
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Looking at SALVATORE) 
		Do you want to go down there? 
			(SALVATORE gives a 
			contented nod.) 
		Go on. 
	
	SALVATORE runs on. ALFREDO looks wistfully towards the huge image in the 
	square. Down in the square SALVATORE heads for the crowd, his eyes trained on 
	the house-front screen. Behind him, the door of the movie house opens. The 
	PRIEST, Father Adelfio, sees the film being projected on the house front, 
	the people standing or sitting on the ground, laughing. His eyes nearly pop out 
	of his head. Then he motions over the TICKET-SELLER, whispers something into his 
	ear. The TICKET-SELLER strides over to the shivering spectators, pulls the pad 
	of tickets out of his pocket.
	
				TICKET-SELLER  
		Ladies and gentlemen! You have to buy 
		tickets! Reduced rate! 
	
	An irresistible chorus of Bronx cheers washes over him. SALVATORE looks around, 
	highly amused.
	
				CROWD  
		Fuck off!! The square belongs to 
		everybody! 
			(The VILLAGE IDIOT peers 
			Out Of the crowd, all 
			worked up.) 
	
				VILLAGE IDIOT  
		No!!! The square's mine!!! Come on, 
		kids, no joking around here!!! 
		Otherwise...
	
	The crowd roars with laughter. SALVATORE laughs too, as if carried away by it 
	all. And over the general merriment looms the shadow of ALFREDO, standing in the 
	window of the projection booth. All at once, on the house-front screen, the 
	image of Toto slows down for an instant, a white blister appears and spreads 
	until it fills the whole screen. The crowd gives a start of bewilderment and 
	fear. SALVATORE jerks his head around to look at the booth.
	
	29  PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. DAY 
	
	The film bursts violently into flame among the gears and sprockets of the 
	projector. ALFREDO is taken off-guard. He breaks the film running into the take-
	up reel, but is unable to do it for the delivery reel. He grabs the film which 
	is catching fire and pulls it out quickly, tries to stop the flames from 
	reaching the reel in the f reproof housing. A desperate race against the speed 
	of the fire. The flames on the floor burn his legs. ALFREDO gives a jump, slows 
	down the movement of his hands for an instant and inevitably the flames run 
	ahead, reach the upper housing. It's like an explosion. The flames leap out, 
	striking him full in the face. ALFREDO doesn't have time to scream, struggles 
	desperately and falls to the floor. Meanwhile the flames envelop everything.
	
	30  SQUARE.EXT.EVENING 
	
	The flash of the flames flares up in the windows of the projection booth. 
	SALVATORE is appalled, elbows his way through the moving 
	crowd. Inside the movie house the murmuring of the audience can be heard, 
	growing louder and louder. A scream...
	
	3I:CINEMA PARADISO. INT. EVENING 
	
	A violent spurt of flames leaps out of the mouth of the plaster lion's head, 
	into the darkness broken by the screams of people rushing for the exits.
	
	32  SQUARE AND CINEMA PARADISO ENTRANCE. EXT. EVENING 
	
	The crowd streaks out of the movie house, enveloped in a cloud of black smoke. 
	
				CROWD  
		Heeeelp! Run for your lives!!! 
	
	In the general panic, SALVATORE tries in vain to get inside, elbows his way 
	towards the street with the stairs leading to the projection booth. The audience 
	clashes against him, knocks him to the ground, almost trampling him underfoot. 
	He is suddenly seized by a superhuman force; gets up, claws his way desperately 
	ahead, with people falling on top of him and to the floor. He finally succeeds, 
	starts up the stairs...
	
	33  CINEMA PARADISO. STAIRS AND PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. EVENING 
	
	The place is filled with smoke. The air is suffocating. SALVATORE streaks up the 
	stairs, gasping for breath. The projection booth is enveloped inflames. 
	ALFREDO's body on the floor, burning. SALVATORE moves quickly, throws a blanket 
	over his shoulders, drags him by the feet over to the stairs, as boxes and other 
	objects fall on him. Using the same blanket, he stamps out the flames that have 
	seared ALFREDO'S clothes. With the force of desperation, he drags him further 
	down the stairs which have been reached by the smoke but not by the flames. 
	ALFREDO doesn't move, his face is burnt. SALVATORE looks at him and only now is 
	panic-stricken, lets out a terrified shriek, like a wounded colt. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Alfredo! Heeeelp! Help!!!
	
	34  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. EVENING 
	
	The plaster lion looks like a dragon spitting fire and smoke. The statue of the 
	Virgin Mary is also in flames. And the movie screen.
	
	35  SQUARE AND CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. EVENING 
	
	The fire has been put out. Nothing remains of the movie house but the skeleton. 
	Everything has gone up in smoke. 
	
	People stand around, dismayed. They gather around the PRIEST, who is at once 
	grieved and shocked, to express their solidarity and comfort. 
	
				VOICES  
		What a pity! Poor Alfredo! What a 
		terrible thing!! Cheer up, Father, is 
		there something we can do?'
	
				VILLAGE IDIOT  
			(Laughing) 
		Burnt up...Burnt up. 
	
				PRIEST  
		What'll we do now! The town will have 
		to get along without movies! Who's 
		got the money to rebuild it? 
	
	CICCIO SPACCAFICO, the man who won the Sisal pools, comes up, dressed in style. 
	He looks up at the charred cinema. It looks like a battlefield after an enemy 
	attack. From the smoke and ashes to...
	
	36  CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. EVENING
	
	...The great lighted sign of the CINEMA PARADISO . The movie house has been 
	rebuilt. New facade. New billboards. There are people 
	moving about the entrance. It is the evening of the inauguration...
	
	37  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. EVENING 
	
	The lobby is crowded with people, authorities, special guests. There is the 
	MAYOR, FATHER ADELFIO and the new owner, CICCIO SPACCAFICO, dressed to the 
	teeth. The MAYOR cuts the ribbon. Flashbulbs pop. Clapping. 
	
				GUESTS  
		Cheers' Congratulations, Don Ciccio! 
	
	The procession advances towards the stairs leading into the theatre. FATHER 
	ADELFIO, with a nostalgic sigh, blesses the lobby, then the corridor. Lastly, 
	the new auditorium, which resounds with toasts and cheers.
	
				AUDIENCE  
		To the Cinema Paradiso! 
	
	The PRIEST sprinkles the new seats, the walls, the screen with holy water...
	
	38  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. EVENING 
	
	Now FATHER ADELFIO is blessing the brand-new projection booth. He also blesses 
	the new projectionist: SALVATORE. He is very nervous, but serious, self-
	possessed. His worried-looking mother is also there for the occasion. The PRIEST 
	turns to SPACCAFICO. 
	
				PRIEST  
		How'd you solve his being under age? 
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		I took out a license as 
		projectionist, thanks to friends down 
		at the guild offices. But I don't 
		know a thing about it. Officially, I 
		do the job...
			(Smiling at Salvatore)
		...but Toto earns the money. 
	
				PRIEST  
		Fine. 
			(To SALVATORE) 
		Always be careful, my boy. Don't ever 
		go to sleep. Be sure another accident 
		doesn't happen. Do everything poor 
		Alfredo taught you. And may God bless 
		you. 
	
	SALVATORE nods his head seriously, assuming a responsible expression. His 
	mother kisses the PRIEST's hand.
	
				MARIA  
		Thanks, Father. Thanks. 
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		And now enough of this gloomy 
		atmosphere. Life goes on! I want to 
		see you happy and smiling!
	
	39  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. EVENING
	
	Laughter. The laughter of the large audience at the first showing of the
	inauguration film. Among the spectators, SALVATORE'S mother, MARIA, and his kid 
	sister, El A. Up on the screen, a man and a woman kiss. The first time a kiss 
	has been seen at the Cinema Paradiso. The audience murmurs, surprised and 
	excited.
	
				AUDIENCE  
		Ooooooh! They're kissing!! Look at 
		that!! Christ, that's news!!
	
	An OLD LADY sitting next to the MAYOR, crosses herself, flabbergasted. CICCIO 
	SPACCAFICO chuckles. Rubs his hands: these are going to be golden times for him. 
	FATHER ADELFIO gets up and stalks out of the theatre, indignant; he'll
	never set foot in the place again. The love theme gets louder and
	louder...
	
	40  PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. EVENING
	
	The same music spreads through the booth from the monitor. SALVATORE is by 
	himself. He is watching the film through the hole but strangely enough, the 
	story doesn't absorb him. ALFREDO'S absence makes him nervous, he gazes at the 
	stool he used to sit on. Il has been repainted. A voice from the rear of the 
	cabin:
	
				ANNA'S VOICE  
		Toto?...
	
	SALVATORE turns and at the top of the stairs sees SIGNORA
	ANNA and behind her, ALFREDO, her husband. He is wearing a
	pair of dark glasses and walks with the kelp of a cane. He has
	lost his sight, but not his spirit. He smiles:
	
				ALFREDO  
		Any room for me in this Cinema 
		Paradiso?
			(SALVATORE runs over and 
			embraces him.)
	
				SALVATORE  
		Come in, Alfredo.
	
				ANNA  
			(to SALVATORE) 
		Toto, will you bring him home when 
		you close down?
	
				SALVATORE  
		Yes. Signora Anna. 
			(To ALFREDO) 
		I'm glad you came.
	
						Cut to:
	
	ALFREDO is now sitting there immobile. He listens to the soundtrack of the film. 
	SALVATORE studies the way he stares into empty space, and the idea of darkness 
	frightens him. There is something new in ALFREDO'S manner, as if having grazed 
	death and the loss of his sight had endowed him with a deeper knowledge of men 
	and life.
	
				ALFREDO  
		How's school?
	
				SALVATORE  
		OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, 
		I'11 probably stop going...
	
				ALFREDO  
		Don't do that...Sooner or later 
		you'll be left empty-handed.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Why? What do you mean?
	
				ALFREDO  
		Toto, this isn't for you. For the 
		moment, the Cinema Paradiso needs 
		you, and you need the Cinema 
		Paradiso. But it won't last...Some 
		day you'll have other things 
		to do, more important things...
			(He reaches out and 
			touches SALVATORE'S face 
			to 'feel' his expression.)
		That's right, more important. I know 
		it. Now that I've lost my sight I see 
		more. 
		I see everything I didn't see 
		before...
			(As ALFREDO moves his hand 
			from SALVATORE's face, we 
			see that he is now a young 
			man, and that ALFREDO is 
			older, grayer.) 
		And it's all thanks to you, who saved 
		my life. And I'll never forget it...
			(SALVATORE doesn't 
			understand his strange 
			words. ALFREDO can 'feel' 
			he is troubled.)
		And don't put on that look. I haven't 
		gone off my head yet. You want proof?
	
	And he gives a joking smile. SALVATORE is curious, expects one of his fiendish 
	tricks.
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Smiling) 
		Yes. I want proof.
	
				ALFREDO  
		For example, at this moment the 
		film's out of focus. Go see. 
	
	SALVATORE stands up in disbelief. He looks through the hole, and indeed the film 
	is out of focus. He puts it back into focus, flabbergasted.
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Smiling) 
		It's hard to explain, Toto...
	
	41  CAFE IN THE SQUARE. INT/EXT. MORNING
	
	As the BILL-POSTER attaches to the café door a poster of Catene - the
	coming attraction at the Cinema Paradiso - CICCIO SPACCAFICO is
	speaking on the phone in the phone booth. He is clearly peeved.
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Only two days? Are you joking?!...
		What do I care if all the copies 
		are reserved?...Catene for only two 
		days in a place like this! Why, 
		people will eat me alive!...
			(Standing beside him 
			listening is SALVATORE. He 
			is carrying school 
			books under his ann. In 
			the café, several curious 
			ONLOOKERS laugh as through 
			the café window they watch 
			some unemployed PEASANT 
			MEN dancing together at 
			the club. SPACCAFICO 
			listens nervously, then 
			shrieks as if he were 
			about to eat the phone.)
		...I know, I know. But even if I 
		start showing at eight in the morning 
		it wouldn't be enough! This is a big 
		town now and you people at the 
		Titanus know it perfectly well! I'm 
		your sole agent and if I get pissed 
		off I'll write straight 
		to Lombardo, in Rome!! I'll give you 
		guys a good run-around!! If I get my 
		dander up, I can let fly, if my 
		name's Spaccafico!! 
	
						Cut to:  
	
	SPACCAFICO AND SALVATORE are now outside the café, head towards the square. In 
	front of the movie house, the CHARWOMAN is at work. SPACCAFICO is so nervous he 
	lights two cigarettes without noticing it. SALVATORE is turning something over 
	in his mind.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Don Ciccio, I've got an idea...You 
		remember that old abandoned movie 
		house where they're supposed to build 
		those low-rent houses?
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		So what's that got to do with it?
	
				SALVATORE  
		The projector's all rusty, but I 
		could fix it in two or three days. 
		Give the place a good cleaning, put 
		in some seats and bring in a 
		projectionist and we'll show Catene 
		in two houses.
	
				SPACCAFICO  
			(Shrieking) 
		What the fuck you talking about? You 
		getting into the act too, Toto? 
		Titanus has trouble giving me even 
		one copy and I have to say thanks! If 
		I ask for two, the least they'll do 
		is cut off my head and play ball with 
		it! 
	
	A shrewd look glitters in SALVATORE s eyes. He smiles.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Who says we need two copies?
	
	42  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. DAY 
	
	The house is jammed with people. Almost bursting at the seams. The last scenes 
	of Catene move across the screen. Tears stream down the faces of the men and 
	women. The children are unusually silent. Even the BLACKSMITH is awake, indeed 
	whispers ahead of time all the lines of Nazzari and Yvonne Sanson, knows them by 
	heart. Among the crowd in the balcony there is ALFREDO and his wife, the MAYOR, 
	DON VINCENZO the landowner, the schoolteachers. Now the music is loud, heart-
	rending. 'THE END' appears on screen. The lights go on. And there is a great 
	din and uproar as one audience leaves and another arrives. The race for empty 
	seats. Quarrels. The CARABINIERES help the USHER maintain order and persuade the 
	people who want to see the film again to get up and leave. 
	
				USHER  
			(Exasperate]) 
		That's enough now! You've seen it ten 
		times! I need the seats! I wish you'd 
		all get the galloping runs! 
	
				CARABINIERES  
		Easy! Easy! Through the emergency 
		exits, quick! Stop the jabbering!!
	
	43  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. 
	
	The end of the film slips through the sprockets. SALVATORE switches off the 
	motor. He is particularly fast in taking the reel out of the housing. And even 
	faster in dropping it into the sack BOCCIA is holding open for him. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Now get running and bring me the 
		first reel. Meanwhile I'll start 
		showing the news! 
	
				BOCCIA  
		OK, Toto!
	
	44  VILLAGE STREETS AND COUNTRYSIDE. EXT. DAY 
	
	BOCCIA speeds like an arrow on his bicycle through the village streets. Tied to 
	the parcel-rack is the sack containing the second part of Catene. He now turns 
	off the main street and takes a short-cut down a country road. He pedals as fast 
	as he can. Until he disappears into the distance, beyond the trees.
	
	45  ENTRANCE OLD ABANDONED MOVIE HOUSE. EXT. DAY 
	
	BOCCIA finally reaches the old movie house, which has been more or less spruced 
	up. Here too people are lined up in front of the posters of Catene. CICCIO 
	SPACCAFICO is waiting impatiently on an outside staircase. He too is holding a 
	sack, containing the first part of the film. The bicycle pulls up in front of 
	him. The sacks are exchanged. 
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Quick! Give it to me! Here's the 
		first part. Get moving! 
	
	BOCCIA heads back to the Cinema Paradiso, to take the first part to SALVATORE. 
	SPACCAFICO dashes up the stairs, and hands the sack to a MAN standing in the 
	door, through which the bare projection booth can be seen, and the projector 
	which SALVATORE has put back into working order. SPACCAFICO yells in excitement. 
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Here you are! Quick, quick!! People 
		are waiting!
	
	46  OLD ABANDONED MOVIE HOUSE. INT. DAY 
	
	In fact, inside the old freezing cold movie house, the audience is grumbling. 
	Everyone is wrapped in overcoats and woollen scarves and are sitting on chairs 
	they've brought from home and wooden benches. The hum of the projector is heard 
	at last. The lights go down. The grumbling subsides. The words 'PART TWO' appear 
	on screen and then the images of the film.
	
	47  VARIOUS COUNTRY ROADS AND VILLAGE STREETS. EXT. DAY/SUNDOWN
	
	Meanwhile BOCCIA pedals his way swiftly through the countryside on his way to 
	the Cinema Paradiso...
	
						FADE.
	
	Now BOCCIA is on his way back to the old movie house. To carry out another 
	exchange of sacks containing the reels of film.
	
						FADE.
	
	Another race back to Cinema Paradiso. BOCCIA starts looking tired, his breath is 
	short. And daylight starts fading into the colours of sundown.
	
						FADE.
	
	The last fading light of sundown.-BOCCIA is pedalling once more back
	to the old movie house. With the same sack tied to the parcel-rack. He
	is exhausted. On his last legs. He slows down, then stops.
	
	48  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. EVENING
	
	The lights are still on. In the thick blanket of smoke, the crowd stirs
	nervously. Shouting. Whistling.
	
				AUDIENCE  
		Hey, when's it starting!! We've got 
		ploughing to do in the morning!! 
		Toto, get a move on!! Heeey!!
	
	49  PROJECTION BOOTH. INT/EXT. EVENING
	
	In the booth, the projector is turned off. SALVATORE looks nervously
	out of the window...at the square. But not a sign of BOCCIA. A CARABINIERE 
	peers in through one of the holes.
	
				CARABINIERE  
		What are we going to do, Toto? The 
		whole place here is up in arms. 
		They've been waiting more than a half 
		hour.
	
				SALVATORE  
		What can I do?
	
	50  OLD ABANDONED MOVIE HOUSE. INT. EVENING
	
	Here too the audience is up in arms. They're waiting for Part Two tostart. 
	CICCIO SPACCAFICO tears his hair with rage.
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Where's the fucking bastard got to?
	
				SPECTATOR  
		Let's get one thing straight, Don 
		Ciccio! I'm waiting ten minutes 
		more, and if you haven't started...
		you're giving me my money back!!
	
				AUDIENCE  
			(In chorus) 
		Well said! Well said! We want our 
		money back!!
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Easy! Easy! What about my showing you 
		the first part again? Huh? 
	
	People shout, whistle, give Bronx cheers.
	
	
				AUDIENCE  
		No! First part, my foot! We want to 
		see how the story ends!! 
	
	Down in the front row, PASQUALE, the man who sells black market cigarettes, 
	stands up.
	
				PASQUALE  
		I've seen the whole works! You want 
		me to tell you how it ends? 
	
	A shoe comes flying at him.
	
				AUDIENCE  
		Nooo! No! Shut up, you jerk!!
	
	5I  VILLAGE STREETS AND COUNTRY ROADS. EXT. EVENING
	
	SALVATORE has got himself a bicycle and is going off to look for
	BOCCIA. He pedals fast, turns into the country short cut. Looks
	around  not a sign of Boccia. By now it is dark. He sees a MAN in the window of 
	a farmhouse, calls out to him. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Boccia! Boccia! 
	
	SALVATORE rides on. Now he's in the open country. All of a sudden he seems to 
	hear something. He stops. Pricks up his ears. It's a sort of moan - he can't 
	figure out if it's an animal or a man. He turns on the flashlight he has brought 
	along. Takes a closer look around. 
	
	Catches sight of a bicycle wheel on the ground behind a bush. That's where the 
	moan is coming from! He creeps over in alarm. Next to the bicycle he now catches 
	sight of the sack with the film. And the moaning gets louder. 
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Alarmed) 
		Boccia, what's wrong? 
			(He runs over to help his 
			friend. Behind the bush he 
			discovers BOCCIA humped up 
			between the legs of 
			TERESA, a prostitute. He 
			moves with all the fury 
			of his young years. 
			SALVATORE has never seen 
			people making love before 
			and is speechless.)
		Damn you, what are you doing? 
	
				BOCCIA  
			(Shouting) 
		Oh, Christ, it's so good!!! 
			(And he goes on ramming it 
			home.) 
	
				TERESA  
		Hey, cut it out! Go away. Shoo! 
	
	With a confused look on his face, SALVATORE picks up the sack and walks away, 
	looking over his shoulder at the couple who go on tossing around more and more 
	frantically.
	
	BOCCIA lets out a shriek of pleasure that rings through the countryside, as 
	SALVATORE pedals off like a madman and disappears into the trees. 
	
	52  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. DAY/EVENING 
	
	Music and the naked body of Brigitte Bardot. A row of youngsters on the main 
	floor stare at the naked actress, all excited. A regular rhythmic tremor runs 
	through them, half-hidden by the back of the seats.
	
	A scene from a horror film. The frightened faces of the audience. Off in one 
	corner, the door of the men's toilet opens and a MAN with a contented look comes 
	out, followed by TERESA, who motions another one to come in. In the projection 
	booth, SALVATORE is eating the meal his mother has brought him.
	
	A gangster film. The tense faces of the audience. A gun battle. Rounds of 
	machine-gunfire in the night. The shots echo through the theatre. A LITTLE BOY 
	claps his hands over his ears. Alternating with the machine-gunfire on screen, a 
	real pistol shoots the back of one of the spectators, the landowner DON 
	VINCENZO, who slumps down in his seat without anybody noticing...The shooting 
	continues up on screen...
	
	SALVATORE'S hand holds a lighted match under a piece of film, before the 
	horrified eyes of SPACCAFICO and the USHER, and the puzzled expression of 
	ALFREDO. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch 
		fire! 
	
				ALFREDO  
		Progress! It always arrives too late!
	
	A scene from Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. The only empty seat
	in the theatre is the one where DON VINCENZO was killed. A flower
	has been tied to it with string. All the other seats are taken.
	
						Fade to:
	
	ROSA and ANGELO are sitting next to each other. They are watching a
	different film. But she has a baby in her arms  they have got married,
	have set up a family.
	
	In the balcony, the MAN with the face of a public notary spits down
	below with a contented look. But this time the main floor takes its
	revenge and a blob of shit hits him square in the face.
	
	53  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. MORNING 
	
	In the morning the theatre is empty. All the doors are shut. Light filters in 
	through the open windows up above, illuminates the posters of coming attractions 
	and the yellowish screen. Off-screen, a woman's voice 
	and a boy's voice are heard. 
	
				TERESA'S VOICE  
			(Off-screen) 
		Come on...That's right...relax...
			(Laughing)
		...Don't be scared...
	
				SALVATORE'S VOICE  
			(Off-screen) 
		Is it true that if I bleed I've got 
		to squeeze lemon juice on it? 
	
				TERESA'S VOICE  (Off-screen) 
			(A loud laugh) 
		Lemon juice?...That's a new one for 
		you! Who tells you this crap...Take 
		it easy...That's right...You see, 
		it's not painful, is it?
	
	Slow pan along the walls of the theatre, the empty aisles,
	discovers SALVATORE on the floor between the seats with
	TERESA, the prostitute who has already been seen. SALVATORE is
	making love for the first time in his life. He is awkward and
	clumsy. There is an uncertain look in his eyes, his livid face is
	dripping with sweat.
	
				TERESA 
		...There you are! That's right, 
		that's right! Keep going...
			(SALVATORE is quicker, has 
			learned the lesson. TERESA 
			goads him on.)
		Ah!!! There, now you're a real man! A 
		man! ? A real calf!
			(SALVATORE's panting 
			slackens into a deep sigh 
			of pleasure.)
	
	54  VARIOUS SETTINGS. INT/EXT. DAY 
	
	The blade of a knife, clutched in a hardened hand. A blow. A cry of pain. A calf 
	falls like a dead weight to the ground...SALVATORE photographs the animal in 
	the throes of death with his 8mm movie camera. As well as the faces of the MEN 
	who now bleed and skin it quickly. In the vast slaughter-house, the voices of 
	the men and animals mingle together.
	
	SALVATORE'S eye is quick to catch the most unexpected expressions of ordinary 
	people. His movie camera is always ready, like a hunter's rifle. Now he is 
	shooting...
	
	A meeting in the square: the passionate reactions of the peasants listening to a 
	speaker who flails his arms around.
	
	At school: the old SCHOOLMISTRESS sitting at her desk, sunk in God knows what 
	dreams, her eyes staring off into empty space, as a tear runs down her pale, 
	unhappy face, and the unknowing STUDENTS carry out their assignments.
	
	At the railroad station: the nervous excitement of the people waiting on the 
	platforms. SALVATORE pans his camera on to TWO MEN fighting. But an arriving 
	train comes in between. Salvatore follows the train, pans along the cars. The 
	train stops. 
	
	-A door opens and the passengers climb out. Several TRADERS, a CARABINTERE, a 
	group of commuting STUDENTS, the TICKET-COLLECTOR, a distinguished looking 
	COUPLE and lastly, a GIRL who stops in the middle of the viewfinder. SALVATORE 
	is immediately attracted by her face. He goes on shooting without leaving it a 
	moment. He follows her through the lens. She is very beautiful, must be around 
	sixteen, a simple, sweet face, blue eyes. She is certainly the daughter of the 
	distinguished looking COUPLE who got off just before she did. The little family 
	moves off down the platform. Salvatore follows the girl's movements, as if 
	hypnotized. Now she passes by him, turns towards him for one moment, as if 
	trying to figure out where he is aiming that funny-looking gadget. SALVATORE 
	smiles at her, entranced.
	
	55  HIGH SCHOOL. COURTYARD. ENTRANCE. EXT. MORNING
	
	The JANITOR is ringing the bell. In the courtyard, on the other side of
	the gate, the STUDENTS prepare to enter. SALVATORE is with a group
	of schoolmates, including BOCCIA. And they all stare, wide-eyed, at
	the GIRL from the station. She has her books under her arm and is
	walking by herself.
	
				SALVATORE  
		You know that one there?
	
				BOCCIA  
		She's new. Not bad though. Nice-
		looking.
			(SALVATORE has the look of 
			somebody seeking for an 
			idea, some way of picking 
			up a conversation with 
			her.)
	
				SECOND STUDENT  
		Her father s the new bank director. 
		Loaded, luxury and easy living!
	
				FIRST STUDENT  
		People who jerk off with a shirt so 
		they won't get their hands dirty. 
			(Laughs.)
	
	All at once, BOCCIA and SALVATORE notice that the GIRL drops
	her lunch without noticing as she is about to enter the school. They
	fly off, swift as arrows. It's a chance not to be missed. BOCCIA is
	the quicker, is already in the lead. SALVATORE gives an angry
	gesture. A flash come into his eyes, the same flash he had as a little
	boy when he finds the right way to hit home. He picks up his step,
	trips BOCCIA and brings him to the ground. He pounces on him
	and lets go with his fist. He starts running again. Picks the
	bundle off the ground. Catches up with the GIRL from the
	station, nervous and inexperienced, but polite.
				SALVATORE  
		Look, you dropped this.
	
	And he hands her her lunch with a smile. She recognizes him.
	
				ELENA  
		Oh, thanks. I hadn't noticed...
	
	She takes the bundle as SALVATORE touches her hand delicately.
	
				SALVATORE  
		My name's Salvatore...And yours?
	
				ELENA  
			(Smiling) 
		Elena. My name's Elena.
	
	SALVATORE is very flustered. He feels as if all his blood were
	throbbing in his head. He tries to say something else, but the words
	catch in his throat.
	
				SALVATORE  
		I...I...The other time at the 
		station.
	
	BOCCIA suddenly grabs him by the collar and yanks him away. ELENA is frightened, 
	puts her hand over her eyes so as not to see.
	
	56:CINEMA PARADISO.PROJECTION BOOTH.INT.AFTERNOON 
	
	SALVATORE has a black eye, swollen shut. He is setting up a little 8mm projector 
	on a stool. ALFREDO is sitting in one corner. He has come to keep him company. 
	He listens to the sound-track of the movie being shown. 
	
				ALFREDO
		Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto? 
	
				SALVATORE  
		That's right, Modern Times. 
	
				ALFREDO  
		I've shown it so many times I know it 
		by heart. The first time I showed 
		it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first 
		wife died. They kept it hidden from 
		me all day so they wouldn't have to 
		close down the movie house. I only 
		found out that night, after the last 
		show. Those are things you never 
		forget...
			(Changing his tone.) 
		So, Toto, how are these home movies 
		going? 
			(SALVATORE has switched on 
			the little projector and a 
			square of light appears on 
			the wall beside ALFREDO, 
			with the scenes shot in 
			town.) 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Yes. 
			(The shots of the 
			slaughter-house have 
			appeared.) 
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Whispering) 
		What is it, what is it? What's the 
		picture? 
	
				SALVATORE  
		It's people in the slaughter-house 
		killing a calf. There's blood all 
		over the floor, like a lake. And 
		through this lake another calf passes 
		by on its way to die. 
	
	ALFREDO is concentrated, as if SALVATORE'S description transmitted the 
	real image to him, the colours, the forms. The railway station has appeared on 
	the wall, and the sequence of ELENA. SALVATORE does not move, does not say a 
	word, as he gazes at those blue eyes looking into the camera. ALFREDO senses 
	something funny in the boy's s11ence.
	
				ALFREDO  
		Now what can you see?
	
				SALVATORE  
		Nothing, there's nothing. It's all 
		out of focus.
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Smiling) 
		Is there a woman?...Tell me the 
		truth...
			(SALVATORE is shamed, 
			uncertain, doesn't know 
			whet to say. A tender look 
			filters through ALFREDO's 
			dark glasses. He has 
			obviously caught on and 
			whispers:) 
		There is a woman.
	
	SALVATORE is forced to admit it, with a sigh.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Yes, it's a girl I saw at the 
		station.
	
				ALFREDO  
		What's she like? What's she like?...
	
	And as other shots of ELENA appear on the screen, SALVATORE describes her. As 
	only somebody in love could.
	
				SALVATORE  
		She's nice. My age...Slender, with 
		long hair, brunette. She had big blue 
		eyes, a simple expression and a 
		little beauty mark on her lip, but 
		really tiny. You can only see it 
		close-up. And when she smiles...She 
		makes you feel...
	
	He stops. Only now does he realize that he has let himself be carried away by 
	passion, by the desire to talk about her. ALFREDO smiles, spellbound...
	
				ALFREDO  
		Eh! Love...what a mystery!
			(SALVATORE turns off the 
			projector and heaves a 
			deep sigh, almost of 
			liberation. ALFREDO'S 
			sympathy does him a lot of 
			good. It's nice to be 
			understood. He moves over 
			closer to him. ALFREDO 
			runs his hand through his 
			hair, whispers:)
		I understand you, Toto...The ones 
		with blue eyes are the
		most beautiful. Whatever you do, you 
		can't make friends with
		them.
			(SALVATORE is comforted by 
			the way he talks. He 
			didn't think it
			was possible to put into 
			words the things he has 
			felt since meeting
			ELENA. He nods his head. 
			ALFREDO sighs.)
		Eh, there's nothing to be done about 
		it! The heavier a man is,
		the deeper his footprints. And if 
		he's in love, he suffers,
		because he knows he's up a one-way 
		street. Because love is a
		meaningless thing when a man gets it 
		into his head to do what
		he wants...
			(SALVATORE is touched by 
			his sensitivity, by his 
			intense, passionate, sweet 
			way of speaking.)
	
				SALVATORE  
		What you say is wonderful! But sad...
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Smiling) 
		They're not my words. John Wayne said 
		it in Shepherd of the Hills.
	
	SALVATORE suddenly changes expression, as if discovering he was being made fun 
	of.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Stinking two-timer!! 
			(And they burst out 
			laughing.)
	
	57:CINEMAPARADISOANDVARIOUSSTREETS.EXT.DAY
	
	A grey, windy day. It is opening-time and the shutters of the movie
	house are being rolled up. SALVATORE is about to enter through the
	small door of the spiral staircase, when in the distance he catches sight
	of...
	
	ELENA crossing a street with her books under her arm. She is alone.
	SALVATORE doesn't stop to think twice, dashes off, runs through streets
	full of dust, another square, turns the corner, but has lost sight of her.
	He looks around in all directions  there she is! He starts running again.
	And finally catches up with her, all out of breath, practically
	speechless with emotion.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Hi, Elena!
	
				ELENA  
		Hi. Why are you running?
	
				SALVATORE  
		No particular reason...
			(He is entranced by her 
			eyes. He wants to tell her 
			all sorts of
			things, say all the words 
			he has memorized a 
			thousand times. But
			now he can't get them out. 
			His knees tremble. He does 
			his best to
			overcome his confusion, 
			but all that comes out 
			is:)
		Nice day, huh?
			(A gust of wind envelops 
			them in a cloud of dust 
			and a clap of
			thunder rends the air. 
			ELENA laughs, amused by 
			the blunder.)
	
				ELENA  
		Yes, nice day.
			(SALVATORE laughs too. He 
			gazes at her long hair 
			tossed by the wind. She 
			turns to leave.)
		...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Bye-bye, Elena.
			(ELENA walks away. And 
			SALVATORE also turns to 
			leave. Only now is he 
			seized by disappointment,  
			regret at not having made
			the best of the 
			opportunity. He talks to 
			himself.)
		...What an idiot! What an idiot! 
		'Nice day'! Christ!!
	
	58:SALVATORE'S BEDROOM.INT.DAY 
	
	SALVATORE projects images of ELENA on his wall. He lies across his bed gazing at 
	her image.
	
				SALVATORE  
		You probably don't believe me, but 
		I'm going to become the leading man 
		in your life. Sure, I don't look like 
		Marlon Brando, but look at me, really 
		look at me. Am I really so ugly? So 
		should I try once more? Maybe It'll 
		succeed. What do you 
		say? 
	
	ELENA seems to be saying, Yes. As SALVATORE kisses ELENA, her image disappears. 
	He is left with his face against the wall in the white light from the 
	projector.
	
	59:PHONEB00TH AND ELENA'S HOUSE.INT.DAY
	
	SALVATORE is in a phone booth. The telephone will certainly help him feel less 
	nervous.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Hello, can I speak to Elena, please?
	
				WOMANS VOICE  
		Yes. 
			(SALVATORE recognizes 
			ELENA's voice, changes his 
			tone, turns sweeter, more 
			personal.)
	
				SALVATORE 
		Is that you, Elena?
	
				WOMAN'S VOICE  
		Yes...
	
				SALVATORE  
		Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't recognize 
		your voice. This is Salvatore, 
		remember?
	
				WOMAN'SVOICE  
		Yes...
	
	SALVATORE finally speaks, says everything all in one breath, without stopping, 
	without hesitating, in order to leave no room for shyness.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Listen, I know that every time we see 
		each other I make a fool of myself, 
		but I'm not like that, I swear. It's 
		just that when I see you, I feel shy, 
		the right words don't come to me, I 
		don't have the courage to say that 
		all I do is think about you...
			(He has finally got it 
			out. He's dripping with 
			sweat, but happy at having 
			succeeded. He continues.) 
		That's right, Elena, you're the last 
		thing I think of when I go to sleep 
		and the first when I wake up in the 
		morning. And at night I always dream 
		of you. I know, it's not good on the 
		phone. But please, don't get me 
		wrong. Because I love you very 
		much...
	
				WOMAN'SVOICE  
			(Interrupting him) 
		If you don't stop phoning her, I'm 
		calling the police!
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Stunned) 
		But excuse me, who's speaking?
	
	At ELENA'S house, a WOMAN who is visibly in a state is speaking on the phone.
	
				ELENA'S MOTHER  
		I'm Elena's mother, you filthy pig! 
	
	SALVATORE feels like dropping through the floor, tries to get a word in to 
	explain, to apologize, but the flood of insults overwhelms him.
	
				SALVATORE  
		I'm sorry, Signora, maybe there's a 
		misunderstanding...I...
	
				WOMAN'S VOICE  
		And don't call my daughter any more. 
		Never! 
	
	SALVATORE has no choice but to hang up, disappointed, defeated. He's so mad he 
	starts slapping himself.
	
	60:ALFREDO'S HOUSE.EXT.AFTERNOON
	
	Good Friday. ALFREDO comes out of his house, leaning on
	SALVATORE's shoulder. They go off down the street, towards the
	church. SALVATORE has finished recounting his misadventure.
	
				ALFREDO  
		I told you, the blue-eyed ones are 
		the most difficult.
	
				SALVATORE  
		But why? There must be some way to 
		make her understand!
	
				ALFREDO  
		Don't think about it, Toto. Don't 
		even try. With feelings, there's 
		nothing to understand. 
	
	SALVATORE gives an angry gesture. This time ALFREDO'S words do not quiet his 
	frenzy, don't help him. He moves away from him a few steps.
	
	ALFREDO stands there motionless in the middle of the road.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Stop it! I've had enough of your 
		sermons! You act as if you created 
		the world! 
			(A bicycle streaks by 
			ALFREDO, who gives a 
			startled jump, as if it 
			were about to 
			run into him. He raises 
			his voice, panic-
			stricken.)
	
				ALFREDO  
		Heeey! Totooooo! Don't get pissed off 
		with me now! Come here! I don't 
		know where the fuck I have to go. 
			(A MAN on a bicycle almost 
			collides with ALFREDO. 
			SALVATORE fumes, goes over 
			to him listlessly. ALFREDO 
			puts his hand back on his 
			shoulder and they start 
			walking again. ALFREDO has 
			calmed down, but his voice 
			is determined.) 
		And the next time be careful how you 
		talk. Not to take credit away 
		from the Lord, but if I had created 
		the world, in all modesty, certain 
		things would have come out better. 
		But unfortunately such was not the 
		case.
	
				SALVATORE 
			(Laughing) 
		You see, it s like I say. You always 
		have an answer for everything.
	
				ALFREDO  
		I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm 
		going to tell you a story. 
			(And he squeezes 
			SALVATORE'S shoulder. It's 
			the signal for taking a 
			rest. They sit in a 
			doorway. ALFREDO starts 
			telling his story, and his 
			way of speaking is 
			hypnotic, magical. With 
			those eyes lost in empty 
			space, it's as if his 
			thoughts and his words 
			came in from some other 
			dimension, mysterious, 
			hidden...) 
		Once upon a time a king gave a feast 
		and there were all the most beautiful 
		princesses of the realm. Basta, one 
		of the guards, saw the king's 
		daughter: she was the loveliest of 
		all! And he immediately fell in love 
		with her. But what could a poor 
		soldier do compared with a king's 
		daughter?!...One day he managed 
		to meet her and told her he couldn't 
		live without her. The princess was so 
		struck by the depth of his feeling 
		that she said to the soldier  'If you 
		will wait a hundred days and a 
		hundred nights beneath my balcony, 
		then in the end I'll be yours.' 
		Christ, the soldier ran off there and 
		waited! One day, two days, 
		ten, twenty...Every night she looked 
		out of her window, but he never 
		budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never 
		budged! The birds shat on him and the 
		bees ate him alive! After ninety 
		nights he was gaunt and pale and 
		tears streamed from his eyes but he 
		couldn't hold them back. He didn't 
		even have the strength to sleep any 
		more. The princess kept watch...And 
		on the ninety-ninth night, the 
		soldier got up, picked up his chair 
		and left!
	
				SALVATORE  
		No! You mean right at the end? 
			(SALVATORE is amazed, 
			dumbfounded; that ending 
			has made a deep 
			impression. They 
			start walking again.)
				ALFREDO  
		That's right, Toto, right at the end? 
		And don't ask me what it means. If 
		you figure it out, let me know...
	
				SALVATORE  
		I'll be damned'
	
	6I:CHURCH.INT.EVENING
	
	Before the high altar, the Virgin Mary in tears clutches three spikes inher 
	hand. And beside her is another statue  Christ descended from the
	cross. MEN and WOMEN stand in line to kiss Christ's wounds. Many people are 
	sitting between the pews. SALVATORE helps ALFREDO take a seat, and at that 
	moment catches sight at the far end of ELENA on her way to the confessional. 
	
	She kneels down on one side, just as FATHER ADELFIO comes out of the middle 
	booth and goes to the altar to say something to the sacristan. SALVATORE'S eyes 
	light up. He has had a brainstorm. 
	
	He leans over and whispers something into ALFREDO's ear. ALFREDO nods his head. 
	SALVATORE is so happy that he gives him a pat on the cheek, like a caress. Then 
	he hurries over to the PRIEST. Says something in a low voice, gesticulates with 
	some agitation, points to the pew where ALFREDO is sitting. The PRIEST tries to 
	say he can't now, but SALVATORE insists, and wins. The PRIEST goes over to 
	ALFREDO, leans over. 
	
				PRIEST  
		What is it, Alfredo? Right now, of 
		all times! 
	
				ALFREDO  
			(In a grave voice) 
		Father Adelfio, I have a very serious 
		doubt that is torturing my soul. And 
		you've got to help me, because I've 
		lost all peace of mind...
	
	SALVATORE watches from a distance. He sees the PRIEST put on an alarmed 
	expression and then sit down beside ALFREDO. Everything's ready. He creeps over 
	to the confessional. ELENA is there, kneeling down waiting for the PRIEST to 
	arrive. In an instant, without anyone noticing, SALVATORE pops inside the 
	confessional. He shuts the little door below and draws the purple curtain. On 
	the other side of grille, only a few inches away, those eyes that keep him awake 
	all night. 
	
				ELENA  
		Father, I have sinned...
	
				SALVATORE  
			(In a low voice) 
		We'll talk about that later. 
	
				ELENA  
			(Surprised) 
		But...who...
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Interrupting her) 
		Sssssh, Be quiet, pretend 
		everything's normal. I'm Salvatore. 
	
	ELENA'S eyes pop in amazement.
	
				ELENA  
		What are you doing here?
	
	Meanwhile ALFREDO and the PRIEST continue their unusual and animated discussion. 
	The PRIEST is appalled, crosses himself. 
	
				PRIEST  
		But Alfredo, what you're saying is 
		horrifying! 
	
				ALFREDO  
		I know. But take the-miracle of the 
		loaves and fishes, for example! I 
		think about it a lot...How is it 
		possible for...
	
	In the confessional, the whispered conversation between SALVATORE and ELENA 
	continues.
	
				ELENA  
			(Annoyed) 
		There was a terrible rumpus at home. 
		My mother told my father. And how 
		could you have mistaken my voice?!
	
	SALVATORE is mortified, on tenterhooks, keeps an eye on ALFREDO and the PRIEST 
	through a crack in the curtain.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Forgive me, Elena. It was stupid of 
		me. But I had to talk to you. 
	
	She looks up at him and her eyes are even more beautiful in the candlelight. 
	This time SALVATORE finds the courage to speak to her calmly, with 
	determination. That grille probably helps him, allows him to see without being 
	seen.
	
				SALVATORE  
		You're so beautiful, Elena...That's 
		what I wanted to tell you. When I 
		meet you, I can't put two words 
		together because...you give me the 
		shivers. I don't know what you do in 
		these situations, what you're 
		supposed to say. It's the first time. 
		But I think I'm in love with you. 
	
	ELENA gazes through the grille at the two shining specks of his eyes. She is 
	bewildered by that flood of passion. At that moment, an OLD WOMAN kneels down on 
	the other side of the confessional and her face appears behind the grille.
	
				OLD WOMAN  
		Father, I have sinned...
			(SALVATORE turns lo her, 
			instinctively.)
	
				SALVATORE  
		I absolve you in the name of the 
		Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. 
		Go in peace, my daughter. 
			(And he slams the panel 
			shut in her face. ELENA is 
			barely able to control her 
			laughter.) 
		When you laugh, you're even more 
		beautiful. 
	
	She pulls herself together again and puts on a serious, but tender look.
	
				ELENA  
		Salvatore, it's awfully sweet of you. 
		And even though I don't know you, I 
		like you. But...I'm not in love with 
		you. 
	
	For SALVATORE, it's as if a knife had plunged straight into his heart. He sits 
	there gazing into her eyes, at the beauty mark on her lip, without moving. Then 
	through the crack sees ALFREDO and the PRIEST conversing nervously, God knows 
	what they're saying. And he turns back to her.
	
				SALVATORE  
		I don't care. I'll wait.
	
				ELENA  
		For what?
	
				SALVATORE  
		For you to fall in love with me too. 
		Listen carefully. Every night, when I 
		get off work, I'll come and wait 
		beneath your window. Every night. 
		When you change your mind, open your 
		window. That's all. I'll 
		understand...
	
	He smiles at her. She is upset by those exaggerated words, but also intrigued.
	
	The PRIEST has meanwhile solved the problem that ALFREDO has made up as an 
	excuse.
	
				PRIEST  
			(Exhausted) 
		You understand now? You see it 
		clearly?
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Hypocritically) 
		Oh yes, father. Now everything's 
		clear.
	
				PRIEST  
		And the next time don't go around 
		saying such heresy. You survived the 
		fire at the movie house. But no one 
		can save you from the fire of Hell!
	
	62:SQUARE AND ELENA'S HOUSE. EXT. NIGHT
	
	Sweet poignant music accompanies SALVATORE's long waits beneath the window of 
	ELENA'S room... A warm early summer night. The last spectators wander off into 
	the streets. The VILLAGE IDIOT makes his rounds of the square.
	
	SALVATORE is beneath her window. He waits. The shutters are open,
	but not the windows with the curtains. ELENA peers at him through a
	dark crack...
	
						Fade to:
	
	A rainy night. SALVATORE is back there again. Determined,
	headstrong. A dog keeps him company, taking shelter under an
	overhanging roof. The window is shut...
	
						Fade to:
	
	SALVATORE'S hand adds another check to an endless row of checks on
	the calendar. A check a day...
	
						Fade to:
	
	Another night. Wind. The window is still shut. SALVATORE's eyes are
	the eyes of a lovesick man prepared to face the hardest battles, just to
	win, just to conquer his loved one. She peeks at him through the crack,
	but he can't see her...
	
						Fade to:
	
	The paces of the calendar are covered with checks. Several months
	have gone by. SALVATORE adds a check on the last page, on 30 December. Tomorrow 
	night will be...New Year's Eve. The streets are empty. Loud merry voices can be 
	heard coming from the houses. Old discarded objects hail down from balconies. 
	Firecrackers explode here and there. SALVATORE is there in the same old place, 
	as usual. The shutters are open, but not the windows, and all is darkness 
	inside. SALVATORE is wrapped in a large overcoat and stamps his feet to keep 
	warm...
	
	63:SALVATORES HOUSE. GIANCALDO. INT. NIGHT
	
	Toasts are being prepared in SALVATORE's house. MARIA is there
	with her daughter, LIA, then ALFREDO with his wife, ANNA.
	SALVATORE is the only one missing for the "family" to be complete.
	The bottle of spumante and the Christmas cake are ready. The radio is
	on with the New Year's Eve programme.
	
				MARIA  
			(Nervously) 
		But why hasn't Toto shown up? The 
		movie house is closed at this hour!
	
	ALFREDO has a know-all look. He tries to put her mind at rest.
	
				ALFREDO  
		He had to do something for me...
	
	Over the radio, music and merrymaking
	
	64:ELENA'S HOUSE.EXT.NIGHT 
	
	More sounds of merrymaking, coming from ELENA's house. SALVATORE listens to it, 
	sees the shadows of her parents and relatives, maybe even hers, ready to 
	celebrate, welcome in the New Year. But further on, that window remains dark and 
	shut. SALVATORE gazes at it again. 
	
	There is a new look in his eyes, like a gleam of hope. Maybe it's the 
	specialness of that night, maybe it's the fire crackers, the festive atmosphere, 
	but something tells him that's going to be the right night. The night when 
	she'll open her window. In fact, a light suddenly goes on in the room. 
	SALVATORE'S eyes sparkle, have already taken on the hue of victory. 
	
	The window is pulled open, and his heart starts pounding like a drum. The music 
	reaches its climax. Two hands come out. SALVATORE shuts his eyes for a moment, 
	to hold back the flood of feeling. He opens them again and sees......The hands 
	reach out and take hold of the shutters and pull them shut. The light goes out. 
	It is midnight. An echoing voice does the countdown.
	
				RADIO VOICE  
		Six, five, four, three, two, one, 
		zero! Happy New Year! Happy New Year! 
	
	And a roar of voices, shouts, explosions, fills the air. SALVATORE has remained 
	standing there immobile, speechless. Disappointed. Defeated.
	
	65  SALVATORE S HOUSE. GIANCALDO. INT. NIGHT
	
	At his house, glasses are about to be raised. There is a strange, tense 
	merriment. MARIA is unable to conceal her concern, her presentiment. She glances 
	at the door, hoping to see SALVATORE appear.
	
				ALFREDO  
			(To Maria) 
		There's nothing to worry about. He's 
		probably with his friends. 
			(To all) 
		Let's toast!
	
				EVERYBODY  
			(Toasting) 
		Here's to you! Here's to you! Happy 
		New Year!
	
				MARIA  
		For Toto too, here's to you!! Happy 
		New Year! !
	
	Everybody echoes MARIA'S toast...
	
	66  ELENA S HOUSE. EXT. NIGHT 
	
	But SALVATORE is not happy in these first few minutes of the New Year. He feels 
	hurt, humiliated, rejected. He walks off amidst the old discarded objects flying 
	down from the terraces. That was his last night. He's not showing up beneath 
	that balcony any more.
	
	67  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. AFTERNOON 
	
	Outside there is a violent thunderstorm. The pounding of the rain and the 
	rumbling of the thunder drown out the sound-track of the film being shown. Two 
	buckets are on the floor to catch the water dripping through the roof. SALVATORE 
	is alone. For the first time he feels he hates the profession he's got into. He 
	is tearing up the calendar where he checked off the nights he spent waiting for 
	ELENA. He tears it into a thousand pieces, as if trying to wipe out the traces 
	of his grief. He is so absorbed in his thoughts that he doesn't notice that 
	someone has appeared at the top of the stairs and quietly entered the room. And 
	now stands there watching him in silence. The thunder is deafening. That someone 
	is ELENA. She comes up behind him, realizes he is thinking 
	about her. Whispers. 
	
				ELENA  
		Salvatore...
	
	Loud passionate music is heard on the monitor. SALVATORE turns and sees her as 
	if in a dream. It is a sudden blow to the heart. The look on her face is 
	wonderfully sweet, the look of somebody who knows she is madly loved and 
	who now realizes at last that she is in love too. For SALVATORE it is an 
	overwhelming, almost unbearable moment...A long passionate embrace that is 
	never-ending. They are happy, cling to each other never to leave each other 
	again. 
	
	They spin around, end up against the wall where strips of film are hanging, the 
	first-part endings and the trailers. Another intense look, their eyes 
	locked...And it is their first kiss. A kiss at first timid, hesitant, almost 
	clumsy, and then becomes resolute, poignant. Amidst the film strips dangling 
	around and touching their young faces. Meanwhile the film has finished, the 
	projector turns uselessly...Down below the screen is blank, the audience 
	whistles...But SALVATORE hears nothing, neither the whistles nor the useless 
	whirring of the reels in the projector. All he hears is her breathing, an he 
	feels is the warmth of her 
	skin.
	
	68  VARIOUS SETTINGS. INT/EXT. DAY
	
	The happiest, most vivid moments SALVATORE and ELENA spend
	together:
	
	A country outing. They eat a lavish salad using the flat branches of the
	prickly pear for plates.
	
	A chase through an endless field of wheat.
	In the projection booth. A cake with seventeen lighted candles.
	SALVATORE and ELENA blow them out together. And then a kiss.
	
	69  ROAD AT THE EDGE OF TOWN.EXT. DAY
	
	SALVATORE is driving an old beaten-up Balilla he bought from a
	car-wrecker. ELENA sits beside him, having the time of her life. They
	roar with laughter. The car jolts, moves by fits and starts, jarred by the
	holes in the road, and besides SALVATORE is not such a hot driver. She
	fondles him.
	
				ELENA  
			(Ironically) 
		You have a great future as a driver. 
		If they don't arrest you first!!
	
				SALVATORE  
		That's nothing to do with it, it's 
		the car that's still being run in...
	
	He has barely finished the last sentence when the car gives a
	sudden violent shudder. A sharp report. A cloud of white smoke issues from the 
	motor. And the Balilla stops dead in its tracks. ELENA and SALVATORE cannot 
	smother their wild laughter. They embrace. 
	
				ELENA  
		SO now how do we get home? 
	
						Cut to:  
	
	The two of them are standing beside the empty road, looking bored, as they have 
	already been waiting a long time for someone to go by, a car, a wagon. When all 
	at once a car comes around the bend, heading for town. SALVATORE and ELENA flag 
	it down. 
	
	The DRIVER slows down. The back door opens, a MAN gets out. An alarmed and 
	startled look comes over ELENA's face  that man is her FATHER. She sees him 
	stride over in a rage. 
	
	He has almost reached SALVATORE, who tries lo be polite, to make the best of the 
	situation. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Hello, Dr Mendola...Hem...
	
	ELENA buries her face in her hands, so as not to see...
	
	70  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. EVENING
	
	SALVATORE has a bruise on his cheek and two Band-aids on his face.
	He got himself a good thrashing, and then some. The house is jammed,
	as on the great occasions. Curiosity is written all over the faces of the
	audience. But what they're seeing is not a film, but an instalment of
	Double or Nothing. SALVATORE is standing by a teleprojector which
	has been set up in the central aisle of the balcony. It is a machine that
	makes it possible to project television show on the screen. ALFREDO is
	sitting beside him.
	
				ALFREDO  
			(In a low voice) 
		Toto, are you pulling my leg or 
		something? How is it possible to see 
		this television without film?
	
				SALVATORE  
		Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any. 
		And if you buy a television set, you 
		can watch it at home, without any 
		fuss...
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Sceptically) 
		Could be...But I don't like this
		business. It smells fishy to me.
	
	ELENA is sitting in one corner of the balcony with her parents. Sitting beside 
	her FATHER is the owner of the movie house, SPACCAFICO, who thanks him.
	
				SPACCAFICO  
			(In a low voice) 
		You see what a bright idea, Dr 
		Mendola? But without the bank loan 
		how could I have bought the machine? 
		If we don't get organized around 
		here, in this day and age, we'll meet 
		the same end as the Punch and Judy 
		shows! 
	
	ELENA is not very interested in the TV show. She sneaks a look at SALVATORE. 
	From the looks on their faces, it is clear that things are not going very well. 
	He gives her a nod, as if to say he wants to speak to her and that she should 
	figure out some way! ELENA leans over to her MOTHER, whispers something into her 
	ear.
	
	7I  CINEMA PARADISO. TOILET. INT. EVENING
	
	ELENA's MOTHER stands waiting in front of the women's toilet,
	gazing at Mike Bongiorno emceeing the TV show in the distance.
	
	Inside the toilet, ELENA is standing on the toilet seat whispering to
	SALVATORE, who is standing on the 20ilet seat of the men's toilet.
	
	Their eyes are barely able to peek over the flush tank which they have
	uncovered. ELENA is worried.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Could it be your father doesn't like 
		the work I do...That my family's too 
		poor...Is that it? 
	
	She gives a nod of the head, but only faintly, so as no2 to wound his 
	vulnerability. SALVATORE sighs.
	
				ELENA'S MOTHER  
			(Off-screen) 
		Elena!
	
				ELENA  
		All right! ! 
			(To Salvatore, in a 
			whisper) 
		For the moment it's impossible to see 
		each other...As soon as school is 
		out, we're going to go stay with 
		friends in Tuscany. We'll be there 
		all summer...Maybe if you came up, 
		we could meet in secret...
				SALVATORE  
			(Crestfallen) 
		But we're opening the outdoor movie 
		theatre this summer. What will I do 
		all this time without seeing you?!
				
				ELENA  
		I'll write to you every day. Don't 
		worry. I love you. The summer'll be 
		over and I'll be back...
	
	They reach out to kiss each other. Who knows when they'll be able to see each 
	other again?
	
				ELENA'S MOTHER  
			(Off-screen) 
		Elena! 
	
	ELENA climbs down, pulls the chain and walks off, leaving SALVATORE standing 
	there on the toilet seat.
	
	Summer has come. A bevy of barefoot children chase after the carts carrying the 
	carters' families to the beach to go swimming. SALVATORE, helped by the USHER, 
	has finished loading the disassembled projector on to a wagon in order to carry 
	it to the outdoor movie house. The USHER has hung a sign on the Cinema Paradiso 
	to the effect that 'Showings to continue at the Imperia Arena', and now climbs 
	into the wagon. 
	
	The horse moves off slowly and the monotonous clatter of its hoofs reminds 
	SALVATORE that the summer is going to be long this year, longer than ever. And 
	he leans on the projector that totters and lurches from the jolting of the 
	wheels. A cart carrying a cheerful and noisy family pulls up alongside the 
	wagon. There are the MEN from the slaughter-house. They recognize SALVATORE. 
	
				SLAUGHTER-HOUSE MAN 
		Well, look who's here!! Cecil B. De 
		Mille! Hey, Toto!! When are you 
		coming to shoot another film?!? 
	
	And they laugh, with their gaping toothless mouths. SALVATORE doesn't feel like 
	joking, not even like answering. He looks away, so as not to see their leers. He 
	wants to be by himself. 
	
	73  BEACH AND IMPERIA ARENA. EXT. DAY 
	
	
	The beach is almost deserted, dotted here and there with groups of bathers. The 
	carts and horses are scattered in the sand, near the Imperia Arena, where some 
	WORKMEN are putting on the finishing touches for the new opening. The wagon 
	arrives and SALVATORE and the USHER unload the projector.
	
	74  BEACH. IMPERIA ARENA. PROJECTION BOOTH. EXT.EVENING
	
	A sultry evening. The jacklights of the octopus fishers twinkle on the
	dark horizon. The sound-track of a comic film reverberates over the sea,
	the laughter of the audience mingles with the sound of the shallow waves
	breaking on the rocks. A group of LITTLE BOYS in a boat pulls away
	from shore. They join some more boats standing still in the water, all of
	them crammed with LITTLE BOYS all looking in the same direction...
	towards the screen of the open-air movie at the water's edge. There is a
	funny scene.
	
				LITTLE BOYS  
		All seats are sold out! Free entrance 
		and payment on the way out!! Sssssh!!
	
	And they guffaw noisily. Their laughter is echoed by more
	laughter, in the distance...
	
	...the laughter of the Arena audience, scattered among the
	metal chairs. By dint of laughing, the people in one of the rows
	of chairs tip over backwards. Screams, laughs, whistles.
	The projection booth has a door at the back with stairs leading
	down to the rocks. SALVATORE is sitting on the ground, bare
	chested, tired and sticky with sweat. He is reading a letter from
	ELENA. He is so engrossed the words can almost be read on his
	face.
	
				ELENA'S VOICE  
			(Off-screen) 
		Salvatore, my darling, here the days 
		never end. I find your name 
		everywhere if I read a book, do a 
		crossword puzzle, thumb through a 
		newspaper...You're always before my 
		eyes. Today I've got some rather bad 
		news. At the end of October we're 
		moving to the city where I'll attend 
		the University. It'll be hard to see 
		each other every day. But don't 
		worry, whenever I can get away I'll 
		always come running to you, to the 
		Cinema Paradiso.
	
	On the Arena screen, with its potted plants and palm trees, a
	very funny scene is being shown. The audience again bursts into
	wild laughter. And the audience of LITTLE BOYS in the boats also laugh. One
	of them, laughing himself to tears, loses his balance and falls
	into the water. The others howl with laughter. A voice rises up
	out of the carousel of boats.
	
				URCHIN  
		Fuck me! I've caught an octopus! An 
		oooooctopus!
	
						FADE
	
	75  VARIOUS SETTINGS. INT/EXT. DAY 
	
	The August sun is blazing hot. People are forced to stay inside when the sirocco 
	blows. The streets are empty. And there is a strange silence. Nothing can be 
	heard except far in the distance, from somewhere in the country, the love song 
	of some carter...SALVATORE hears it too, stretched out on the floor of his 
	room, his eyes fixed on the ceiling where flies buzz around nervously. The 
	MAILMAN comes down the street on his bicycle, rides up to SALVATORE and hands 
	him a letter...Sitting in the shade of a white wall, SALVATORE reads the 
	letter. Next to him, the dog that kept him company at night, beneath ELENA's 
	window. He gazes up at him as if looking for news of her.
	
	76:ARENA IMPERIA. PROJECTION BOOTH. EXT/INT.EVENING
	
	The Arena is crowded with sun-burnt faces. On screen, scenes from
	Ulysses. On a shelf in the projection booth, there is an enormous pack of 
	letters. SALVATORE is worn out. The waiting has destroyed him. He looks
	like a madman. As he winds up one of the parts of the film, he repeats
	her name obsessively, under his breath.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Elena...Elena...Elena...
	
	Now he is sitting outside on the back steps, a few yards from the
	sea. There is a breeze this evening, the waves are rather high and
	the boats of 'gate-crashers' can be seen out in the water, rolling
	fitfully but not dangerously. SALVATORE stretches out, gazes up
	at the inky sky and talks to himself, just like a madman,
	whispering...
	
				SALVATORE  
		When will this shitty summer be over? 
			(Half shutting his eyes) 
		In a film it'd already be finished...
			(Smiling)
		...Fade-out and cut to a nice 
		thunderstorm!!! Huh? that'd be 
		perfect!
	
	A clap of thunder explodes in the air. Loud, rumbling. SALVATORE'S eyes pop 
	open. The Arena audience looks up in alarm at the sky...The 'gate-crashers' in 
	the boats also look up and see a streak of lightning ushering in another clap of 
	thunder. One of those storms is building up that ruins late summer 
	nights. SALVATORE gives a contented smile as the cloudburst pours down 
	violently, suddenly... The Arena audience scatters with a howl and scurries 
	over to the overhanging roofs of the projection booth, to take shelter and to go
	on watching the film despite the rain...
	
	The LITTLE BOYS in the boats quickly pull tarpaulins over their
	heads...But SALVATORE does not get up. He lets the rain fall on him,
	goes on laughing, incredulous and stunned as if a real miracle had
	taken place. And as he shuts his eyes and lifts his head up, to
	catch more rain on his face, and gives himself up to that marvellous feeling of 
	joy, a mouth comes to rest passionately on his lips it is ELENA. SALVATORE opens 
	his eyes in utter amazement, it seems like a vision, another hallucination 
	created by the rain...Instead no, it is really her! 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Elena!...But when...
	
				ELENA  
		I got back today. You can't imagine 
		the excuses I had to make up to be 
		here...
	
	SALVATORE's lips interrupt her. It is an intense, a stupendous kiss. They've 
	probably never been so happy as they are at that moment. They cling to each 
	other as the rain goes on streaming over their bodies, mingling her hair with 
	his, binding them ever closer.
	
	77  CINEMA PARADISO. ENTRANCE. EXT. DAY
	
	Autumn has arrived. In the streets, the PEASANTS prepare the barrels
	for preserving the grape must. ALFREDO is sitting in front of the Cinema 
	Paradiso with SPACCAFICO and the USHER. It is a quiet moment, they chat, while 
	the humming of the projector and the sound track of the film can be heard 
	through the window of the booth. The MAILMAN stops and hands SPACCAFICO a folded 
	sheet of paper.
	
				MAILMAN  
		Don Ciccio, this is for Toto. Give it 
		him...
			(And he pedals off on his 
			bicycle.)
	
				ALFREDO  
		What is it?
	
	SPACCAFICO unfolds it, reads it, claps his hands on his head, in alarm.
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Holy blood of Judas! Now what am I 
		going to do??!
	
	78  UNIVERSITY. EXT. DAY
	
	ELENA is waiting near the University. She paces nervously back and
	forth. Glances at her watch. He's late. She looks around in all
	directions and sees him at last. He comes running up to her. They
	embrace...
	
				ELENA  
		So what'd they say?
	
				SALVATORE  
		The army says that, as a war orphan, 
		I don't have to serve in the 
		military, but nothing can be done. 
		It's a bureaucratic error. I have to 
		leave. Day after tomorrow morning. 
		They're sending me to Rome. But 
		they'll discharge me ten days later. 
		Let's go...
	
	He takes her hand, turns to go to a café. ELENA holds back. She has caught sight 
	of her FATHER's car approaching. ELENA turns to look and in a faint voice 
	reveals the reason for her nervousness.
	
				ELENA  
		No, Salvatore. You'd better go. It's 
		my father.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Good, this way we can finally talk. 
		I'll convince him this time.
	
				ELENA  
		He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He 
		has other plans for me.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Who?
	
				ELENA  
		The son of one of his colleagues. 
		Don't act that way. We'll talk about 
		it later. Wait for me Thursday at the 
		Cinema Paradiso. I'll be coming with 
		the five o'clock bus. 
	
	SALVATORE looks with longing as ELENA drives away with her father. 
	ELENA gives him a meaningful look through the window. SALVATORE returns the 
	look, but stands there motionless, with a grim expression, like someone who 
	knows how to take the treacherous blows of life. The car drives off and with it 
	ELENA. Their eyes hang on the same thread. The thread of hope and now of fear.
	
	79  CINEMA PARADISO. ENTRANCE. EXT. MORNING
	
	The poster of Il Grido hangs on the billboard outside the theatre.
	SPACCAFICO replaces 'THURSDAY' with a 'TODAY' sticker. The
	CHARWOMAN is washing the floor of the lobby. SPACCAFICO shouts
	up to SALVATORE, who is in the projectionist's booth. SPACCAFICIO
	says that tomorrow he'll be leaving and today is his last day on the job,
	and he's sorry.
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Toto, this is no film for the common 
		herd. One day'll be more than 
		enough...So tonight, please set up 
		tomorrow's film, so the projectionist 
		who is coming will find it ready.
	
				SALVATORE  
		OK...
	
	SPACCAFICO understands SALVATORE's sadness.
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Cheer up, Toto. I'll be here waiting 
		for you. No one's taking your job 
		away from you. Don't worry!
	
	80  SQUARE AND PROJECTION BOOTH, CINEMA PARADISO. EXT/INT. DAY
	
	The bus has pulled into the square but among the people getting out
	there is no sign of ELENA. SALVATORE stands nervously up in the window of the 
	projection booth, glances at his watch. It's already five-thirty and she hasn't 
	come. He checks the projector. The first part has just begun and the reel is 
	full of film.
	
	The first part is now about to finish, the reel is almost empty, and ELENA still 
	isn't there. SALVATORE is extremely nervous, worried, mortified by his meeting 
	with her FATHER. 
	He sees ELENA's face pulling away in the car. Thinks back over her 
	terrible confession. He paces back and forth, as if he were in a prison cell, 
	thinking up solutions...The stair light finally goes on; there she is SALVATORE 
	dashes over and down the stairs to meet her. He comes down the final turn of the 
	spiral staircase and finds himself face to face with ALFREDO, who is slowly 
	making his way up with the help of his cane. SALVATORE freezes to the spot. 
	ALFREDO senses his disappointment. 
	
				ALFREDO  
		You weren't expecting me? 
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Nervously) 
		No, Alfredo, I was coming to help 
		you...
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Smiling) 
		You were expecting her? Huh? 
			(SALVATORE doesn't answer. 
			He's too worried, too 
			upset. ALFREDO climbs 
			another step, whispering.)
		...It's a nasty business waiting by 
		yourself. In company it's better. 
		No?...Then I'll leave. 
	
	As usual ALFREDO'S sweetness comforts SALVATORE, indeed suddenly gives him a 
	bold idea, one that quiets his nervousness. He puts a hand on ALFREDO'S 
	shoulder.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Alfredo, I need your help!
	
	8I  ROAD TO THE CITY. EXT. AFTERNOON 
	
	The Balilla speeds as fast as it can down the road to the city, where ELENA s 
	family has gone to live. SALVATORE drives along in a state of agitation. The 
	idea of having to leave without seeing ELENA is his obsession. An obsession he 
	refuses to accept...
	
	82 CINEMA PARADISO.PROJECTION BOOTH.INT.AFTERNOON
	
	The second part has begun, the reel is full. For the first time in many
	years, ALFREDO is alone in the booth, sitting in front of the projector,
	and he feels helpless. Not only because he's blind, but also because
	there is nothing he can do for SALVATORE. A strange agitation comes over him, as 
	if he were experiencing the same anxiety troubling his 'Toto' at that moment. 
	Meanwhile, the film roll on and with it, time, minutes...
	
	83  CITY.EXT.AFTERNOON
	
	SALVATORE has already reached the city. He slows down at the bus
	terminus. Looks at the people waiting, but she is not there...
	He asks several girls in front of the University. But they haven't seen
	her...
	
	He phones from a phone booth. But nobody answers. His self-control
	is about to give way to desperation...
	
	84  CINEMA PARADISO.PROJECTION BOOTH.INT.AFTERNOON
	
	On the reel there is less film. Like an hourglass with the sand trickling
	through...
	
	85:ELENAS HOUSE IN THE CITY.EXT/INT.AFTERNOON 
	
	SALVATORE comes streaking up in front of her house. He screeches to a stop, 
	dashes out like greased lightning. His nerves are tense, a slight tremor runs 
	through his whole body. He rings the bell, but nobody answers. A MAN who lives 
	in the building opens the front door and comes out. 
	
	SALVATORE seizes the chance and climbs up to the third floor. He pounds on the 
	door furiously, almost cracking his knuckles. But all to no avail; there is 
	nobody at home. He shrieks, panic stricken. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Open up! Open up! Elenaaa! 
	
	And in fact, there is somebody inside: ELENA's MOTHER. She sits there immobile, 
	without a word. 
	
	The pounding on the door reverberates in the room, but she does not budge, 
	determined to ignore that desperate message.
	
	86:CINEMA PARADISO.PROJECTION BOOTH.INT.AFTERNOON
	
	The reel spins faster. The film is almost ended. By now there is very
	little time...
	
	87  ROAD TO THE VILLAGE. EXT. SUNDOWN 
	
	And SALVATORE is on his way home, defeated. Be drives as fast as he can. Be is 
	in a terrible state, can't figure out what's happened. Can't explain it. And 
	that's what hurts. 
	
	88  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. SUNDOWN
	
	The words 'THE END' appear on the screen...and the film runs out, leaving the 
	projector turning uselessly. ALFREDO is alarmed. He can hear that the film is 
	finished, but doesn't know where to begin. He gropes around. He's scared. Like a 
	little boy calls his mother when he's lost in a crowd, so old ALFREDO calls 
	SALVATORE. 
	
				ALFREDO  
		TotooooO! TotooooO! 
	
	The few people down in the audience start whistling and complaining about the 
	film they haven't understood. 
	
				SPECTATORS  
		Lights! Christ, what a piece of 
		crap!! We want OUT money back!!! 
		Heeeeey!! Bandits!! 
	
	Others are shouting that they like the film.
	
	89  CINEMA PARADISO. ENTRANCE. EXT. SUNDOWN 
	
	The Balilla screeches to a stop in front of the theatre. SALVATORE darts out and 
	runs to the stairs...
	
	90  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. SUNDOWN 
	
	SALVATORE turns the lights on in the theatre and turns off the projector, trying 
	to calm down ALFREDO, who has got to his feet, frightened. 
	
				ALFREDO  
		But where'd you go, Toto?!! 
	
				SALVATORE  
		I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy! 
			(And he folds him into his 
			arms, like calming down a 
			little boy who has had a 
			nightmare. Be whispers, 
			still out of breath:) 
		Sit down, sit down...
			(ALFREDO quiets down as 
			SALVATORE lowers him into 
			a chair, and asks him the 
			only question upon which 
			his last hope depends.) 
		Did she come? 
	
				ALFREDO  
		No, nobody came. 
			(And he embraces him, 
			almost as if to comfort 
			him in his great 
			disappointment.)
	
	For SALVATORE it's really the end: she's not coming. Tomorrow he'll be leaving 
	without having seen her again. 
	
	SALVATORE'S hands remove the photographs of Amedeo Nazzari and of ELENA from the 
	wall, slip them into one of his pockets. 
	
	Now the hands open the metal containers of tomorrow's film, take . 
	out the reels to set them up, pick up the receipt - his last before leaving - 
	and with the same mechanical gesture, hang it on a nail, as usual.
	
	91  ROME. VARIOUS SETTINGS, MILITARY LIFE. EXT/ INT. DAY/NIGHT 
	
	A wild frenetic sequence, set to the pace of military life...SALVATORE, in 
	uniform with close-cropped hair, answers his superior, shouts: 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Radio Operator Di Vita Salvatore! 
		Third Battalion, Ninth Company, 
		sir!!!
	
	Target practice. SALVATORE fires all the shots in the cartridge, one after the 
	other... 
	
	A SECOND LIEUTENANT barks out a march rhythm in the blazing sun. 
	
				SECOND LIEUTENANT  
		One, two, one, two!! Attention! Left 
		march! 
	
	SALVATORE sneaks out of line, goes over and slips a letter into 
	the mailbox and hurries back to his place.
	
	On one of the public phones in a square of Rome, SALVATORE is phoning ELENA. 
	Nobody answers. He slams down the receiver, as the line of SOLDIERS waits its 
	turn...
	
	Night-time. A large plastic bag full of water. A thud. SALVATORE wakes up with a 
	start in a lake of ice water. He lets out a terrified shriek as the others 
	laugh, protected by the dark. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Aaaaaaah! Heeeeeelp!! 
	
	In the large dormitory, the SERGEANT is handing out the mail. He 
	throws a pile of letters on SALVATORE'S bunk. They are his letters to ELENA, 
	stamped 'ADDRESS UNKNOWN'.
	
	Mess duty. SALVATORE is washing Up, in a sea of water and grease.
	He rimes a pan full of tomato sauce with a tap hose. A spurt of red water 
	splatters him in the face. 
	
	A training run. Another letter which SALVATORE drops into the mailbox...
	
	A cold, rainy night. SALVATORE stands stiff as a poker in front of the 
	Ammunition depot. It is his first guard duty. Soaked to the skin, gazing wide-
	eyed into empty space. 
	
	COLONEL'S office. 
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Aggressively) 
		Colonel, I was supposed to spend ten 
		days here and it's been about a year, 
		and I haven't ever gone borne. I'd 
		like a furlough, at least! 
	
	SALVATORE is in the guardhouse. A cold, dark, filthy cell. His nerves start to 
	give way. He bows his head in despair. 
	
	Hospital. SALVATORE is exhausted, run-down. The night-stand is jammed with 
	medicines. He lies in bed without moving, staring off into empty space, and 
	repeats obsessively in a low voice, as if talking to himself. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Elena...Elena...Elena...
			(He has touched the 
			extreme of suffering, a 
			young man who has 
			been denied love and 
			affection, his rights, 
			freedom. A NURSE comes 
			up.) 
	
				NURSE  
		Di Vita Salvatore, get ready, your 
		discharge has come through.
	
	SALVATORE registers this information with his eyes and nods absently.
	
	92  GIANCALDO. SQUARE AND STREETS. EXT. DAY 
	
	The bus disappears around the corner leaving SALVATORE standing there alone. It 
	is a blazing hot day. The sirocco wind blows the yellow dust in all directions. 
	The square is empty, the billboard in front of the closed movie house announces 
	a Western. SALVATORE puts his suitcase on the ground, looks around. Everything 
	exactly the same, immobile. Only one new feature  in the cafe there's a jukebox 
	playing 'Estate' sung by Milva. 
	
	SALVATORE turns towards the Cinema Paradiso. The projectionist is at the 
	window of the booth, smoking a cigarette. Who knows who he is, where he came 
	from. A hot flurry of dust. SALVATORE turns and sees a dog leaping around kim, 
	wagging its tail. It's the dog that kept him company during his nights beneath 
	the window. SALVATORE gives a start of joy, drops his suitcase and leans over to 
	stroke him. Then he hugs him, as if he were an old friend. 
	
	93  ALFREDO'S HOUSE. INT. AFTERNOON 
	
	SALVATORE goes to see ALFREDO. He is still in bed, has just woken up. He is glad 
	to hear his 'Toto'. He feels his forehead, his eyes and cheeks, as if to 'see' 
	him. 
	
				ALFREDO  
		You 're thinner...You can tell 
		you've not been treated well. 
			(As usual, you can't hide 
			anything from ALFREDO. 
			SALVATORE senses something 
			different in him that he 
			can't figure out, like 
			same wild restlessness 
			within). 
	
				SALVATORE  
		They tell me you never go out, never 
		talk to anybody. Why?
				
				ALFREDO  
		Toto, sooner or later there comes a 
		time when talking or keeping quiet is 
		the same thing. So it's better to 
		shut up. 
			(Changing his lone) 
		It's hot in here. Toto, take me to 
		the beach. 
	
	94  BEACH AND WATERFRONT. EXT. AFTERNOON 
	
	The sea is ruffled and the air is less sultry, easier to breathe. 
	SALVATORE and ALFREDO walk slowly along the waterfront. ALFREDO totters 
	slightly, holds on to SALVATORE, who is telling him something very funny. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		At the Christmas party the lieutenant 
		pinches a girl's ass. The girl turns 
		around: it's the daughter of the 
		commanding officer. The lieutenant is 
		scared to death and says: 'Miss, if 
		your heart is as hard as what I have 
		just touched, I'm done for! 
	
	And they roar with laughter. They look like two old school buddies telling each 
	other dirty jokes. They stop beside a low wall. ALFREDO knows that those laughs 
	are simply a way of uselessly dancing around the countless things that are 
	troubling SALVATORE. And he breaks the ice, while SALVATORE is still 
	laughing.
	
				ALFREDO  
			(Seriously) 
		Did you ever see her again? 
			(SALVATORE'S laughter dies 
			away, taken off-guard as 
			he is. Then he lights a 
			cigarette.)
	
				SALVATORE  
		No. And nobody knows where she is. 
	
				ALFREDO  
		It was probably meant to be like 
		this. Each of us has a star to 
		follow. So now what are you thinking 
		of doing? 
	
	It's a terrible question, and SALVATORE has no answer to it. In fact, would 
	rather not even talk about it. He changes his tone, as if he hadn't heard it, 
	laughs, trying again to ding to the funny jokes he heard during military 
	service.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Listen to this one...The commander 
		says to the sergeant: 'You 
		remember that windmill that used to 
		be there?' 'Yes, sir, I remember the 
		mill's gone but the wind's still 
		there!' 
			(And he bursts into 
			nervous laughter. But this 
			time ALFREDO remains cold, 
			unmoved, does not laugh 
			with him. SALVATORE 
			gradually falls silent. He 
			doesn't know what to say. 
			For the first time in his 
			life, he doesn't know what 
			goal to aim for, doesn't 
			know what to do. The cloud 
			of smoke wreaths his 
			nervous face, now he seems 
			to relax, whispers:) 
		You remember the story of the soldier 
		and the princess? 
			(ALFREDO nods his head.) 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Now I understand why the soldier went 
		away just before the end. That's 
		right, just one more night and the 
		princess would have been his. But 
		she, also, could not have kept her 
		promise. And...that would have been 
		terrible, he would have died from it. 
		So instead, for ninety-nine nights at 
		least he had lived with the illusion 
		that she was there waiting for him...
			(This time SALVATORE is 
			the one to explain 
			something to ALFREDO. And 
			ALFREDO realizes how 
			bitter his story is and, 
			above all, that the boy 
			standing there is no 
			longer a boy...) 
	
				ALFREDO  
		Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! 
		This land is cursed. 
			(They are now leaning 
			against a boat on the 
			beach. ALFREDO goes on 
			whispering his words.) 
		When you're here every day you feel 
		like you're at the center
		of the universe, it seems like 
		nothing ever changes. Then you go 
		away, one year, two...And when you 
		come back, everything's different. 
		The thread has broken. You don't 
		find those you were looking for, your 
		things no longer exist. Isn't that 
		the case?...You've got to go away a 
		long time, for many, many years, 
		before coming back and finding your 
		people again, the land where 
		you were born...But not now, it's 
		impossible. Now you're blinder than I 
		am.
			(Intense words, straight 
			from the heart, and 
			SALVATORE is spellbound. 
			He whispers with a smile:) 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Who said that? Gary Cooper, James 
		Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh? 
			(ALFREDO also gives a 
			gentle smile) 
	
				ALFREDO  
		No, Toto, nobody said it. I say it! 
		Life's not like you saw it in the 
		movies. Life...is harder. 
			(He lays his hand on 
			SALVATORE'S shoulder, 
			gives it a hard squeeze.) 
		Get out! Go back to Rome. You 're 
		young, the world is yours! And I'm 
		old...I don't want to hear you talk 
		any more, I want to hear talk about 
		you. 
	
	SALVATORE gives a shudder that runs through his very soul. The setting sun lies 
	colorless on the horizon.
	
	95  VARIOUS SETTINGS. EXT/INT. NIGHT 
	
	Night. The square is empty. SALVATORE is sitting on the church steps. 
	His head in his hands. He has to make a decision leave or stay. And why?... 
	'What decision will he make?' is the question that keeps ALFREDO awake, in his 
	hot dark bedroom...
	
	MARIA, his mother, also can't get to sleep. She knows, senses, that her son is 
	on the verge of an important turning-point. But what will he decide? What will 
	happen?...
	
	Also LIA, his sister, feels a strange, heavy tension in the air. And 
	doesn't sleep. She's probably wondering where SALVATORE is at that 
	hour... 
	
	He's sitting on the ground. But even if he were to go to bed he wouldn't 
	sleep. He rubs his face with his hand. The church bell chimes four a.m...
	
	ALMOST THIRTY YEARS LATER, another distant bell is chiming four a.m. And 
	SALVATORE is once again wide awake. He is thinking, with his hand on his face, 
	just like then. And the same decision to make: what to do? Stretched out beside 
	a sleeping WOMAN, he goes on staring at the window. Outside, the storm has 
	passed. The long memory has almost faded, only the sound of a train surfaces in 
	his mind...
	
	96  GIANCALDO RAILWAY STATION. EXT. DAY
	
	It's the train that THIRTY YEARS EARLIER had pulled into the station
	of his home town before leaving for Rome. SALVATORE hugs his 
	MOTHER and SISTER. The moment has come to say goodbye to  
	ALFREDO. The old man is deeply moved. A heart-rending trembling
	comes into his husky voice. 
	
				ALFREDO  
		Don't come back any more, don't think 
		about us, don't turn round, don't 
		write, don't give in to nostalgia. 
		Forget us all. If you can't hear it 
		and come back, don't come looking for 
		me, I won't let you into the house, 
		you understand? 
	
	They clasp each other tightly, as if they knew they wouldn't be meeting 
	again...
	
				SALVATORE  
		Thanks for all you've done for me. 
	
				ALFREDO  
		Whatever you do, love it like you 
		loved that projection booth of the 
		Paradiso when you were little...
			(The train moves now. 
			Hands wave in the air, 
			drawing further and 
			further away. The PRIEST 
			has arrived at the last 
			moment and waves goodbye 
			from the distance.)
	
				PRIEST  
			(Shouting) 
		Goodbye, TotooooooO!!! I got here too 
		late. What a shame! 
	
	The figure of ALFREDO and the others can no longer be distinguished. Only a 
	distant blur at the end of the track. 
	
	97  PUNTA RAISI AIRPORT. EXT. DAY 
	
	THIRTY YEARS LATER, a plane flies over Sicily. It lands on the 
	runway char seems to emerge from the sea and flatten out towards the slopes of 
	the dark mountains. Salvatore's face appears among the clouds reflected in one 
	of the plane windows. He has the tense look of the man who suddenly comes home 
	after the adventure of life has carried him afar, wandering the world, where he 
	has forgotten everything. From the plane window to another window...
	
	98  SUPERHIGHWAY. INT/EXT. DAY 
	
	...the window of the taxi-cab driving SALVATORE to his home town. The scenery 
	moving by on either side of the road summons up sweet memories. A lot of things 
	have changed, but the colors are still the same. The yellow running through the 
	entire landscape is unmistakable. And all those black birds perched in a row on 
	the guard-rail are crows. 
	
	The cab now approaches the outskirts of Giancaldo. But if the sign, 
	hadn't been there with the name on it, it could be an entirely different 
	place...
	
	99  SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. EXT/INT. DAY
	
	The house where SALVATORE'S MOTHER lives is also new, nearer the 
	sea. 
	
	The old lady is sitting alone in an armchair in the parlor, knitting a white 
	sweater. Her hands move very swiftly, almost mechanically. 
	
	The hands of a woman who is waiting. The front doorbell rings twice. MARIA stops 
	short. That is what she has been waiting for. She mumbles in excitement. 
	
				MARIA  
		It's Toto...I knew it...
	
	And she scrambles to her feet, dropping her knitting in the chair, one needle 
	dangling over the edge. She hurries off, forgetting that she still has the ball 
	of white yarn in her apron pocket. And the yarn runs off the needles and the 
	knitting comes undone quickly as she moves about the house, goes down the stairs 
	to the front door.   
	
	There the yam stops and MARIA' s excited voice is heard.
	
				MARIA 'S VOICE  
			(Off-screen) 
		Toto!...
	
				SALVATORE'S VOICE (Off-screen) 
		How are you, Mamma?... 
	
	The camera now moves, discovering them through the parlor window, hugging each 
	other outside the front door. Under the curious eyes of an old bored dog.
	
	100  SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. INT. DAY 
	
	MARIA is no longer wearing an apron. Mother and son are sitting side 
	by side at the kitchen table...
	
				MARIA  
		Lia'll be so glad to see you, you'll 
		see. And you won't recognize the 
		kids any more, they're grown up by 
		now. 
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Smiling) 
		They're always writing to me saying 
		they want to come to Rome!
	
	SALVATORE looks around; It's a place he's never seen before, and yet it's 
	his mother's house.)
	 
				MARIA  
		See how pretty the house is? We did 
		everything over.
			(Smiling) 
		If it hadn't been for you! 
			(Getting up) 
		Come, I have a surprise.... 
			(She takes him by the hand 
			and leads him out to the 
			hallway. SALVATORE looks 
			at her and feels a pang. 
			She seems smaller, age 
			withers the body, she is 
			slightly stooped, her hair 
			is gathered into a knot at 
			the back other head.)
		You must be tired. If you want to 
		rest, there's time before the 
		funeral. 
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Interrupting her) 
		No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by 
		air, you know. 
	
				MARIA  
			(Smiling, ironically) 
		You shouldn't tell me that now. After 
		all these years! 
			(SALVATORE gets the 
			message, feels guilty. 
			Thinking about it, it 
			seems incredible that he 
			has never come before. 
			MARIA opens a door, steps 
			aside to let her son in, 
			whispers:) 
		I put all your things in here. Go in, 
		go in...
	
	SALVATORE lakes a few steps, is flabbergasted at the sight of his old room 
	perfectly reconstructed and preserved. It looks like a museum, the museum of the 
	past. Despite the bed, the clothes in the cupboard, the books on the shelves, it 
	is perfectly clear that no one has ever lived in it and never will live in it. 
	MARIA senses his perturbation, remains standing in the doorway as if to leave 
	him alone...SALVATORE goes over to the bed, looks around  the old 8mm movie 
	camera, the projector, his documentaries, the bicycle hanging on the wall, the 
	photographs of his favorite movie stars. But what mostly catches his eye is a 
	tiny framed photograph: SALVATORE as a little boy and ALFREDO, standing smiling 
	in front of the Cinema Paradiso. Strange, at that time ALFREDO was younger than 
	he is now! It's as if he were standing there before him one last time. That 
	impressive figure, his good-natured bur firm look, touches his heart. From 
	ALFREDO'S smiling face to...
	
	101  GIANCALDO. MAIN STREET AND SQUARE. EXT. DAY 
	
	...the coffin where his old blind friend rests for ever. The funeral
	procession winds its way down the main street. At the intersections, , 
	cars stop to let the black hearse pass by. People cross themselves. The old men 
	remove their hats. Store shutters are lowered. Then, when the procession has 
	passed by, the cars start up again, the old men put their hats back on, the 
	shutters are pulled up. 
	
	SALVATORE is in the front row with his MOTHER, next to ALFREDO'S WIDOW. 
	SIGNORA ANNA says in a whisper, her eyes fixed on the coffin.  
	
				ANNA  
		He would have been happy you came, 
		Toto. He always talked about you. 
		Always! Right to the end! He was 
		terribly fond of you...
			(Tears come to her, she is 
			unable to say any more. 
			SALVATORE gives her a hug, 
			deeply touched by her 
			words.) 
		He left two things for you. Come see 
		me before you leave. 
	
	SALVATORE nods his head. He gazes intensely at the coffin covered with flowers 
	and is grieved as if he were ashamed never to have come to see the man who had 
	been like a father to him. But why had he forgotten him? Up in front, leading 
	the procession, he sees a young PRIEST with an altar boy beside him, and these 
	figures are also like chisels scraping the rust off his soul and bringing old 
	feelings to light again. 
	
	The procession reaches the square. The dark column stands etched in the dazzling 
	early-afternoon light. SIGNORA ANNA motions the driver and the procession comes 
	to a halt. It is ALFREDO'S last farewell to the place where he had spent the 
	best years of his life  the Cinema Paradiso. Everyone turns to look and 
	SALVATORE also turns, taken by surprise...It has fallen to pieces: doors and 
	windows boarded shut, crumbling walls, a piece of the sign dangling down, weeds 
	and mildew in the cracks and on the roof. The square has changed completely, is 
	unrecognizable. Buildings, stores, sign boards and lines of cars creeping at a 
	snail's pace in a deafening chorus of honking horns. And the central square has 
	turned motorcycles. SALVATORE turns slowly to look behind him, towards the small 
	crowd, and is entranced by the unexpected sight of faces that he recognizes at 
	once, despite the many years that have gone by:  the MAN AT THE BOX OFFICE, the 
	USHER who also served as bill-poster, the CHARWOMAN, the CARABINIERE SERGEANT, 
	and further on behind ROSA and ANGELO, the lovebirds who had met in the movie 
	house and then got married. They all have white hair. And they too have 
	recognized him, give little hello nods and gestures. Another face 
	he seems to recognize: why sure, it's SPACCAFICO, the owner. How old he's 
	become! He also looks up and his eyes meet SALVATORE'S. A hello nod. 
	SALVATORE makes his way over to him through the crowd. They shake hands 
	heartily, without a word, both touched. The procession starts up again. 
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Under his breath) 
		How long's it been shut? 
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Six years ago this May. No one came 
		any more. You "know better than me, 
		Mr. Di Vita, the crisis, television, 
		videos. By now the movie business is 
		only a dream. The city's bought it 
		now to make a new parking lot. Next 
		Saturday they're 
		tearing it down...A pity!...
	
	SALVATORE is disconcerted, irritated by that 'Mr. Di Vita'. Besides, finding 
	out that the movie house is to be torn down depresses him, after all, it's a 
	piece of his life...And all those curious faces staring at him.
	
				SALVATORE  
		But why do you call me 'Mr. Di Vita'? 
		It didn't used to be that way...
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Well, it's hard to call an important 
		person by his first name. But if it 
		really matters to you, I'11 call 
		you...
			(Smiling) 
		Toto!...
	
	SALVATORE smiles at that. Meanwhile, the procession has reached the church. 
	SALVATORE excuses himself and goes over to the hearse. Old SPACCAFICO watches 
	him go, then says, almost to himself) 
	
				SPACCAFICO  
		Bless you, Toto. 
	
	The coffin is unloaded. SALVATORE has asked to be one of the 
	bearers into the church. As he moves off slowly with that weight 
	on his shoulder, somebody catches his eye on the other side of the sidewalk. An 
	old woman, sixty or seventy years old, with a plastic bag in her hand. She 
	crosses herself quickly. SALVATORE recognizes her  she was the one he made love 
	with for the first time. TERESA, the prostitute. The coffin is carried into the 
	church, followed by the little procession. 
	
	102  SALVATORE' S MOTHER'S HOUSE. EXT/INT. EVENING 
	
	The little house is sunk in the darkness of evening and the ground floor
	windows are lit up. The rustling of the sea can be heard. The family is having 
	supper. The table is set with the finest silver and the company china has been 
	brought out. LIA is also there with her husband, ALFIO, and their two children. 
	FILIPPO, fifteen, and SARA, thirteen. The television is on, but the sound has 
	been turned practically all the way down. SALVATORE'S presence arouses a special 
	excitement. The children look at their uncle with a certain awe, after all they 
	don't really know him. 
	
				SARA  
			(Playfully) 
		Uncle, the next time Granny comes to 
		Rome, I want to come along too. I 
		want to see what you do when you 
		work...
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Smiling) 
		Fine. But I warn you, there isn't 
		much to see. I sell much more smoke 
		than fire...
	
	The CHILDREN laugh. At the sight of them, LIA, ALFIO and MARIA also smile.
	
				ALFIO 
			(To SALVATORE) 
		Watch out, don't get too familiar 
		with those two 
			(indicating the children)
		they're worse than cannibals. They'll 
		take advantage. 
	
	Everybody laughs again. Even MARIA laughs a lot. SALVATORE looks at her; he had 
	never seen her laugh like that, amused, at peace.
	
				FILIPPO  
		You leaving tomorrow, Uncle? 
	
	SALVATORE doesn't know what to say. He feels drunk. It has been a day of violent 
	upheavals, a series of almost overwhelming emotions and now he knows nothing  on 
	the one hand, he' d like to stay, let himself drift on the sweet tide of family 
	life, be completely carried off by the rolling waves of his own past: on the 
	other, he wishes he had never come. He forces himself to smile again.
	
				SALVATORE  
		I don't know, Filippo. I don't 
		know...
	
	They go on eating, but SALVATORE isn't very hungry. Re peers at LIA eating out 
	of the comer of his eye, feels deeply bound to her  she has a few white hairs 
	and light wrinkles line her face. 
	
	Then he looks at her husband, ALFIO, he's going bald but he tries to hide it by 
	combing over the little hair left. Who knows what their marriage is like, he 
	wonders. He looks back at LIA, and it's as if she sensed it, she looks up, 
	guesses the nature of his thoughts, imagines what he is trying to figure out, a 
	blush colors her cheeks and she smiles. SALVATORE returns a conniving smile.
	The ringing of a phone. SARA starts to get up to go and answer it, hut MARIA 
	stops her with a glance of the eye.
	
				MARIA  
			(To SALVATORE) 
		It must be for you...They've been 
		calling all afternoon. They wanted to 
		know if you're leaving this evening 
		or tomorrow...
	
	Everyone turns to SALVATORE with questioning looks, making him feel even more 
	restless and undecided. The phone goes on ringing.
	
	103  CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. DAY . 
	
	The TRAFFIC cops are trying to break the front door down with their
	shoulders. Once, twice, and at last, the door flies open with a screech, 
	kicking up a cloud of dust. SALVATORE enters by himself...
	
	104  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. DAY 
	
	SALVATORE'S silhouette stands out against the light in the open door. S lowly he 
	makes his way into the empty theatre. A thick layer of dust lends everything a 
	gray, rarefied look. The light streaming in from the windows up above teems with 
	strange mates of dust, like a haze. 
	
	Cobwebs hang like long veils from the ceiling. SALVATORE walks down the middle 
	aisle. The rows of seats are unhinged, what was once the wooden veneer has 
	warped from the dampness. He looks around as if he Were thumbing through the 
	album of his memories.  
	
	The screen dangles from its frame. The emergency exits are boarded 
	and nailed shut. Observing the emptiness of the theatre, SALVATORE 
	has the feeling he can hear the howling, the whistling and voices of the . 
	audience, as he remembers it. But only for one brief moment, then the silence 
	returns. A mouse creeps along one wall, stops near a pile of dust. SALVATORE is 
	attracted by that little gray mass. He goes over as the mouse scampers off, 
	takes a closer look and recognizes the shape of half a lion's head covered with 
	dust. He moves it with his foot, then looks up at the projection booth, 
	repeating the same gesture of bygone years. But the lion's head is no longer 
	there, only the outline of it on the wall, and cobwebs have covered the hales of 
	the booth, those little square openings that had caused him such long suffering 
	as a little boy...SALVATORE now climbs up the spiral staircase. Each step kicks 
	up a little cloud of dust. 
	
	The little booth, yellow with fumes, appears before him again. Now it 
	looks like some big, empty cave. The projector is no longer there, nor 
	the equipment. Who knows where they junked them?! The only thing left is a clump 
	of film strips still attached to the wall: trailers, Part One 
	endings, etc...There he had kissed ELENA for the first time, and
	strips of film like those had grazed their faces. Now they are caught up
	in the coils of cobwebs. And where the film-winder once stood, the
	nails remain with thousands of yellowing receipts. Of all the films 
	shown at the Cinema Paradiso Palace. And three more boxfuls of 
	them are on the floor. 
	
	And the windows overlooking the square are bolted shut and the glass   
	broken. SALVATORE peers out of one of the cracks in the window and
	sees the village...which is now a city. A different world he no longer 
	knows. 
	
	105  CAFÉ IN SQUARE. INT/EXT. DAY 
	
	The cafe in the square has been completely renovated. The CASHIER and BARMEN 
	have young, unfamiliar faces. SALVATORE holds out the receipt with a tip. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		A double whisky, please. 
	
	Several BOYS are sitting at the comer tables, talking about girls. Others stand 
	playing 'war games', shake around to the obsessive strains of same electronic 
	tune. 
	
	A man comes up to SALVATORE and asks for his autograph. Then SALVATORE turns to 
	the plate-glass window overlooking the main street, where the workers' club once 
	was. And like a flash, a shudder freezes him to the spot.... Two steps away 
	from 
	him, through the glass, a stunning vision, which casts him beyond time, chills 
	his blood: there before him is ELENA! But she is still young, young as she was 
	then! Sweet, luminous, alluring, exactly the way he saw her the first time at 
	the station. 
	
	She is waiting to go across the street with a bunch of books under her 
	arm...Have the passing years had no effect on her? Or is she an hallucination? 
	No! It's a dream! Or is he dead too, like ALFREDO? SALVATORE doesn't know how to 
	explain it. And he is suddenly seized by a feeling of panic. His glass drops to 
	the floor...As the GIRL walks off... 
	
	106  GIANCALDO. STREET. EXT. DAY 
	
	At the age of fifty-five, SALVATORE feels no scruples about wandering
	the streets of his home town, spying from a distance on an eighteen- year-old 
	girl. There's nothing he can do about it. He stares at her with the amazement of 
	someone who discovers that miracles exist. Now he is nearer to her. How lovely 
	she is! It's her, no doubt about it! Exactly the same. Except she has a 
	different hair-do and is wearing different clothes:  ELENA didn't wear slacks. 
	The GIRL goes up to a parked motorcycle. She removes the padlock and fastens her 
	books to the rack. SALVATORE is standing there a few steps away, and without 
	stopping to think, moves a little closer, discreetly, politely.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Excuse me, Miss...
			(She turns to look at him, 
			indifferent, but friendly. 
			He looks at her wonderful 
			blue eyes.) 
		I'm so sorry, I thought you were 
		someone else. 
			
				GIRL  
			(Shrugging) 
		Well. 
	
	She has already started the motor of her bike. A flip of the accelerator and 
	off she goes, her hair flying in the wind. 
	
	SALVATORE follows her with his eyes until she disappears around the corner.
	
	107  SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. INT. AFTERNOON 
	
	The old shots of ELENA getting off the train and walking away, casting a curious 
	look at the camera...SALVATORE is watching her again, projected on the white 
	wall of his room. He also watches the other shots of those happy long-gone days  
	the picnic,. she at the beach, smiling, joyful...And again SALVATORE doesn't 
	understand, or doesn't want to understand. But these scenes could have been shot 
	yesterday, so identical to ELENA is the girl he saw on the street...And the 
	wound which he thought had healed years ago, starts bleeding again. 
	
	The lingering note of suffering for a romance that had ended without his ever 
	knowing why, and the endless explanations that had been sifted through by his 
	young mind, start slipping through his soul again, like those shots 
	slipping again through an old 8mm projector. 
	
	Through the crack of the door, MARIA sees those images on the wall, SALVATORE 
	rocking his head back and forth slowly, like he used to do as a boy when he 
	cried. She somehow feels his grief, his bitterness, lowers her eyes and walks 
	away without a word, as the little shiny rectangle on the wall remains blank, 
	empty...And SALVATORE sits there gazing at it, as if he saw other scenes which 
	his camera never set down on film, only his memory. 
	 
	108  HIGH SCHOOL. STREETS AND LITTLE SQUARE. EXT. DAY 
	
	The HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS are coming out after school. Happy young faces. That 
	GIRL 's motorcycle can be seen in a rear-view mirror. SALVATORE is at the wheel 
	of the car ALFIO has lent him. He has obviously followed that motorcycle before. 
	He waits with an eagerness he thought he had long lost, a determination to 
	understand, to get to the bottom of the matter, which frightens him and at the 
	same time overwhelms him hopelessly. 
	
	And here she comes. She unlocks the padlock and prepares to speed off. SALVATORE 
	starts the motor and follows her a short distance away. The GIRL heads for the 
	new residential district on the outskirts. 
	
	109  SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. INT. DAY 
	
	MARIA is setting the table. LIA and her family are eating at her 
	house today. SALVATORE is sitting again, with a lighted cigarette, 
	gazing through the window at the shrubs tossing in the wind and the 
	rolling sea. The air whistling through the cracks of the windows lends a 
	heaviness to the silence, like the troubled look on his face. MARIA glances at 
	him. 
	
				MARIA  
		What are you thinking, Toto? 
	
	SALVATORE looks at the old woman's lovely face, a faint smile. on his lips. 
	There was always something like an unspoken rule between them, the rule of 
	silence, of unconfessed complicity. And now he feels that rule has to be broken. 
	He speaks quietly, as if to curb the tumult of his feelings of guilt.
	
				SALVATORE  
		I was thinking...that we've never 
		talked, Mamma...When I was little I 
		saw you as if you were already old. 
		That's probably true with all kids...
		Who knows? 
			(She nods, then sits down 
			before him. He strokes her 
			old, skinny, heavily 
			veined hands...) 
		But only now do I realize you were 
		young, you were beautiful, had a 
		whole life before you. But how...
			(Sighing) 
		...how could you have lived alone 
		all that time, with no one to look 
		after you? You could have 
		remarried...Why not? At the time I 
		probably wouldn't have understood, 
		but I would have later...
	
	MARIA doesn't answer, but she is not troubled. An inner peace lends her a sweet, 
	quiet expression. Then she too agrees to break the rule of silence. 
	
				MARIA  
		I never had anybody. If that's what 
		you think...I didn't want anybody. I 
		always remained faithful. First to 
		your father, then to you, to Lia. 
			(With a shrug) 
		That's the way I'm made, there's 
		nothing I can do about it. 
			(Smiling) 
		And you're like me, you're too honest 
		and too attached to the things you
		love...But I don't know if that's a 
		good thing. Faithfulness is a bad 
		business. If you're faithful, you're 
		always alone! 
			(SALVATORE is immersed in 
			the profound truth of 
			those words. And he says 
			nothing. The silence is 
			broken by the ringing of 
			the phone. A menacing 
			sound, which SALVATORE 
			cannot bear. He knows they 
			are calling him from Rome, 
			gives a nervous gesture, 
			stands up and pulls out 
			the plug. The silence 
			returns, the whistling of 
			the wind. MARIA lowers her 
			eyes.) 
		It's my fault! It would have been 
		better if I hadn't called you... 
	
	SALVATORE sits down again, leaning closer to her. He stubs out his cigarette in 
	the already overflowing ashtray.
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Whispering) 
		No...It's nothing to do with you. 
		It's just that I was scared of coming 
		back. Now, after all these years, I 
		thought I was strong, that I had 
		forgotten lots of things. Instead, I 
		find it's quite the opposite, as if I 
		had never left. And yet, I look at 
		Lia and feel as if I didn't know her, 
		and you, Mamma...I abandoned you, 
		ran away like a thief, thought only 
		of myself, and never gave you 
		an explanation...
	
				MARIA  
			(Interrupting him) 
		And I never asked for one! You have 
		nothing to explain. I always thought 
		that what you did was right, and that 
		was that. With no beating around the 
		bush...
			(Smiling, playing it down) 
		Only one thing made me suffer: 
		bolting the door shut before going to 
		bed at night...
	
				SALVATORE  
		You never used to do that! 
	
	She smiles like a little girl who is about to confess the fibs she has told.
	
				MARIA  
		No, no...When you used to work at 
		the movies, I could never get to 
		sleep at night until you came home. 
		Then when you arrived, I pretended to 
		be asleep, but I heard all your 
		movements. Then when you fell asleep, 
		I'd get up and bolt the door. Then, 
		when you left, every time I did it, I 
		felt as if I had left somebody 
		outside the door, far away.... 
			(SALVATORE listens to his 
			MOTHER'S words, surprised 
			and entranced by the 
			poetry of her way of 
			speaking...) 
		But you were right to leave. You 
		succeeded in doing what you wanted to 
		do...
			(Sighing) 
		When I call you, a different, woman 
		always answers. I pretend I know them 
		so they won't have to go through the 
		embarrassment of introducing 
		themselves. 
			(Smiling) 
		I'm sure they take me for a crazy old 
		woman. But so far I've never heard 
		one voice that really loves you...I 
		would have known. And yet, I'd like 
		to see you...settled down...fall in 
		love...
			(Gazing into his eyes) 
		But your life's there. Here there are 
		nothing but ghosts, Toto! Let it go. 
	
	She has said this with a subtle allusiveness in her voice. And SALVATORE 
	realizes she has always known everything. But he doesn't' answer her. 
	They look at each other a Long time without speaking. Their rule of conniving 
	silence has come back into play, as before, forever. It is her expression that 
	tells him to leave, to take the plane and fly away...
	
	110  SMALL SQUARE AND HOUSE. INT/EXT. EVENING 
	
	But SALVATORE has not taken his MOTHER'S advice. Re has not left. Something 
	holds him there still, leads him to go on looking. 
	
	The GIRL'S motorcycle is parked in the courtyard beyond the gate of a small 
	house. He is studying it from inside the car parked in a corner of the small 
	square, near a café. Re has been there some while, but is not nervous, waits 
	there with determination...
	
	Several windows in the house are lit, but no one can be seen through 
	the curtains. Nothing but shadows pass by every now and then. Now the light in 
	one of the windows goes out, and the light on the stair goes on. The front door 
	opens and the GIRL comes out with a tall, sturdy- looking, elegantly dressed 
	GENTLEMAN around fifty. 
	
	They converse bur are too far away for their voices to be heard. SALVATORE 
	watches them come out the gate and climb into a car. They look like father and 
	daughter. The car now drives off and passes right by him. A gleam of light, 
	the reflection from the headlights, falls on the GENTLEMAN'S face. He recognizes 
	him at once, from the birthmark on his temple...
	
				SALVATORE  
			(To himself) 
		Boccia! 
	
	His eyes flash, he's afraid he's understood. And now the craze to get to the 
	bottom of it all gnaws away at him. There is no turning back. 
	
	111 CAFÉ. AND SMALL SQUARE. INT/EXT. EVENING 
	
	SALVATORE'S hands rifle through a phone directory. He is in the cafe, on the 
	other side of the glass door leading to the little square. His finger 
	runs down the column of names...
	
				SALVATORE  
			(Mumbling) 
		His last name was Lo Meo, Vincenzo. 
	
	He has already put the token into the slot and dials the number, looking at the 
	two lit upstairs windows of that house, where the mystery of his life may be 
	hiding. SALVATORE hears the first ring, his heart in his throat...A shadow 
	appears in one of the windows. And a voice answers. 
	
				VOICE ON TELEPHONE  
		Hello? 
			(It's a woman's voice. 
			SALVATORE shuts his eyes, 
			is about to speak, but the 
			lump in his throat 
			silences him...) 
	
				VOICE ON TELEPHONE  
		Hello? Hello? 
	
	He still hesitates, can' t get a word out, as if he had lost his voice or 
	didn't know what to say. He hangs up. The shadow at the window also hangs up, 
	then disappears... 
	
	SALVATORE is at a loss, sits down at one of the rabies near the 
	phone in the almost empty cafe. At the far end, a group of five people watching 
	television.
	
				BARMAN  
		You want something? 
	
	And he turns back to the television. SALVATORE lights a cigarette. He is 
	uncertain. Once again he has to lake an important decision  redial the number 
	and seek a face behind that shadow? Or forget the whole thing, the GIRL, BOCCIA, 
	the shadow, and go away? Yes, best go away. He gets up and leaves. He can be 
	seen through the window turning the comer. A pack of cigarettes and a lighter 
	lie on the table, he has forgotten them. And the lighted cigarette bums down in 
	the ashtray. A few moments have gone by. Footsteps, and a hand picks up the 
	lighter and the cigarettes. It is SALVATORE who now, on a sudden urge, slips 
	another token into the slot. The shadow reappears at the window. The same voice 
	as before.
	 
				VOICE ON TELEPHONE  
		Hello, who's speaking? 
	
	SALVATORE answers at last, keeping his eyes shut, whispering:
	 
				SALVATORE  
		I'd like to speak to Signora Elena...
	
				VOICE ON TELEPHONE  
		Speaking. Who is it, please? 
	
	SALVATORE feels a terrible pang, continues:
	
				SALVATORE  
		Salvatore. 
	
	Silence, charged with tension. Then the voice continues weakly, as if puzzled.
	
				VOICE ON TELEPHONE  
		Salvatore...who? 
	
	He runs his hand over his forehead, his eyes, as if to soothe the turmoil he 
	feels inside.
	
				SALVATORE 
		Di Vita. Salvatore Di Vita. Do you 
		remember? 
			(Another pause chilly, 
			heavy. SALVATORE opens his 
			eyes, looks at the window. 
			Her shadow is motionless, 
			as if cut out of 
			cardboard.) 
		Elena, I'm here, in the bar, across 
		the street from your house. 
	
	The shadow moves slowly, a hand pulls aside the curtain. It's a moment of heart-
	rending emotion...She appears. And they see each other from a distance, after 
	thirty years, each of them with a phone receiver to their ear. But she is 
	somewhat in the dark, against the light, it's impossible to make out her 
	features. Her voice gives a sudden start, instantly controlled.
	 
				VOICE ON TELEPHONE  
		Certainly, I remember...
	
	SALVATORE'S eyes glisten, try to pierce the distance and the darkness to get a 
	better look, but in vain. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Elena. I'd like to see you...Let's 
		meet. 
	
	ELENA lets the curtain drop and goes back to being a shadow. She whispers the 
	words.
	
				VOICE ON TELEPHONE  
		It's been so long. Why should we 
		meet? What good would it do? 
	
				SALVATORE 
		Please, don't say no.. . 
	
	But her voice is firm, unshakeable, even if quivering with emotion.
	
				VOICE ON TELEPHONE  
		I'm old, Salvatore. And you too. It's 
		best not to meet. Goodbye. 
	
	The shadow hangs up, disappears. The light goes off.
	
	112  DIFFERENT SETTINGS. INT/EXT. EVENING 
	
	The wind is stronger now, the streets and the square are empty. SALVATORE 
	is at the wheel of the car, driving aimlessly around the town. He has 
	rediscovered the woman who conditioned his whole life and they hadn't had the 
	courage to meet. An obsessive musical heat, fraught with rage, pours out of the 
	car radio. 
	
	113  SALVATORE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE. INT. EVENING 
	
	A phone ringing drowns out the sound of the television and the wind  
	whistling outside. In the half-darkened room, MARIA picks up the receiver...  
	
				MARIA  
		Hello?
	
	No one answers, but she can sense the presence of someone who now hangs up. 
	MARIA is alarmed. Who could it be at this hour? And where is Toto?
	
	114  SEAFRONT AND PIER. EXT/INT. CAR. EVENING 
	
	SALVATORE stands motionless on the pier, facing the storm-tossed sea. He feels 
	relieved by the roar of the waves that dispels his bitter thoughts, blurs them, 
	but does not wipe out the look of suffering in his eyes. A flashing light seems 
	to approach behind his back. SALVATORE turns and is blinded by the headlights of 
	a car parked at the beginning of the pier. The splattering waves lend the scene 
	a hazy cast and diffuse the glare of the flashing headlights. Now the lights 
	move towards him. And SALVATORE also lakes a few timid steps forward... 
	They are close. The car has almost stopped. But it is impossible to make out the 
	person at the wheel who now reaches over to open the other door. A voice can be 
	barely heard over the raging sea. It is ELENA's voice. 
	
				ELENA  
		Salvatore! 
	
	SALVATORE approaches, accepting the invitation, enters the car and shuts the 
	door. The headlights go off and the car remains there suspended between the open 
	sea and the harbor with its rocking boats. Inside the car, not a word. Two dark 
	figures gaze at each other, unintelligible, as if the night were trying to 
	further delay that meeting. The glowing reflection of a wave higher than the 
	others now lights up their faces. ELENA was right, they are no longer the faces 
	of teenagers, but of people on in years who study each other, searching for a 
	truth. The howling of the wind and the crashing of the waves are louder, but 
	ELENA and SALVATORE /rear nothing, sit glued to their seats, fixed in the 
	endless gaze that envelops them. He is the first to break the silence in a faint  
	voice.
	
				SALVATORE  
		How'd you know I'd be here? 
	
	ELENA  I don't know how many years have gone by, but some things about you I do 
	remember. There weren't many, places you could have gone. I looked around...
	
	SALVATORE turns on the light of the rear-view mirror. Finally 
	they can see better. They look at each other a little ill at ease, 
	making the inevitable comparisons with the memory of their young faces. 
	SALVATORE carefully observes her graying hair, her blue eyes lined 
	with wrinkles, the somewhat faded beauty mark on her lip.
	
				SALVATORE  
		You're still beautiful...
	
				ELENA  
		Don't be silly...I'm old.
			(She looks down troubled 
			by the way he has of 
			gazing into her eyes, 
			speaks almost mumbling her 
			words.) 
		Don't look at me like that, please. 
			(And she switches off the 
			light. But this time it is 
			less dark, things can be 
			seen.) 
		Why'd you come back? 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Alfredo died. Do you remember him? 
	
				ELENA  
		Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. 
		You were terribly fond of him. 
	
	A moment of silence. It's hard to find something to say.
	
				SALVATORE  
		I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! 
		Who knows how many Salvatores 
		must be running after her...
	
				ELENA  
			(Smiling) 
		One or two. Bur there're not all that 
		many Salvatores. 
			(SALVATORE also smiles, 
			but a puzzled smile as if 
			what she has said had 
			thrown him off-guard.) 
		I've got a son, too...he's older. 
		And you, do you have children? 
	
				SALVATORE  
		No. And I'm not married. 
			(ELENA sits there in 
			silence. A veil of sadness 
			clouds her eyes. 
			SALVATORE'S 
			too...) 
		Are you happy? 
	
				ELENA  
		All things considered, yes. Even if 
		it wasn't what I dreamt of then...
	
	Again SALVATORE is thrown off-guard, as if the round key of 
	his enquiry had met with only square locks. She continues.
	 
				ELENA  
		My husband...you know him. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Sure, sure! Boccia...
			(With a bitter smile) 
		What's he do? 
	
				ELENA  
		Politics. He's the district 
		representative. We met at the 
		University in Pisa. 
	
	Then instinctively, in a shy voice, SALVATORE asks the question 
	that he probably wouldn't have asked a moment later.
	
				SALVATORE  
		And...how come you never married 
		that guy from Tuscany? 
	
	The white foam of the waves splashes up over the wall of the pier, dashing 
	against the car windows. The shadow of the trickling water is superimposed on 
	the agony of their faces. ELENA hides her embarrassment beneath a faint but 
	haughty smile.
	
				ELENA  
		I didn't want to...I had to fight 
		tooth and nail. But in the end I 
		won...
			(SALVATORE is unable to 
			smile. It's as if the void 
			were growing and swelling 
			within. Thunder and 
			lightning shatter the 
			roaring of the wind and 
			sea, hut it does not rain. 
			Now her smile Jades away.)
		At that time...I was waiting for 
		you...
	
	There is no resentment in her words. She has said them fondly. With the serenity 
	of someone who has suffered greatly and then found a strong convincing way of 
	suffering no more. For SALVATORE, it's as if one of those thunderbolts had 
	pierced his heart. He leans over, gazing into her shining eyes. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		But I've never forgotten you, Elena! 
	
				ELENA  
			(Whispering) 
		Nor have I. Even though you 
		disappeared...
			(SALVATORE is staggered, 
			feels as if he were 
			plunging into the void. 
			What she has said strikes 
			him as grotesque. ELENA 
			strokes his hair, as if to 
			restrain his sinking 
			heart, gives a sweet 
			smile.) 
		But what's the point of talking about 
		it? We risk being pathetic and 
		ridiculous. 
			(And she tries to change 
			the subject.) 
		You still live in Rome? 
	
	But SALVATORE ignores the question. He doesn't want to change the subject. 
	He feels that everything is crumbling inside him, the alibis and excuses he had 
	had to give himself in order to accept the end of their romance. And instead, 
	now the tables seem to have completely turned. Without realizing, he shouts 
	desperately, staring wildly at her and shaking her by the 
	shoulders.
	
				SALVATORE  
		What do you mean, you were waiting 
		for me?! What are you saying? 
			(He controls himself at 
			once, continues, breathing 
			heavily.) 
		The last time we saw each other, we 
		made a date to meet at the Cinema 
		Paradiso. You remember? And you 
		didn't come, you disappeared without 
		leaving a trace, nothing! I'll tell 
		you how many years have gone by: more 
		than thirty!!! 
	
	Quiet rears stream down Elena's face, glisten with the reflections of the 
	lightning and the waves.
	
				ELENA  
		I kept that date. 
			(SALVATORE laughs at the 
			absurdity of it. A 
			nervous, heartbroken 
			laugh, which slowly melts 
			away as she goes on to 
			say:) 
		But I was late...
			(Tears continue to stream 
			out of her blue eyes, but 
			she tells her story in a 
			calm voice.) 
		I had a fight with my family. I tried 
		to convince them again that they 
		couldn't separate us. But it was 
		futile. They had decided to leave 
		Sicily once and for all. Which is 
		what we did. I didn't know what to do 
		any more, what to say. And I said 
		yes, I'd do whatever they wanted. In 
		return, my father promised to let me 
		see you one last time, to say 
		goodbye. But I hoped that by seeing 
		each other we could take advantage of 
		it and make a decision...I thought 
		we would run away together. 
			(She holds back her sobs. 
			Dries her tears with the 
			back of her hand, and 
			continues:) 
		My father drove me to the movie 
		theatre. But you weren't in the 
		projection booth. Only Alfredo...
	
	Her voice continues over the scene of same thirty years before...
	
	115  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. AFTERNOON Flashback. 
	
				ELENA'S VOICE  
			(Off-screen) 
		And I didn't have time to wait for 
		you to comeback... 
	
	From the bottom of the spiral staircase, ELENA'S FATHER is waiting nervously, 
	yells up at the projection booth.
	
				ELENA' S FATHER  
		Elena! Hurry up!! 
	
				YOUNG ELENA  
		All right, Daddy!...
	
	In the projection booth, ALFREDO is sitting on a stool, near the
	projector. Seen from the rear, the YOUNG ELENA is leaning over 
	beside him, she is excited, her eyes are red and swollen with tears.
	
				ELENA'S VOICE  
			(Off-screen) 
		So I told Alfredo how things stood 
		and fiat I was leaving the same 
		evening, and I asked him to tell you 
		everything. He was very kind, he 
		listened carefully, then... 
	
	ALFREDO answers YOUNG ELENA, stroking her hair.
	
				ALFREDO  
		Easy, easy. 
			(Sighing) 
		Listen carefully to what I have to 
		say. If you want me to tell Toto what 
		you've told me, I will. But if you 
		want my advice, forget it. It's 
		better for both of you if you don't 
		see each other...
			(YOUNG ELENA gives a start 
			of resentment, listens 
			with surprise.) 
		Dear girl, fire always turns into 
		ashes! Even the deepest love ends 
		sooner or later. And after that other 
		loves appear, lots of them. Toto, he 
		can't understand fiat now. If I tell 
		him he won't believe it, he' d be 
		capable of killing me...But you can 
		understand, you've got to 
		understand...Do it for him! 
	
	116  WATERFRONT. INT. CAR. EVENING 
	
	SALVATORE sits there without moving, pale as a sheet, looks as if he had
	grown even older. As if the whole world has fallen in on him. For ELENA, it was 
	a painful but liberating story. She dries her last tears. 
	
				ELENA  
		It's the first time I've had to 
		chance to tell the story. I never 
		mentioned it to anybody. 
	
				SALVATORE  
			(In a daze) 
		Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell 
		on you too! 
	
				ELENA  
		I told him I'd take his advice. But 
		before I went away I left you that 
		note...
			(SALVATORE gives her a 
			quick look, a questioning 
			look. He listens.) 
		I was on my way down the stairs...
			(Her voice continues, laid 
			over the...) 
	
	117  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. AFTERNOON Flashback
	
	ELENA has already said goodbye to ALFREDO, is on her way down the stairs, but 
	stops short. 
	
				ELENA' S VOICE  
			(Off-screen) 
		I thought Alfredo couldn't see me. So 
		I snuck back up...
			(She tip-toes back without 
			making any noise. Goes 
			over to the film-winder. 
			Takes out a pen, looks for 
			a scrap of paper, but 
			doesn't see any. Her eyes 
			fall on the film receipts 
			hanging on the nail. She 
			tears off the top one, 
			turns it over and 
			scribbles a message on the 
			back.) 
		I wrote you where you could find me, 
		and that I'd wait for you. 
	
	She hangs the scrap of paper back on the nail, well in sight. She creeps out, 
	glancing at ALFREDO, who hasn't noticed a thing.
	
	118  WATERFRONT. EXT/INT. CAR. EVENING 
	
	ELENA finishes telling her story. She heaves a Jeep sigh. 
	
				ELENA  
		But you disappeared all the same. 
	
	There is a haunted look in SALVATORE's eyes, he is searching his memory for 
	something he can't find, then suddenly sees, as if in a dream...his hand thirty 
	years before going through the routine gesture of hanging a receipt on the nail, 
	over the others, mechanically, without even looking...and he shuts his eyes as 
	if fearing the truth. Her last words have wounded him. He shakes his head, then 
	in a faint voice:
	
				SALVATORE  
		Oh, how I looked for you, Elena! 
		You'll never know. I wrote, 
		telephoned, nothing. Nobody ever 
		answered. But I dreamt of you for 
		years! That's why I went away...and 
		never came back here. 
			(And his anguish breaks 
			free, dissolving into 
			quiet, almost childish 
			tears. ELENA is startled 
			by his reaction. She 
			caresses him, 	
			passionately. They embrace 
			and remain like that, she 
			with her face buried in 
			his shoulder, he leaning 
			on hers with his tear-
			filled eyes.)
		Even as the years passed, in all the 
		women I met, I was only looking for 
		you. I had success it's true, but 
		there was always something missing...
			(She is deeply moved, goes 
			on caressing him gently 
			until he calms down. The 
			car windows are steamed 
			up. The sea, the harbor, 
			the waves have 	
			disappeared. Nothing 
			remains but the sound of  
			the storm. SALVATORE takes 
			her face between his 
			hands. They gaze at each 
			other, their faces 
			practically touching. He 
			murmurs:) 
		I'd never have imagined that all this 
		had to end because of the man who was 
		like a father to me. A crazy lunatic!  
			(She gives a faint smile.) 
	
				ELENA  
		He wasn't crazy. In the beginning I 
		was upset. I think I really hated 
		him. But then, with time, I 
		understood what he said...and your 
		silence too. 
	
	SALVATORE whispers one last dreadful revelation. And it's as if he had got a 
	terrible weight off his chest.
	
				SALVATORE  
		But I never saw that note! 
			(He squints, as if to 
			stress the absurdity of 
			the idea.) 
		I must have covered it with my hand, 
		without realizing it, that's the only 
		explanation...
			(But strangely enough, 
			ELENA is not surprised.) 
	
				ELENA  
		What difference does it make to find 
		an explanation? That's the way it 
		went. But Alfredo didn't betray you, 
		he was the only one who really 
		understood you. Salvatore, if you had 
		chosen to be with me, you'd have 
		never made your films. And that would 
		have been a pity! Because they're 
		wonderful, I've seen them all. 
			(Her eyes glitter with 
			joy, then she smiles, 
			almost ironically.) 
		But you shouldn't have gone and 
		changed your name. You should have 
		kept your own. 
	
	Tears stream down Salvatore's cheeks. He gives her a look of longing, of 
	desire. 
	
	ELENA embraces him. They kiss with heartrending tenderness, with the same 
	passion of their first kiss amidst the strips of film brushing their faces, so 
	many years ago. And they make love, clasped in the cramped quarters of the car, 
	like two teenagers. Passionate kisses, embraces, deep sighs. Their hair 
	damp with sweat, their hands clasping, their fingers interweaving. Then the 
	frenzy subsides into a deep, tumultuous pleasure, of immense loving and immense 
	grief...As outside the wind and the waves go on rating around that car which 
	seems suspended in empty space.) 
	
	 
	119  ALFREDO'S WIDOW'S HOUSE. INT. DAY 
	
	SIGNORA ANNA'S hands place an old wooden stool and a rusty round 
	metal can on the table.
	
				ANNA  
		These are the things he left to 
		you...
	
	SALVATORE is sitting by the table. He has finished the cup of coffee SIGNORA 
	ANNA has prepared for him. He picks up the stool, recognizes it at once: it's 
	the one ALFREDO had made for him as a little boy so he could climb up and put 
	the reels on the projector. 
	
				ANNA  
		When they showed your films on 
		television, he was happy. He'd plop 
		himself down there and all his 
		ailments were forgotten. He knew all 
		the words by heart, every one, and 
		I'd describe what was going on. And 
		when the papers talked about 
		you, I had to read them two or three 
		times...
	
	SALVATORE examines the can, wonders what it can be. He opens it: inside is a 
	reel of film, wrapped in a plastic bag, well preserved. Those objects bring a 
	pang to his heart, and the things that ANNA said, but he feels disappointed, as 
	if he expected to find something else.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Did he ever think of meeting me? 
	
				ANNA  
		No, never! One time your mother said 
		that if he wanted, you'd have surely 
		come. He got furious and said  'No, 
		Toto mustn't come back to Giancaldo, 
		never!!' He didn't say it to be mean. 
		He was a decent man. Who knows what 
		he could have been thinking? Towards 
		the end he'd say such strange things. 
		And a moment before he shut his eyes, 
		he told your mother not to let you 
		know. 
	
	120  CINEMA PARADISO. PROJECTION BOOTH. INT. DAY 
	
	A cloud of yellowed scraps of paper flutters into the air and as it falls slowly 
	to the ground another handful is flung up. SALVATORE is in the projection booth, 
	looking through the countless yellowed receipts, stuffed away in boxes. He looks 
	at them one by one, then throws them into the air. A desperate search, almost a 
	defiance of the passing of time. He continues with greater determination, flings 
	piles of receipts into the air, glances at a few dates, a film title, tries to 
	discover the oldest dates at the bottom. He moves swiftly, his hands plunge in, 
	then fling up a nimbus of paper and dust. But to no avail...He stops, short of 
	breath. His eyes go over to the nails in the wall, where other stacks of 
	receipts are hanging. He gets up and goes to look at them, thumbs " it through 
	them hastily, in anger... 
	
	He yanks off two or three packs, which come off, nail and all. Only then does he 
	notice that at the bottom of those blocks of yellowed paper, there are same more 
	sheets, much older, almost brown. His eyes concentrate on the mildewed scraps of 
	paper. He leans over, picks themup and goes through them one by one, delicately, 
	because they crumble in his fingers...And then all of a sudden, some film 
	titles 
	he recognizes from that time. He goes on thumbing through them, and all at once 
	an astonished look appears on his face  in his hands is a receipt that has been 
	turned over. It's the one! The message scribbled on it can still be seen. He 
	reads it. 
	
				SALVATORE'S VOICE  
			(Off-screen) 
		Salvatore, forgive me. I'll explain 
		later what happened. Not finding you 
		here was terrible. Unfortunately, 
		this evening, my mother and I are 
		leaving for Tuscany. We're moving 
		there. But you' re the only one I 
		love, I'll never be with anybody 
		else, I promise. Here's the address 
		of a girlfriend of mine where you 
		can write to me. Don't abandon me. 
		Love and kisses, Elena. 
	
	He clasps the scrap of paper, and his brimming eyes darken with regret.
	
	121  CAFÉ~ IN SQUARE AND ELENA'S HOUSE. INT/EXT. DAY 
	
	ELENA stands near the window overlooking the little square, listening on the 
	phone to SALVATORE'S voice. She can see him through the transparent curtain 
	speaking on the phone down below in the café. 
	
				ELENA  
		When are you leaving? 
	
	SALVATORE opens his eyes, tosses away his cigarette.
	
				SALVATORE  
		This afternoon. Elena, in the future 
		maybe we could...
	
	ELENA interrupts him, speaks softly, tenderly.
	
				ELENA  
		No, Salvatore...there is no future. 
		There's only the past. Even meeting 
		last night was nothing but a dream, a 
		beautiful dream. 
			(Smiling) 
		We never did it when we were kids, 
		remember? 
			(Down in the cafe, 
			SALVATORE nods his head 
			slowly, desperately.) 
		Now that it's happened, I don't think 
		there could have been a better 
		ending.
			(It's farewell. SALVATORE 
			glances one last time at 
			that window.) 
	
				SALVATORE  
		I'll never agree with you. Never, 
		Elena. 
	
	122  CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. DAY 
	
	The square, unusually empty. There is no one, and no cars and motorcycles are 
	parked in the middle. The stores are shut. And there is an unreal silence. The 
	houses on the two streets on either side of the theatre are covered by enormous 
	pieces of gray canvas. 
	
	Only now does the camera discover in the distance, a crowd of curious onlookers 
	waiting in front of the movie house, kept at a safe distance by firemen and 
	policemen. Old SPACCAFICO is in the crowd. SALVATORE is also there. Be gazes at 
	the front of the old movie theatre...
	
	123  CINEMA PARADISO. INT. DAY 
	
	The inside of the theatre, completely empty...All of a sudden, a blinding flash 
	and...
	
	124  SQUARE AND CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. DAY 
	
	...a deafening roar rends the air, accompanied by a surge of amazement in the 
	crowd. And the Cinema Paradiso suddenly collapses, folds inward and disappears 
	for ever in a gigantic cloud of white smoke that rises into the air, carried by 
	the wind towards the crowd...
	
	125  ELENA' S HOUSE. INT. DAY 
	
	The echo of the explosion is also heard in ELENA'S house. She is alone. 
	And the bang distresses her, as if something had burst inside her. From her face 
	to...
	
	126  SQUARE AND CINEMA PARADISO. EXT. DAY 
	
	SALVATORE's face, stiff, unmoving, his eyes fixed on those falling ruins, on 
	that season of his life turning into smoke and dust. Enveloped in the white 
	cloud, SPACCAFICO stands crying in silence. 
	
	Mice dart out of the ruins in terror, scamper nervously into the square. A group 
	of youngsters scream, amused and excited. Among them, ELENA'S DAUGHTER, 
	smiling... SALVATORE sees her joking with friends and pointing to some boys  
	chasing the mice across the square, hooting and laughing. As a white-haired OLD 
	TRAMP, filthy and covered in rags, makes his way through the crowd. There is an 
	empty look in his eyes and he repeats obsessively in a low voice:
	
				VILLAGE IDIOT  
		The square's mine, the square's mine, 
		the square's mine... 
	
	SALVATORE recognizes him, it's the VILLAGE IDIOT, the one who used to close down 
	the square at night. Be watches him walk off, raving, with nobody even noticing. 
	The crowd now moves over to the huge empty space where the movie house once 
	stood. The murmuring voices are drowned out by the deafening roar of an 
	airplane. From the ruins of the Cinema Paradiso, fade to...
	
	127  ROME. STUDIO VIEWING-ROOM. INT. DAY 
	
	...SALVATORE'S hands giving a STUDIO PROJECTIONIST the rusty metal can left him 
	by ALFREDO. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Please check the splices. As soon as 
		you're ready you can start. 
	
				PROJECTIONIST  
		OK. Congratulations on your film. 
		It's terrific. 
	
				SALVATORE  
		Thanks. 
	
	A COLLEAGUE of SALVATORE comes up behind him.
	
				SALVATORE  
		Well? 
	
				COLLEAGUE  
		The distributor is opening up the 
		film earlier. The press conference is 
		in the afternoon. The actors will 
		also be there, the producer, just 
		about everyone. 
	
	An ASSISTANT comes up to them.
	
				ASSISTANT  
		The official notification of the 
		award just came out, but we've 
		already received a mountain of 
		telegrams. Aren't you happy? 
	
				SALVATORE  
		It's all right. We'll talk about it 
		later. 
	
	SALVATORE walks off towards the viewing theatre. 
	
	SALVATORE is by himself in the small viewing theatre. Now the lights go down. 
	The beam of light shines out of the little square hole of the projection booth 
	and the screen lights up. A number trailer goes by and then SALVATORE sees the 
	first shots. 
	
	A start of intense amazement and joy suddenly runs through him, astounds him, 
	delights him. It's the best piece of film he has ever seen...  
	
	It consists of all the kisses ALFREDO cut out of the films and kept for him, 
	when he was a little boy. They have been spliced together, one , after the 
	other, at random, same of them even upside down. And yet it looks like a first-
	rate editing job. 
	
	In rapid sequence the passionate kisses between actors and actresses, names 
	famous and names unknown in the history of movies. Greta Garbo, Gary Cooper, 
	Alida Valii, Rudolph Valentino, Ingrid Bergman, Clark Gable, Anna Magnani, 
	Humphrey Bogart, Marlene Dietrich, Amedeo Nazzari, Luisa Ferida, Vittorio De 
	Sica, Rita Hayworth, Tyrone Power, Doris Durante, Massimo Gironi, Marta Abba, 
	Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, Assia Noris...
	
	A whole movie season summed up in a few fragments, a few seconds. A bizarre, 
	poignant, melancholy parade. 
	
	SALVATORE is overwhelmed, moved to tears. It is the most profound act of love he 
	has ever seen. He laughs as tears shine in his eyes. Up on the screen, another 
	kiss, the last kiss marking the happy ending of a film. And the age-old words 
	appear 'THE END'.
Clueless

 OK, so here it is. The entire script to Clueless including important actions, songs from the soundtrack, and my own personal comments. Just hit the little speaker  next to the character's name to hear the lines from the movie (They're not working yet). I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it. It's amazing the things you pick up when watching a scene 50 times. One thing: this is written by a hopelessly devoted and loyal Alicia Silverstone fan, so some of the commentary may be biased. But, I figure if you're reading this then you must have some interest her. Enjoy.

 Any suggestions, errors, anything?! Please email me pacey578@rocketmail.com

   

 SCENE I - CHER'S HOUSE

 "Kids in America" The Muffs

 (Heaps of shots of the girls having fun)

 CHER V.O.

 So OK, you're probably thinking, "Is this, like a Noxema commercial, or what?!" But seriously, I actually have a way normal life for a teenage girl. I mean I get up, I brush my teeth, and I pick out my school clothes.


 "Fashion Girl" David Bowie

 Daddy's a litigator. Those are the scariest kinds of lawyers. Even Lucy, our maid, is terrified of him. He's so good he gets paid five hundred dollars an hour just to fight with people, but he fights with me for free 'cause I'm his daughter.


 CHER

 Daddy!


 MEL

 Cher, please don't start with the juice again.


 CHER

 Daddy, you need your vitamin C.


 MEL

 Where's my briefcase?


 CHER

 It's been a couple of months now, so I say we go out to Malibu.


 MEL

 Don't tell me those braindead low-lifes have been calling again.


 CHER

 They are your parents. And don't try sneaking out of the office. Dr. Lovitz is coming by to give you a flu shot.


 MEL

 Oh, Josh is in town. He's coming for dinner.


 CHER

 Why?


 MEL

 Because he's your step-brother!


 CHER

 But you were hardly even married to his mother and that was five years ago. Why do I have to see Josh?


 (Watch those LIPS!!)

 MEL

 You divorce wives, not children.


 CHER

 Here.


 MEL

 Forget it!


 SCENE II - CHER'S CAR

 "Just a girl" No Doubt

 CHER V.O.

 Did I show you the loqued-out Jeep Daddy got me? It's got four wheel drive, dual side airbags and monster sound system. I don't have a licence yet, but I need something to learn on.


 (Cher runs over a potted plant on the kerb)

 Oh, why that came out of nowhere.


 (Watch her face when she looks back at the road)

 Here's where Dionne lives. She's my friend because we both know what it's like to have people be jealous of us.


 DIONNE

 Dude!


 CHER

 Girlfriend!


 CHER V.O.

 And I must give her snaps for her courageous fashion efforts.


 DIONNE

 Hey Cher.


 CHER V.O. 

 Dionne and I were both named after great singers of the past who now do infomercials.


 DIONNE

 So?


 CHER

 Shopping with Dr. Seuss?


 DIONNE

 Well, at least I wouldn't skin a Collie to make my backpack.


 CHER

 It's Faux.


 DIONNE

 Hello. That was a stop sign!


 CHER

 I totally paused!


 DIONNE

 Yeah, OK.


 SCENE III - SCHOOL WALKWAY

 DIONNE

 It's not even eight thirty and Murray is paging me.


 CHER

 He is so possesive.


 DIONNE

 Tell me about it. This weekend he called me up and he's all "Where were you today?" and I'm like "I'm at my Grandmother's house"...


 CHER V.O.

 Dionne and her boyfriend, Murray are in this dramatic relationship. I think they've seen that Ike and Tina Turner movie just too many times. Now I have to say to her...


 CHER

 Dee, why do you put up with it? You could do so much better.


 DIONNE

 Alright, sh, sh. Here he comes.


 "Shoop" Salt n' Pepa

 MURRAY

 Woman, why don't you be answering any of my pages?


 DIONNE

 I hate when you call me Woman!


 MURRAY

 Where you been all weekend? What's up? You been jeepin' around behind my back?


 DIONNE

 Jeepin'?


 CHER

 Jeepin'.


 (Watch Cher closely. It's Classic!)

 MURRAY

 Jeepin', jeepin'.


 DIONNE

 No, but speaking of vehicular sex, perhaps you can explain to me how this cheap K-mart hair extension got into the back seat of your car.


 MURRAY

 I don't know where that came from. That looks like one of your stringy something on others you got up here...


 DIONNE

 Excuse me. I do not wear polyester hair, OK. Unlike some people I know, like Shawanna.


 CHER

 Dee, I'm outie.


 DIONNE

 Bye.


 MURRAY

 Why do you gotta go there?


 DIONNE

 That's it. I've had it with you.


 MURRAY

 Is it that time of the month again?


 (Croud Gasps)

 CHER V.O.

 I don't know why Dionne is going out with a high school boy. They're like dogs. You have to clean them and feed them and they're just like these nervous creatures that jump and slobber all over you.


 (Random guy puts his arm around Cher)

 CHER 

 Ooo! Get off of me! Uh, AS IF!


 SCENE IV - CLASSROOM DEBATE

 MR HALL

 Should all oppressed people be allowed refuge in America? Amber will take the con position. Cher will be pro. Cher, two minutes.


 CHER 

 So, OK, like right now, for example, the Haitians need to come to America. But some people are all "What about the strain on our resources?" But it's like, when I had this garden party for my father's birthday right? I said R.S.V.P. because it was a sit-down dinner. But people came that like, did not R.S.V.P. so I was like, totally buggin'. I had to haul ass to the kitchen, redistribute the food, squish in extra place settings, but by the end of the day it was like, the more the merrier! And so, if the government could just get to the kitchen, rearrange some things, we could certainly party with the Haitians. And in conclusion, may I please remind you that it does not say R.S.V.P. on the Statue of Liberty?


 (Class breaks into applause)

 CHER

 Thank you very much.


 MR HALL

 Uh, Amber? Replying?


 AMBER

 Mr. Hall, how can I answer that? The topic is Haiti and she's talking about some little party.


 CHER

 Hello?! It was his fiftieth birthday!


 AMBER

 Whatever. If she doesn't do the assignment, I can't do mine.


 MR HALL

 Ladies. So, does anyone have any further thoughts on Cher's oration? Elton? Comments?


 ELTON

 Yeah, I can't find my Cranberries CD. I've gotta do to the Quad before somebody snags it.


 MR HALL

 I'm afraid I can't permit that. Any further insights?


 TRAVIS

 I had an insight, Mr. Hall.


 MR HALL

 I'm all ears.


 TRAVIS

 OK, like, the way I feel about the Rolling Stones is the way my kids are going to feel about Nine Inch Nails, so I really shouldn't torment my Mom anymore, huh?


 MR HALL

 Yes. Well, it's a little off the subject of Haiti, but tolerance is always a good lesson, even when it comes out of nowhere.


 TRAVIS

 Thank you.


 MR HALL

 And with that in mind, I'm going to distribute you report cards. Now, is there a Christian Stobich in this class?


 CHER

 MR. Hall? The buzz on Christian is that his parents have joint custody, so he'll be spending one semester in Chicago and one semester here. I think it is a travesty on the part of the legal profession.


 (Look at Cher's face while speaking! Ahhh, I can't take it anymore!)

 MR HALL

 Thank you for that perspective Cher.


 (Mr. Hall hands out the report cards)

 Now could all conversations please come to a halt.


 (Travis jumps up to the window)

 And could the suicide attempts please be postponed till the next period?


 TRAVIS

 Must die.


 (After Cher, the most classic character in the movie)

 CHER V.O.

 Suddenly, a dark cloud settled over first period. I got a C in debate?!


 SCENE V - SCHOOL HALLWAY

 CHER (on phone)

 Dee?


 DIONNE

 Wassup?


 CHER

 Did you get your report card?


 DIONNE

 Yeah, I'm toast. How'd you do?


 CHER

 I totally choked. My father is going to go ballistic on me.


 DIONNE

 Mr. Hall was way harsh!


 (Cher and Dionne meet up in the hall)

 He gave me a C minus.


 CHER

 Well, he gave me a C, which drags down my entire average.


 DIONNE

 Bye.


 CHER

 I'll call ya, OK?


 DIONNE

 Yeah.


 SCENE VI - CHER'S HOUSE

 CHER V.O.

 Isn't my house classic? The columns date all the way back to 1972. Wasn't my Mom a betty? She died when I was just a baby. A fluke accident during a routine liposuction. I don't remember her, but I like to pretend she still watches over me.


 CHER

 Hey, Ma. 98 in geometry. Pretty groovy, huh?


 "Fake Plastic Trees (Acoustic Version)" Radiohead

 CHER V.O. 

 Yuk! Uh, the maudlin music of the University station.


 CHER

 Waa, waa, waa.


 (Cher enters the kitchen)

 Yuh, what is it about college and cry-baby music?


 JOSH

 Hey, who's watching the Galleria?


 CHER 

 So, the flannel shirt deal. Is that a nod to the crispy Seattle weather, or are you just trying to stay warm in front of the refrigerator?


 JOSH (grabs Cher's tummy)

 Oo, wow. You're filling out there.


 CHER

 Wow. Your face is catching up with your mouth.


 JOSH

 I went by Dad's office.


 CHER

 He is not your Dad. Why don't you torture a new family.


 JOSH

 Hey, just because my mother marries someone else, doesn't mean he's my father.


 CHER

 Actually, Kato, that's exactly what it means.


 (They enter the Lounge)

 I hope you're not thinking of staying here.


 JOSH

 I sure want to.


 CHER

 I'm sure you do.


 JOSH

 I've got a place in Westwood, near School.


 CHER

 Shouldn't you go to school on the East Coast? I hear girls at N.Y.U. aren't at all particular.


 JOSH

 Hahaha, you're funny.


 (Josh changes the channel from Beavis and Butthead to the News)

 CHER

 Hey! God, you just got here and already you're playing couch Commando!


 JOSH

 Hey! In some parts of the Universe, maybe not in Contempo Casual, but in some parts, it's considered cool to know what's going on in the world.


 CHER

 Thank you, Josh. I so need lessons from you on how to be cool. Tell me that part about Kenny G again?


 MEL (From Dining Room)

 C'mon you chuckleheads, get in here!


 (They move to the Dining Room)

 Josh, are you still growing? You look taller than you did at Easter.


 JOSH

 I don't think so.


 MEL (to Cher)

 Doesn't he look bigger?


 CHER

 His head does.


 MEL

 So, Josh, have you given any thought to our little discussion about Corporate Law?


 JOSH

 Yeah, you know, but I think I'd really like to check out Environmental Law.


 MEL

 What for? Do you want to have a miserable, frustrating life?


 CHER

 Oh, Josh will have that no matter what he does.


 MEL 

 At least he knows what he's doing. And he's in good college. I'd like to see you have a little bit of direction.


 CHER

 I have direction.


 JOSH

 Yeah, towards the mall.


 MEL

 Which reminds me, where's your report card?


 CHER

 It's not ready yet.


 MEL

 What do you mean, "it's not ready yet?"


 CHER

 Well, some teachers are trying to low-ball me, Daddy. And I know how you say, "Never accept a first offer", so I figure these grades are just a jumping off point to start negotiations.


 MEL

 Very good.


 (One of the mobile phones rings, everyone answers their phone)

 CHER

 Dee?


 JOSH

 Yeah?


 MEL

 Hello? Yeah, Jake, what? NO! Not the afternoon.


 (Cher and Josh put their phones down)

 CHER

 You are such a brown-noser.


 JOSH

 Oh, and you are such a superficial space-cadet. What makes you think you can get teachers to change your grades?


 MEL (in background)

 I told you I wanted it in the morning! Doesn't he understand? In the morning.


 CHER

 Only the fact that I've done it every other semester.


 SCENE VII - VARIOUS SCHOOL LOCALES

 "Shake some action" Cracker

 CHER V.O.

 I told my P.E. teaher an evil male had broken my heart, so she raised my C to a B.


 CHER

 I'm so miserable. I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't study.


 MISS STOEGER

 They're slime, they're slime, I mean they're horrible, don't feel bad, don't feel bad, I know, and you see they're all like this.


 CHER V.O.

 Then I promised Miss Giest I'd start a letter writing campaign to my congressman about violations of the clean air act.


 But Mr. Hall was totally rigid. He said my debates were unresearched, unstructured, and unconvincing, AS IF!


 I felt impotent and out of control, which I really hate. I needed to find sanctuary in a place where I could gather my thoughts and regain my strength.


 SCENE VIII - THE MALL

 DIONNE

 Dude, what's wrong? Are you suffering from buyer's remorse or something?


 (Watch Cher flick her head)

 CHER

 God, no! Nothing like that. It's just that, we've been shopping all day and I still don't know what to do about Mr. Hall. I have tried everything to convince him of my scholastic aptitude, but I was brutally rebuffed.


 DIONNE

 Get over it, OK. He's a miserable little man who wants to make everyone else miserable too.


 CHER

 Dee, that's it! We've got to figure out a way to make Mr. Hall sublimely happy.


 SCENE IX - SCHOOL

 CHER V.O.

 Here's the four-one-one on Mr. Hall. He's single, he's 47, and he earns minor duckets for a thankless job. What that man needs is a good healthy boinkfest. Unfortunately, there was a major babe drought in our school. The evil trolls from the math department were actually married,... oooh Snickers... and in the grand tradition of P.E. teachers, Ms. Stoeger seemed to be same-sex oriented. Of course, there was always Miss Giest. Something told me not to discount Miss Giest. Well sure, she has runs in her stockings, and her slip is always showing, and she always has more lipstick on her teeth than her mouth. God, this woman is screaming for a make-over. I'm her only hope.


 (Cher is writing a note outside Miss Giest's pidgeon hole)

 DIONNE

 Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May but thy eternal summer shall not fade. Phat! Did you write that?


 CHER

 Duh, it's like a famous quote.


 DIONNE

 From where?


 CHER

 Cliff's notes.


 DIONNE

 Oh.


 (Travis and Miss Giest walk out of her office toward where Cher and Dionne have split the scene)

 MISS GIEST

 I know you're going to be better now. Now, you run along and I'll see you third period and you will try to remember to bring your textbook.


 TRAVIS

 Uh, OK.


 (Miss Giest reads the note left by the girls and her face brightens)

 DIONNE

 Oh, my God! She actually looked happy!


 CHER

 Oooh, classic!


 (Scene changes to Mr. Hall's classroom)

 MR HALL

 Paroudasm Budapshawn, 16 tardies to work off.


 (Paroudasm mutters something in Farsi and his friends cheer)

 Janet Huon, no tardies.


 CLASSMATES

 Kisser!


 MR HALL

 Travis Berkenstock, 38 tardies. By far the most tardies in the class. Congratulations.


 (The whole class cheers and applaudes. Travis approaches the podium)

 TRAVIS 

 This is so unexpected, I, uh, I didn't even have a speech prepared. Uh, but I would like to say this: Tardiness is not something you can do all on your own. Many, many people contributed to my tardiness. Uh, I'd like to thank my parents for never giving me a ride to school, the L.A. city bus driver for taking a chance on an unknown kid, and, uh, last but not least, the wonderful crew at McDonalds for spending hours making those egg McMuffins, without which I might never be tardy.


 MR HALL 

 Well, if Mr. Berkenstock has no political messages to include in his speech, I'll go on. Cher Horowitz, two tardies.


 CHER

 I object! Do you recall the dates of these alleged tardies?


 (Cher in lawyer mode. Legendary!)

 MR HALL

 One was last Monday!


 CHER

 Mr. Hall, I was surfing the crimson wave, I had to haul ass to the ladies'.


 MR HALL

 I assume your referring to women's troubles, and so I'll let that one slide.


 CHER

 Thank you, Mr. Hall. Miss Giest was right about you.


 MR HALL

 What do you mean?


 CHER

 Well, she said that you were the only one in this school with any intelligence.


 SCENE X - CHER'S HOUSE

 MEL

 Cher, get in here!


 CHER

 Yes, Daddy?


 MEL

 Would you tell me what the hell this is?


 CHER

 Um, a second notice for three outstanding tickets. I don't remember getting a first notice.


 MEL

 The ticket is the first notice. I didn't even know you could get tickets without a licence.


 CHER

 Oh, sure you can. You can get tickets anytime.


 MEL

 Oh, is that so?


 (Cher nods)

 Well not around here you can't. From this moment on, you will not drive, sit, do anything in that jeep without a supervised driver present. And no cruisin' around with Dionne, alright? Two permits do not equal a licence! Do I make myself clear?


 CHER

 Yes, Daddy.


 MEL

 Cher, I expect you to become a good driver. I want to see you apply yourself.


 CHER

 I will. I'm gonna practise real hard.


 MEL

 OK. 

 (The scene moves to the poolside)

 CHER V.O. 

 A licenced driver with nothing to do? Where would I find such a loser?


 CHER

 Hey, granola breath, you got something on your chin.


 JOSH

 I'm growing a goatee.


 CHER

 Oh, that's good. You don't want to be the last one at the coffee house without chin pubes.


 JOSH

 I can't tell you how much I enjoy these little chats of ours, but in the interest of saving time, why don't you just tell me what you want.


 CHER

 OK. So, actually, I have a permit and I can drive and all, but Daddy says I can't take the jeep out without a licenced driver, and since your not doing anything and all, you know?


 JOSH

 What are the chances of you shutting up until you get your way?


 CHER

 Hmmm, slim to none. C'mon!


 SCENE XI - CHER'S CAR

 JOSH

 Hey, James Bond, in America we drive on the right side of the road.


 CHER

 I am. You try driving in platforms.


 JOSH 

 Look, I got to get back to school. Ah, you want to practise parking?


 CHER

 What's the point? Everywhere you go has valet. What class you going to?


 JOSH

 Actually, I'm going to a tree people meeting. Me might get Marky Mark to plant a celebrity tree.


 CHER

 How fabulous. Getting Marky Mark to take time from his busy pants-dropping schedule to plant trees? Josh, why don't you just hire a gardener?


 JOSH

 You know, maybe Marky Mark wants to use his popularity for a good cause, make a contribution. In case you have never heard of that, a contribution is the giving of...


 CHER

 Excuse me, but I have donated many expensive Italian outfits to Lucy...


 JOSH

 time... funds...


 CHER

 And as soon as I get my licence I fully intend to brake for animals, and I have contributed many hours helping two lonely teachers find romance.


 JOSH 

 Which I'll bet serves your interest more than theirs. You know, if I ever saw you do something that wasn't ninety percent selfish, I'd die of shock.


 CHER

 Oh, that'd be reason enough for me.


 SCENE XII - SCHOOL

 CHER

 Would you call me selfish?


 DIONNE

 No. Not to your face.


 CHER

 Really?


 DIONNE

 What's wrong? Is Josh giving you shit because he's going through his post-adolescent idealistic phase?


 CHER

 Look, there's Mr. Hall.


 (The girls run over to Mr. Hall)

 Mr. Hall, Mr. Hall, Mr. Hall, um, do you drink coffee?


 MR HALL

 Well, not from this cafeteria. But, uh, yes under normal circumstances.


 CHER

 Well, I am such a retard. When I was packing Daddy's lunch this morning I gave him my lemon snapple, and I took his sucky Italian roast. Do you want it?


 MR HALL

 Are you sure you don't want it?


 CHER

 Duh, it might stunt my growth. I wanna be 5'10" like Cindy Crawford. But I thought maybe you and Miss Giest might like it?


 DIONNE

 Maybe you can share it?


 MR HALL

 Well, uh, thanks.


 CHER

 Sure.


 (To Dionne)

 Hmm?


 (Outside Miss Giest's office, she opens the door)

 CHER & DIONNE

 Miss Giest!


 MISS GIEST

 Hi girls. Did you sign up for the environmental fair?


 DIONNE

 Oh, yeah, we will.


 CHER

 You have such pretty eyes. Don't hide them. And these clips are so cute.


 DIONNE

 And this tiny little waist. Oooh, wow.


 MISS GIEST

 Girls. Oh, and don't forget to sign up for the environmental fair.


 DIONNE

 Not a total betty, but a vast improvement.


 CHER

 Well, we did our best. 


 DIONNE

 Mmmm, Hmmm.


 CHER

 We gotta book it if we're going to make it to P.E.


 (Scene moves outside)

 C'mon, Dee.


 DIONNE

 Ohh, I feel like failing, dude, c'mon.


 CHER

 I know what you mean, but at least it's exercise. I feel like such a heffer. I had two bowls of special K, three pieces of turkey bacon, a handful of popcorn, five peanut butter M&M's, and like, three pieces of licorice.


 DIONNE

 (Gasp) Oh, my God. Look. Is that a photo op, or what?


 CHER

 Will you look at that body language? Legs crossed towards each other. That's an unequivocal sex invite.


 DIONNE

 Oh, Cher, he's getting her digits. Look at Giest, she is so cute.


 CHER

 Ohh, old people can be so sweet.


 "Change" Lightning Seeds

 (The following scenes show Miss Giest and Mr. Hall get it on while everyone is thanking Cher.)


 CHER V.O.

 The entire student body was utterly grateful for the improvement in their grades.


 SCENE XIII - CHER'S HOUSE

 MEL

 Cher, what's this all about?


 CHER

 My report card?


 MEL

 The same semester?


 CHER

 Uh-huh.


 MEL

 What'd you do? Turn in some extra-credit reports?


 CHER

 No.


 MEL

 You take the mid-terms over?


 CHER

 Uh-uh.


 MEL 

 You mean to tell me that you argued your way from a C+ to an A-?


 CHER

 Totally based on my powers of persuasion. You proud?


 MEL

 Honey, I couldn't be happier than if they were based on real grades.


 CHER

 Thank you.


 MEL

 Fabulous.


 SCENE XIV - SCHOOL P.E.

 "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" Robert Hazard

 CHER V.O.

 I felt so satisfied, I wanted to do more good deeds.


 (Dionne sneezes)

 CHER

 Dee, when your allergies act up, take out your nose-ring.


 MISS STOEGER

 Follow... through! There you go, there you go. All right, Cher. Earth to Cher! Come in Cher!


 CHER

 Oh. Miss Stoeger? I would just like to say that physical education in this school is a disgrace. I mean, standing in line for forty minutes is hardly aerobically effective. I doubt I've worked off the calories in a stick of care-free gum.


 (Class cheers)

 MISS STOEGER

 Well, you certainly exercised your mouth Cher. Now, hit the ball.


 (Ball flies by, inches from Cher's nose)

 CHER

 Miss Stoeger, that machine is just a lawsuit waiting to happen!


 MISS STOEGER 

 Thanks for the legal advice.


 (Cher returns to line)

 Dionne? You're up.


 DIONNE

 Uh, no, Miss Stoeger? I have a note from my tennis instructor, and he would prefer it if I didn't expose myself to any training that might derail his teachings.


 MISS STOEGER

 Fine! Amber?


 AMBER

 Miss Stoeger. My plastic surgeon doesn't want me doing any activity where balls fly at my nose.


 DIONNE

 Well, there goes your social life.


 (Girls giggle. Principal walks onto the scene)

 PRINCIPAL

 Miss Stoeger? Got another one. Ladies, we have a new student with us. This is Tai Frasier.


 MISS STOEGER

 Tai, you don't have time to change, but you could hit a few balls in those clothes.


 AMBER

 She could be a farmer in those clothes.


 CHER

 Dee, my mission is clear. Would you look at that girl? She is so adorably clueless. We have got to adopt her.


 DIONNE

 Cher, she is toe-up. Our stock would plummet.


 CHER

 Dee, don't you want to use your popularity for a good cause?


 DIONNE

 No.


 CHER

 (Motions to Tai)

 C'mere. Yeah, c'mere. Hang with us.


 TAI

 Oh, thank you.


 CHER

 How do you like California?


 TAI

 Man, I am freakin'. I could really use some sort of a herbal refreshment?


 DIONNE

 Well, we do lunch in ten minutes. We don't have any tea, but we have Coke and stuff.


 TAI

 No shit! You guys got Coke here?


 DIONNE

 Well, yeah.


 CHER

 Yeah, this is America.


 (Scene changes to the girls walking down main path)

 "Unknown song and artist"

 CHER V.O.

 So, we decided to show Tai the ropes at Bronson Alcott High School.


 CHER

 That is Alana's group over there. They do the T.V. station. They think that's the most important thing on Earth. And that's the Persian mafia. You can't hang with them unless you own a BMW. And there's Elton in the white vest, and all the most popular boys in the school.


 DIONNE

 Including my boyfriend. Ain't he cute?


 TAI

 Yeah.


 CHER

 If you make the decision to date a high school boy, they are the only acceptable ones.


 TAI

 Cher, which one of them is your boyfriend?


 CHER

 As if!


 DIONNE

 Cher's got attitude about high school boys.


 CHER

 It's a personal choice every woman has got to make for herself.


 (Murray approaches the girls)

 MURRAY (to Dionne) 

 Woman, lend me five dollars.


 DIONNE

 Murray, I have asked you repeatedly not to call me Woman!


 MURRAY

 Excuse me, Miss Dionne. 


 DIONNE

 Thank you.


 MURRAY 

 OK, but street slang is an increasingly valid form of expression. Most of the feminine pronouns do have mocking, but not necessarily in a misogynistic undertone.


 (Murray hops away)

 TAI

 Wow! You guys talk like grown-ups.


 CHER

 Oh, well, this is a really good school.


 TAI

 I'm gonna go get a soda. You guys want?


 CHER

 Sure.


 TAI

 Alright.


 DIONNE

 She's nice.


 CHER

 Oooh, project!


 (I can't put that cute little squeal into words)

 (Scene changes to inside cafeteria)

 "My Iron Lung" Radiohead

 TRAVIS (To food)

 Oh, wow. That's disgusting.


 (To Tai)

 That's nice representation.


 TAI

 Thanks. Those are really nice stickers.


 TRAVIS

 Oh, you like 'em? See, I was thinking it was too cluttered. You know, I wanna wipe all of this out and concentrate on one main decorative statement. Like, uh, Marvin the Martian. Right there.


 TAI

 Get outa town! I can do Marvin the Martian.


 TRAVIS

 Really?


 TAI

 Well, I mean, there's not really a lot to him. But, you wanna see?


 TRAVIS

 Yeah.


 TAI

 Here.


 TRAVIS

 Oh, wow! That's really cool.


 TAI

 Thanks.


 TRAVIS

 You drew that?


 TAI

 Yeah, and wait, I got... one here.


 TRAVIS

 You didn't trace this?


 TAI

 Uh-uh. No. Here's another one over here. And, lots of little guys. 


 TRAVIS

 That is so cute! 


 TAI

 I love to draw.


 TRAVIS

 You're really good at it.


 TAI

 No.


 TRAVIS

 Yeah, really you are.


 TAI

 No.


 TRAVIS

 Yeah!


 (Scene changes to outside)

 DIONNE

 Are you sure that's fat free?


 CHER

 Oh, yes. And you lose wait by doing it like this. Like really small.


 (Dionne giggles/hisses)

 It's true.


 TAI

 I met a really cool guy.


 CHER

 Describe!


 TAI

 Alright, he's got long hair, he's really funny, and straight off, right? He offers me some smoke. There he is!


 CHER

 Are you talking about drugs?


 TAI

 Yeah.


 CHER

 Tai, how old are you?


 TAI

 I'll be sixteen in May.


 CHER

 My birthday is in April, and as someone older, can I please give you some advice?


 (Tai nods)

 It is one thing to spark up a dubie and get laced at parties, but it is quite another to be fried all day.


 DIONNE

 Do you see the distinction?


 TAI

 Yeah.


 CHER

 Loadies generally hang on the grassy knoll over there.


 "unknown song and artist" guitarish

 Sometimes they come to class and say bonehead things, and we all laugh, of course. But no respectable girl actually dates them. 


 DIONNE

 Hmm-mm.


 CHER 

 You don't want to start off on the wrong foot, do you?????????????


 (TAI shakes her head)

 I've got an idea. Let's do a make-over!


 (Dionne lights up)

 TAI

 No, no.


 DIONNE

 Oh, c'mon! Let us! Cher's main thrill in life is a make-over. OK, it gives her a sense of control on a world full of chaos.


 CHER

 Pleeeaaase.


 (How could anyone resist that?!)

 TAI

 Sure. Why not? Shit! You guys! I have never had straight friends before.


  


 SCENE XV - MAKE-OVER AT CHER'S HOUSE

 "Supermodel" Jill Sobule

 (Various scenes of Cher and Dionne making over Tai, then Cher and Tai working out in the lounge room)

 CHER

 Squeeze in.


 TAI

 Cher, I don't wanna do this any more, and my buns, they don't feel nothin' like steel.


 CHER

 OK, it will get easier, I promise. Just as long as we do it every day. Not just sporadically.


 TAI

 How do you know if we're doing it sporadically?


 CHER

 That's another thing, Tai. We've got to work on your accent and vocabulary. See, sporadic means once in a while. Try and use it in a sentence today.


 TAI

 Alright.


 CHER

 OK, from now on we're alternating Cindy Crawford's "Aerobicise" and "Buns of Steel", and reading one non-school book a week. My first book is "Fit or Fat".


 TAI

 Mine is "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus".


 CHER

 Good. Now that takes care of our minds and bodies, but we should do something good for mankind or the planet for a couple of hours.


 (Josh walks in)

 JOSH

 Hey, brainiac.


 CHER

 Uh, the dreaded ex. Tai, this is Josh.


 JOSH

 Nice to meet ya.


 CHER 

 Hey! You know about this stuff. I want to do something good for humanity.


 JOSH

 How about sterilization?


 (Tai cracks up. Cher and Josh enter the kitchen)

 CHER

 So, what do ya think?


 JOSH

 I'm amazed.


 CHER

 That I'm devoting myself so generously to someone else?


 JOSH

 No, that you've found someone even more clueless than you are to worship you.


 CHER

 I am rescuing her from teenage hell. Do you know the wounds from adolescence can take years to heal?


 JOSH

 Yeah, and you've never had a mother so you're acting out on that poor girl as if she was your Barbie doll.


 CHER

 Freshman psych rears it's ugly head


 JOSH

 Hey, I am not taking psych.


 CHER

 Whatever. I am going to take that lost soul in there and make her well-dressed and popular. Her life will be better because of me. How many girls can say that about you?


 (Josh and Cher walk back to the lounge where Tai is watching T.V. and singing along with the "Mentos" ad. God I hate those ads!)

 JOSH

 Be seein' ya.


 TAI

 Yeah, I hope not sporadically.


 SCENE XVI - SCHOOL

 CHER

 Oh, my God. Do you see how boys are responding? My heart is totally bursting.


 DIONNE

 I know. I'm kvelling!

 (Travis approaches)


 TRAVIS

 Cher, you have Timor, right?


 CHER

 Giest.


 TRAVIS

 Hey, Tai! Did you get a flyer?


 TAI

 Uh-uh.


 TRAVIS

 Here.


 TAI

 Thanks. Wow, a party!


 CHER

 It's in the Valley. The cops usually break 'em up in less than an hour, and it takes that long to get there.


 DIONNE

 And besides, it's just local loadies.


 TAI

 Do you guys think that Travis is gonna be there?


 DIONNE

 Tai, I thought we moved on from there.


 CHER

 Don't sell yourself short now. You've got something going for you that no one in this school has.


 TAI

 Oh, I'm not a virgin.


 CHER

 I mean mystery. As far as everyone is concerned you were the most popular girl in your school, and the fact that you hang with Dee and I, well...


 DIONNE

 Speaks very highly of you.


 CHER

 If you strike while the iron is hot, you can have any guy that you want.


 TAI

 Like who?


 CHER

 Let's see. Who's available? There's Bronson... I got it! Elton! He just broke up with Collette.


 DIONNE

 Oh, yes!


 TAI

 Who's Elton?


 DIONNE

 Oh, my God. He's way popular. He's like the social director of the crew.


 CHER

 Yeah, and his Dad can get you into any concert, and I noticed him scoping you out.


 TAI

 He was looking at me?


 CHER

 He said you gave him a toothache.


 TAI

 How'd I do that?


 CHER

 It's an expression. It means he thought you were sweet.


 TAI

 Yeah?


 CHER

 Yeah.


 TAI

 Wow.


 DIONNE

 Is that true?


 CHER

 No.


 DIONNE

 Oh, you are so bad.


 (Scene moves to fountain where Cher is taking pictures of the crew)

 "Alright" Supergrass

 CHER

 Ok, you guys, all get together. Oh, that is great. Smile! Tai, Tai, get a little closer. Closer Tai. Good, great! Hey, Elton, uh, why don't you put your arm around Tai?


 ELTON

 (Unwillingly) Alright!


 CHER

 Yeah, that's great.


 (Check out Cher's little smile and rock! Awesome!)

 OK. Tai, c'mere, c'mere, Tai.


 (Scene moves to just Cher and Tai by bushes)

 Hold that.


 TAI

 OK. 

 CHER

 OK. 

 (Elton approaches.)

 ELTON

 Cool picture.


 CHER

 Doesn't she look classic?


 ELTON

 Yeah, this is beautiful.


 CHER

 She looks like one of those Bottichellis chicks.


 ELTON

 Hey, why don't you make me a copy of this, OK?


 CHER

 Sure.


 (Another one of Cher's little squeals. Classic!)

 SCENE XVII - CHER'S HOUSE, DINING ROOM

 CHER

 Hi Daddy. This is my friend, Tai.


 MEL

 Get out of my chair!


 (Tai moves to opposite Cher. Lucy brings in dinner.)

 CHER

 Thank you, Lucy. It looks great.


 MEL

 What is this crap?


 CHER

 Daddy, it's from the "Cut your Colesterol" cook book. Doctor Lovitz says you've got to get down to two hundred.


 (Cher's pager beeps.)

 MEL

 No calls tonight.


 CHER

 But it's Dionne, it might...


 MEL

 Sorry!


 CHER

 It might be important.


 MEL 

 We're going to have a nice family dinner. So, uh, what'd you do at school today?


 CHER

 Well... I broke in my purple clogs.


 (Mel's phone rings.)

 MEL

 Yeah, hello? Alright, Jake. Yeah, yeah, no, no, what?


 CHER

 Dee? Whatup?


 DIONNE

 So, check it. Murray's geometry class is right by Elton's locker, and taped up inside was the picture you took of Tai.


 CHER

 Oh, my God.


 TAI

 What?


 CHER

 Elton's got a picture of you hanging up in his locker.


 TAI

 Oh, no shit!


 DIONNE 

 Hello! So, anyway, the whole crew is going to this party in the Valley.


 CHER

 Bye. 


 (Cher hangs up the phone.)

 Looks like we're going to have to make a cameo at the Val party.


 MEL (in background)

 I told you I want it in the morning. No!


 SCENE XVIII - MURRAY'S CAR

 DIONNE

 Murray!


 MURRAY

 Just look at the top of the map. Sun Valley is north.


 DIONNE

 OK, no. All I see is Bel Air, OK. 

 MURRAY

 Then you're on the wrong map. 

 DIONNE

 I am not on the wrong map.


 MURRAY

 Look at the number on the top. What is the number on the top?


 DIONNE

 There are no numbers on the top. There's letters.


 (Murray makes a frustrated noise.)

 DIONNE

 Murray, shut up!


 CHER

 Please don't friz out!


 SCENE XIX - THE VAL PARTY

 (The gang pull up outside the party.)

 Listen Tai, when we get there make sure Elton sees you, but don't say hi first. Look like you're having fun and you're really popular. Talk to someone in his eyeline, preferably a guy. Make him come to you, and find an excuse to leave while he's still into the conversation. The key is, always have him wanting more. You got it?


 TAI

 I got it.


 CHER

 OK. 

 TRAVIS

 Heads up!


 (Does a rail slide with his skateboard on the stair-rail.)

 TAI

 Oh, did you just see that?!


 CHER

 Oh, God. Skateboards, that is like, so five years ago.


 TRAVIS

 Oh, you guys came! That's great! You want a beer? I'll get you one.


 CHER (to Tai)

 No.


 (The girls enter the party house.)

 "Unknown song and artist"

 TAI

 This is ragin'.


 CHER

 Let's do a lap before we commit to a location.


 (Dionne drags a dancing girl away from Murray.)

 DIONNE

 Who was that?!


 TAI

 Cher, ain't that the same dress that you was wearin' yesterday?


 CHER

 Say, Ambular?


 AMBER

 Hi.


 CHER

 Was that you going through my laundry?


 AMBER

 As if. Like I would really wear something from Judy's.


 CHER

 Do you prefer fashion victim or ensembly challenged?


 (Amber walks off.)

 AMBER

 Uh!


 CHER

 What a clone.


 TAI

 Cher, you looked much better in that dress than she did.


 (Travis bursts onto the scene spilling drink on Cher's shoes.)

 CHER

 Uh! Ruin my satin shoes, why don't you?!


 TRAVIS

 I'm sorry.


 (They move to the kitchen.)

 CHER

 Excuse me, my shoes! Uh! This is so not fixable.


 TRAVIS

 It's a small price to pay to the party gods. Look, I'll make amends. How about some chronic shit?


 CHER

 Oh, it's the least you could do.


 TAI

 Spark it.


 CHER

 Hey, Elton's over there. Act like Travis is saying something funny.


 (Tai hands joint to Cher and blows smoke in her face.)

 TAI

 Sorry.


 (Tai starts cracking up.)

 TRAVIS

 What's so funny?


 TAI

 Nothing.


 (Elton approaches and reaches behind Cher for the joint)

 CHER

 Oh, here.


 (Summer enters holding a card)

 SUMMER

 Hey, everyone! Let's play suck and blow.


 (The card passes through the group until Elton drops it (on purpose) and plants one right on Cher's mouth)

 CHER

 God, Elton. Can you suck?


 (Dionne screams in the background)

 It's Dee. C'mon!


 (Scene changes to the bathroom, where Murray is getting his head shaved)

 DIONNE

 What have you done! Oh, my God! Uh! Why did you do this to your head?!


 MURRAY

 Because I'm keeping it real. Because I'm keeping it real.


 DIONNE

 What?!


 MURRAY

 'Cause I'm keeping it... 'cause I'm keeping it real.


 DIONNE (to Cher)

 Look! Look what he's done to his head! Can you believe this?


 MURRAY

 Look at Lawrence's head. Alright?


 LAWRENCE

 It's the bomb!


 MURRAY

 You know what I'm sayin'? You look good.


 LAWRENCE

 As will you.


 DIONNE

 What'd you care what he thinks, Murray? I'm the one that has to look at you. That was a big mistake. What am I going to do with you now? And right before the year book pictures? What am I going to tell my grandchildren?


 MURRAY

 Alright.


 DIONNE

 You know what? Ok, that's it.


 MURRAY (mimicking)

 That's it.


 DIONNE

 You wanna play games?


 MURRAY (mimicking agin)

 You wanna play games?


 DIONNE

 I'm calling your mother.


 MURRAY

 I'm... I'm ca... Oh, wait! Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, wait. Don't call my Ma.


 LAWRENCE

 Yo, man. Chill, chill!


 MURRAY

 Chill?!


 (Cher and Tai start walking away)

 CHER

 Same thing happened at the spring dance. She spent the entire after-party in the bathroom.


 TAI

 See, that almost destroyed by buzz.


 CHER

 I'm still baked.


 TAI

 Yeah.


 (Back to the dance floor.)

 "Rollin' With My Homies" Coolio

 CHER

 What do ya say, we go bump into people?


 TAI

 Yeah, I'm cool with that.


 TRAVIS (from on the fireplace)

 Hey, Tai! Wait up! Whooh!


 (Travis jumps onto the crowd. No one keeps him up and he hits the deck.)

 TAI

 Are you OK?


 TRAVIS (to dancers)

 Where's your sense of pit hospitality?


 TAI

 That was so cool, the way you did that. I wish I could do it.


 TRAVIS

 Oh, no, don't.


 TAI

 Why not?


 TRAVIS

 Well, 'cause if girls did it, what would guys do to impress them?


 TAI

 I don't know, like stuff. You know?


 TRAVIS

 What kind of stuff?


 (Cher spots Travis tuning Tai and butts in to stop it)

 CHER

 Tai, I need you.


 TAI

 OK. 

 CHER

 Elton's over there.


 (The girls start dancing. As Tai is trying to impress Elton she is hit in the head by a flying Clog)

 CHER

 Tai! Tai, Elton, help me!


 (Elton carries Tai into the kitchen and places her on the counter)

 CHER

 Thank you.


 TRAVIS

 Here, you should use ice.


 CHER

 No, Travis! We've got it under control. 


 TRAVIS

 Tai, are you OK?


 CHER

 Travis, Tai would have wanted you to enjoy the party.


 CHER 

 If it's a concussion, you have to keep her concious, OK? Ask her questions.


 ELTON

 What's seven times seven?


 CHER

 Stuff she knows!


 (Tai sits up and hits her head on the light. What a clutz!)

 ELTON

 Some bump you've got there.


 TAI

 Yeah.


 ELTON

 Yeah? You ready to go back out there?


 TAI

 Yeah, I am.


 ELTON

 Alright. Are you sure? Can you do this? (Singing) Rollin' with the homies.


 TAI

 (Singing) Rollin' with the homies. 


 (Great voice.)

 ELTON

 Yeah, let's do it. You're ready.


 (Elton and Tai go back to the dance floor.)

 CHER V.O.

 I had to give myself snaps for all the good deeds I was doing. It was so great. Love was everywhere. Even though I was alone, I was really happy for Tai. It's like that book I read in ninth grade that said, "'tis a far, far better thing doing stuff for other people."


 (Scene changed to outside by the pool. Cher's phone rings.)

 CHER 

 Hello?


 MEL

 Do you know what time it is?


 CHER

 A watch really doesn't go with this outfit, Daddy.


 MEL

 Where are you?


 CHER

 Uuhh, just having a snack with my girlfriends.


 MEL

 Where, in Kuwait?!


 CHER

 Is that in the Valley?


 MEL

 Cher, I expect you to walk in this door in twenty minutes.


 CHER

 Well, um, it might take longer than that, Dad.


 MEL

 Everywhere in L.A. takes twenty minutes.


 (Cher hangs up the phone.)

 (Scene changes to outside front of party house.)

 CHER

 Sorry to make you leave, Dionne is bucking for best dramatic actress at a Val party.


 (Tai laughs.)

 CHER

 Hey, Summer!


 SUMMER

 Hi! Pretty random fiesta. Need a ride home?


 CHER

 That'd be great! Thanks!


 ELTON

 No, I got it.


 SUMMER

 Well, I'm right below Wilshire and Lindon.


 TAI

 Oh, that's right near me! I'm, um, above Olympic.


 ELTON

 Great! Then, Tai you'll go with Summer, and Cher you'll come with me.


 CHER

 Actually, you could take Wilshire to Cannon and that turns into Bennedict.


 ELTON

 Well, then she'd have to go back south and I'm already going north.


 CHER

 But, you could take Tai on your way up to Sunset. Yeah.


 ELTON

 That doesn't make any sense! I'd have to get off the freeway, I hate that. Tai, go with Summer, Cher, you'll come with me. Watch your feet.


 (Each get into respective cars and wave each other goodbye.)

 SCENE XX - ELTON'S CAR

 "Away" The Cranberries

 (Elton is singing along to music. Trying to be sexy, but he fails miserably, the sleazy bastard!)

 CHER

 Didn't Tai look cute tonight?


 (Elton just sings.)

 I really love her hair when it's all wild, you know? But it's also very pretty when it's all up, with that curly tendrils. Like in that picture I took.


 ELTON

 You know, you're one of my best friends and I do not have friends that are girls.


 CHER

 Well, I'm glad, because your happiness means a lot to me.


 ELTON

 It does?


 CHER

 Sure. I mean, I saw how hard your breakup with Collette was.


 ELTON

 Yeah. I think we both know what it feels like to be lonely.


 CHER

 Whatever. The thing is, is that I'd really like to see you settled already.


 (Elton pulls the car into a parking lot.)

 Where are we going?


 (The car stops.)

 ELTON

 I knew it, I knew it.


 (Elton makes a pass at Cher.)

 CHER

 Oooh, you knew what?!


 ELTON

 That you were totally sprung on me.


 CHER

 Hello?! Don't you mean Tai?


 ELTON

 Tai?!


 CHER

 You have her picture in your locker.


 ELTON

 I have the picture you took in my locker.


 CHER

 Ohh, I'm having a twin peaks experience.


 ELTON

 I knew it, I knew it when you kissed me.


 CHER

 Suck and Blow is a game, Elton!


 (Elton has another go at Cher.)

 Stop it!


 ELTON

 Alright! You know, I don't get you Cher. I mean, you flirt with me all year.


 CHER

 As if! I have been tryng to get you together with Tai.


 ELTON

 Tai?! Why would I go with Tai?


 CHER

 Why not?


 ELTON

 Why not? Why not?! Don't you even know who my father is?


 CHER

 You are snob and a half.


 ELTON

 Cher, listen to me. Me and Tai, I mean, we don't make any sense, right? Me and you, well, makes sense.


 (Elton tries for Cher, yet again.)

 CHER

 Cut it out!


 ELTON

 C'mon.


 CHER

 Stop it!


 (Cher gets out of the car.)

 (Watch Cher compose herself after getting out of the car. i.e. the head movements and sound effects.)

 ELTON

 Cher?! Where are you going? You're only hurting yourself here, baby. C'mon, you gonna walk home? Would you get back in the car, please? Get back in the car.


 CHER

 Leave me alone!


 ELTON

 Fine!


 (Elton drives away. What a prick!)

 CHER

 Hey, where are you going? Shit!


 (Cher whips out the phone and dials)

 OPERATOR

 Valley information.


 CHER

 Yeah, do you have the number of a cab company?


 OPERATOR

 Which one?


 CHER

 I don't know which one. What do you have out here?


 OPERATOR

 We have Valley Cabs...


 ROBBER

 Hand it over.


 (Cher squeals/moans)

 Give me the phone.


 (Cher complies)

 OK. Bag, too. C'mon! Alright, now, uh, get down on the ground. Face down. C'mon!


 CHER

 Oh, no. You don't understand, this is an Alaia.


 ROBBER

 An a-what-a?


 CHER

 It's like a totally important designer.


 ROBBER

 And I will totally shoot you in the head. Get down!


 (Cher whimpers as she lies down on the pavement)

 Alright, um, count to a hundred. Thank you.


 CHER

 One, two...


 CHER V.O.

 The evening had turned into a royal mess. Sexually harrassed, robbed. I didn't know the number of the party, so I couldn't call Dionne, and Daddy would kill me if he knew where I was. There was just one person left to call, and I really, really didn't want to call him.


 (Cher dials up Josh's place. He's trying to get it on with his girlfriend)

 JOSH

 C'mon.


 (Phone rings)

 Hello.


 CHER

 Josh, you busy?


 HEATHER

 Who is it?


 JOSH

 It's Mel's daughter.


 CHER

 So, OK, I was at this party, and my designated driver tried to attack me, so I got out 'cause we'd stopped, and then he drove off and deserted me, and then this guy with a gun held me up, took my money, and my phone and he yelled at me and he forced me to ruin my dress.


 JOSH

 OK, OK, look, um. Where are you?


 CHER

 Sun Valley.


 JOSH

 Man, you owe me.


 SCENE XXI - JOSH'S CAR

 "The Ghost in You" Counting Crows

 HEATHER

 The man is ridiculous. He doesn't have one unique thought in his little, puny brain.


 JOSH

 I think there's some merit in learning the form straight off.

 SCENE XXIV - CHER'S HOUSE

 CHER V.O.

 Suddenly, Daddy had a case that had to be solved right away, so some clerks and Josh came to help him go through a gazillion depositions.


 (The doorbell rings)

 CHER (from upstairs)

 Daddy!


 MEL

 What?


 CHER

 I can't just open it, I have to make him wait a while.


 MEL

 Then he can wait outside.


 CHER

 Josh, pleeeaaase!


 (Who could resist that?!)

 C'mon, Josh? C'mon.


 (Josh opens the door. Christian walks right in)

 CHRISTIAN

 What do ya hear?


 JOSH

 She's not ready.


 (The two of them walk over to where Mel is working)

 CHRISTIAN

 Hey, man.


 (Christian extends his hand, but Mel ignores it)

 Nice pile of bricks you got here.


 MEL

 You drink?


 CHRISTIAN

 No, thanks. I'm cool.


 MEL

 I'm not offering, I'm asking you if you drink? You think I'd give alcohol to teenage drivers taking my daughter out?


 CHRISTIAN

 Hey, man. The protective vibe, I dig.


 MEL

 What's with you kid? You think the death of Sammy Davis left an opening in the Rat Pack?


 (Cher appears walking down the stairs. Josh and every male in the audience is stunned)

 CHER

 Christian.


 CHRISTIAN

 Doll face.


 CHER

 Handsome.


 CHRISTIAN

 Stunning.


 JOSH (to Mel)

 You're not letting her go out like that, are ya?


 MEL

 Cher, get in here.


 CHER

 What's up, Daddy?


 MEL

 What the hell is that?


 CHER

 A dress.


 MEL

 Says who?


 CHER

 Calvin Klein.


 MEL

 It looks like underwear. Go upstairs and put something over it.


 CHER

 Duh, I was just going to.


 (Cher runs off)

 MEL 

 Hey, you?!


 (Christian turns around)

 Anything happens to my daughter, I got a .45 and shovel. I doubt anybody would miss you.


 (Cher reappears)

 CHER

 Bye, Daddy. C'mon!


 (They walk out)

 CHER

 It's so killer!


 CHRISTIAN

 Thank you. Your dad is pretty scary.


 CHER

 Isn't he?


 CHRISTIAN

 You like Billie Holiday?


 CHER

 I love him.


 CHRISTIAN

 Right.


 "Miss Brown To You" Billie Holiday

 (They drive off)

 JOSH

 I didn't like him.


 MEL

 What's to like?


 JOSH

 I think I should go to the party.


 MEL

 If you feel like you should go...


 JOSH

 You don't need me, do ya?


 MEL

 No, no, no.


 JOSH

 I mean, unless you want? I mean, unless you want?


 MEL

 Josh! Go to the party. Go, go, go, go.


 JOSH

 OK. I'll watch her for you.


 (Josh walks off)

 MEL

 You do that.


 SCENE XXV - THE FRAT PARTY

 "Someday I Suppose" Mighty Mighty Bosstones

 (Everyone is just dancing. Tai enters)

 CHER

 Tai!


 (Tai falls down the stairs on her butt! Classic!)

 Oh, my God. Tai, are you OK?


 TAI

 God, shit! That is so embarassing!


 CHER

 No, no one saw.


 TAI

 Now, all night long, I'm gonna be known as that girl who fell on her butt.


 CHER

 Tai, no one noticed.


 "Where'd You Go?" Mighty Mighty Bosstones

 COLLEGE GUY

 Wow! Are you OK? That looked really bad.


 TAI

 Yeah, thanks.


 (Tai spots Elton dancing with Amber.)

 Oh, my God, Cher, look. He's going with Amber?!


 CHER

 No, he's probably just dancing with her.


 TAI

 Do you think she's pretty?


 CHER

 No, she's a full on Monet.


 TAI

 What's a monet?


 CHER

 It's like a painting, see? From far away, it's OK, but up close, it's a big old mess. Let's ask a guy. Christian, what do you think of Amber?


 CHRISTIAN

 Hagsville.


 CHER

 See?


 CHRISTIAN

 Dig this. They're charging for brewskies. Cash me a five, I'll pay you back.


 CHER

 Sure.


 (Christian kisses Cher on the cheek)

 CHRISTIAN

 Thanks.


 (Christian walks away)

 TAI

 He is so cute!


 CHER

 Oh, my God. Do you see how he is falling in love with me?


 (The girls watch Christian shrug off an interested girl)

 I mean, look how he ignores every other girl.


 TAI

 Oh, God, look. There's Josh.


 CHER V.O.

 I didn't even see him come in, but it's like he finds the only adult in here, like he's deliberately trying to not have fun.


 (Watch the look on Cher's face as she's waving. Truly legend.)

 TAI

 Cher, I have a question. What do you think I should do with this thing? Should I, uh, like tie it around, or put it over my shoulder?


 CHER

 Tie it around your waist.


 CHRISTIAN

 Ready to slide?


 TAI

 Thanks.


 CHRISTIAN

 Let's go.


 (Christian and Cher return to the dance floor)

 CHER V.O.

 The band was kickin', and Christian was the hottest guy there, but my enjoyment was put on pause when I saw how unhappy Tai was.


 (Josh walks over to Tai, engages in small talk, then asks her to dance)

 CHER

 Oh, look, look! Josh is dancing with Tai, he never dances.


 CHRISTIAN

 I can see why.


 CHER

 No, he's doing her a prop so she won't feel left out.


 CHRISTIAN

 Oh, I dig it.


 (Time passes. Cher, Tai, Josh, and Christian are left. Christian is still dancing by himself)

 "Here (Squirmel Mix)" Luscious Jackson

 JOSH

 How are you guys holding up?


 CHER

 We're so ready to leave.


 TAI

 I'm tired.


 CHER

 Let's get Christian and go. Christian! You wanna go?


 CHRISTIAN

 Now? These guys here have got the skinny on the happenin' after hours.


 CHER

 My trainer's coming really, really early this morning.


 CHRISTIAN

 Oh.


 JOSH

 Look, I could take the girls home.


 CHRISTIAN

 No, it's OK.


 CHER

 No, I'm fine, stay.


 CHRISTIAN

 You sure?


 CHER

 Yeah, sure.


 CHRISTIAN (to Josh)

 Thanks, man. You got my marker.


 (to Cher) You are a down girl. I'll call you tomorrow.

 SCENE XXVI - JOSH'S CAR

 CHER

 That was really decent of you to dance with Tai tonight.


 JOSH

 My pleasure.


 CHER

 You notice any positive changes in her?


 JOSH

 Yeah, it's under your tutilage she's exploring the challenging world of bare midriffs. So you didn't want to make a night of it with the ring-a-ding kid?


 CHER

 Yeah, Daddy wouldn't go too ballistic, it's not like he's going to sleep or anything.


 JOSH

 No, not if they're going to finish those depo's.


 CHER

 Hey, you what would be so dope? If we got some really delicious take-out. I bet they haven't eaten all night.


 JOSH

 That would be pretty dope of us. Let's do it.


 SCENE XXVII - CHER'S HOUSE

 CHER V.O.

 The midnight snack totally revived the lawyers and Daddy was way grateful.


 MEL

 Mmm, Meat!


 CHER

 Meaty oranges and you get a lot of vitamin C.


 (Mel picks up a large sandwich)

 Daddy, no! Daddy, no. You know you can't have that...


 MEL

 Cher, c'mon!


 CHER

 Don't be silly.


 CHER V.O.

 I know it sounds mental, but sometimes I have more fun vegging out than when I go partying. Maybe because my party clothes are so binding.


 JOSH

 Look, I'm just curious. How many hours a day do you spend grooming yourself?


 CHER

 Some people are not lucky enough to be as naturally adorable as you are.


 JOSH

 Stop it, you're making me blush.


 (Phone rings. Cher answers)

 CHER

 Hello?


 GAIL

 Hi Cher, how are you?


 CHER

 Hi, Gail.


 GAIL

 Is my son there, cleaning out your refridgerator?


 (Josh motions a "No" to Cher)

 CHER

 No, no, he's not here. You should try the dorms.


 GAIL

 Alright, bye, hon.


 CHER

 Bye-bye.


 (Cher hangs up the phone)

 What was that all about?


 JOSH

 She wants me to come home for spring break.


 CHER

 So, what's the big deal? Nobody will be in school.


 JOSH

 Yeah, but husband number four's at home and his whole idea of acting like a family is to criticize me.


 CHER

 So, what? You're just going to roam around campus for two weeks all by yourself?


 JOSH

 I don't mind.


 CHER

 That is stupid. Why don't you just come here, you can have your old room, and there are going to be some great parties.


 JOSH

 I don't know.


 CHER

 Why not?


 JOSH

 You got your whole social world going on, I don't want to get in the way.


 CHER

 you won't be in the way.


 JOSH

 How much fun would it be having a brother-type tagging along?


 CHER

 Josh, you are not my brother.


 JOSH

 You know what I mean.


 CHER

 C'mon, you need some excitement in your life. It'll replenish you for your finals.


 JOSH

 OK. 

 CHER

 Good.


 JOSH

 I can't believe I'm taking advice from someone who watches cartoons.


 CHER 

 That's Ren and Stimpy. They're way existential.


 JOSH

 Do you have any idea what you're talking about?


 CHER

 No, why? Do I sound like I do?


 SCENE XXVIII - CHER'S HOUSE

 (Theme from "2001:A Space Odyssey" is playing while camera is focused on phone. The phone rings)

 CHER V.O.

 Christian said he'd call the next day, but in boy time, that meant Thursday. So, you can imagine my astonishment to hear from him while I was packing Daddy up.


 CHER

 Hello?


 "I Believe I'm You" Gail Orange

 CHER V.O.

 He said he'd come over with some video tapes and we'd watch them. A night alone with Christian! I sent for reinforcements. Then, Dee and I had to design a lighting concept, and costume decisions. I don't rely on mirrors, so I always take polaroids. Whenever a boy comes, you should always have something baking.


 CHER

 Oh, I'm still all red.


 DIONNE

 Well, I'm trying to make you as white as I can, Cher. Look, you're all flushed. You have to calm down. OK? Calm.


 CHER

 You know, I am so glad I never did it with someone I had lukewarm feelings for. Christian is brutally hot, and I am going to remember tonight forever.


 DIONNE

 Blot.


 (Later)

 (The door bell rings. Cher opens the door)

 CHRISTIAN

 Hi.


 CHER

 Hi.


 CHRISTIAN

 Is something burning?


 CHER

 Oh, my God!


 (Cher runs to the kitchen. The bake was fried)

 CHRISTIAN

 Oh, honey, you baked.


 CHER

 I tried.


 CHRISTIAN

 C'mon, show me the rest of your pad.


 (Cher and Christian are outside among Mel's art collection)

 CHRISTIAN

 Your father has a well-rounded collection.


 CHER

 Daddy says it's a good investment.


 CHRISTIAN

 He's absolutely right. Klaus Oldenberg.


 CHER

 Oh, he's way famous!


 (Christian approaches a different sculpture)

 CHRISTIAN

 This is older, see? Transitional. A very important piece.


 CHER

 Um, do you want to go swimming?


 CHRISTIAN

 Hmmm, let's watch the movies.


 CHER

 Oh, OK.


 (Scene moves to Christian and Cher lying on bed watching "Spartacus")

 CHER V.O.

 Christian had a thing for Tony Curtis, so he brought over "Some Like It Hot" and "Sparaticus".


 (Cher starts rubbing her feet up against Christian's legs. Christian doesn't enjoy it)

 CHER

 My feet are cold.


 (Christian puts a pillow over Cher's feet)

 Thanks.


 CHRISTIAN

 Oh, watch this part, this is good.


 (Cher falls off the bed while trying to look sexy. Too funny.)

 Are you OK?


 CHER

 I'm fine. Do you want some, something to drink? You know, I could get you some wine.


 CHRISTIAN

 No. You notice how wine makes people wanna feel, like sexy.


 CHER

 That's OK.


 CHRISTIAN

 I'm actually getting tired.


 CHER

 But, um, I could make you some coffee if you'd like?


 CHRISTIAN

 Oh, no thanks. Got the ulcer.


 CHER

 But you had all those cappucinos before?


 CHRISTIAN

 Oh. Well, you know, that was, like... foam.


 (They move to the front door)

 You're great. We're friends, right?


 (Cher nods)

 Knock me a little kiss.


 (Cher kisses him on the cheek)

 I'll see ya.


 (Christian leaves)

 CHER V.O.

 I don't get it. Did my hair get flat? Did I stumble into some bad lighting? What's wrong with me?


 (NOTHING!)

 SCENE XXIX - MURRAY'S CAR

 DIONNE

 Nothing! Maybe he really was tired!


 CHER 

 I suppose it wasn't meant to be, I mean, he does dress better than I do. What would I bring to the relationship?


 MURRAY

 Get back into the right lane. What's the first thing you do?


 DIONNE

 First thing I do is, I put on my blinker.


 (Dionne accidently turns the wipers on)

 Oh, wait, shit.


 MURRAY

 Watch the road, watch the road!


 DIONNE

 Alright! Stop. Then, I look in my mirror. OK, then I glance at my blind spot.


 MURRAY

 Glance with your head, not the whole car. I swear to God, I swear to God, Woman, you can't drive for shit!


 DIONNE

 I'm not trying to hear that.


 MURRAY

 Hear me...


 CHER

 Actually, going all the way is like a really big decision. I can't believe I was so caprecious about it. Dee, I almost had sex with him.


 MURRAY

 You almost had sex with who?


 CHER

 Christian.


 (Murray cracks up)

 DIONNE

 What?


 MURRAY 

 Yo, look. Are you bitches blind or something? Your man, Christian is a cake-boy!


 CHER & DIONNE

 A what?!


 MURRAY

 He's a disco-dancing, Oscar Wilde-reading, Streissand ticket-holding friend of Dorothy, know what I'm saying?


 CHER

 Uh-uh. no way.


 MURRAY

 He's gay.


 CHER

 Not even.


 MURRAY

 Yes, even.


 DIONNE

 He does like to shop, Cher, and the boy can dress.


 CHER

 Oh, my God. I am totally buggin'. I feel like such a bonehead.


 MURRAY

 What the hell? Yo, you're getting on the freeway!


 DIONNE

 What?!


 MURRAY

 Yo, turn right! Get out of the lane! Don't go. Forget procedure, just get out of the lane!


 (Both Cher and Dionne scream)

 MURRAY

 Truck, truck, truck, truck! Ahhh!


 CHER (screaming)

 You're on the freeway!


 DIONNE

 What do I do, Murray?


 MURRAY

 Go straight, go straight, go straight! Just relax and drive, baby! Just relax and drive.


 (An old lady gives them the finger)

 CHER (screaming)

 Shut up! Shut up!


 (Lots of screams from everybody)

 MURRAY

 Whatever you do, keep your hands on the wheel, at all times!


 (A huge truck closes in on them. Murray sees it)

 Aaahhhhh!!!


 (A lot more screaming from the three)

 Turn to the right! Oh, there it is. Alright, we're off. Damn, you did wonderful. Sorry, baby.


 CHER

 You did it, Dee!


 MURRAY

 Relax, relax, relax, relax, honey, relax. Baby, relax, relax. Breathe, breathe, breath in, breathe. Let it out. Breathe, breathe, breathe, honey, breathe, breath. Relax, relax.


 CHER V.O.

 Boy, getting off the freeway makes you realize how important love is. After that, Dionne's virginity went from technical to non-exisistant. I realized how much I wanted a boyfriend of my own.


 SCENE XXX - THE MALL

 CHER V.O.

 Not that Christian wasn't a blast to hang out with. He was becoming one of my favourite shopping partners.


 CHRISTIAN

 ???????? Um, where's Tai?


 CHER

 Oh, she met some random guys at the Foot Locker and escorted them right over there.


 TAI (in distance)

 Oh, my God! Did you see...


 CHER

 I don't know where she meets these Barnies.


 CHRISTIAN

 I have a question, alright?


 CHER

 What?


 CHRISTIAN

 The jacket? Is it James Dean or Jason Priestly?


 CHER

 Carpe' diem. OK, you looked hot in it.


 CHRISTIAN

 Really?


 TAI (with the barnies)

 If I fall, would you guys catch me?


 CHER

 Could we please be more... generic?


 (Tai screams)

 TAI

 Stop it! Please! Bring me back up, please! Bring me back up.


 (Tai screams a little more, then Christian rescues her)

 TAI

 Thank you.


 CHRISTIAN

 You asshole!


 BARNEY #1

 Hey, man. We're just joking.


 CHRISTIAN

 Oh, really?! Someone could get killed.


 (Tai runs over and hugs Cher)

 TAI

 Cher, you don't understand. I was just sitting there and I was just talking to those guys, and then, all of a sudden, we were laughing, and...


 CHRISTIAN

 Hey, are you OK?


 TAI

 Yeah.


 CHRISTIAN

 Are you sure?


 TAI

 I'm fine. Yeah, uh-huh.


 CHRISTIAN

 Let's get you home for some R&R, huh?


 TAI

 What's that?


 (Christian laughs)

 CHER V.O.

 Boy, considering how clueless she was, Tai certainly had that "damsel in distress" act down.


 SCENE XXXI - SCHOOL

 CHER V.O.

 Meanwhile, back at school, everyone was talking about Tai's "brush with death" at the mall.


 STUDENT

 Was it, like a montage of all the scenes in your life?


 TAI

 Not exactly a montage...


 SUMMER

 Hey, Cher! Is it true some gang members, like tried to shoot Tai in the mall?


 CHER

 No.


 SUMMER

 That is what everyone is saying.


 CHER

 Whatever.


 STUDENT

 When I was nine, I fell off the jungle gym, that's when I saw this light, you know?


 TAI

 Wait, wait. Move down for Cher.


 DIONNE

 Hi!


 AMBER

 Tell me more, tell me more.


 TAI

 Where was I?


 AMBER

 You were thinking about was really important.


 TAI

 Oh, right, right. Right before you die, your mind just sort of gets very clear. It's a very intense, spiritual thing...


 CHER

 Well, I know when I was held at gun-point...


 STUDENT

 Excuse me. (to Tai) You were saying.


 TAI

 It's spiritual. I don't know, I can't, I can't pinpoint the spirituality out for you, you know, if you've never experienced anything...


 SCENE XXXV - CHER'S HOUSE

 CHER V.O.

 But now I don't know how to act around him. I mean, ordinarily I would strut around in my cutest little outfits and send myself flowers and candy, but I couldn't do that stuff with Josh.


 (Cher and Josh are in the lounge watching T.V.)

 JOSH

 What's with you?


 CHER

 What do you mean?


 JOSH

 You're so quiet. You haven't made me watch the real world?


 CHER

 I care about the news.


 JOSH

 Since when?


 CHER

 Since now.


 (T.V. shows scenes from Bosnia)

 JOSH

 You look confused.


 CHER

 Well, uh, I thought they declared peace in the Middle East.


 (Scene changes to Mel's Den with Cher walking past the door in her pyjamas)

 MEL

 Cher, get in here!


 CHER

 What's up Daddy?


 MEL

 What are you doing, dancing infront of my office?


 CHER

 Nothing, I just wanted to see if you needed any help with anything.


 MEL

 Yeah, you caould help me with something. Come over here. Every time that you see a telephone conversation that took place on September third, highlight it. just September third.


 CHER

 OK. 

 MEL

 Fun, huh?


 CHER (laughing)

 Yeah. Daddy, did you ever have a problem that you couldn't argue your way out of?


 MEL

 Tell me the problem, and we'll figure out how to argue it.


 CHER

 I like this boy.


 MEL

 Yes?


 CHER

 And he likes someone else.


 MEL

 How could that be?


 CHER

 I don't know, but I feel wretched.


 MEL

 Well, obviously this boy is a complete moron. You are the most beautiful girl in Beverly Hills. And to tell you the truth, I'm not sure I want you with a stupid fella like that.


 CHER

 Well, actually he is a smart guy and, you know he's one of those do-gooder types, and now I feel like all my after-school commitments are just not good enough.


 MEL

 How can you say that? Who takes care of everyone in this household? Who makes sure that Daddy eats right? To tell you the truth, I have not seen such good-doing sice your mother. 


 CHER

 Really?


 MEL

 Really. Now get back to work.


 SCENE XXXVI - PISMO BEACH DISASTER

 CHER V.O.

 Later, while we were learning about the Pismo Beach diaster, I decided I needed a complete make-over, except this time I'd make-over my soul. But what makes someone a better person? And then I realised, all my friends were really good in different ways. Like, Christian, he always wants things to be beautiful and interesting. Or Dionne and Murray, when they think no one is watching, are so considerate of each other. And poor Miss Giest, always trying to get us involved, no matter how much we resist?


 MISS GIEST

 Oh, it's just, that doesn't even show... you know, every single possesion, every memory, everything you had your whole life... gone in a second. Can you imagine what that must feel like?


 (Elton raises his hand)

 Elton?


 ELTON

 Can I use the Pass?


 MISS GIEST

 Yeah. We'll be collecting blankets, disposable diapers, canned goods...


 (Cher raises her hand)

 CHER

 Miss Giest?


 MISS GIEST

 Cher?


 CHER

 I wanna help.


 MISS GIEST

 That would be wonderful.


 CHER V.O.

 I felt better already.


 (Back at Cher's house)

 CHER

 Daddy?


 MEL

 What?


 CHER

 You didn't like that red caviar, did you?


 MEL

 What's she talking about?


 (Cher starts dragging a heap of stuff to the front door)

 MEL

 Cher, what are you doing?


 CHER

 I'm captain of the Pismo Beach disaster relief.


 MEL

 I don't think they need your skis.


 CHER

 Daddy, some people lost all their belongings, don't you think that includes athletic equipment?


 MEL

 This is your influence, Josh?


 (Scene changes to sign-on stall at school)

 "Shake Some Action" Cracker

 CHER

 Hey, c'mere. Sign up, it's going to be really fun.


 (Scene cahnges to indoors)

 No, you know what? Can you please take it to bedding? Yes, thank you very much.


 Oh, Miss Giest, Miss Giest.


 MISS GIEST

 Yes, dear?


 CHER

 I need more boxes, they're all filled up.


 MISS GIEST

 Already? Great!


 CHER

 I divided them into entres and apetisers.


 MISS GIEST

 Oh, OK, I'll have them picked up.


 TRAVIS

 Hey.


 CHER

 Proper. This is really decent of you Travis.


 TRAVIS

 Sure.


 (Cher picks up a Bong from Travis' box.)

 I wasn't sure about that. I don't need it anymore, but far be it from me to deny anyone else, you know? Oh, I wanted to tell you something, I'm sorry about your shoes.


 CHER

 What shoes?


 TRAVIS

 The red ones with the strappy things?


 CHER

 Oh, those are so last season. What even made you think of them?


 TRAVIS

 Well, it's one of my steps, you see? I joined this club, and there are these steps...


 CHER

 Twelve?


 TRAVIS

 Yeah, twelve! How'd you know?


 CHER

 Wild guess.


 TRAVIS

 Wow, good guess. Ah, also, here.


 (Travis hands Cher a flyer)

 CHER (reading)

 A.S.L. ? 

 TRAVIS

 Ameteur Skateboarding League. This clarity thing has brought me to, like a whole new level with my skating. You gotta see it. Would you come Saturday?


 CHER

 Sure.


 TRAVIS

 Cool!


 CHER (holding up bong)

 Well, um, I guess, kitchenware?


 TRAVIS

 That's where I used to keep it.


 SCENE XXXVII - A.S.L. COMPETITION

 "Mullet Head" Beastie Boys

 (Tai approached Cher at the drinks stand)

 TAI

 Hi?


 CHER

 Hi.


 TAI

 Cher, can I talk to you a minute?


 CHER

 Um, sure.


 TAI

 Look, I have been in agony the past week and I can't even believe that I went off the way I did.


 CHER

 No, I have been going down a shame spiral. I cannot even believe I was so unsupportive of your feelings for Josh.


 TAI

 No, you are entitled to your own opinion, alright? I'm the tart here. Cher, you've been nothing but super-duper nice to me.


 CHER

 Not even. If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't have even liked that loser, Elton. I'm so sorry, Tai.


 TAI

 Cher, I'm really sorry. Oh, shit. Now I'm going to go ahead and cry.


 CHER

 Let's never fight again, OK?


 (Cher and Tai hug. Travis is announced on the P.A.)

 PA

 Next up, number fourteen, Travis Berkenstock.


 (The girls sit down, excitedly giggling and pointing to Travis.)

 TAI

 Alright Travis!


 CHER

 I had no idea he was so motivated.


 TAI

 Oh, I did.


 CHER V.O.

 When I saw the sparks between Tai and Travis, I knew Josh was out of the picture.


 SCENE XXXVIII - CHER'S HOUSE

 JOSH

 You look like Pippi Longstocking.


 CHER

 Well, you look like Forrest Gump. Who's Pippi Longstocking?


 JOSH

 Someone Mel Gibson never played.


 CHER

 Funny.


 (Cher lets her hair down, and Josh is dumbfounded by her beauty)

 LAWYER

 What happened to the August 28th files?


 JOSH

 Hmm, what?


 LAWYER

 Mel wanted them tonight, there were twice as many. He's gonna go ballistic, where are they?


 CHER

 I think I checked them for the September third conversation.


 LAWYER

 What?


 JOSH

 Where'd you put them?


 CHER

 I divided them into two piles. Is that wrong?


 LAWYER

 Oh, my God. I have to redo all that. What are you, some kind of idiot?


 JOSH

 Hey, she didn't know.


 LAWYER

 She just set us back a day. Who cares about the September call? Now we're screwed!


 CHER

 I'm sorry.


 LAWYER

 Just forget it, OK? Just go back to the mall or something.


 (Cher runs out of the room)

 JOSH

 What's your problem, man? She didn't mean any harm.


 LAWYER

 I'm gonna get killed because she's a moron.


 JOSH

 She's not a moron. You know, if you were paying attention to your assignment, it wouldn't have happened.


 LAWYER

 Well, if you hadn't been playing footsy with the dumb kid, she wouldn't be bothering me.


 JOSH

 What the hell are you talking about?!


 LAWYER

 You know exactly what I'm talking about. Josh, this is a multi-million dollar law suit, not some excuse for puppy-love.


 JOSH

 Look, we've been working our butts off on this case!


 LAWYER

 Well, tell you what? You do whatever you want with your butts, I'm calling in sick.


 (Lawyer leaves while Josh slams the door behind him. Cher is sitting at the top of the stairs)

 CHER

 Did I really ruin Daddy's law suit?


 JOSH

 No.


 (Josh moves up to sit beside Cher)

 Of course not.


 CHER

 Well, did I set him back? I mean, there's so much work to be done, and he can't afford to lose that time.


 JOSH

 Don't worry about it, I'll take care of it. Your father won't lose any time. Can you imagine the nerve of that guy? I mean, making you worry like that, and yet, he's the one that screwed up and then he goes and blames us. Imagine saying we were... you know?


 CHER

 That's right, you've been very dedicated to this case.


 JOSH

 Yeah, well, it's a good learning experience, at least for me, I want to be a lawyer. But you, I mean, you don't need to be doing this. Go out and have fun, go shopping.


 CHER

 You think that's all I do, I'm just a ditz with a credit card?


 JOSH

 No, no, ah, that's not what I meant.


 (Josh just stutters a bit, looking for the right words)

 You're young and beautiful...and...


 CHER

 And?


 JOSH

 And, well, uh, what?


 CHER

 You think I'm beautiful?


 (YES, YES!!!! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, YES!!!!)

 JOSH

 You know your gorgeous, alright? And popular, and, um, and... but this is not why I, you know, I come here. This is a good learning experience for me.


 CHER

 You already said that.


 JOSH

 Mel, I wanna help out Mel. He's the only one who cares about me.


 CHER

 That's not true.


 JOSH

 He's not? Are you saying you care about me?


 CHER

 Josh.


 (Cher goes to hit his shoulder, but he catches her with a kiss. Good move!)

 (Both like it. So they try again.)

 CHER V.O.

 Well, you can guess what happened next.


 SCENE XXXIX - THE WEDDING

 CHER V.O.

 As if! I am only sixteen, and this is California, not Kentucky.


 (Mr. Hall and Miss Giest get married)

 TAI

 I know, that when I have my own wedding, I want this, like whole entire floral motif, very floral garlens... floral dresses.


 DIONNE

 No, no, no, no. When I get married, I'm gonna have a sailor dress, but it's going to be a gown, and all my bridesmaids are gonna wear sailor hats... with vails.


 TAI

 That sounds so cool.


 MURRAY

 Oh, my God. They're planning our weddings already. Could you all stop all that to death do us part mumbo-jumbo. I'm telling ya, man, I'm completely buggin'.


 JOSH

 I'm buggin' myself.


 (Miss Stoeger runs on the scene)

 MISS STOEGER

 Girls! She's about to throw the bouquet, c'mon!


 (Miss Stoeger, Dionne and Tai run off)

 JOSH (to Cher)

 Look, we got a pool going to see who's girl gets the bouquet. It's up to two hundred dollars.


 CHER

 It's in the bag.


 "Tenderness" General Public

 (All the girls are jumping around waiting for the bouquet. Miss Giest/Mrs. Hall throws it amongst them. The bouquet exchanges hands and they all fall down. Classic scene! Cher ends up with it.)


 (Cher and Josh kiss. It's the one scene that I'll never get out of mind for the rest of my life. Simply awesome lip-lock!)

                                    Anthony Minghella

                            Based On The Novel "Cold Mountain"

                                            by

                                     Charles Frazier

                

               EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN, NORTH CAROLINA. DAY

               ON A BLACK SCREEN: Credits.

               A RAUCOUS VOICE (SWIMMERS) CHANTING IN THE CHEROKEE LANGUAGE.

               A RANGE OF MOUNTAINS SLOWLY EMERGES: shrouded in a blue mist 
               like a Chinese water color. Below them, close to a small 
               town, YOUNG MEN, armed with vicious sticks and stripped to 
               the waist, come charging in a muscular, steaming pack.

               Their opponents, also swinging sticks, attach the pack.

               A ball, barely round, made of leather, emerges, smacked 
               forwards by INMAN, who hurtles after it and collides with a 
               stick swung by SWIMMER, a young and lithe American Indian. 
               Inman falls, clutching his nose. The ball bobbles on the 
               ground in front of him. He grabs it and gets to his feet, 
               the blood pouring from his nose.

               His team form a phalanx around him and he continues to charge.

               A PRISTINE CABRIOLET pulled by an impressive horse, comes 
               down towards the town. It has to pass across the temporary 
               field of play, parting the teams. Some of the contestants 
               grab their shirts to restore propriety as the Cabriolet and 
               its two exotic passengers passes by.

               The driver is a man in his early fifties, dressed in the 
               severe garb of a minister, MONROE. And next to him, a self-
               conscious girl in the spotless elaborate, architectural skirts 
               of the period, is his daughter, ADA. Inman, using his shirt 
               to staunch his battered nose, looks at Ada, astonished by 
               her. An angel in this wild place.

               Now Swimmer stops chanting and begins, more hesitantly, to 
               translate into English:

                                     SWIMMERS VOICE (V.O.)
                         You will be lonely. You will howl 
                         like a dog as you walk alone. You 
                         will carry dog shit cupped in your 
                         hands. You will be smeared with dog 
                         shit. Your spirit will wane and 
                         dwindle to blue, the colour of 
                         despair... 

               As the Cabriolet passes, SWIMMER takes the ball an with a 
               whoop starts to run towards the opposing goal. The game 
               resumes. Ada looks back as the men swarm into each other, 
               sticks and fists flailing.

               EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. NIGHT

               A SIDE OF BEEF turns on a huge barbecue. The battered teams 
               eating, drinking hard liquor, rehearsing victory and defeat, 
               illuminated by a roaring bonfire. Swimmer is sewing up a 
               gash in Inmans cheek as he continues to translate:

                                     SWIMMER
                         ...This is your path. There is no 
                         other. That's a curse you can use on 
                         the Yankee before battle.

                                     INMAN
                         And that works?

                                     SWIMMER
                         You have to say it in Cherokee.

                                     INMAN
                         You said it to me in Cherokee.

               During this, Monroe and Ada have arrived, escorted by SALLY 
               SWANGER, a local woman, middle-aged, kindly, and her husband, 
               ESCO, a glorious curmudgeon. The Monroes are introduced to 
               various locals. Inamn watches them, on the other side of the 
               crowd. The Reverend Monroe, his daughter Ada. Up from 
               Charleston, bringing God's word to you heathens! Is Esco's 
               preferred introduction. Building a church. Inman watches 
               Ada, moves his head to keep her in view as Swimmer stitches, 
               and winces with pain.

                                     SWIMMER
                         So keep your head still.

               Sally collects plates for the Monroes. Hands them to Ada and 
               her father, who wait, patiently, for silverware. Esco takes 
               a plate, picks up a skewer of meat, bites on it. Monroe 
               pluckily follows suit.

                                     INMAN
                              (to Swimmer)
                         Anyway, there won't be any war. And 
                         if there is, they say it won't last 
                         a week.

                                                END OF CREDITS AND FADE TO:

               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. PREDAWN

               CAPTION: PETERSBURG, VIRGINIA. JULY 30TH, 1864. IN THE FOURTH 
               YEAR OF THE CIVIL WAR.

               A STAND OF TREES. The pastoral lush green Virginia. A RABBIT 
               surfaces from its hole. Peace and beauty.

               A second RABBIT shakes itself from the ground, darts into 
               open ground to confront the FORBIDDING TRENCHES OF THE 
               CONFEDERATE AND UNION ARMIES, RANGED AGAINST EACH OTHER ON 
               THE OUTSKIRTS OF PETERSBURG. Massive wooden barricades in 
               the shape of crosses, rows of X's, define the two lines. The 
               Federals have been laying siege for months. So early and 
               it's already hot. The trees are an oasis of green in a world 
               of mud between the two stark and ugly scars of the trenches.

               IN THE CONFEDERATE LINES, the men are rousing, boiling water 
               for coffee or to shave, smoking, stiff from night. There's a 
               large gun emplacement and some men still sleep against the 
               stub-nosed cannon. Another RABBIT is disturbed from its hole. 
               Ears pricked up to a distant rumbling.

               INT. TUNNEL. PREDAWN.

               A dark hole. Some evil place. A scraping sound. Shapes 
               burrowing forwards at a crouch. A silent purpose.

               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. PREDAWN.

               Young OAKLEY, freshly recruited, approaches a group of men, 
               like him Highlanders from Company F of the 25th North Carolina 
               Regiment. He doles out breakfast. Inman, loading his heavy 
               LeMats pistol, its nine rounds, is not hungry. Oakley serves 
               another, ROURKE, last seen in the scrum at Cold Mountain. 
               Oakley keeps his head low as he serves.

                                     ROURKE
                         Don't worry, son. Those Yankee boys 
                         keep store hours. They ain't open 
                         yet.

               INT. TUNNEL. PREDAWN

               Shadows and shapes. A BARREL rumbles along the tunnel. It 
               reaches a kneeling figure, who rolls it forwards. A relay 
               team. At the end of the tunnel, where it widens, a man, naked 
               to the waist, crouches, stacking the barrels.

               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. PREDAWN

               A RABBIT, scared up, darts along the trench. Rourke sees it, 
               beckons to another Cold Mountain boy, Butcher.

                                     BUTCHER
                         That's fresh breakfast. Shoot him!

                                     ROURKE
                         I'm not firing, start the damn war 
                         off.

               Butcher chases after the rabbit, Rourke in raucous support.

               INT. TUNNEL. PREDAWN

               The crouching man has wrapped FUZE WIRE around the last 
               barrel, and now retreats, paying out the wire as he does so, 
               as each man in the tunnel crawls backwards behind him.

               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. DAWN

               Rourke weaves through the gun emplacements, laughing.

                                     ROURKE
                         That's my rabbit!

               Great sport. Inman, fifty yards away, looks over, amused, 
               goes back to his gun.

               INT. TUNNEL. DAWN

               The fuze wire is lit. It fizzes towards the barrels.

               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. DAWN

               Rourke is running BUT NOW THE GROUND BUCKLES UNDER HIM AND 
               HE'S BEING LIFTED SLOWLY INTO THE AIR, the earth swelling.

               AN APOCALYPTIC EXPLOSION. FOUR TONS OF DYNAMITE RIP THE GROUND 
               OPEN IN A CRATER 135 FEET LONG, 90 FEET ACROSS, 30 FEET DEEP.

               HORSES, GUNS, MEN ARE BLOWN TO PIECES AND THROWN UP INTO THE 
               AIR.

               INMAN DISAPPEARS UNDER DIRT AND DEBRIS.

               Pandemonium. The Confederates are in complete disarray. The 
               Federals pour forwards across NO MANS LAND, through the 
               peaceful oasis of trees, roaring the roar of attack. They 
               flood towards the crater, hundreds of them, charging into a 
               dense and impenetrable WALL OF SMOKE.

               THEN THEY'RE INSIDE THE GREAT GASH OF CRATER AND CAN'T GET 
               OUT AGAIN, arriving at an insurmountable wall of mud.

               The Confederates regroup. Orders are yelled. Chaos developing 
               into battle.

               The Confederates begin firing into the crater. Guns and mortar 
               wheel round and empty into what is becoming a terrible death 
               trap.

               Inman gets to his feet. Oakley with him, and rushes through 
               the smoke to the pit, emptying his LeMats into the crater.

               LATER: A BLACK REGIMENT from the Union join the attack. Bodies 
               falling on bodies as the Federals charge in and pack their 
               comrades even tighter. The Confederates make a pincer movement 
               outside the Crater, forcing all the Federals in. It's 
               Medieval.

               No escape.

               THE CONFEDERATES jump into the pit to engage the Federals. 
               Hand to hand fighting. Too close for rifles, just bayonets, 
               and guns swung like clubs and Inman sliding down into that 
               hell, tiring the nine rounds, then the shotgun charge, which 
               does a terrible damage. Primitive. Unutterable carnage. Men 
               killing each other in embraces, soldier crushed against 
               soldier, desperate to survive, to kill, to live. An oozing 
               layer cake of bodies, dead and frantically alive, drowning 
               in slick.

               YOUNG OAKLEY loses his rifle and picks up a magazine case, 
               clubbing his opponent, then slips onto him and is stuck with 
               a bayonet, the pain of which makes him squeal.

               INMAN GOES AT IT. He's a warrior, punching and stabbing and 
               firing. A coldly efficient killer. He's grabbed from behind 
               and crushed, a hand gouging at his face, an almighty struggle.

               He falls and lands on top of Oakley, and he and his Federal 
               opponent fight to the death with the wounded boy as their 
               pillow. The slaughter continues over and around them, the 
               sound, the sound of hell and madness. The boy has his arm 
               around Inman, like lovers.

               LATER: The Confederates run after the retreating Union 
               soldiers, firing, cavalry riding them down. Inman stands, 
               the boy's blood all over him, exhausted and appalled. The 
               crater, behind him, an abattoir of men. The victors are 
               yelling, pumped mad with adrenaline. Butcher comes alongside 
               Inman.

                                     BUTCHER
                         That was something! That's hell and 
                         we've been there! Kicked old Nick's 
                         asshole.

               A WOUNDED BLACK SOLDIER sits up as Butcher celebrates.

               Butcher runs over, but can't find a charge for his musket. 
               He looks around in the stack of corpses, pulling out weapons,

               tries one: not loaded, throws it down, tries another: not 
               loaded. The wounded man can't get up, tries to drag himself 
               like a crab away from Butcher. Inman yells at him, appalled.

                                     BUTCHER
                         You got a charge?

               He picks up another musket. It fires. The wounded Federal 
               slumps back, dead.

               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. DUSK

               THE AFTERMATH. The dead being piled up for burial, divided 
               into allegiance. Wounded prisoners able to walk are led away.

               A great deal of casual looting. Of boots, of equipment, of 
               personal items. Inman sees a soldier in the crater, lining 
               up wounded Federals, putting their heads in a row. THE MAN 
               EXTRACTS A HAMMER FROM HIS BELT AND, SATISFIED HE HAS AN 
               ECONOMIC ARRANGEMENT, PROCEEDS DOWN THE LINE, SMASHING EACH 
               SKULL.

               Inman turns away, sees another Rebel, extravagantly costumed, 
               a strange FIDDLE head protruding from his knapsack. This is 
               STOBROD THEWES. He's bent over a dead Federal, examining his 
               mouth. He reaches behind his back and roots around in the 
               knapsack, producing A PAIR OF PLIERS, WHICH HE INSERTS INTO 
               THE CORPSE'S MOUTH. He's yanking away when A SWINGING BOOT 
               connects with his head and knocks him to the ground.

               Startled, he looks up to see Inman hovering over him.

                                     STOBROD
                         That's gold in his mouth he got no 
                         need for.
                              (shrugs)
                         We take his boots.

               He examines his fiddle for damage. Some orderlies pass, 
               lifting OAKLEY away on a gurney.

               Oakley's pale as a maiden, the life leaking from him. Inman 
               walks a way with him. Oakley looks up, desperate to be brave.

                                     OAKLEY
                         I got a few. You saw?

                                     INMAN
                         I saw.

                                     OAKLEY
                         I know you don't recognise me. I'm 
                         Mo Oakley's boy.
                              (Inman finds this 
                              incredible)
                         It's okay. I was thirteen when you 
                         all left. Am I going to die?

               Inman flicks his eyes to the Orderly, whose look confirms 
               the boy's wounds are certainly mortal.

               INT. FIELD HOSPITAL. NIGHT

               Inman sits on the ground beside Oakley's cot. Around them, 
               the wounded are certainly dying, makeshift care, oil lights, 
               groans.

                                     OAKLEY
                         I'd like to hear some music while I 
                         go.

               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. NIGHT

               Inman walks around the campfires. He hears some fiddle music. 
               It's Stobrod.

               Stobrod sees Inman. Inman stares, his expression an 
               instruction, the turns and walks away.

               INT. FIELD HOSPITAL. NIGHT

               Stobrod stands over Oakley. Consults with Inman.

                                     STOBROD
                         What about Bonaparte's Retreat? That's 
                         one I play.

                                     OAKLEY
                         Play me something sweet. Like a girl's 
                         waiting for me.

               Stobrod looks at Inman, confused.

                                     OAKLEY
                         Play me something like there's nothing 
                         to fear from a merciful Lord.

                                     INMAN
                              (to Stobrod)
                         You heard him.

                                     STOBROD
                              (nervous)
                         I only know a couple of tunes.

                                     OAKLEY
                         Like when you're thirsty up at 
                         Bishop's Creek and the water is so 
                         cool.

               Inman glares at Stobrod. And Stobrod starts to play.

               Hesitant, then with gathering confidence, improvising, 
               increasingly expansive, as if he's as surprised as everyone 
               else. Oakley's lips move. A whisper. Inman leans in.

                                     OAKLEY
                         I'm reaching Cold Mountain before 
                         you.

               Stobrod plays. It's wrenching. Oakley stills. Inman abruptly 
               puts his hand on the neck of the fiddle, stopping Stobrod. 
               The boy is dead. Inman gets to his feet and walks away.

               INT. CONFEDERATE TENT. NIGHT

               A dozen men in the tent. Inman has a BOOK, its cover gone, 
               rolled up and tied with a leather strap. His bookmark is A 
               FADED TINTYPE PHOTOGRAPH of a solemn young woman. He unwraps 
               the book carefully and reads a page by the sickly light next 
               to his bedroll. An OFFICER comes into the tent, approaches 
               Inman, who makes a stand.

                                     OFFICER
                         Don't get up, soldier. You are 
                         mentioned tonight in my report. You 
                         are a credit to the Highlands, to 
                         North Carolina and to the Cause.

                                     INMAN
                              (tight)
                         Do you have news, sir, on my 
                         application for transfer?

                                     OFFICER
                         I know. A bloody day. It's what our 
                         General said: Good thing war is so 
                         terrible else a man might end up 
                         liking it too much.

                                     INMAN
                         Sir. It was my understanding the 
                         medical corps was desperate for 
                         volunteers.

                                     OFFICER
                         Right now, soldier, it's me who is 
                         in need of volunteers. There's a 
                         dozen Yankees in that stand of trees 
                         between us. Stuck there from the 
                         retreat. Come daylight they can shoot 
                         us down for sport.

               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. NIGHT

               A beautiful night. Lots of stars. Inman and three others, 
               including Butcher, slide over the top of the trench, far to 
               one side of the stand of trees. The plan is to cast a wide 
               arc that will bring them around back of the trees, closer to 
               the enemy side than their own. The four men slither over the 
               ground. They pause. Inman has arrived at a tangle of corpses.

               He slithers over them.

               They work their way towards the trees. THERE ARE A HALF DOZEN 
               FEDERALS CROUCHING IN THE COVER OF THE TREES. They are dozing. 
               Only one of them sits with a rifle surveying the Confederate 
               lines, the others have their backs to the enemy, sitting 
               against the trunks, grabbing a few minute's sleep.

               As the four rebels approach, still crawling, one of the 
               Federals opens his eyes, sees the attack, shifts for his 
               rifle. INMAN IMMEDIATELY STANDS UP, FIRING INSTANTLY, killing 
               him and two others, while Butcher throws himself at another.

               The exchanges are brief and savage and one of Inman's party 
               and all of the Federals lay dead. Then the rebels break from 
               the trees.

               A FLARE goes up, then another, both from the Confederate 
               trenches. INMAN AND HIS ACCOMPLICES ARE PICKED OUT IN A 
               BRILLIANT GREEN LIGHT. Shots follow, from both sides, aimed 
               at the three returning men as they zigzag towards their own 
               lines. As they get close, voices cry out, rippling down the 
               trench, joining their own admonitions: Don't shoot, Hold 
               your fire, they're our boys, Hold your fire!!! They're almost 
               home. Butcher is laughing, whooping. Then just as suddenly 
               he falls, wounded. Inman stops, turns back, runs to him.

               Inman collects Butcher, drags him, carries him. They're fifty 
               yards from their lines. A BULLET CATCHES INMAN IN THE NECK.

               He goes down like a tree, blood pouring from his neck. Lying 
               on the ground, he watches the phosphorescent lights slowly 
               fade to black, all sound fading with them.

               EXT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. 3 YEARS EARLIER. DAY

               A WOODEN JOIST swings across the view of the Blue Ridge. Men 
               are swarming over the roof of an unfinished CHAPEL, below 
               which appears the small town of COLD MOUNTAIN. Among the 
               workers, armed with nails and hammer, knees clutching a 
               rafter, is Inman, fresh and a whole lifetime younger. Rourke 
               and Butcher are also there hammering, building, kidding around 
               and Oakley, barely a teenager.

               Below them, women are setting up a lunch for the workers, 
               ADA amongst them. She has the circumspect air of the blue 
               stocking, uncomfortably aware of the dirt beneath her hem, 
               the men's radar for her every move. Inman watches her as 
               Sally Swanger approaches.

                                     SALLY
                              (to Ada, as Monroe 
                              moves off)
                         Ada, how are you settling in? Are 
                         you liking the farm?

                                     ADA
                         Very much. It's beautiful country.

                                     SALLY
                         So listen -- if you would say hello 
                         to one of these fools, I'll get a 
                         field cleared this weekend.

                                     ADA
                         Anyone? Like a forfeit?

                                     SALLY
                              (pointing at Inman 
                              who immediately looks 
                              away)
                         No. Him in particular, up in the 
                         rafters. Been pressing me all morning.

               UP ON THE ROOFBEAMS OF THE CHAPEL, the men are preoccupied 
               with talk of secession from the Union.

                                     ROURKE
                              (hammering)
                         I call this nail: Northern Aggression.
                              (hammering)
                         I call this nail: a free nigger.

                                     BUTCHER
                         Show some respect -- these nails are 
                         making a church.

                         I call this nail: respect the church.

               Ada comes over, carrying a tray of lemonade glasses. Calls 
               up to Inman.

                                     ADA
                         Hello.

               Inman swings down. He feels the other men staring, burning a 
               hole in his head.

                                     ADA

                         If you were to take a glass of 
                         lemonade your friends might stop 
                         staring. Inman.

                                     INMAN
                         They're not my friends.

               He drops down to ground level, takes the lemonade, scowls at 
               the other guys. They're breaking for lunch and as they make 
               their way to the trestle tables -- they enjoy jostling Inman.

                                     INMAN
                         Thank you.

                         I work wood. Got a piece of land. 
                         Mostly work wood.

                         I can clear a field.

                                     ADA
                         So, was there something in particular 
                         you wished to say to me?

                                     INMAN
                              (thinks about it)
                         Not that comes to me.
                              (hands back the glass)
                         I'll say thank you for the lemonade.

               And he turns and joins the other men gathering round the 
               tables for lunch. Ada watches him, intrigued. Rourke and co. 
               approach ESCO SWANGER, a known sympathizer with the North, 
               to give him a bad time.

                                     ROURKE
                         Esco loves the Yankees.

                                     ESCO
                         I prefer a Yankee to a halfwit.

               Inman arrives just as Rourke points a warning finger at Esco.

               He pushes the finger down to get by. Esco continues:

                                     ESCO
                         What is it you think you'd be fighting 
                         for?

                         The South.

                         And what's that when it's at home?

               Esco's sons, ELLIS AND ACTON, who're working at the other 
               end of the building, have now arrived at the table.

                                     ACTON
                         Pop, you causing trouble?

                                     ESCO
                         No.

                                     ELLIS
                         That means yes.

                                     ESCO
                         You cut the wood, you carry the water 
                         for good old King Cotton. Now you 
                         want to fight for him. Somebody has 
                         to explain it to me.

                                     ACTON
                              (to Rourke and the 
                              others)
                         Don't even try.

               The others are desperate to tease Inman.

                                     BUTCHER
                         How's the lemonade? Sweet?

               Ada, at the lemonade stand again, watches them laughing at 
               Inman, who keeps his head fixed on the table.

               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. NIGHT

               INMAN, ON A GURNEY, carried, someone with a cloth to his 
               neck, which is soaked through with blood. They start to run 
               with him, heading for the field hospital, worried that he 
               will die before the wound can be staunched, cauterized.

               Throughout, A STRANGE MUSIC PLAYS, discordant notes jangling:

               EXT. SWANGER FARM. COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

               -- from A PIANO, lashed to a cart, as it bounces along the 
               lane, passing the Swanger Farm. Sally comes out to look. 
               It's Ada riding next to one of the farmhands, a second boy 
               keeping watch over the piano. Sally goes over.

                                     SALLY
                         That's a fine looking thing.

                              look)
                         Inman's down in the bottom field, 
                         clearing his debt.

                         twice, by two different men. Both of 
                         them -- they were hunting for a 
                         simile, what was I like -- and thistle 
                         came right to them.

                         why not go down and say hello.

               EXT. BOTTOM FIELD, SWANGER FARM. DAY

               Inman's working in the field, stripped to his undershirt, 
               hot work, wielding a scythe. He hears something and looks up 
               at the edge of the lane, ADA IS PLAYING THE PIANO, which is 
               still strapped to the cart. She briefly raises a hand to 
               Inman, then nods to the farmhand who sets them on their way 
               again. Inman smiles, waves back, watching as the cart rumbles 
               off down the track.

               EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT

               It's pouting with rain. INSIDE THE FARMHOUSE, ADA IS PLAYING 
               THE PIANO.

               Men and women crowd into the parlour, in best clothes, 
               celebrating the completion of the Chapel. Inman is outside 
               on the porch, his coat soaked, water pouring off his hat. He 
               looks at Ada. She finishes. Monroe steps in front of the 
               applause, smiling. His words of thanks leak through the window 
               to Inman, who stands, watching, listening.

               INT. PARLOUR, BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT

               Monroe circulates, with Ada. He nods at a group of men, who 
               congregate in one part, not mingling. Their leader, TEAGUE, 
               might be a minister himself, favouring a black dress coat, a 
               black crow in the corner, eyes flashing. Ada doesn't know 
               them. Esco comes by. Monroe puts a hand on his arm.

                              and co.)
                         -- they helped build the Chapel?

                                     ESCO
                         That's Teague and his boys. I'd 
                         recommend you kick them out except a 
                         man don't kick a snake. One time the 
                         Teague family owned the whole of 
                         Cold Mountain. My farm, your farm, 
                         all belonged to his grand-daddy. 
                         Teague wanted this place bad. You 
                         got it. He's here sniffing out an 
                         advantage.

                                     MONROE
                         There's no advantage here, but to 
                         celebrate a job well done. Cheers --
                              (he raises his glass)
                         -- and thank you.

               And Teague raises his glass across the room.

               EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT

               Ada appears at the door opening it onto the porch. She's 
               carrying a tray with drinks. Acknowledges Inman.

               He goes into the night rain. She watches him.

               EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               A beautiful day, the farm peaceful. Inman walks up the path 
               to the farmhouse, its borders flowering and pretty, a slave 
               woman weeding. He knocks on the door. Monroe answers.

                         I should probably get along.

                                     ADA
                         Mr. Inman is more comfortable 
                         outdoors. Perhaps we might take a 
                         walk.

                         A splendid idea.

               EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Monroe and Inman and Ada touring the farm. It's a biggish 
               property, over three hundred acres. And well-tended by the 
               dozen slave farmhands who work it, some of whom are dotted 
               about in the landscape. Rolling mountains dominate the view.

                              (expansive)
                         I want to get sheep into this field. 
                         A big field doesn't look right without 
                         sheep. You're a lucky fellow, Mr. 
                         Inman, you've had this view all your 
                         life.

                                     INMAN
                         I think so.

                                     MONROE
                         It's a special view. I dragged my 
                         poor daughter to Cold Mountain from 
                         Charleston because of my Doctors -- 
                         they say my heart is weak -- so the 
                         air's meant to do me good. But it's 
                         the view I think heals.

               Ada walking behind, comes alongside the two men, threading 
               her arm into her father's but, by so doing, also arriving 
               next to Inman.

                         I have to get on my visits. Can I 
                         offer you a ride back into town?

               Inman looks at Ada. No word.

               INT. PARLOUR, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               From the window Ada watches the Cabriolet head towards town.

               At the piano, she unwraps the leather lace from the package 
               of music. Inside the first book of music, there's a 
               DAGUERREOTYPE OF INMAN with his LeMats, a typical Confederate 
               pose. Some of the music has left its imprint on the picture, 
               the notes like a melody over Inman's face. Ada picks them 
               out on the piano.

               The ebullient sound of Shape Singing. A noisy choir letting 
               rip --

               INT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN, MAY 20TH, 1861. DAY

               -- THE WHOLE CHURCH IS SINGING, MEN TO ONE SIDE: WOMEN TO 
               THE OTHER. Monroe conducts, sings. Inman is there, as is 
               Ada. He fixes on her neck, the way the hair falls.

               The door bursts open. Young OAKLEY, apologetic nod to Monroe, 
               sits at the back, then leans forward, as the singing 
               continues, to say something to Rourke, who says something to 
               Butcher, the news spreading like wildfire. Rourke gets up, 
               leaves. Butcher gets up next, follows. Another man. Another.

               Depleting the male voices, until only women and some of the 
               older men are singing and one side of the church is 
               practically empty.

               Inman, remains, fixed on Ada. Who does not look round.

               EXT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

               Those left in the congregation now spill out into what has 
               become a melee as the NEWS OF SECESSION goes up. Enormous 
               excitement, particularly among the boys, who now seem 
               curiously attractive to the girls. Inman blinks out into the 
               sun, Ada finds him. They're awkward as they watch other 
               sweethearts embracing.

                                     ADA
                         Well, you have your war.

               TEAGUE AND HIS MEN COME RIDING UP THE STREET, their horses 
               clearing a path amongst the celebrating crowd. Teague reins 
               in his horse and rides it up against Esco Swanger.

                                     TEAGUE
                         Those who follow Lincoln, or preach 
                         abolition, best keep one eye open 
                         when they're sleeping, Old Bogey Man 
                         might get you!

               Inman steps between Esco and Teague, holding the reins of 
               Teague's horse, easy and dangerous.

                                     INMAN
                         Are you the law all of a sudden?

               Teague produces a document, which he waves in the air.

                                     TEAGUE
                         That's right, son. Home Guard for 
                         Haywood County. I'm the law from 
                         today. You all go fight now. We'll 
                         watch your sweethearts.

               And he spurs on his horse, his fellow Home Guard falling in 
               behind, riding on over the ridge. Inman walks to Ada.

                                     INMAN
                         You might be safer back in Charleston.

                                     ADA
                         But then who'll be waiting for you?

               She puts a hand on his arm for a second. They both want to 
               get to the point of declaration but don't know how. They 
               stand, people noisy around them, those about to leave, those 
               about to be left.

                                     INMAN
                         I'm going to walk back inside the 
                         Chapel.

               And he does so, making his meaning clear for her to follow.

               INT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

               Inman walks inside. Stands with his back to the door. It 
               opens and closes. Inman turns. It's Monroe.

                                     MONROE
                         Did you want a quiet word?

               Now the door opens again and it's Ada. She's dismayed to see 
               her father.

                                     INMAN
                         Just some quiet.

                                     MONROE
                         Of course Ada.

               He indicates they should both leave. Inman sits at a bench.

               EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

               Monroe and Ada come into town in their cabriolet. They pass 
               under banners proclaiming the Confederate cause: Old Rip's 
               Awake! Watch out Yankees! The trap draws up by the Cold 
               Mountain General Store. Monroe lets Ada down.

                                     MONROE
                              (of his appointment)
                         I'll daresay Dr. O'Brien'll want to 
                         do a test or two.

                                     ADA
                         And then there'll be a coffee or 
                         two, a brandy or two...

               Monroe smiles in acknowledgement, gets back in the trap. Ada 
               heads into the store.

               INT. BEDROOM. ROOMING HOUSE. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

               INMAN SITS ON HIS BED, wearing pants and a vest. His room is 
               like a monk's cell. Nothing in it. Inman's trunk is packed.

               He's polishing his boots, in his bare feet. One hand inside 
               the boot, the other blacking it. There's a knock at the door.

               He opens it. It's Ada. He abruptly closes the door on her.

               INT. HALLWAY, ROOMING HOUSE. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

               Ada waits outside. She's not sure what's happening. Then 
               Inman opens the door. He's buttoning his shirt. His boots 
               are on, one conspicuously dirty, one highly polished. Somebody 
               walks up the stairs, carrying a jug and bowl. They separate 
               as the man passes them. They're tender, awkward.

                                     ADA
                         I found you this book. William 
                         Bartram. They tell me it's good. I 
                         think he writes about these parts, 
                         the author, so...

               Inman takes it.

               She has something else. Wrapped in paper.

                                     ADA
                         And this...
                              (hands it to him)
                         I'm not smiling in it. I don't know 
                         how to do that, hold a smile, so now 
                         I'm solemn...

                                     INMAN
                         Ada...

                                     ADA
                         What?

               HE KISSES HER, pressing into her, his arm circling her waist.

               Below them the sound of a MARCHING BAND. It's the RECRUITMENT 
               PARADE and brings Rourke and Butcher racing down the stairs.

               Inman pulls away from Ada as the boys hurtle for the front 
               door.

                                     ROURKE
                         Let's go!

               EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

               Rourke, Butcher, and then Inman appear in the doorway of the 
               Rooming House, and then fall in with the motley crew of 
               Volunteers AS THEY MARCH BY WITH THE BAND AND THE ENLISTED 
               SOLDIERS. The town is out to wish them well, parents, younger 
               brothers, sweethearts walking alongside their brave men. Ada 
               comes to the door of the Rooming House. Inman looks back and 
               sees her, but almost immediately loses her in the crowd. THE 
               DRUMMERS DRUM, THE CROWD CHEERS, THE RECRUITS MARCH UP THE 
               HILL --

               EXT. BEHIND CONFEDERATE LINES, VIRGINIA. DAY

               -- AND THE WOUNDED AND THE WRETCHED STRAGGLE ALONG THE 
               RAILROAD.

               A TRAIN with the seriously injured snakes past the back of 
               the Confederate lines -- its suburbs of supplies, arriving 
               and departing troops -- and into peaceful country. FIDDLE 
               PLAYS, THEN A BANJO.

               INT. BOX CAR. DAY

               A CROWDED WAGON. It's a cauldron, and those able smash through 
               the wooden walls to make a breathing hole. Some have their 
               heads thrust out like crated poultry. INMAN IS IN THERE, 
               neck bandaged, its ugly seepage making a bloody necklace. 
               The light plays black and white through the boarded sides of 
               the boxcar, flashing on Inman's face as he drifts in and out 
               of consciousness. He focuses and sees the strange head of 
               STOBROD'S FIDDLE. Stobrod is serenading him, accompanied by 
               an angel-faced and extremely heavy child-man, PANGLE, whose 
               grin of delight seems permanent even in this claustrophobic, 
               grim world. Inman is panicked, puts a hand to push the fiddle 
               away. His voice is a croak, spoiled.

                                     INMAN
                         I'm not dying.

                                     STOBROD
                              (to Pangle)
                         What'd he say?

                                     PANGLE
                         Says he ain't about to die.

                                     STOBROD
                              (to Inman)
                         Truth to tell they say you are, 
                         Soldier. We'll meet again, in the 
                         better world.

               He changes his tune, and the tempo, finding a foot-slapping 
               rhythm, the two musicians grinning at each other. Inman lapses 
               back into unconsciousness. The rhythm becomes a hammering 
               sound...

               EXT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

               -- AS A MAN HAMMERS A TINTYPE OF HIS SON'S FACE into the 
               wooden porch of the Chapel, where it joins many other 
               portraits of those lost to the war. Monroe presides. One of 
               the slaves from Black Cove holds the ladder for the bereaved 
               father. Other families wait, with their own daguerreotype to 
               mount. It's a memorial service without bodies.

               Riders approach. Home Guard. Teague brings his horse up 
               alongside Monroe at the Chapel door, tips his hat in 
               condolence to the bereaved families. With him is a young, 
               intensely beautiful and flamboyant rider, BOSIE, his hair 
               long, a single fingernail bizarrely overgrown. Somehow 
               sinister.

                         Keep an eye on the negro. They want 
                         what the white man got -- all of you 
                         watch out your brave boys give their 
                         lives to war and meantime your slaves 
                         carry murder, rape and arson to your 
                         firesides.

               Cold Mountain at its loveliest. The CABRIOLET with Monroe 
               and his daughter heads towards the farm. At a bend they meet 
               a couple of riders, TWINS, from Teague's Home Guard, riding 
               furiously past them. Monroe reins in the trap and lets them 
               thunder past before continuing on their way home. Monroe is 
               intrigued by Ada, as if he's never looked at her before.

                         He gives you alcohol and you get 
                         emotional.

               She squeezes his arm.

                                     MONROE
                         We commiserate about the folly of 
                         this terrible war.
                              (they ride in silence)
                         Do you worry when there's no word 
                         from him?
                              (no response)
                         From Mr. Inman?

                                     ADA
                         Yes. But then I've tried counting 
                         the number of words which passed 
                         between Mr. Inman and me.
                              (looking ahead, seeing 
                              smoke)
                         Is that a bonfire? So close to the 
                         barns.

               Then they see THE FAMILY OF SLAVES turn off the road as their 
               cabriolet approaches, running away into the fields.

                                     ADA
                         What's going on?

                                     MONROE
                              (shouting at the 
                              disappearing slaves)
                         Hey! Stop there! Hey!

               Monroe gets out of the cabriolet and runs into the fields 
               after the retreating family, who are carrying bundles, chairs, 
               personal items, all loaded up. Ada has already taken the 
               reins and has driven up to the house. THE BARN IN WHICH THE 
               SLAVE FAMILY HAD LIVED IS ON FIRE. Monroe catches one of the 
               women, remonstrates with her. She's upset, distressed, one 
               of her sons comes back, pushes Monroe to the ground. They 
               hurry away. Monroe gets up, hurries to the fire.

               A FIGURE SWINGS IN THE HEAT OF THE FLAMES, HANGING FROM A 
               BEAM. Monroe spies it as he catches up with Ada.

                                     MONROE
                         Dear God.

                                     ADA
                         No, Daddy, it's not real.

               The figure swings round. IT'S AN EFFIGY, A GROTESQUE 
               CARICATURE OF A BLACK MAN.

                                     MONROE
                              (appalled)
                         What is wrong with us all?

               Ada turns and runs off.

                                     ADA
                         I'll get help.
                              (shouting over her 
                              shoulder)
                         Keep away from the flames.

               Monroe stands and considers the flames. Ada turns back once 
               more to see him -- a small man silhouetted against the blaze.

               INT. HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. DAY

               INMAN lies; bandaged, eyes closed, in THE BALLROOM OF A 
               COLONIAL MANSION, co-opted as one ward of a Confederate 
               hospital. Rows of beds, the wounded and the dying, are lodged 
               between some vestiges of the room's former glory.

               SOME LOCAL WOMEN, conscious of their duty to the cause, are 
               brought through by an exhausted doctor, who's lost all his 
               grace. The windows are open, but it's still insufferably 
               hot, the muslin curtains barely moving.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Most of these men will be dead by 
                         the morning or, if they're stubborn, 
                         by nightfall. I have other men outside 
                         in the quadrangle waiting for the 
                         beds.

               The women try to process this, the attitude.

                                     DOCTOR
                         So, any kind word will be a blessing.

               One woman is overpowered by the stench, gags.

                                     DOCTOR
                         It's the heat. I'm sorry. They rot.

               The women begin to approach the beds.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Don't pray. If they're not God fearing 
                         you can stir up a hornet's nest.

               MRS. MORGAN, nervous, decent, sits next to INMAN. His mouth 
               is moving. She doesn't know what he's saying.

                                     MRS. MORGAN
                         I'm sorry, you want water?

               She bends to him again. His voice is a faint croak.

                                     INMAN
                         Pigeon River. Little East Fork.

               The Doctor is on his exit, stops at the bed.

                                     MRS. MORGAN
                         I'm sorry. I don't know what he's 
                         saying.

                                     DOCTOR
                         They ramble. Names of loved ones.

                                     MRS. MORGAN
                              (listening to Inman)
                         Pigeon River. Is that a place? Cold 
                         Mountain?

               The Doctor shrugs, not a detective, moves on, stops at the 
               man in the next bed. Has a brief look, calls to a nurse.

                                     DOCTOR
                         This man is dead.

               EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. LATE AFTERNOON

               Monroe and Ada are outside, a picnic at the summer table, 
               autumn leaves blowing up around them. Nearby the charred 
               skeleton of the barn. Ada gets up, clears away.

                                     MONROE
                         Thank you.
                              (staying her for grace)
                         For your Providence, Oh lord, we 
                         thank you.

                                     ADA
                         Amen. That was the last of the ham.

                                     MONROE
                         It was delicious.

                                     ADA
                         I have to learn how to cook.

                                     MONROE
                         I was going to say something in 
                         Chapel. Perhaps some of the womenfolk 
                         will volunteer.

                                     ADA
                         I can't have people coming here and 
                         cooking for me!

                                     MONROE
                         It's my fault. I should have raised 
                         you less like a companion and more 
                         like a young woman. I'm sorry.

                                     ADA
                         I'm not sorry, but I don't know how 
                         we'll get through another winter.

                                     MONROE
                         Will you play me something? Something 
                         peaceful while I look over my sermon.

               Ada takes the dishes away. He gets out his papers, his pen 
               and ink.

               INT. PARLOUR, BLACK COVE FARM. DUSK

               ADA PLAYS THE PIANO. Chopin's Prelude in E Minor. Outside in 
               the garden, Monroe has adjourned to his striped campaign 
               chair, and is hunched over his notes. The door of the parlour 
               is open and the music floats over to him as he works.

               Ada plays. A FEW SPOTS OF RAIN appear at the window. Then 
               the steady drumming of a summer shower.

                                     ADA
                              (still playing)
                         Daddy, bring the tablecloth in with 
                         you!

               She plays some more. Monroe hasn't come in. The rain splashes 
               on to the window..

                                     ADA
                         Daddy, come inside before you drown!

               After a few more bars, she stops playing and, curious, goes 
               to the door. She stands at the doorway. MONROE'S SERMON IS 
               CAUGHT IN THE WIND AND BLOWS AROUND HIM, THE INK RUN TO

               ABSTRACTIONS, his hand dropped and visible to Ada as, with 
               dread, she approaches. SHE CATCHES THE SODDEN PAPERS, CHASING 
               AFTER THEM, THEN REACHES HER DEAD FATHER.

               He's like a fish, his face shining with the rain, and glass 
               eyed. She leans in to him, her head to his heart, then runs, 
               oblivious to the rain, her dress already drenched, runs down 
               the lane.

                                     ADA (V.O.)
                         Dear Mr. Inman...

               INT. HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. NIGHT

               INMAN'S FACE as he drifts in and out of consciousness. Mrs. 
               Morgan, the hospital volunteer, sits by Inman's bed. She 
               holds ADA'S UNOPENED LETTER, badly weather damaged, the pages 
               stuck together, the writing blurred where the ink has run.

                                     MRS. MORGAN
                         It's come to you by way of Virginia.

               There are various dates, which she decodes.

                                     MRS. MORGAN
                         It's not too recent -- written this 
                         past winter. I'm afraid I can't read 
                         who it's from. Dear Mr. Inman,

               INT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT

               Ada is writing at her father's desk. A lonely room.

                                     ADA (V.O.)
                         -- I'm still waiting, as I promised 
                         I would, but I find myself alone and 
                         at the end of my wits --

               INT. HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. NIGHT

               Mrs. Morgan reads to Inman, trying to decipher the letter:

                                     MRS. MORGAN
                         -- at the end of my wits, so now I 
                         say to you, plain as I can, come 
                         back to me. Come back to me is my 
                         request.
                              (can't read the next 
                              bit)
                         Then something I can't read, 
                         something, come back to me.

               Inman is very still. Then, eyes glinting with determination, 
               gives a TINY NOD.

                                     OFFICIAL (O.S.)
                         By order of Zebulon Vance, Governor 
                         of this great state of North Carolina: 
                         any soldier turned deserter is guilty 
                         of treason and shall be hunted down 
                         like a dog. 

               EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

               Ada walks down the hill from the Chapel. There is an absence 
               of young people, but the older folk are gathered round the 
               General Store where a UNIFORMED OFFICIAL is reading from a 
               document.

                                     OFFICIAL
                         -- Any man takes in a deserter is 
                         likewise guilty of treason.

               The Official is flanked by Teague, Bosey and the twins, puffed 
               up with self-importance. Ada has to walk around him to enter 
               the store.

                                     OFFICIAL
                         The Home Guard is powered to enter 
                         any place it sees fit, without notice 
                         or constraint. Names of all deserters 
                         will be posted in every town, 
                         published in every newspaper.

               INT. GENERAL STORE, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

               The Official continues outside as Ada enters. Ada approaches 
               Mrs Castlereagh, the owner.

                                     ADA
                         Is there a letter for me?

                                     MRS. CASTLEREAGH
                         Nothing -- we're getting no post 
                         through at all -- although if you 
                         slip out back the material you ordered 
                         has arrived.

               They go to the back of the store, to a screened-off area. 
               Mrs. Castlereagh hands her over a packet of material. There's 
               another, more furtive, transaction to take place. Mrs 
               Castlereagh hands over a second parcel as if it were 
               narcotics. Ada tears at the wrapping. It's a parcel of books.

                                     MRS. CASTLEREAGH
                         If folks knew I was taking deliveries 
                         from the North.

                                     ADA
                         I know. Thank you so much.

                                     MRS. CASTLEREAGH
                         The sooner we lose this war the 
                         better. Already one boy gone, another 
                         with his leg took off at the knee. 
                         That's enough.

                                     ADA
                         What do you hear?

                         All I know is they say not one boy 
                         in ten from these mountains is coming 
                         home again and most of them are 
                         deserters.

               EXT. GENERAL STORE, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

               Ada emerges, almost collides with Teague. She wriggles past 
               him, tries to make her package invisible.

               EXT. APPROACH TO BLACK COVE FARM - DAY

               IT'S WINTER. A solitary RIDER jogs his horse through the 
               frost, towards Black Cove farm.

               Ada is working at a handpump, failing to coax water from the 
               well. She's wrapped in blankets. The farm is somewhat unkempt 
               and so is she. The hem of her skirt is frayed. She rips at 
               it tearing off a strip of material, which she binds around 
               the handle in an attempt to thaw the mechanism. Then she 
               looks up to see the horseman approaching. It's Teague. Ada 
               immediately heads inside the house.

               Teague arrives at the house, takes a brace of RABBITS from 
               his saddlebag. He heads for the gate. The gate needs oiling, 
               the path is overgrown, he looks at the pump handle, the 
               abandoned pitcher.

               Ada opens the door, pinning her hair.

                                     TEAGUE
                         It's taken me too long, but I've 
                         come to pay my respects.

                                     ADA

                         I reckoned you might need fattening 
                         up.

               Ada takes them. She is very queasy with these dead animals.

               He turns and stops at the gate, runs his hands through his 
               hair and uses the grease to ease the hinge. Then steps up 
               onto his horse, and rides away. Ada watches him. Shudders.

               INT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT

               Ada comes into the kitchen. A weak oil-lamp reveals THE TWO 
               RABBITS, partially covered on a plate, flies buzzing around 
               them, a little liquid leaking from them. Ada takes a knife 
               and contemplates skinning gutting them. Suddenly she gathers 
               them up and runs out.

               EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT

               ADA BURIES THE TWO RABBITS. The wind howls. She covers the 
               little hole with soil and stones. Pumps out water to wash 
               her hands. Thinks she hears a noise, listens, alert to any 
               unfamiliar sounds, then hurries back to the house.

               INT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT

               Ada comes inside, she closes the door. Locks it. Puts a chair 
               against it. Goes upstairs, to her bedroom.

               INT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT

               Ada enters her bedroom. It's a chaos of books, clothes, 
               dishes. She closes the door, sets another chair against it.

               Then drags her armchair up against that, books and papers 
               spilling onto the floor. She props up Inman's portrait, on, 
               the chair, as if he were guarding her. Sits on the bed and, 
               desolate, begins to write:

               EXT. THE OCEAN BY THE HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. DAY

                         Should I imagine you are dead and, 
                         that it is to your spirit I am 
                         writing? No word from you in all

               THERAPY FOR WOUNDED SOLDIERS. Some of those convalescing 
               swim or are helped to paddle in the healing sea. There are 
               rudimentary wheelchairs. Inman, a long way from home, is 
               amongst those sitting in one of these, very still, grey and 
               sick -- but alive. He pulls at the dressing on his neck, 
               exposing the still raw and livid wound to the sea air.

               Inman has his Bartram, his bookmark is the battered and foxed 
               picture of Ada, which he considers, before continuing to 
               read.

               Behind him A HUNDRED SLAVES AT WORK IN THE FIELDS, and behind 
               them the Mansion which has become the hospital. A series of 
               bells, of shouts, and the slaves stop working, prepare for 
               the long walk home, congregating, then forming a line, herded 
               by the foremen.

               Inman eases his position to bend over and dip his bandage in 
               the seawater. He brings the wet bandage to his neck, considers 
               the ocean, his fellow ragtag of wounded, the slaves, the 
               great fields, the Mansion. The whole meaning of this war 
               around him. A GRAVEL VOICE STARTS TO SING THE BLUES, CONTINUES

               EXT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

               -- A tintype of OAKLEY is added to the Chapel's votives, 
               hammered in alongside Rourke and Butcher. There are fifty or 
               more images now, the paint flaking around them. The exterior 
               of the Chapel, three years on, has taken on the burden of 
               recording history.

               There is no minister, no services, just the votives, 
               daguerreotypes or simply the names of those missing in action, 
               accompanied by tiny vases of wildflowers. The town shrouded 
               in mist, and quiet.

               EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. SPRING. DAY

               EVERYWHERE SIGNS OF PROFOUND NEGLECT, like a Grimm's fairy 
               tale of a deserted house. The fields are overgrown with weeds, 
               the gardens abandoned. The chickens have deserted the henhouse 
               and are wandering around the outbuildings, scuffing at the 
               packed dirt.

               Sally and Esco come up the overgrown path, avoiding the 
               chickens, and knock at the door.

                                     SALLY
                         Ada! Ada, It's Sally.

               They're seen from ground level, through a boxwood, as their 
               feet patrol the ground, turn away from the door, and then 
               retreat, their voices drifting away. Ada is there, crouching 
               in her hidey-hole, a blanket on the ground, her book. She 
               wants to reveal herself, but is too embarrassed.

                                     ESCO
                         Will you look at the state of this 
                         place!

                         Poor soul. She's got nobody and 
                         nothing and three hundred acres of 
                         misery.

               During this a ROOSTER, black and gold, struts into the 
               boxwood. As the rooster approaches, Ada shudders, tries to 
               shoo it away without alerting her presence. Ada peers through 
               the boxwood as Sally and Esco close the gate and recede. The 
               rooster comes at her again. She rises up, kicking out at it, 
               while he flares his wings, spurs flaying at her. Ada runs 
               from the boxwood, tormented by the triumphant rooster, which 
               continues to fly and scratch, driving her into the house.

               INT. ADA'S BEDROOM BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ada dabs at the scratches, her dress rolled down to the waist 
               to reveal her arms and shoulders. Now she shucks off the 
               dress completely and tries to find a clean replacement. There 
               isn't one, so she hunts through the overflowing laundry basket 
               for something less dirty.

               INT. MONROE'S BEDROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ada enters her father's room, wearing undergarments.

               Everything as he left it and, in contrast to the rest of the 
               house, extremely tidy. She opens a wardrobe, finds one of 
               his coats, puts it on. It's much too big, and she rolls up 
               the sleeves, catches her pinched face and disheveled face in 
               a swivel mirror. She turns the mirror away and the image 
               swings into --

               EXT. GATES OF HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. DAY

               -- the figure of Inman walking, frail, grey. A kind of 
               lurching walk, as if his balance isn't guaranteed. He gets 
               close to the gate and interests a Guard, on the lookout for 
               would-be deserters. A BLIND MAN IS SELLING PEANUTS which he 
               roasts over a small fire. He's always singing. Inman 
               approaches. When Inman speaks, his voice is a croak.

                         woman. Though I put my hand on all

                         there I'd sure liked to have had a

                         Ten minutes! Wouldn't give an Indian 
                         head cent. I fear it might turn me 
                         hateful.

                         That ain't the way I meant it. You 
                         said ten minutes. It's having a thing 
                         and then the loss I'm talking about.

                         Then we don't agree. There's not 
                         much I wouldn't give for ten minutes 
                         of someplace.

                         men who take themselves a walk.

               EXT. TREE PROMENADE, CHARLESTON. DAY

               Inman and a bunch of other walking wounded make their way, 
               under supervision, towards the town. The grandeur of the 
               approach, the carriages. The sorry state of the soldiers.

               INT. COURTHOUSE, CHARLESTON. DAY

               TWO GREAT TRESTLE TABLES, LOADED WITH CLOTHES. Underneath 
               the tables, boots -- laced together, origins various. The 
               charitable womenfolk are helping match clothes to recovering 
               soldiers, some of whom are still on crutches, or in 
               wheelchairs. Inman finds a black dresscoat, some pants, a 
               pair of boots. He accumulates a little pile. On his way out, 
               AN ELDERLY AND STAUNCH CONFEDERATE GENTLEMAN shakes his hand 
               and gives him an apple from the barrel.

               EXT. TEMPORARY BARBERSHOP, CHARLESTON. DAY

               Inman emerges from the Courthouse and joins the line for a 
               shave at the makeshift barbershop set up outside the 
               Courthouse. Two barbers, two chairs. A VERY ELEGANT SQUARE, 
               SOME STUCCO-FRONTED BUILDINGS, A GLIMPSE OF THE MONEYED SOUTH 
               IN SHARP CONTRAST TO THE MODEST TOWN OF COLD MOUNTAIN. AN 
               AUCTION HOUSE OPPOSITE ADVERTISES SLAVES, CATTLE, LAND...

                                     BARBER
                         Next.

               Inman settles in the seat. The Barber contemplates his scraggy 
               beard, the livid, scabbed wound on his neck.

                                     BARBER
                              (nervous)
                         I'll cut your hair, but I ain't about 
                         to shave you. That thing opens up, 
                         your head's liable to falloff.

               INT. HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. PREDAWN

               It is almost dawn. The window by Inman's bed is a frame giving 
               onto the still dark world. The Night Guard passes by on its 
               patrol of the perimeter. A CLEAN-SHAVEN INMAN IS FULLY DRESSED 
               UNDER THE COVERS. He gets his hat, pushes his book into his 
               knapsack and, with one step up, WALKS OUT OF THE WINDOW AND 
               INTO THE WORLD.

               EXT. THE OCEAN BY THE HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. DAWN

               Inman, his footprints in the sand, as he hurries along by 
               the edge of the ocean, away from the hospital...

               EXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY

               -- as Ada walks, the wind kicking up around her, past the 
               Swanger place. She's bent and curiously dressed in her 
               father's coat.

                                     SALLY (V.O.)
                         Ada...

               Sally Swanger calls out from the field. She's concerned at 
               Ada's gaunt, ragged appearance. Ada waits for her approach.

                                     SALLY
                         You're skinny as a whippet, girl -- 
                         you're coming indoors with me.

                         I can't. I'm not -- I need to clean 
                         some clothes.

                                     SALLY
                         Great God, you ever looked at my 
                         husband! I can't get him to wear 
                         decent Church clothes Christmas 
                         morning. Hang on to me, the wind'll 
                         blow you over.

               And she folds her arm into Ada's. They walk up the lane.

               INT. SWANGER FARM. AFTERNOON

               Ada eats. Esco across from her contemplating her evident 
               appetite, the oversized man's jacket. Sally ladles more food 
               onto Ada's plate.

                         but it's what folks do, like when 
                         they dangle a needle over the belly 
                         to see if you're carrying a boy or a

               EXT. YARD, SWANGER FARM. LATE DAY

               AN IMAGE -- DISTORTED, WATERY. IT'S HARD TO RESOLVE BUT COULD 
               BE A CORRIDOR OF TREES. THE SUN LOW AT ONE END, THE SILHOUETTE 
               OF A FIGURE WALKING SLOWLY FORWARDS, A SUDDEN DISTURBANCE OF 
               CROWS.

               Ada is bent backwards over the well, a hand mirror glinting 
               down into the blackness. The reflection is elusive against 
               the bright evening sky, the sun almost set, and low.

                         See anything?

                         dickybird.

               The image is clearer. The trees sharpen, the figure walking, 
               the steep incline of the corridor, all fiercely black and 
               white as if it were a carpet of snow and black hieroglyphs 
               of trees, and crows flying. The trick of the glass and the 
               watery disc of the well surface. A buzzing in Ada's ears, 
               something like a distant music. Then the figure seems to 
               suddenly pitch forwards, but at that moment, Ada -- canted 
               over, getting dizzy has to move and the image flies away, 
               replaced with the sky, the flash of the setting sun.

                         You all right?

               Ada's faint. She sits up, blank, a little shaken.

                         Yesterday I found myself crouched

               EXT. PLANTATION. DAY

               Inman walks along an expanse of marshland. Great cranes fly 
               heavily over him.

                         -- and staring down into its secrets, 
                         I thought I saw you there, walking 
                         back to me --

               EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. LATE AFTERNOON

               Ada is writing in her father's campaign chair, a blanket 
               wrapped around her, a rake propped next to her.

                                     ADA (V.O.)
                         -- or wished I did.

                         That cow wants milking.

               Ada looks up from her writing with a start. She covers her 
               letter, guiltily, instinctively. In front of her, at the 
               gate, is A YOUNG RAWBONED, FERAL WOMAN, OF INDETERMINATE 
               ORIGINS. She is barefoot, and dressed in a hand-dye_ shift 
               of blue. Her name is RUBY.

                         If that letter ain't urgent, the cow

                         help. Here I am.

               Ada is instantly defensive, intimidated.

                         is he?

               Ada gets up, nods to the corner of the yard. Ruby goes over.

               The Rooster gathers himself up for a new opponent.

               IN ONE MOVEMENT SHE PICKS UP THE BIRD AND TWISTS OFF ITS 
               HEAD.

                         Let's put him in a pot.

               EXT. CORNFIELDS. DAWN

               Inman's walking on a track which passes through cornfields, 
               the crop high and thick around him. He stops, hearing 
               something. Riders. He wades into the field, seeking cover in 
               the tall crop, lying in the dirt. Horses appear. HOME GUARD 
               MEN ON PATROL, A CHAIN GANG OF PRISONERS: SLAVES, DESERTERS 
               IN TOW, A COUPLE OF FEDERAL SOLDIERS. They have dogs, which 
               sniff and growl, intrigued by the fields, called back by the 
               Home Guard.

               Inman waits until they're well out of sight. AS HE GETS TO 
               HIS FEET IN THE GREAT FIELDS, ANOTHER BODY APPEARS, THEN 
               ANOTHER, THEN ANOTHER, THEN ANOTHER, ALL SLAVES ON THE RUN 
               DOTTED AROUND THE FIELD. He walks to the road, paying no 
               heed to them. They assemble, paying no heed to him and move 
               off in the opposite direction. Inman turns, looks at them.

                                     INMAN
                         Hey!
                              (they stop, turn)
                         I'd pay a dollar for an egg. A piece 
                         of cheese.

               They look at him, then continue on their way.

               INT. ADA'S BEDROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. PREDAWN

               Ada wakes up to persistent knocking.

               INT. KITCHEN, BLACK COVE FARM. PREDAWN

               Ada enters blearily, clutching her novel. Ruby already busy.

               EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. DAWN

               Ruby emerges, followed by Ada, chewing on a tomato.

                                     RUBY
                         -- we got our own story. Called Black 
                         Cove Farm: a catastrophe.

               She looks back at Ada for a reaction.

                                     RUBY
                         I can spell it, too. C-a-t-a-s-t-r-o-
                         phe. Learned the same place you did, 
                         in the schoolroom. That's one of the 
                         first words they taught me. Ruby

               They're heading for the stable.

               INT. STABLE, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ruby's already pitching hay. Turns to Ada.

                                     RUBY
                         You mucking out?

               Ada half-asleep, obedient, stunned by this energy.

                                     RUBY
                         Three years I was in school before 
                         my daddy -- saying God rest his soul 
                         is like wishing him what he had in 
                         life, cause he lived to rest, he was 
                         born tired -- before my daddy decided 
                         there was better use for my backside 
                         than have it sat all day in front of 
                         a blackboard.

               EXT. A FIELD OF WEEDS, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ruby dictates a list to Ada as they bustle along.

                         Number One -- layout a winter garden 
                         for cool season crops: turnips, 
                         onions, cabbage, greens.

               Ada scribbles, walks, scribbles.

               EXT. BARN, BLACK COVE FARM

               Ruby up a ladder, inspecting the roof.

               INT. COLD HOUSE, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ruby cleans out leaves and detritus from the stone channel, 
               allowing the stream to flow free and cool.

                         Number three: clay crocks for

               Ruby doing her version of soil analysis, scrunching the earth, 
               tasting it, spitting it out. Ada makes a face.

                                     RUBY
                         Clear and turn this field. No harm 
                         done letting it go fallow, now we'll 
                         do well.

               Ruby looks up. Ada catches up with her.

               EXT. APPLE ORCHARD, BLACK COVE FARM. DUSK

               Ruby, delighted, contemplates the bounty of apples.

                         There's survival. On them trees.

                              Ada)
                         You got a cider press or would that 
                         be wishing on a blessing?

                         Actually, yes, I think we do.

               Ruby whoops, jogs away. Ada, exhausted takes a bite of an 
               apple, watches her.

               EXT. A BLUFF. NIGHT

               INMAN WALKS A ROCKY TRACK, FALLING AWAY TO THE RIVER AT ONE 
               SIDE, A STEEP CLIFF TO THE OTHER, the way itself broken and 
               precarious, bad country to meet an enemy.

               Inman sees A LIGHT in the distance, a torch flicking in and 
               out of view, like a star to follow. He stops, narrows his 
               eyes to focus on the view, listening hard. He pulls out the 
               Lemats.

               A MAN, ALL IN BLACK, A HORSE IN TOW, IS AT THE EDGE OF THE 
               GORGE.

               The horse has a burden -- a sack or wrapped bundle draped 
               over either side of the saddle. The attempts to heave the 
               bundle onto his shoulders. He can't, and the bundle slips to 
               the ground, cover falling enough to glimpse an arm, a head. 
               IT IS THE BODY OF A BLACK GIRL. The man tries again to lift 
               her. He's clearly upset, despairing, his hat comes off to 
               reveal long, dandy's hair, all extravagant curls. He staggers 
               with the weight of the girl, heading for the lip of the deep 
               gorge.

               He kisses the girl again and again, cheeks, mouth, mumbling 
               to her. He's at the edge now and can just let her go. THEN 
               INMAN'S GUN IS AT HIS TEMPLE.

                                     INMAN
                         Don't let go. Just back up, nice and 
                         steady, do this all in reverse, you're 
                         going to end up with her draped back 
                         over your animal.

                                     VEASEY
                         Don't pull that trigger. I am a man 
                         of God.

                                     INMAN
                         I've killed several of them.

                                     VEASEY
                         I mean I am God's minister.

                                     INMAN
                         What part of God's business is 
                         throwing a woman down a gorge.

                                     VEASEY
                         A slave woman, can you see that in 
                         this light? She's black as a bucket 
                         of tar.

               He's retreating, on his way back to the horse.

                                     INMAN
                         Is she dead?

                                     VEASEY
                         Drugged her. Like you would a 
                         butterfly. And I care for her, that's 
                         the heartbreak of it.

               He has the girl back on the horse. Inman brings the torch up 
               to his face. It's tear-stained.

                                     VEASEY
                         She's got my bastard in her belly. 
                         What kind of pistol is that I never 
                         saw the like of it?

               EXT. VEASEY TOWN. NIGHT

               Inman leads the horse, with Veasey ahead of him, hands tied 
               behind his back, desperate for a reprieve.

                                     VEASEY
                         I'm begging you. It's better you 
                         blowout my brains than return me to 
                         this place.

                                     INMAN
                         Where does she live?

                                     VEASEY
                         In our house. She sleeps in our 
                         kitchen. You don't know me, friend, 
                         but the good Lord punished me with 
                         want. I am all appetite. That's all 
                         I do all day is want: food, the female 
                         parts...

                                     INMAN
                         Shut your mouth. I don't want a sermon 
                         every time I ask a question.

               They're in the town's main drag now. There's a Chapel and 
               next to it, a small house.

                                     INMAN
                         This your place?

                                     VEASEY
                         Dear God of misery.

                                     INMAN
                         You're going to put her back where 
                         she sleeps.

                                     VEASEY
                         I do that the Members will lynch me. 
                         Consorting with a nigger, adultery, 
                         siring a bastard while serving as 
                         their preacher. We're a strict 
                         congregation we've churched men for 
                         picking up a fiddle on the sabbath.

                                     INMAN
                         So you reckoned to kill her.

               Disgusted, Inman approaches the front door of the house.

                                     VEASEY
                         There's a back door. Have pity.

               And he leads Inman down a side path.

               INT. VEASEY HOUSE. NIGHT

               Veasey comes in, now carrying the girl. Inman comes behind, 
               the gun trained on Veasey as he sets her down by the fire.

                                     VEASEY
                              (whispering)
                         Thank you. I was going to do a 
                         grievous wrong.

               He looks longing at the girl as he puts the blanket around 
               her shoulders. He turns to Inman.

                                     VESEY
                         You tasted dark meat? Sweet as 
                         liquorice. I think I should go back 
                         up to my wife. She wakes at the 
                         slightest noise.

               Inman is incredulous that he thinks he can just go to bed...

                                     INMAN
                         You find me some paper and a pen.

               EXT. CHAPEL, VEASEY TOWN. DAWN

               INMAN HAS TIED A VERY DISTRAUGHT VEASEY TO A TREE IN FRONT 
               OF HIS CHAPEL. Inman is pinning a sheet of paper above 
               Veasey's head. It's covered in handwriting. A dog barks.

                                     VEASEY
                         You're not entitled to judge me! 
                         You're nothing but an outlier, plain 
                         as daylight!

               Inman has pulled a handkerchief from Veasey's jacket. He 
               stuffs it into his mouth, cutting this diatribe short. And 
               then he walks away leaving Veasey tied to the tree, cursing 
               through the handkerchief.

               INT. ADA'S BEDROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. PREDAWN

               Ada asleep. Ruby enters, shattering the calm.

                                     RUBY
                         Morning. Pigs: you have any loose in 
                         the woods?

                                     ADA
                         No. What? No. We bought our hams.

                                     RUBY
                         There's a world more to a hog than 
                         the two hams! Lard, for example, 
                         we'll need plenty --

               She picks up some discarded laundry, contemplates the 
               overflowing laundry basket.

                                     RUBY
                         The catastrophe of Ada Monroe's 
                         laundry.
                              (marching out)
                         I can feel you shutting your eyes.

               EXT. BOTTOM FIELD. BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ada and Ruby working with the horse to make the beginnings 
               of A SPLIT RAIL FENCE. As they struggle with a heavy rail, 
               Ruby is testing Ada.

                                     RUBY
                         What's this wood?

                                     ADA
                         I don't know. Locust?

                                     RUBY
                         Where's North?

                                     ADA
                         North is, North is --

                                     RUBY
                         Name me three herbs growing wild on 
                         this farm.

                                     ADA
                              (frustrated with Ruby 
                              and with herself)
                         I can't! I can't! All right? I can 
                         talk about farming in Latin. Will 
                         that do? I can read French. I know 
                         Harmony and Counterpoint. I know my 
                         Bible. I can name the principal rivers 
                         of Europe, but don't ask me to name 
                         one stream in this county. I can 
                         embroider, but I can't darn, I can 
                         arrange cut flowers, but I can't 
                         grow them. If a thing has a function, 
                         if I might do something with it, it 
                         wasn't considered suitable.

                                     RUBY
                         Why?

                                     ADA
                         Ruby, you could ask why? about pretty 
                         much everything to do with me.

               They manage to get the first line of rail set down.

                                     ADA
                         This fence is about the first thing 
                         I've ever done that'll produce an 
                         actual result.

                                     RUBY
                         So you never wrapped your legs around 
                         this Inman?

               An old-fashioned look from Ada...

               EXT. SUNKEN FOREST. DAY

               Inman finds himself in A SUNKEN FOREST OF PINE. He moves 
               warily, his beard longer, his figure gaunt, his clothes 
               weathering to a uniform smudge of charcoal.

               He hears DOGS BARKING IN THE DISTANCE, FAINT SHOUTS. He picks 
               up his pace, skirts round the swampy lake.

               EXT. CAPE FEAR RIVER. DUSK

               Inman comes to the bank of a HUGE RIVER. The water, as the 
               light begins to go, is the color of mud, with bubbles, 
               belching to the surface, full of ugly prominent. Inman is 
               almost jogging now, an ear tracking his still distant 
               pursuers. The river is too wide to contemplate swimming and 
               now it begins to curve left, forcing him -- against his 
               judgment, to circle back. He approaches A SMALL JETTY.

               A sign: Ferry $5. Yell Loud.

               On the far bank there's A CABIN ON STILTS above the highwater 
               mark. Inman calls out, reluctantly, his voice still a kind 
               of growl. Then again.

               A TINY FIGURE steps out of the cabin and waves before jumping 
               into a small canoe. The canoe heads against the current, the 
               rower's back bent with the effort. As the canoe approaches, 
               Inman sees that the ferryman is, in fact, A YOUNG GIRL, not 
               eighteen. She doesn't look at him. He produces five dollars. 
               She eyes the bill with contempt.

                                     FERRYGIRL
                         For five dollars I wouldn't give a 
                         parched man a dipper of this 
                         riverwater.

                                     INMAN
                         Sign says ferry, five dollars.

                                     FERRYGIRL
                         This look like a ferry? My Daddy's 
                         dead, or gone off to the Federals, 
                         don't matter which. I'm the way across 
                         now.

                                     INMAN
                         What's the name of this thing?

                                     FERRYGIRL
                         Nothing but the mighty Cape Fear 
                         River, is all.

               A dog barks in the distance. Getting closer. Inman turns to 
               the sound. The Ferrygirl is well aware of her leverage.

                                     FERRYGIRL
                         Nobody crosses this water unless 
                         they're running from someplace. Some 
                         cross one way, some the other: makes 
                         no difference, they're all running. 
                         You want to wait for your friends?

                                     INMAN
                         I can give you thirty dollars script.

                                     FERRYGIRL
                         Let's go.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Hey! Hey! Wait!

               Inman is astonished to see VEASEY stumble out of the trees. 
               His head is shaved, his face bruised and swollen, his clothes 
               castoffs and ill-fitting, cinched at the waist with rope. He 
               stumbles towards Inman, urging him to get on with the journey.

                                     VEASEY
                         Keep going. We're both in trouble.

               He gets straight into the canoe.

                                     INMAN
                         No. Get out.

                                     VEASEY
                         It's Homeguard. Made me tell them 
                         all about you.

                                     INMAN
                         I should have shot you when I had 
                         the chance.

               Shouts, more barking. Inman jumps in the canoe, and they're 
               off. The Ferrygirl turns the boat around, rows them away 
               from the jetty with the grace of someone doing something for 
               the thousandth time.

                                     VEASEY
                         I'm not looking for revenge, by the 
                         way. For what you did to me. No, I'm 
                         a Pilgrim now, like you, traveling 
                         the road, paying our dues, relying 
                         on the kindness of strangers.

                                     INMAN
                         You're nothing like me and the last 
                         thing I want right now is a 
                         conversation.

                                     VEASEY
                              (to Ferrygirl)
                         You recall Job in the scriptures? I 
                         will give free utterance to my 
                         complaint. I will speak in the 
                         bitterness of my soul. That's our 
                         friend here...
                              (to Inman)
                         They cut off my hair. Which was hard. 
                         I was vain about my hair.
                              (to Ferrygirl)
                         I had good curls. But I deserved it. 
                         I'm the Reverend Veasey. Have I seen 
                         you in church?

               Inman sits, scouring the bank for sign of his pursuers. The 
               sun is sinking fast.

                                     FERRYGIRL
                         I'm saving for a cowhide, and when I 
                         get it I aim to get a saddle made, 
                         and when I get me a saddle I'll save 
                         for a horse, and when I got a horse 
                         I'll throw on the saddle, and then 
                         you won't see my sorry ass round 
                         this swamp again.

               She has no love for the river. Another gurgle of viscous 
               bubbles around the canoe.

                                     VEASEY
                         What's that?

                                     FERRYGIRL
                         Catfish. 'gator. Keep your hand in 
                         the boat. Already looks like some 
                         critter chewed his neck.
                              (she looks at Inman)
                         Thirty more dollars, we can go to 
                         the cabin. I'll pull this dress over 
                         my head.

                                     VEASEY
                              (excited)
                         Have we got thirty dollars?

               A sharp sound, a tiny thwack of ball on meat. The Ferrygirl 
               SUDDENLY SLUMPS BACK and falls into the water.

               Veasey grabs out at the oar, but it goes, too. The girl sinks 
               quickly, A BLOODY GAP to the side of her head. Inman, on his 
               knees and stretching, can't help her. Then a second noise as 
               A HOLE THE SIZE OF A FIST appears in the canoe, just at 
               waterlevel. Water pours into the canoe. Dogs bark, and now 
               FIGURES are visible at the jetty. HOME GUARD. One of them 
               has a sniper's rifle and is loading for a third shot. Inman 
               can see him sighting the rifle. They lie flat in the canoe.

               ANOTHER GREAT FIST OF WOOD is gouged out. Now the boat is 
               almost full of water. Veasey spits out a foul mouthful. INMAN 
               ROCKS THE CANOE AND LETS IT TURN OVER ONTO THEM, Veasey 
               surfaces from under it, clutching the wood as a raft, but 
               the canoe CATCHES INMAN A BLOW TO HIS HEAD and he sinks. 
               Veasey hauls him to the surface and, surprisingly strong, 
               holds him with one fist, the boat with the other, lets the 
               current take them, pulling them under, then up, under, then 
               up, but clinging on, as the rifle continues to deliver its 
               assault, another shot into the boat, another into the water 
               near to Veasey's arm.

               THE GIRL'S BODY comes by them, carried by the river, the 
               dress billowing out almost covering her head. The sun has 
               gone, the light fading, the canoe sliding downriver away 
               from their aggressors.

               EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE CAPE FEAR. NIGHT

               In the moonlight, the canoe drifts into the muddy bank and 
               Veasey drags a half-drowned Inman to land, both of them 
               retching with the vile river water. AN ALLIGATOR eases into 
               the river not ten feet from where they lie, lungs heaving. 
               They get up. Veasey to his feet, Inman to his knees.

                                     VEASEY
                         You okay?

               Inman nods, coughs. And Veasey AIMS A KICK at Inman's head, 
               knocking him back into the mud.

                                     INMAN
                         Jesus, god!

                                     VEASEY
                         I figure that righteous, given our 
                         history. Otherwise I'd bear a grudge 
                         on our journey.

                                     INMAN
                         There's nowhere I'm going with you 
                         except to Hellfire!

               INT. ADA'S BEDROOM. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT

               Ada, her hair plaited in a new and simpler configuration, is 
               working on Ruby's hair, while Ruby experiments with some 
               earrings.

               A pile of Ada's jewelry on the bed beside them.

                                     ADA
                         Agricola poetis viam non monstrat.

                                     RUBY
                         Which means?

                                     ADA
                         The farmer does not point out the 
                         road to a poet.

                                     RUBY
                         Which means? Should be the other way 
                         round

                                     ADA
                         Which means, I suppose, which means 
                         the poet should know where he's going.

                                     RUBY
                              (of Ada's hairdressing)
                         It's no wonder you're helpless and 
                         hopeless if it takes this long to 
                         fix your hair.
                              (of the Latin)
                         Say some more.

                                     ADA
                         Terra mutata non mutat mores.
                              (can't believe she 
                              knows all these 
                              phrases by heart)
                         It's appalling what's in my head.

                                     RUBY
                         It's appalling what's in my head?

                                     ADA
                         No, it means: A change of place does 
                         not change a character.

                                     RUBY
                         Well that's surely true even in 
                         English.

                                     ADA
                         You can keep those earrings.

                                     RUBY
                         We can't keep anything.

                                     ADA
                         I have to keep the bangles. They 
                         were my mother's.

                                     RUBY
                         Well that's all. The rest is for 
                         trading. Else they can bury you in 
                         your finery.

                                     ADA
                              (of her hair)
                         You're done.

               There's a small mirror on a stand. It has Inman's picture 
               stuck in it. She picks it up, removing the tintype, and 
               holding it up for Ruby to see her hairstyle.

                                     RUBY
                         Good God! Okay.

               She takes the mirror and shows Ada her simple plait.

                                     ADA
                         I like it.

                                     RUBY
                         Takes two minutes. That's what I 
                         like.

               She puts the earrings back in the pile.

                                     RUBY
                         How much do you love that piano?

               EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. DUSK

               THE PIANO jangles down the rutted lane on the back of Mr. 
               Roy's cart. Ada watches, A SMALL FLOCK of sheep milling around 
               her in the path. Ruby is dragging a big sow towards the yard. 
               Ada picks up one of two sacks and staggers towards the house.

               INT. KITCHEN, BLACK COVE FARM. DUSK

               Ada arrives in the kitchen. They've got it under control 
               now, scrubbed and orderly. She puts the sack down next to 
               another one. Her hands are calloused, the finger nails cracked 
               and ruined, stripes of earth under them. Ruby comes in, 
               struggling with the last sack, pleased.

                                     RUBY
                         We're careful we'll get through the 
                         winter now. I made old man Roy give 
                         me ten of those sheep on account of 
                         I said they were so small put together 
                         they were no bigger than six proper 
                         sheep.

                                     ADA
                         My father always wanted sheep on 
                         this land.

                                     RUBY
                         I'm sorry you had to lose your piano. 
                         I cut off my hair once, for money. 
                         My daddy got two dollars for it. 
                         Made a wig for a rich feller in 
                         Raleigh.

               They're working as they talk, taking the sacks into the 
               larder, putting out stuff for the evening meal.

                                     RUBY
                         Stobrod called himself a musician -- 
                         my daddy -- he could play six tune 
                         on a fiddle. Got himself shot dead 
                         at Petersburg. I was like his goat 
                         or some creature tethered to a post. 
                         He left me once, up the mountains. I 
                         was eight. He was gone over two weeks.

                                     ADA
                         Oh Ruby.

                                     RUBY
                              (defiant)
                         I was all right! He'd walk forty 
                         miles for liquor and not forty inches 
                         for kindness.

                                     ADA
                         And your mother?

                                     RUBY
                         Never met her. We're the same in 
                         that regard. He said she was -- he 
                         told me a thousand stories -- she 
                         was a wolf or an indian or a donkey. 
                         Don't say much for him, except you 
                         know he'd be fast to work up a sweat 
                         on a tree if he thought there was 
                         pleasure in it.

               There's a pause. Ruby not easy with her emotions. Abruptly 
               she jumps up.

                                     RUBY
                         There's cows to milk.

               EXT. RIVER, EN ROUTE TO SALISBURY. DAY

               Inman stands in the river, hoping to catch a fish, trying to 
               concentrate. Veasey presides, complaining...

                                     VEASEY
                         Used to be as regular as morning 
                         prayers. Matter of fact I could set 
                         my watch by my bowels. That beeswax 
                         you fed me, day before yesterday, it 
                         stops a man up. Open my gut now they'd 
                         find turds stacked up like little 
                         black twigs.

               On a parallel track across the river, RIDERS... impossible 
               to say whether Home Guard or a Federal Raiding Party. Inman 
               splashes out of the water, pushes Veasey down, silencing 
               him. The riders pass.

               Veasey spots something shining in the grass, picks it up. 
               IT'S A LONG TWO-HANDED SAW.

                                     VEASEY
                         Hey! Look at this!
                              (flexing it)
                         This is a good saw.

                                     INMAN
                              (getting up)
                         It's not yours. You take it, you 
                         make us another enemy. You're a 
                         Christian -- don' t you know your 
                         commandments?

                                     VEASEY
                         You'll find the good Lord very 
                         flexible on the subject of property. 
                         We could do a lot with this saw...

               Inman is vexed, walks away. Veasey follows, experimenting 
               with the saw's music when flexed. Inman stalks on.

               EXT. NEAR A FORD. DAY

               Inman way ahead, full of purpose. Veasey still has the saw, 
               trots to catch up.

                                     VEASEY
                         Why you in such a hurry the whole 
                         time?
                              (no answer)
                         Hurry or slow the destination is 
                         always the same. It's only the journey 
                         that is different. That's either in 
                         the Good Book or I made it up.

               Inman suddenly stops, scowling, puts up a hand, listens.

               Inman carefully scouts the track then, with great caution, 
               edges towards the river bank.

               A HEAVY SET MAN labours in the water. He's contemplating THE 
               HUGE BLACK CARCASS OF A BULL which has slipped into the ford 
               and died. The man is wet and exasperated.

                                     VEASEY
                         Good day to you!

               The man turns, his spirit evidently lifted by the prospect 
               of help. His name is JUNIOR. He's working on roping the 
               animal.

                                     JUNIOR
                         My old bull, wandered off and died 
                         in this here creek. Fouled up our 
                         water is how I found it.

               Veasey is immediately an authority on bull removal.

                                     VEASEY
                         This is a tricky one.

               The three men contemplate the carcass, swatting away the 
               swarms of flies. Junior offers a swig from a jug of liquor.

               Inman refuses, Veasey takes a long pull, shudders happily.

                                     VEASEY
                         The name for the Bull's member is a 
                         tassel. I learned that and never 
                         forgot it.

                                     JUNIOR
                         Reckon I need a train of mules.

                                     VEASEY
                              (walking away)
                         I'm getting an idea. My saw is the 
                         remedy. Let's saw up some wood and 
                         make levers.

                                     INMAN
                         Then what?

                                     VEASEY
                         Lever him out. This'll work!

               He walks into the wood.

                                     JUNIOR
                         Where you two sports heading?

                                     INMAN
                              (inscrutable)
                         I don't know where he's heading. I'm 
                         going down the road. And I got a 
                         good way to go before nightfall.

                                     JUNIOR
                              (acknowledging his 
                              attitude)
                         Charitable of you to make a stop. 
                         Ain't for me to be curious.

                                     VEASEY
                              (emerges from the 
                              woods)
                         How do you work this damn thing?

                                     INMAN
                              (to Veasey)
                         Give me that saw.
                              (to Junior)
                         Come on.

               He takes the saw, walks to the bull, gets on one side, 
               indicates Junior should go to the other.

                                     INMAN
                         Let's do this in chapters.

               And they begin to SAW OFF THE BULL'S NECK.

               LATER, and they're in A VILE STEW OF BLOOD AND INNARDS. The 
               stomach opens and its contents gush into the creek. Veasey 
               is disgusted, draws back. The two other men haul up the rest 
               of the animal onto the banks. They're exhausted.

                                     INMAN
                         You might want to leave off that 
                         water for a day or two.

                                     JUNIOR
                         There'll be a tang, I'd imagine.

               EXT. TRACK APPROACHING JUNIOR'S CABIN. EVENING

               Junior, Inman and Veasey come around a bend and there's A 
               BIG CABIN LOOMING. It's in such poor repair that one end has 
               slipped from the stones which serve as it's foundation and 
               STANDS BADLY TILTED OVER. Junior roots up another hidden jug 
               of liquor, which he drinks from, then hands to Veasey.

                                     JUNIOR
                         There's my place. Hope you can stomach 
                         a yard chock-full of females. Brought 
                         my woman home, she showed up with 
                         her three so-called sisters and their 
                         brats. The noise in that place is 
                         something awful. It's why I go 
                         hunting.

                                     VEASEY
                              (considering the wild 
                              camber)
                         Looks a bit crooked.

                                     JUNIOR
                         It is on a bit of a tilt. Them 
                         females. They all roll down one end 
                         each night!

                                     VEASEY
                         -- Roll me over!

                                     JUNIOR
                         -- In the clover

                                     VEASEY
                         One good fart -- that'll tip over!

               They guffaw, delighted in the alcohol haze. Veasey suddenly 
               exclaims, hand in the air, rushes into the bushes.

                                     VEASEY
                         Oh God of my God! Hallelujah! 
                         Hallelujah!

                                     JUNIOR
                         What's up?

                                     VEASEY
                         The Israelites! The tribes of Israel 
                         are about to flee from the banks of 
                         Egypt! Hallelujah!

                                     INMAN
                              (explaining to Junior)
                         He's got a shit coming on. It's 
                         overdue.

                                     JUNIOR
                              (bewildered)
                         And he's a Preacher? Like a Christian?

                                     INMAN
                         Like a Christian.

                                     JUNIOR
                         Good God.

               EXT. JUNIOR'S CABIN. DUSK

               The three men arrive at the yard. DOGS AND CHILDREN MILL 
               AROUND THE VISITORS. FOUR WOMEN COME OUT, one after the other 
               each of them in simple shifts which seem to emphasis their 
               voluptuousness, or so it seems to Veasey. They freely stare.

                                     JUNIOR
                         These two boys is stopping for supper. 
                         They're on the road to Atonement.

               The women consider the men, then disappear back inside.

                                     VEASEY
                         Atonement is not a place.

                                     JUNIOR
                         So what is it when it's at home?

                                     VEASEY
                         Those are fine examples of the female.

                                     JUNIOR
                         Take them all and leave the saw. Be 
                         a sight more use.

                                     SHYLA
                              (reappearing)
                         If they want to get in a tub there's 
                         an hour before food.

                                     JUNIOR
                         They love to scrub a man.
                              (to Shyla)
                         Put the water on the boil.
                              (back to the men)
                         It's my liquor, gets their titties 
                         swinging.

                                     VEASEY
                              (excited)
                         God damn!
                              (to Inman)
                         I was right about sheep droppings 
                         those stools -- like rock hard. Quite 
                         astonishing.

               INT. SMOKEHOUSE AT JUNIOR'S CABIN. DUSK

               No real furniture. Veasey is shaving. Inman stows his knapsack 
               behind the woodburning stove, on which a big kettle of boiling 
               water steams away. Then he gets in the tub, his back to the 
               door.

               Shyla comes in, brings the kettle over to the tub, pours in 
               the steaming water. She appraises Inman. It's intensely 
               sexual.

                                     SHYLA
                         That's battered flesh.
                              (of his neck wound)
                         I could work a finger in there.

                                     VEASEY
                         He's a hero. Took that wound at 
                         Petersburg.

                                     INMAN
                         He doesn't know what I am.
                              (uncomfortable with 
                              her stare)
                         Thanks.

                                     SHYLA
                              (to Veasey)
                         He's shy, ain't he?

                                     VEASEY
                         Wait up a few minutes, I'll be in 
                         that tub, then we'll see who's a shy 
                         one.

                                     SHYLA
                         I want to poke my thumb in his holes.

               A second woman comes to the door. Dolly.

                                     DOLLY
                         Lila says supper's up.

               INT. JUNIOR'S CABIN, NIGHT

               LILA, JUNIOR'S WIFE, spoons out stew from a vast pot. The 
               table crammed with customers -- her three sisters, the three 
               men, the herd of dogs and filthy children. Nobody speaks. 
               Each time Lila bends over to spoon out of the pot, her 
               cleavage strains against the flimsy fabric of her dress. 
               Veasey's mesmerized. Inman is also getting drunk, his eyes 
               increasingly glazed. When Lila makes to sit down next to 
               Junior, he slides a hand up her dress, exposing a naked 
               buttock, which he strokes and pinches as he pulls away.

                                     LILA
                         Hey!

               Junior grins, looks over at Inman, then nudges Veasey.

                                     JUNIOR
                         He's gone now. Look! His eyes have 
                         gone.

                                     INMAN
                              (vaguely, drunk)
                         What?

                                     VEASEY
                         Dolly?

                                     DOLLY
                         S'me.

                                     VEASEY
                         Dolly, Lila, Shyla and Mae. That's a 
                         poem. That's a poem.

               He begins to recite, has a verse in his mind.

                                     VEASEY
                         Dolly, Lila, Shyla and Mae
                              (but he can' t summon 
                              it)
                         Da-da da-da da-da dae...
                              (vague)
                         ...there's a poem there.

                                     JUNIOR
                         I'm leaving soon as I'm full.

                                     VEASEY
                         Really. Goodbye.

                                     JUNIOR
                         Got a bunch of traps needs visiting. 
                         I'll be back tomorrow, before dark. 
                         You'll still be here?

                                     VEASEY
                         That's my fervent prayer.

                                     JUNIOR
                         My house is your house.

                                     INMAN
                              (suddenly)
                         Like to wash their hands and pray.

                                     VEASEY
                         Say again?

                                     INMAN
                         Dolly, Lila, Shyla and Mae.

                                     VEASEY
                         That's Job. Don't say much but even 
                         liquored up there's a preacher in 
                         him.

               Inman gets up suddenly, sways.

                                     INMAN
                         I'll say my goodbyes, got miles and 
                         miles to go before sunset.
                              (head spinning)
                         I'll just quickly lie down.

               And he stumbles over to the fire where he instantly curls 
               up.

                                     VEASEY
                         I'm heading for that smokehouse and 
                         I'm ready to be washed clean of my 
                         dirt.

               He gets up, wanders out of the door. Junior's eyes glint. He 
               jerks his head towards the girls then in the direction of 
               the smokehouse.

                                     JUNIOR
                         You go tend to him.
                              (to Lila)
                         I'll be seeing you.

               He picks up his gun and leaves Dolly gathering up the children 
               and herding them out.

                                     DOLLY
                         Come on you -- get!

               Shyla stays, Mae having gone off after Veasey. Lila waits 
               until the children have gone. They consider Inman supine by 
               the fire.

                                     LILA
                         He's mine. You can go rub yourself 
                         off on the Preacher.
                              (of Inman)
                         Gonna make him hug me till I grunt.

               Lila shepherds Shyla out, shuts the door, swigs from the 
               jug, walks over to Inman, then turns to the big table and 
               pushes pots and plates way down to one end to make a playing 
               field.

               Then she bends over the prostrate Inman.

                                     LILA
                         Hey!

               Inman stirs, glazed.

                                     LILA
                              (kneeling down to him)
                         You want to see what Mamma's got for 
                         you?

               SHE SLIPS A SLEEVE OF HER DRESS TO REVEAL A FULL BREAST.

               Inman is drunk, doesn't think he's awake. She takes her breast 
               to his mouth, and Inman suckles. Then she puts his hands 
               under the dress which rides up as his hands move between her 
               legs. She's naked.

                                     LILA
                         That's good. Ain't that sweet?

               SHE PULLS INMAN TO HIS FEET, KISSES HIM, THEN TURNS HER BACK 
               AND LIES FACE DOWN ON THE TABLE, HER BARE ASS UNDULATING IN 
               THE AIR.

                                     LILA
                         You just get on and ride me all the 
                         way to China.

               He doesn't move, except to sway, eyes glazed. She turns.

                                     LILA
                         You shy? You need a hand?
                              (goes to his buttons)
                         Let's have a look see what we can 
                         muster.

               She's kneeling now, her dress hunched up around her middle, 
               working the front of Inman's pants. He's in a swoon, 
               surrendering to her, getting aroused, his hand cupping her 
               head. ON CUE, THE DOOR CRASHES OPEN AND HE'S STARING DOWN 
               THE BARREL OF JUNIOR'S SHOTGUN.

               As Lila turns, Junior KICKS HER violently in the head, 
               knocking her over.

                                     JUNIOR
                         You little bitch! Look at you! Cover 
                         yourself up!

               NEXT HE SWINGS THE SHOTGUN BARREL AGAINST THE SIDE OF INMAN'S 
               HEAD. Inman falls back. Junior goes to the door and whistles.

               AND WITH THAT THE ROOM FILLS UP WITH A GROUP OF HOME GUARD 
               BRISTLING WITH WEAPONS AND PURPOSE. THEY SEIZE INMAN, DRAG 
               HIM OUT AS JUNIOR SPITS AND KICKS AT HIM.

               INT. SMOKEHOUSE AT JUNIOR'S CABIN. NIGHT

               Lila enters the smokehouse, hand to her bruised head. VEASEY'S 
               ON THE FLOOR, WITH DOLLY ASTRIDE HIM, HIS ARM CRUSHING A 
               NAKED MAE INTO AN EMBRACE. He considers Lila, beams:

                                     VEASEY
                         I had a special prayer you'd come 
                         visit.

               THREE MEN BURST IN BEHIND HER, RIFLES RAISED.

               EXT. JUNIOR'S CABIN. NIGHT

               Veasey led out, a CHAIN GANG waiting -- a bedraggled 
               collection of prisoners, slaves, deserters -- and now INMAN. 
               Veasey is joined to the line. It starts to rain.

               EXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY

               Ruby and Ada at the door of the Swanger house. They both 
               wear Monroe's clothes by now, like two little men. THEY'RE 
               CARRYING A SMALL SACK, A PIE UNDER A CLOTH. Ruby hammers at 
               the door, a little impatient. Sally Swanger opens it, has to 
               decode who it is under the clothes, the hats.

                                     SALLY
                         Ada Monroe and Ruby Thewes! Look at 
                         you both!

                                     RUBY
                         Look at us both what?

                                     SALLY
                         Like a coupla scarecrows after a 
                         thunderstorm.

                                     RUBY
                         We need a scarecrow, birds eating up 
                         half our winter garden.

                                     ADA
                         Sally's right. We should both stop 
                         toiling and stand a while with our 
                         arms stretch out. I'll volunteer.

                                     RUBY
                         We got something for you.

                                     ADA
                         For all your kindness. Coffee. And a 
                         pie.

                                     RUBY
                         That's real coffee. It ain't hickory 
                         and dirt.

                                     SALLY
                              (taking the gifts)
                         Thank you both.
                              (of the pie)
                         Ruby, I look forward to this. We all 
                         do. Esco and me.

                                     RUBY
                              (grinning at Ada)
                         She made it.

                                     ADA
                         I made it.

                                     SALLY
                         Good God in Heaven.

                                     RUBY
                              (by way of 
                              recommendation)
                         I'm still alive.

               Sally's strangely awkward, lingering at the door, staring at 
               the gifts...

                                     RUBY
                         We'll be getting along.

                                     SALLY
                              (nodding)
                         I know Esco's going to be real sorry 
                         he missed you. You all take care.

               They all kiss, then the girls walk back down the path. Ruby 
               is vexed.

                                     RUBY
                         That strike you as odd?

                                     ADA
                         What?

                                     RUBY
                         Stood at her front door?

                                     ADA
                         Sally?

                                     RUBY
                         Number one -- I know that woman all 
                         my life. I never stood outside her 
                         house -- she'd invite a wolf inside 
                         if it knocked on the door.

                                     ADA
                         Perhaps, I don't know, perhaps she 
                         was busy.

                                     RUBY
                         Number two -- Old Man Swanger was 
                         inside that house: I could smell his 
                         pipe burning. Number three -- look 
                         at these fields.

                                     ADA
                         What about them?

               She contemplated the stubble fields they're passing.

                                     RUBY
                         We came by here a week ago, they 
                         were waist high in hay.

               EXT. A PATH. DRIVING RAIN. NIGHT

               The Home Guard ride, bent under their oilskins, as the rain 
               tips down. Between the horses, unprotected and drenched, 
               their prisoners trudge along the muddy path. Inman and Veasey 
               among them. Veasey has grown some beard.

               AN OLDER MAN COLLAPSES, lies where he falls, not moving.

               There's a domino effect and so Inman falls on top of him. He 
               picks himself up, then tries to pull up the older man. He 
               doesn't move.

                                     INMAN
                         He's dead.

               The horses plough on. Inman shouts to BROWN, the leader.

                                     INMAN
                         This man's dead!

               Nobody pays any attention. He has to drag the body.

               EXT. VEASEY TOWN. DAY

               THE HOME GUARD ESCORT THE PRISONERS PAST VEASEY'S OLD CHURCH.

               More days have gone by and taken their toll on the prisoners, 
               Veasey and Inman are haggard and filthy and reduced. The 
               Home Guards stop for food, a wash, a break, chain the 
               prisoners to a horse rail.

               Citizens go by, Veasey knows them all. Some of them spit 
               contemptuously at the Deserters. None of them recognise 
               Veasey.

                                     VEASEY
                         Am I so altered that they don't see 
                         me?

               Somebody walks by with a young child.

               Veasey looks at Inman.

                                     VEASEY
                         I christened that child.

               The child stops, looks without recognizing, is tugged away 
               from the chain gang by his mother. One of the other prisoners, 
               SHEFFIELD, leans in to Inman, his voice low.

                                     SHEFFIELD
                         I'm looking to get out of this. They 
                         drag us back to fight -- we're just 
                         target practice for the Federal boys.

                                     INMAN
                         You run, we're all running with you, 
                         the lame and the stupid, of which we 
                         number both.

                                     SHEFFIELD
                         Either way we're fucked. Run or don't 
                         run.

                                     INMAN
                         Just give me some warning so I can 
                         tell the guard -- I'm not getting 
                         shot again for some cause I don't 
                         believe in.

               A GROUP OF SLAVES ARE WALKING BY, CARRYING SACKS. One of the 
               women is pregnant. Veasey studies the group, sees the pregnant 
               woman, recognizes her.

                                     VEASEY
                              (mesmerized)
                         That's Rebecca. That's Rebecca.
                              (he hisses)
                         Rebecca!

               In daylight it's apparent that Rebecca is a real beauty. She 
               turns at the sound of her name, stops, is confused. She sees 
               Veasey and approaches, appalled at his condition.

                                     REBECCA
                         Mas?

                                     VEASEY
                         Is it well with you?
                              (Rebecca nods)
                         I've been repenting for what I did. 
                         I've walked the road of atonement.

                                     REBECCA
                         Your curls is all gone.

               THE GUARD KICKS HIM.

                                     GUARD
                         Hey!

                                     VEASEY
                              (holding his head, to 
                              Rebecca)
                         God Bless you.

               Rebecca, reluctant, rejoins the other slaves, walks away 
               with them, but then turns back to look at Veasey. She clearly 
               cares about him. And seeing her has somehow broken his heart.

               He turns away from Inman, towards Sheffield.

                                     VEASEY
                         I'm with you. I got a baby coming.

               EXT. RAILROAD TRACK. DAY

               THE CHAIN GANG TRUDGES DOWN THE TRACK, horses on either side 
               of them, steep banks forming a V for the railroad. A TRAIN 
               IS COMING. Brown rides up to the prisoners, herds them off 
               the track. The train approaches quite slowly -- the boxcars 
               full of wounded soldiers. Some of the Home Guard dismount, 
               take out pipes. The prisoners wait, one of them sits down.

               Sheffield says something to Veasey, who casually yanks up 
               the sitting prisoner. Inman suddenly understands what's going 
               to happen. The train is almost on them.

                                     INMAN
                         No!

               But it's too late. SHEFFIELD JERKS FORWARD IN FRONT OF THE 
               TRAIN, PULLING ALL THE OTHERS WITH HIM, their reluctance 
               tempered by the possibility of being crushed by the oncoming 
               train.

               SOMEHOW THE CHAIN GANG GETS ACROSS THE TRACK, stumbling and 
               chaotic, the chains yanking tight, then loose, the tight 
               causing a collapse, the loose a recovery.

               They run alongside the train, blocking themselves from the 
               fire of the Guard, Sheffield screaming tactics -- and then, 
               as the train starts to pull past them, they run up the bank, 
               now all as a unit scrambling to the steep summit.

               ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRAIN THE HOME GUARD HAVE REMOUNTED 
               THEIR HORSES AND ARE RIDING HARD ALONGSIDE IT. Then they 
               have sight of the escaping prisoners silhouetted at the top 
               of the bank like a line of paper dolls stretched out along 
               the ridge. Sheffield's yelling with adrenaline, Veasey joins 
               in, elated. One of the guards raises a rifle, steadies himself 
               on his horse, FIRES. He catches Veasey, who crumples, spinning 
               round and falling down the bank, until Inman uses all his 
               strength and practically lifts him in the air. The chain 
               recovers and works back up the bank.

               But then A SECOND BULLET catches another prisoner and this 
               time the effect is catastrophic -- THE WHOLE GANG JUST FLIPS 
               OVER AND PLUMMETS DOWN THE BANK. The Home Guard approach, 
               firing randomly at the bodies as they tumble into the ditch 
               by the side of the track. Until all movement ceases. Inman 
               has a wound to his head which bleeds profusely, almost 
               completely covering his face. Brown arrives, considers the 
               carnage.

                                     BROWN
                         Get these sacks of shit under the 
                         ground.

               INT. BARN, BLACK COVE FARM. DAWN

               Ada's milking. It's barely daylight. She's slowly becoming a 
               country girl. Ruby appears in the doorway.

                                     RUBY
                         Someone's been in the corncrib.

                                     ADA
                         You sure?

                                     RUBY
                         It's a coon or possum. Scratched out 
                         a fist hole in the side. This place! 
                         I'm telling you -- we grow, others 
                         eat. I'll go into town, take the 
                         last of the cider and trade for a 
                         trap.

               INT. MONROE'S BEDROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ada is in Monroe's bedroom, looks out as Ruby goes off to 
               town, jugs of cider swung either side of the horse. Ada goes 
               over to Monroe's closet, pulls out some clothes.

               EXT. THE WINTER GARDEN, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ada buttons Monroe's dress coat and completes the SCARECROW 
               she's spent the day making, save for the hat, which she now 
               fixes on, pushing in a hat pin to secure it. She's made a 
               stern black thing and steps back to consider it.

               Horsemen come riding along the lane. It's Teague and his 
               men.

               He doesn't stop but raises his hat to Ada.

               INT. KITCHEN, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ada looks out at the Winter Garden. From that distance it 
               really does look like her father out in the field, arms 
               outstretched as if waiting for her to run to him. She finds 
               it unbearable, her tears coming, runs out into the fields, 
               attacks the scarecrow, pulling off the hat, the clothes...

               EXT. RAILROAD TRACK. MORNING

               THE SOUND OF TINY BELLS. A misty drizzle. A GOAT snuffles 
               around in the freshly turned dirt: A hand, pale and wet, 
               protrudes from the thin layer of earth covering the bodies 
               of the murdered Chain Gang.

               SOMETHING SHIFTS UNDER THE DIRT, breaking the surface. Inman 
               wedged under three or four corpses -- their limbs and chains 
               wrapped around him, has regained consciousness. He coughs, 
               can't breathe properly, tries to work himself some air, 
               spitting out dirt. He makes a noise to distract the goat, 
               rattling the chains. Inman rears up, the bodies slithering 
               off him, but even then the animal only retreats a yard or 
               two. VEASEY SLIDES FACE UP, A BULLET IN HIS FOREHEAD LIKE A 
               MYSTICAL THIRD EYE. Inman feels a surprising loss and 
               tenderness. He heaves again, groaning with the pain of new 
               and old wounds.

               EXT. OLD MILL, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

               Ruby rides back from town along the river. An ugly looking 
               trap tied over the horses and three or four bulging sacks. 
               By an abandoned mill she sees the Home Guard under the trees.

               She slows up.

                                     TEAGUE
                         What you looking to catch?

                                     RUBY
                         What?

                                     TEAGUE
                         With that trap.

                                     RUBY
                         We got some critter stealing our 
                         corn.

                                     TEAGUE
                         Still but the two of you up there, 
                         is it?

                                     RUBY
                         You know it.

                                     TEAGUE
                         When we get a cold night, camped 
                         out, trying to keep the rule of law, 
                         protecting girls like you from 
                         Federals and deserters, that's a 
                         thought warms us
                              (to his men)
                         ain't it? -- the two of you up there 
                         on my Grand-daddy's farm, dressed in 
                         men's clothes. Warms us right up. 
                         What you got in the sacks?
                              (to the men)
                         Looks like human heads! Eh? Looks 
                         like a bunch of heads. We got 
                         competition!

               Ruby rides on. She rides around the bend -- she's not far 
               from the Swanger farm.

               EXT. RAILROAD TRACK. DAY

               Goats, their bells tinkling, munch around the tracks. One of 
               them turns at a noise -- a GROTESQUE VISION -- A MOVING, 
               SEETHING MOUND OF DIRT. It's Inman, inching along the 
               embankment, the chain of dead bodies in tow, a macabre tug 
               of war. He considers the goats, they consider him. He rears 
               up and finds himself STARING DOWN THE BARREL OF A SHOTGUN.

               EXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY

               Sally is pinning out white sheets, they're filling out like 
               sails in the afternoon wind. Ruby rides up. Sally seems a 
               little vexed to see her. She walks down to the gate.

                                     SALLY
                         Ruby...

                                     RUBY
                         I'm not stopping, Sally. I'm not 
                         snooping neither. Just you should 
                         know Teague and his boys are lurking 
                         down by Pigeon River, the old mill.

                                     SALLY
                              (after a beat)
                         You tell Ada that was a good pie.

               Ruby rides off. Sally watches, then goes inside the house, 
               her energy changing immediately, as if she might faint.

               EXT. MADDY'S CARAVAN. AFTERNOON

               HARSH WHISTLES. A secret place, in the heart of a forest. 
               There's the answering sound of SMALL BELLS, a chorus of them. 
               Inman is dragged into view on a makeshift litter. Goats 
               appear, they herd around the figure dragging the litter. 
               IT'S AN OLD WOMAN, silver haired, her face a leather map, 
               her clothes leather, everything about her like old leather. 
               HER NAME IS MADDY.

               She and Inman round a bend and there's Maddy's house -- AN 
               OLD CARAVAN, long grown into the ground and plaited with 
               vines and creepers. Inman tries to sit up. An old whiskered 
               BILLYGOAT butts up against Inman, knocks him down. Maddy 
               pays no attention to the struggle, heads inside her caravan.

                                     MADDY
                         Mind that Billy, he's the jealous 
                         kind.

               She emerges, with a bowl of water, rags, washes his face, 
               pushing back his hair to look at his wound, puts a finger to 
               the gash on his neck professional in her appraisal. Inman is 
               barely conscious, he groans, trying to defend himself.

                                     MADDY
                         Pay no attention to me. What happened 
                         to your head?

                                     INMAN
                         Fighting.

                                     MADDY
                         And your neck?

                                     INMAN
                         Different fighting.

                                     MADDY
                         You're the color of a cadaver. I'll 
                         fix you. I can fix you up.

                                     INMAN
                              (speaking of his spirit)
                         Mister -- you could fix me I'd be in 
                         your everlasting debt.

                                     MADDY
                         Debts, fighting -- them words don't 
                         mean much round here. For the record, 
                         I'm a female of the species.

               EXT. BOTTOM FIELD, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ruby rides up to the farm. She rides past the winter garden, 
               admires THE SCARECROW -- WHICH NOW PARODIES ADA, the same 
               outfit she once wore to visit Inman, the same dress, same 
               hat. Ruby grins as Ada comes over from the field.

                                     RUBY
                         The hat's a nice touch.

               Ruby gets off the horse, and they start unloading sacks.

                                     RUBY
                         You're quiet.

                                     ADA
                         I cried for my Daddy. I dressed up 
                         the scarecrow in his suit and he 
                         came back, his arms out, said you 
                         never cried enough, you never cried 
                         enough.

                                     RUBY
                         Well now you did.

                                     ADA
                         Then I thought, it's not my Daddy, 
                         it's my sweetheart. I saw him once 
                         that way, when I looked down Sally's 
                         well. So I dressed the scarecrow in 
                         the dress I wore the day he left. In 
                         case his spirit flies over looking 
                         out for me.
                              (of the vicious looking 
                              trap)
                         That looks terrible.

               Ruby opens the sacks.

                                     ADA
                         Cabbages.

                                     RUBY
                         I bargained like Lucifer. We can 
                         make all kinds of good eating.

                                     ADA
                         Such as?

                                     RUBY
                         Cabbage. Slaw, sauerkraut, cabbage 
                         soup, fried cabbage, stuffed 
                         cabbage...

               EXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY

               TEAGUE'S MEN RIDE UP TO THE FARM. Esco's out in the field, 
               labouring away, but with his shotgun by him. Teague stops 
               alongside the field, the rail between him and Esco. Esco 
               stops working, picks up his shotgun and goes over. Teague 
               has four men with him. MO and JO, the twins, huge, and with 
               the appearance of having less than one brain between the two 
               of them, GRAYLING, a reluctant-looking man, funereal in his 
               bearing, and BOSIE.

                                     TEAGUE
                         Afternoon.

               The riders slowly fan out, almost as if choreographed.

                                     ESCO
                         Don't spread out. Why they spreading 
                         out?

                                     TEAGUE
                         I'm not spreading out. I'm sitting 
                         here.

               Esco comes over the rail fence, his gun loose in his hands.

                                     TEAGUE
                         Never knew a man worked in his field 
                         with a shotgun.

                                     ESCO
                         There's a war on.

                                     TEAGUE
                         Got to watch out for the Bogey Man.

               He starts to fish out a tobacco pouch. Esco's gun swings up.

               Teague shows him the leather pouch, shrugs, starts to make a 
               cigarette.

               INT. SWANGER FARM. DAY

               From inside the house, Sally watches everything. Her view 
               impaired by the sheets.

               EXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY

               Mo dismounts. Ambles past Esco, looks behind the sheets. 
               ESCO KICKS OUT AT HIM, the shotgun rigid and pointing.

                                     ESCO
                         Get off my land.

               Mo examines his breeches for a dust mark, wipes it off, 
               retreating in a turkey walk of examining and dusting.

                                     TEAGUE
                         Your boys come back.

                                     ESCO
                         Ain't seen my boys in four years. 
                         They're fighting other boys, not old 
                         men and women.

                                     TEAGUE
                              (to his men)
                         He means us. He's referring there to 
                         us.
                              (to Esco)
                         So you won't care if we take a look 
                         around?

                                     ESCO
                         What I gotta give you? A chicken? A 
                         lamb?

                                     TEAGUE
                              (shrugs)
                         Sure.

                                     ESCO
                         Right then.

                                     TEAGUE
                         Thing is -- you got one barrel and 
                         there's five of us. Not a fair fight.

               BOSIE SUDDENLY DROPS OFF HIS HORSE, ROLLS ON THE GROUND.

                                     BOSIE
                         Bogey Man! Bogey Man!

               Esco is momentarily distracted and, in that instant, Mo kicks 
               out at him, knocking the gun from his hands, which fires 
               into the air, a shocking sound.

               EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ruby and Ada digging a trench by the smokehouse, laying in 
               the pale heads of cabbage. They hear the distant shot.

                         What's that?

               They stop. Listen. Look at each other, start running.

               EXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY

               Jo sets on Esco, knocking him-backwards into a sheet, where 
               it gets twisted, while Jo kicks and punches, little spots of 
               blood staining the sheet with each blow. MO PULLS OUT HIS 
               SABRE AND RUNS ESCO THROUGH, LEAVES THE SABRE IN DEEP, PINNING 
               ESCO TO THE SHEET, THEN SPINNING HIM ROUND IN THE SHEET SO 
               THAT IT TIGHTENS. A stain grows out from the blade, huge and 
               spreading. Teague walks to Esco.

                                     TEAGUE
                         You're harbouring deserters. I can 
                         confiscate every animal on this farm, 
                         every plate, every sheet, every little 
                         pellet of chicken shit -- I can 
                         confiscate your old lady's asshole, 
                         so don't offer me a bird.

               Sally runs out, screaming. She tries to pull out the sabre.

               MO REVERSES HIS RIFLE AND CLUBS HER TO THE GROUND.

                                     TEAGUE
                              (sharply)
                         Hey!

               Mo backs away. Sally is screaming. She watches, helpless, as 
               Esco dies in front of her, the sheet growing a darker red.

                                     TEAGUE
                         You got your bait. Set it on the 
                         hook.

               BOSIE, SMILING, FETCHES A ROPE FROM HIS HORSE, ALREADY NOOSED 
               AT ONE END. HE FLIPS THE LOOP OVER SALLY'S HEAD.

               INT. BARN, SWANGER FARM. DAY

               ELLIS AND ACTON SWANGER emerge from their hiding places, 
               unable to bear the sound of their mother's screams. They're 
               carrying an axe, a pitchfork, mad for revenge.

               EXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY

               BOSIE IS DOING SOME SORT OF DANCE ALONG THE FENCE RAIL. He's 
               very graceful, his hair flying, his hands out, one finger 
               nail extremely long, his boots stamping down on the fence.

               UNDER HIS STOMPING FEET, THE RAIL POST IS PRESSED ON SALLY 
               SWANGER'S THUMBS. She can't scream any longer, because the 
               noose has practically strangled her. The rope's tied off to 
               Bosie's horse, which yanks on the noose with every slight 
               movement. Sally is prostrate in the dirt.

               Her two boys come running from the barn. TEAGUE CASUALLY, 
               SHOOTS ELLIS WITH HIS RIFLE. BOSIE LETS ACTON GET ALL THE 
               WAY TOWARDS HIM AND THEN SHOOTS HIM FROM A YARD AWAY, THE 
               GUN SUDDENLY SPRINGING INTO HIS HAND. AS ACTON FALLS, BOSIE 
               DOES A FLIP TO DIVE OFF THE POST AND LAND ON HIS FEET NEXT 
               TO ACTON'S BODY.

               EXT. SWANGER FARM. DUSK

               Ada and Ruby, riding together on the horse, arrive at the 
               Swangers.

               SALLY IS STILL PINNED UNDER THE FENCE POST. The noose around 
               her neck has been tied off to the post so that she can't 
               move. There's a bloody sheet draped over the edge of the 
               well. Blood on the ground. Ruby heaves at the fence.

                                     RUBY
                         I can't get this damn thing off her.

                                     ADA
                              (at the well, looking 
                              down)
                         Dear Lord in heaven.

                                     RUBY
                         Ada, I can't get this off her!

               Ada runs over. They struggle, can't lift it. Sally's lips 
               are moving.

                                     RUBY
                         What darling? What?

               She bends down, listens to her. Looks up at Ada.

                                     RUBY
                         She's saying don't bother.

                                     ADA
                         Wait!

               She grabs a thick log off the stack, staggers back and in a 
               second they've inserted it into the fence and levered it up 
               and away from Sally's hands. They fall back onto the dirt.

               Ruby cradles Sally. Ada nods towards the well.

                                     ADA
                         There's someone down there. I think 
                         it's Esco.

               Ruby looks over at the well, then at Ada.

                                     RUBY
                         This world won't stand long. God 
                         won't let it stand this way long.

               INT. MADDY'S CARAVAN. DAY

               An exotic interior, many crocks and jars, bunches of herbs, 
               wrapped papers of dried things, like a woodland apothecary 
               store. Inman wakes up. He finds himself in a small cot, 
               wrapped in blankets, a poultice at his neck. He doesn't know 
               where he is or how long he's been there.

               EXT. MADDY'S CARAVAN. DAY

               Maddy's sitting on a stool. There's a circle of stones where 
               her fire lives and she sets the tinder to it. Inman emerges 
               from the caravan. He's pale and unsteady.

                                     INMAN
                         How long have I been sleeping?

                                     MADDY
                         Not long enough.

                                     INMAN
                         I can't stop here. I'm a deserter. 
                         They find me here things could be 
                         bad for you.

                                     MADDY
                         What they going to do? Cut short my 
                         young life? Sit down before you fall 
                         down.

               She calls over a little goat. It ambles over affectionately 
               and nuzzles into her hand. She strokes it and scratches under 
               the chin. The creature gets increasingly tranquil.

                                     INMAN
                         How long you been up here?

                                     MADDY
                         What year are we? '63?

                                     INMAN
                         Last time I checked it was '64.

                                     MADDY
                         I'd say twenty six years.

                                     INMAN
                         Twenty six years!

                                     MADDY
                         I could move on anytime. I've seen 
                         most of the world anyway, Richmond 
                         in the North, south almost to 
                         Charleston. You're going somewhere 
                         or you are somewhere, what's the 
                         difference?

               She's still stroking the goat. It looks as if it's asleep.

                                     MADDY
                         I've learned a person can survive 
                         off pretty much of a goat. I can't 
                         abide a chicken, but a goat gives 
                         you company and milk and cheese and 
                         then, when you need it, good meat.

               In a single motion she has a knife in her hand and has SLIT 
               THE THROAT OF THE GOAT, putting the bowl underneath its neck 
               to catch the blood, still stroking the goat, which blinks as 
               if it were only surprised and not dying.

                                     MADDY
                         So you've been fighting?

                                     INMAN
                              (as if he might break)
                         I could be at killing for days 
                         sometimes, in the hand to hand, my 
                         feet against the feet of my enemy 
                         and I always killed him and he never 
                         killed me.

                                     MADDY
                         He gave it a try, to look at you.

                                     INMAN
                         I guess he did.

                                     MADDY
                         See I think there's a plan. There's 
                         a design. For each and every one of 
                         us.

               During this she's shucked the skin off the goat with the 
               authority of someone who's done this a thousand times.

                                     MADDY
                         You look at nature, a bird flies 
                         somewhere, picks up a seed, shits 
                         the seed out, a plant grows. Bird's 
                         got a job, seed's got a job.

               And the goat is now thin and pink, eyes bulging, a piece of 
               meat.

               INT. MADDY'S CARAVAN. EVENING

               A woodburning stove with a single cooking plate -- on which 
               pieces of the goat meat, sprinkled with herbs, are sizzling 
               in a pan.

               INMAN IS EATING LIKE A MAN POSSESSED, WRAPPING THE MEAT IN 
               CORN FRITTERS AND PUSHING THEM INTO HIS MOUTH. Maddy watches 
               him, adds another mound of meat to his plate. Inman nods in 
               thanks, but -- doesn't look up.

               She opens a jar and takes out a handful of dried poppy heads, 
               puts them near the stove, then dips into another jar and 
               pulls out what look like old cheroot stubs.

                                     MADDY
                         Take one of these now with your food.

               Inman is circumspect, views the stub lozenge with suspicion.

                                     MADDY
                         Swallow it. If you die I'll give you 
                         your money back.

               Inman puts it in his mouth, gags at the taste of it. She 
               hands him a beaker with milk to wash it down.

                                     MADDY
                         Our minds aren't made to hold on to 
                         the particulars of pain, the way we 
                         do bliss.

               She starts steaming the poppies.

                                     INMAN
                         It's true...

                                     MADDY
                         What is?

                                     INMAN
                         What you remember.

                                     MADDY
                         What's her name?

                                     INMAN
                         Ada.
                              (At the food)
                         -- Sometimes I think I'm crazy when 
                         I'm just hungry --
                              (another mouthful)
                         Ada Monroe.

                                     MADDY
                         And is she waiting for you?

                                     INMAN
                         She was. I don't know. Or if she'd 
                         know me. I'm like the boy who goes 
                         out in winter for firewood comes 
                         back in the spring with a whistle.

               Maddy pricks open the poppies and collects their opium, then 
               hands Inman the liquid.

                                     MADDY
                         Now drink this. It visits the pain. 
                         And you'll sleep.

               He drinks the laudanum she's made.

                                     INMAN
                         I've had to put myself in the way of 
                         people's kindness.

                                     MADDY
                         I hope you found it.

               She dips a cloth in the steaming water, unbuttons his shirt. 
               She has a crock of what looks like treacle and vaseline. She 
               smears this salve over the neck wound and into his scalp. 
               Inman surrenders to the drug.

                                     INMAN
                         The passenger pigeons fly south, the 
                         berries ripen. Whether I see them or 
                         not, whether a man dies, or a war is 
                         won.

                                     MADDY
                         That's the laudanum getting to you. 
                         That's good. Say something more.
                              (she kneels to his 
                              leg)
                         Raise that up for me.

               He obliges. She grimaces at the state of it, where the chain 
               has chewed into the flesh. Gets to work.

                                     INMAN
                         She gave me a book. Ada Monroe. Man 
                         by the name of Bartram. Wrote about 
                         his travels. I carried that book 
                         through every battle. I left it 
                         someplace, got to get it back. 
                         Sometimes just reading the name of a 
                         place near home -- Sorell Cove, Fire 
                         Scale Ridge -- was enough to bring 
                         me to tears. Thing is I've been 
                         thinking -- those places belonged to 
                         people before us, to the Indian -- 
                         and he had a different name. What 
                         did he call Sorell Cove? How can a 
                         name not even the real name break 
                         your heart? It's her, she's the place 
                         I'm heading. And I hardly know her. 
                         So how can a person who's maybe not 
                         even a real person -- I don't know 
                         what I'm talking about -- I have to 
                         close my eyes...

               He slides off the stool and lays on the floor. Maddy goes 
               over to her cot and pulls off a blanket which she drapes 
               over him.

               EXT. YARD, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ada in the henhouse, collecting eggs, is confident now among 
               the birds. She emerges to find Ruby walking out of the 
               backdoor with the shotgun and a determined look.

                                     RUBY
                         It's a man.

                                     ADA
                         What is?

                                     RUBY
                         Raiding our corn. Got him in the 
                         trap. That's him yelping.

                                     ADA
                         You're not going to shoot him!

                                     RUBY
                         I don't want him to shoot me.
                              (of the gun)
                         Can you fire this thing?

                                     ADA
                              (making it clear she 
                              can't)
                         Yes.

               They head towards the corn crib, bundled up against the cold.

               A MAN IS KNEELING AT THE CORN CRIB, perfectly caught in the 
               art of stealing, his head forced away from view. Ruby hands 
               Ada the gun and approaches, warily.

                                     RUBY
                         Listen up -- you got a barrel trained 
                         on your rear-end.

                                     STOBROD
                         Get me out of this dang thing. My 
                         fist's about to drop off.

                                     RUBY
                         You got a weapon?

                                     STOBROD
                         No ma'am. I'm begging you. I'm already 
                         on my knees, otherwise I'd get down 
                         on them.

                                     RUBY
                              (suddenly recognises 
                              the voice)
                         Unbelievable! Stobrod Thewes.

                                     STOBROD
                         Ruby? God damn!

                                     ADA
                         What?

                                     RUBY
                              (to Ada, disgusted)
                         That's my daddy...

               She walks up to him and KICKS HIM HARD AS SHE CAN ON HIS 
               BACKSIDE.

               INT. KITCHEN, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               A strip of fabric, homemade bandage, being wrapped around 
               Stobrod's badly gashed hand. Ada is tending to him. Ruby is 
               cooking at the range, not remotely warm towards her prodigal 
               father, who looks rather comfortable. Stobrod looks at her.

                                     STOBROD
                         Just so's you know -- I can eat while 
                         she's doing this -- in case you're 
                         holding off.

                                     RUBY
                         Just so's you know -- you're not 
                         eating inside. Number One -- they 
                         hang people round here for taking in 
                         deserters. Number two -- even if 
                         they gave out prizes -- you'd still 
                         eat outside.

                                     STOBROD
                         You're scarred.

                                     RUBY
                         I'm what?

                                     STOBROD
                         Your heart. Scarred. I did wrong to 
                         you.

                                     RUBY
                         You'd be scarred. You'd be really 
                         scarred if I hadn't wrapped them 
                         trap teeth in sacking. Which was her 
                         idea.

                                     STOBROD
                         I hurt you.

                                     RUBY
                         Good God!

                                     STOBROD
                         I wrote fifty tunes with you in mind. 
                         Ruby this, Ruby that, Ruby with the 
                         eyes that sparkle.

                                     RUBY
                         Hey! Let's agree: you beat me, you 
                         abandoned me, you ignored me, you 
                         beat me some more -- all of that is 
                         better than Ruby with the eyes that 
                         sparkle!

                                     STOBROD
                         I'm changed. People change. War 
                         changes people something terrible.
                              (to Ada)
                         Ruby's told you -- I've no doubt -- 
                         I wasn't always the best...

                                     RUBY
                         You were an asshole.

                                     STOBROD
                         I can't disagree with that. I was.

                                     RUBY
                         Get him out of here!

                                     STOBROD
                         Music's changed me. I'm full of music, 
                         darling. I wish I'd brung my fiddle 
                         Hey Ruby! Got a new fiddle -- it's 
                         got a little snake's rattle in the 
                         body -- took it off a dead federal 
                         in Virginia. That's a beautiful 
                         fiddle. It's full of tunes, Ruby. 
                         Don't know if it's from that little 
                         rattle locked up in it, or from 
                         something untied my heart.

               Ruby walks over with a crock, wrapped in a cloth.

                                     RUBY
                         You're all set.

                                     STOBROD
                              (sincerely)
                         Bless you both.

               He goes to the door.

                                     RUBY
                         Ain't you got a proper coat?

                                     STOBROD
                         Darling, I'm fine. And you just say 
                         the word, I won't come back neither. 
                         I don't want to put either you or 
                         your mistress here in any bother.

                                     ADA
                         I'm not Ruby's employer.

                                     STOBROD
                         Oh, okay, who is?

                                     RUBY
                         Nobody.
                              (Stobrod digests this)
                         I'll make up food for you, you come 
                         Sundays before it's light, I'll leave 
                         it behind the Old Frazier Mill.

                                     STOBROD
                         Do you know who really needs a coat, 
                         darling, is my partner, fat boy name 
                         of Pangle. We're hiding up in the 
                         caves and he feels the cold like a 
                         thin man, but ain't no coat'll fit 
                         him.
                              (leaving)
                         I love you, Ruby. In case the sky 
                         falls on our head. You're a good 
                         girl.

               And he's gone. Ruby scowls. FIDDLE MUSIC BEGINS.

                                     RUBY
                         He is so full of manure, that man, 
                         we could lay him on the dirt and 
                         grow another one just like him.

                                     ADA
                         So that's Stobrod Thewes.

                                     RUBY
                         It is and that's the last you'll see 
                         of him.

               EXT. MADDY'S CARAVAN. DUSK

               THE FIDDLE CONTINUES, A BANJO JOINS IN.

               Maddy is loading up Inman for his journey. She hands him a 
               bulging goatskin satchel.

                                     MADDY
                         That's medicine and goatmeat. You're 
                         sick of both.

                                     INMAN
                         I have a deal to thank you for.

               She hands him an ancient flintlock pistol.

                                     MADDY
                         And that's just for show, or -- if 
                         you can get close enough -- a wild 
                         turkey.

               She turns, abruptly, mingles in with her goats. Inman nods, 
               knows that she doesn't want a fuss, although he wants to 
               make one, and turns himself, heads away from the caravan.

               EXT. WOODS. DAY

               THE MUSIC CONTINUES. A TURKEY calls. And again.

               JUNIOR is hunting. He creeps through this clearing, eyes 
               peeled for the turkey, gun at the ready. His dog growls, and 
               he puts a hand over its mouth. He listens. Another call.

               Junior moves, without sound, in its direction, stops for 
               several seconds under a tree, listening. He looks up. INMAN 
               IS PERCHED IN THE TREE. THE PISTOL FLASHES IN HIS HAND.

               EXT. JUNIOR'S CABIN. DAY

               THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Inman drags Junior's corpse in to the 
               yard. The dogs whine and slobber over the body. Inman goes 
               straight into the Smoke House.

               INT. SMOKE HOUSE AT JUNIOR'S CABIN. DAY

               THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Inman reaches behind the stove and 
               retrieves his bag. He checks for the LeMats, for the Bartram, 
               opens it, locating the tintype of Ada, which he considers, 
               as the dogs howl outside, joined with another wailing.

               EXT. JUNIOR'S CABIN. DAY

               THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Inman emerges with his bag, LeMats at 
               the ready. The women are all keening over the corpse, as it 
               a saint had passed away. Dogs, women all howling. A chicken 
               bobs in, investigates the glob of blood on Junior's skull.

               Inman walks away, doesn't look at the women, who don't look 
               at him.

               INT. RUBY'S ROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. DAWN

               THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Ruby wakes up. Looks out of the window.

               Ada, also woken, comes into Ruby's room. STOBROD IS OUTSIDE 
               WITH PANGLE, VIOLIN AND BANJO. Ruby opens the window, 
               scowling. Stobrod beams, stops playing, holds up the food, 
               points at Pangle in his new coat. Pangle waves.

                                     RUBY
                         Get on back where you came from!

               Stobrod and Pangle smile and hurry away.

               EXT. PATH IN HILL COUNTRY. DAY

               WINTER SETTING IN. Inman, increasingly a stick figure in the 
               landscape, wasted and fragile, trudges along through fallen 
               leaves. He still limps from the leg irons. No shelter 
               anywhere. He unwraps a paper containing some scraps of goat 
               meat and corn bread. He walks and eats, fishes out a lozenge, 
               tries to swallow it, washes it down with a drink from his 
               flask. Opens the crock of salve and rubs the treacly grease 
               into his neck and ankle. The path splits. He doesn't know 
               which way to go, A CROW repeatedly caws off to the left and, 
               taking it as a sign, Inman goes in that direction.

               INT. ADA'S BEDROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT

               Ada in the bed, reading to Ruby from Wuthering Heights.

                                     ADA
                         -- a source of little visible delight, 
                         But necessary.

                                     RUBY
                         She ain't gonna marry Linton, is 
                         she? She said -- whatever our souls 
                         are made of his and mine are the 
                         same. You can't say that and then 
                         marry Linton.

                                     ADA
                         We'll find out.

                                     RUBY
                         Okay.

                                     ADA
                         Tomorrow.

                                     RUBY
                         I'm not waiting until tomorrow.

                                     ADA
                         Ruby, I'm falling asleep.

               She lies back in her bed. Ruby takes the book, lies across 
               the bottom of the bed, as Ada goes to sleep.

                                     RUBY
                         Little visible delight, but necessary. 
                         I like that...

               EXT. SMALL WOOD. NIGHT

               DRIVING RAIN. Inman shelters under a huge tree, whose split 
               trunk provides a mean shelter. He inserts himself into the 
               cleft of it, a black thing in a black tree, like a troll. He 
               stands, shivers, sodden, desolate.

               EXT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT

               A LITTLE CABIN. Its lights coming through square windows 
               like a chinese lantern. Inman considers it, the risk versus 
               the shelter.

               The sleet still pelts down on him and he decides to approach.

               Closer he can hear a sound coming from the house. IT'S A 
               BABY'S INCESSANT CRY. HE SEES A YOUNG WOMAN WALKING ROUND 
               AND ROUND IN THE ROOM, CLUTCHING THE BABY WRAPPED UP IN A 
               QUILT.

               Inman knocks hard on the door. The light from the lamp goes 
               out, although the fire still gives the room a clear glow.

                                     INMAN
                         I'm one man alone. I'm a Confederate 
                         soldier on furlough. I have no bad 
                         intention. I need shelter and food.

               THE TINY SOUND OF THE DOOR BEING BOLTED.

                                     INMAN
                         Can I at least sleep in the corn 
                         crib -- just for some shelter? I'll 
                         be on my way come morning.

               No answer. Inman accepts this as a rebuttal, and trudges 
               back towards the road.

                                     SARA (V.O.)
                         I've got a rifle.

               Inman turns. A gap in the door appears, the figure barely 
               seen.

                                     INMAN
                         Fair enough.

               The baby's crying behind her.

                                     SARA
                         There's some beans and corn pone, 
                         all I got. You better come in.

               INT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT

               Inman enters the cabin. It's a single room. A big fire. The 
               baby on the bed, a rudimentary crib unoccupied next to it. 
               The woman is already at the little stove. She turns to him. 
               She's painfully beautiful. But sad and fragile. Inman, despite 
               himself, is mesmerized.

                                     INMAN
                         Thank you.

                                     SARA
                         I'm alone here, as you can see, with 
                         my baby. I need to believe you mean 
                         no harm.

               Inman takes out his gun. She starts, terrified.

                                     INMAN
                         No, I mean to give it to you.

               He turns it handle forwards and offers it to her.

                                     SARA
                         I don't want it. I had my way they'd 
                         take metal altogether out of this 
                         world. Every blade, every gun.

                                     INMAN
                         Is your baby sick?

                                     SARA
                         He cries. I don't know. He cries a 
                         lot. My man is dead. He took his 
                         wound at Fredericksburg. Never saw 
                         his boy.

               She never once looks at him. Her eyes on the floor or the 
               food or the baby.

                                     INMAN
                         I'm sorry.

                                     SARA
                         It's pretty much what you'll get if 
                         you knock on any door of this war. 
                         Man dead, woman left.

               She hands him a plate of steaming beans. An onion perched on 
               top.

                                     SARA
                         It's mean food but it's hot.

               She goes over to the bed and picks up her baby and starts 
               the same business of walking him, singing the while, an odd 
               lament. Inman eats, looks at her, at the child and the fire.

               He picks up the onion, bites into it. Sara looks across.

                                     INMAN
                              (ashamed of his hunger)
                         There's no hunting on the road, just 
                         cress and --

               He takes another bite. Sara picks up the baby.

                                     SARA
                         I need to feed this man, if you could 
                         look away.

               Inman, embarrassed, turns his back to her. He sits finishing 
               the food while she puts the baby to her breast, slipping the 
               shoulder from her dress. While the baby feeds.

                                     SARA
                         Used to have a cow, few goats. Raiders 
                         took them. Made me kill our own dog 
                         on the porch. That poor creature 
                         watched over me. Nothing left now 
                         save a hog and couple of chickens to 
                         live off till spring. I'll have to 
                         kill that hog and make sense of the 
                         flesh and divisions which is something 
                         I never did.

                                     INMAN
                         I could do that for you in the 
                         morning.

                                     SARA
                         I'm not asking.

                                     INMAN
                         It's what I'd gladly do for you for 
                         what you're gladly doing for me. I'm 
                         Inman by the way. That's my name.

                                     SARA
                         I'm Sara. My baby's Ethan.

                                     INMAN
                         Glad to know you both.

               EXT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT

               Sara walks ahead of Inman. She carries a pile of clothing, a 
               pair of boots. It's still wretched outside, she hugs the 
               house, the porch barely offering shelter. INMAN FOLLOWS, 
               with a bowl of steaming water and a small towel over his 
               arm. She hands him the clothes.

                                     SARA
                         You look about his size. He was 
                         another man straight up and down.

               There's a palpable attraction between them, so that every 
               exchange seems to contain a promise, a sexual charge.

                                     SARA
                         I don't even have a blanket.

                                     INMAN
                         I got a blanket.

                                     SARA
                         I'll leave you the lamp.

               By the dim light, Inman peels off his clothes, sets to work 
               with the bar of soap and the cloth to scrub himself clean. 
               He can be seen from the window and finds himself turning 
               away to pull off his pants.

               INT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT

               Sara sits at the cot, still singing to the baby, then gets 
               up, goes to the window, sees Inman dressing, walks to the 
               door, lets it open a little, but not so as she can be seen.

                                     SARA
                         They fit?

                                     INMAN (O.S.)
                         Pretty much. These boots are good 
                         boots.

                                     SARA
                         I'll say good night.

                                     INMAN (O.S.)
                         Good night.

               EXT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT

               Inman settles down into the corncrib. He's cold and everything 
               is damp and lumpy and uncomfortable. He pulls his thin blanket 
               around him. The wind is howling. He levers himself up, looks 
               at the house with its warm invitation, can almost feel Sara 
               in there. He reluctantly settles down again.

               HE HEARS A NOISE, STEPS APPROACHING. HE REACHES FOR THE LEMATS 
               UNDER THE BLANKETS.

                                     SARA
                         Will you come inside?

               She stands in a shift, a blanket over her shoulders. Her 
               body under the cotton very clear to him. She turns and goes 
               back inside.

               INT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT

               Inman comes in. Sara is sitting on her bed. Long silence.

                                     SARA
                         Could you do something for me? Do 
                         you think you could lie here, next 
                         to me, and not need to go further?

                                     INMAN
                         I don't know. I'll try.

               He sits on the bed as she slips under the covers, and then 
               removes the boots, his shirt, gets under the covers. There's 
               an electric space between them. Then Sara begins to cry, 
               pulls his arm to open up so that she can be folded into him.

               SHE SOBS, SHUDDERING IN THE BED.

                                     INMAN
                         I'll go. I'll go, shall I?

                                     SARA
                         I don't want you to.

               They lie, staring up at the ceiling, her tears falling. A 
               FIDDLE PLAYS HEAVY WITH YEARNING...

               INT. OLD MILL, COLD MOUNTAIN. CHRISTMAS DAY. NIGHT

               THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Stobrod is playing the fiddle, his bowing 
               hand still lightly taped and a fingerless mitten covering 
               it. They're in the abandoned Mill, a derelict space, which 
               has been cheered up with some rudimentary Christmas 
               decorations. Ada, Ruby and Sally Swanger, her hair now almost 
               completely white. Some token presents. Pangle is picking at 
               a banjo, his grin infectious, and a third player, GEORGIA, 
               with a harmonica. As they play:

                                     PANGLE
                              (of Sally)
                         She don't speak.

                                     STOBROD
                         She can't speak. I told you.

                                     PANGLE
                              (smiles at Sally)
                         Is she feeble then?

                                     STOBROD
                         No.
                              (to Sally)
                         Don't mind him.
                              (to Ruby)
                         Hey Ruby: what about this?

               He starts the tune of Wayfaring Stranger. Ruby groans.

                                     STOBROD
                         Don't make that face -- you listen: 
                         c'mon Georgia...

               And he starts up again, but this time GEORGIA BEGINS TO SING.

               He's like a pale angel and sings with a soft, true voice.

               Ruby finds herself taken by this boy's voice and by Stobrod's 
               extraordinary invention as he takes the tune off on a wild 
               journey. Ruby sits next to Ada, fiddles with her bracelets, 
               slips one from Ada's wrist and slides it over her own.

               EXT. OLD MILL, COLD MOUNTAIN. EVENING

               They're all outside now, shaking hands.

                                     GEORGIA
                         There's snow in the air.

               INT. SARA'S CABIN. EARLY

               Sara, dressed, agitated -- the baby already complaining -- 
               is urgently shaking Inman. Hissing at him:

                                     SARA
                         Get out of here, quick!

               Inman surfaces from deep sleep.

                                     SARA
                         Federals are coming. They find you 
                         here it'll go bad on all of us.

               Inman is up, grabbing clothes, boots, his gun.

                                     INMAN
                         I can try and fight them.

                                     SARA
                         No, my baby. Please no! Just get.

               She pulls up the window in back of the cabin. Inman throws 
               things out into the freezing morning. He has his pants on, 
               but is otherwise naked. He swings over the window and down 
               onto the frosty ground.

               EXT. SARA'S CABIN. EARLY

               Inman picks up his stuff and, at a crouch, runs for cover to 
               the wood which borders the property. He can hear horses and 
               a commotion at the front of Sara's cabin, but doesn't look 
               round until he's sheltered by the trees.

               FEDERAL SOLDIERS, a raiding party, have dismounted and are 
               already wrangling with Sara. Inman watches, pulling on his 
               shirt, shivering, then his boots.

               Sara is standing in front of the hogpen, as if to protect 
               the animal, but one of the soldiers, PISTOL, barges her to 
               one side, toppling her, and opens the gate, starts herding 
               the hog out into the yard. A second soldier, NYM, emerges 
               from the cabin, carrying Ethan. Sara starts up, struggles 
               with him, is again knocked down.

               INMAN HAS TO WATCH AS THEY DRAG HER OVER TO A FENCE POST AND 
               ROPE HER TO IT THEN SLIP THE BLANKET OFF THE BABY AND LAY IT 
               ON THE GROUND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE YARD.

               Then Sara starts to scream.

               Inman is dressed. Boots on. He looks back at the yard. The 
               men sitting, smoking, prepared to wait, their breath coming 
               out in gusts in the freezing air. Flakes of snow fall.

                                     PISTOL
                         We got all day.

                                     SARA
                         My baby's sick! Cover him up! He's 
                         shaking! Have some pity.

               A third Federal, BARDOLPH, chases after the chickens, gathers 
               them up.

                                     SARA
                         I got nothing. I swear.

               Nym gets close to her, putting his rifle to her chest.

                                     NYM
                         That ain't necessarily so.

                                     SARA
                         Yes! Take me inside! Let's all go 
                         inside! Take my baby inside and then 
                         we'll do whatever you want.

               Nym unties her. Pistol has a rope around the hog and now 
               leads it towards the horses.

                                     SARA
                              (screaming)
                         There's nothing! You take that hog 
                         I'm as good as dead. Cover up my 
                         boy!

               She's wailing, an unbearable ululation. NYM SLAPS HER, TWICE, 
               HARD.

               INT. SARA'S CABIN. DAY

               The door is kicked open. Nym pushes Sara inside, kicks the 
               door shut, REVEALING INMAN STANDING BEHIND IT.

               EXT. SARA'S CABIN. DAY

               Bardolph, a chicken in his arms, goes over to the baby.

                                     BARDOLPH
                         This is ready to get a fit going. 
                         It's shuddering. It's gone blue.

                                     PISTOL
                              (to Nym)
                         How long does he want? Hey! Leave 
                         some for the rest of us.

               Pistol heads towards the cabin. As he approaches the door, 
               Bardolph rearranges the blankets to, cover the baby. Pistol 
               opens the door. Nym is on top of Sara. Pistol laughs, enters, 
               and is clubbed down by Inman, who steps out onto the porch, 
               while SARA SHRUGS OFF THE BODY OF NYM, HIS THROAT CUT.

               Bardolph looks up to see Inman walking towards him. Bardolph 
               has left his weapon by the fence.

                                     INMAN
                         Move away from the baby.

               Bardolph obeys, terrified. Sara runs out, collects Ethan, 
               gives a little moan of anguish, runs back inside the cabin.

                                     BARDOLPH
                         Don't shoot.

                                     INMAN
                         Take off your boots.
                              (Bardolph does so)
                         Take off your pants, and your shirt.

                                     BARDOLPH
                         Don't shoot me, please. We're 
                         starving. We haven't eaten.

                                     INMAN
                         You'd better get running before you 
                         catch your death of cold.

                                     BARDOLPH
                              (nods, terrified)
                         Thanks, thank you. I will.

               AND THEN A SHOT RINGS OUT AND HE CRASHES TO THE GROUND, DEAD.

               Behind Inman, Sara stands with a rifle.

               EXT. SARA'S CABIN. LATE DAY

               THERE'S A HUGE FIRE GOING, WITH A CAULDRON HUNG OVER IT. THE 
               HOG HANGS UPSIDE DOWN FROM A TREE, BLOOD DRIPPING INTO A 
               BOWL.

               There's a sense of ritual and order: the chapters of 
               transforming the hog into food.

               Sara is inside the cabin, the door open onto the yard. She 
               holds the baby by the fireplace, swaddled up tight.

               She tries to put him to her breast, but he won't feed. She 
               puts Ethan back in his crib, comes outside.

               Now Inman is butchering the hog, chopping down either side 
               of the spine to make two sides of meat. Now Sara is holding 
               up a sheet of hog fat, as if it were a lace shawl. Now she's 
               rendering the fat into lard. Now Inman's salting the two 
               hams. Now Sara's washing the intestine. She sings all the 
               while -- I dreamed that my bower was full of red swine and 
               my bride bed full of blood -- they don't really converse. 
               Inman continues to work.

               Sara goes back inside to Ethan's crib. Inman glances back, 
               but can hardly bear to, her anxiety so palpable. THE BABY IS 
               DEAD. She looks at it. She takes it up in her arms. Kisses 
               its forehead.

               Makes a strange stifling noise. Inman doesn't look at her.

               She comes out again, shovels some of the food into a plate, 
               serves it up to Inman, gently touching him as she does so. 
               Then serves out food for herself. Inman starts to eat.

                                     SARA
                         Good?

               Inman nods. She collects up the knapsacks, including Inman's, 
               and goes back inside the house with them. Inman squats, 
               eating, glancing back towards the cabin. There's the sudden 
               shocking report of a revolver.

               Inman, knowing what it is, goes slowly towards the house and 
               its two dead bodies. His own face is a rictus, the eyes thin 
               slits. If he gave into his grief it would never cease.

               INT. SARA'S CABIN. DUSK

               From the house, the silhouette of Inman working outside in 
               the day's dying light, snow falling around him. He's digging 
               a grave.

               Inside the house, TWO BUNDLES, the small body wrapped in a 
               blanket, the other wrapped in the bed's patchwork quilt.

               EXT. CABBAGE PATCH, BLACK COVE FARM. DUSK

               Still snowing. Ruby trudges past Ada who is digging out a 
               couple of heads of the buried cabbages.

                         Bad news is girls get working. I'm 
                         going to round up the animals.

                              snow)
                         This'll settle.

               She walks past. Ada stares into the distance where

               EXT. WILD COUNTRY. LAST LIGHT

               -- the snow falls down on Inman. He's hardly visible in its 
               gusting waves. Just a thin black question mark, hunched over 
               the elements, moving slowly forwards...

               EXT. OLD MILL, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

               THE SNOW HAS STOPPED. It's left a carpet on the ground.

               Stobrod, Pangle and Georgia emerge from the Old Mill. THEY 
               MAKE HEAVY FOOTPRINTS as they set off up the hill towards 
               the mountain.

               EXT. PATH IN THE MOUNTAINS. DAY

               Inman comes sliding down a crumbling slate hill and onto the 
               path. He cornea to a place where the path suddenly drops 
               away to reveal a view of the geography. And there, finally, 
               in the distance, Inman can see the blue ridge. Somewhere in 
               there is home, is Ada. He goes on.

               EXT. SLOPES OF COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

               Pangle walks too close to Stobrod and steps on the back of 
               his boot which promptly detaches itself from Stobrod's foot.

               Stobrod turns -- and with a raised finger -- pushes Pangle.

               PANGLE FALLS IN THE SNOW, ARMS SPREADEAGLED, AND SMILES.

               EXT. PIGEON RIVER BEHIND THE OLD MILL. DAY

               SOME HORSES CLUSTER around the Stobrod party's footprints.

               Bosie swings acrobatically over his horse, to hang over the 
               tracks, then up again into his saddle, looks at Teague. The 
               Home Guard plod slowly forward in the direction of the tracks.

               EXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. EVENING

               A CLEARING, fringed by poplars. Stobrod is making a fire.

               Pangle appears with an armful of firewood, his big grin a 
               fixture. Then Georgia appears. He's carrying A SMALL BUCK, 
               frozen and covered with snow.

                         What d'you reckon? Think we could 
                         eat this?

                                     STOBROD
                         You cook something long enough you 
                         can eat anything.

                              (prodding it)
                         It's frozen. How long it been there 
                         for?

                                     STOBROD
                         You hungry?

                                     PANGLE
                         Yeah.

                         Not very long.

               Teague examines the snow's imprinted silhouette of Pangle.

               EXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT

               STOBROD SINGS AND COOKS. PANGLE ACCOMPANIES HIM ON BANJO, 
               Georgia joins in the chorus. Stobrod pulls one of the hickory 
               stick skewers out of the fire, blows on the, meat, smells, 
               smells again, looks at Georgia, takes a bite. Chews.

                         Edible.

               Pangle takes another stick, burns his fingers.

                                     PANGLE
                         Ow!

                         It's good. I think it's good.

               EXT. THE KILLING GROUND. COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT

               The three men are asleep. The fire still burning. They're 
               lying like petals of a flower around it. Suddenly Georgia 
               sits bolt upright, grimaces, gets up stumbles away from the 
               fire, toward a stand of trees, from which come the vivid 
               sounds of violent nausea.

               EXT. TREES NEAR THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT

               GEORGIA IS KNEELING IN THE SNOW, his head in the snow, when

               Stobrod and Pangle. Georgia has to vomit again.

               Teague rides up to the fire, the other riders with him -- 
               Mo, Jo, Bosie, Grayling. Stobrod wakes, sits up, Pangle

                         up there, never occurred to me they 
                         were deserters. Near Bearpen Branch.

                                     PANGLE
                         Ain't nowhere near Bearpen Branch! 
                         It's this side! He's always getting 
                         lost. That cave -- we live there! -- 
                         it's over on Big Stomp. Tell you how 
                         I always find it. There's a big old 
                         locust tree fell down across the 
                         path, that points straight at it, 
                         like a finger, always a dozen 
                         squirrels round that tree. You gets 
                         to the tree, sit on it, and there's 
                         your entrance, straight in front of 
                         you, tree points at it. Come right 
                         to your hand, them squirrels --
                              (makes a chirping 
                              sound)
                         -- Chrrrpppp! Chrrrrppp!

                                     TEAGUE
                         Sounds good. Okay, let's eat, let's 
                         hear some music.

               EXT. TREES NEAR KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT

               Georgia watches as the music starts, Stobrod playing and 
               singing, Pangle joining in at the chorus. Their improvising 
               is wild, profound, Stobrod chording the fiddle, Pangle 
               following him, then, finishing with another verse and ending 
               with the title declaimed by Stobrod.

                                     STOBROD
                         I call this tune: Ruby's Lament.

               EXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT

               Something like compassion has flickered over Teague's face. 
               Mo and Jo nod to the music's secret rhythms. Only Bosie seems 
               detached, contemplating his long fingernail. The music 
               finishes. The Home Guard applaud.

                                     PANGLE
                         What'd you make of that?

                                     BOSIE
                         Heartbreaking.

                                     TEAGUE
                         Stand over by that tree.

                                     STOBROD
                         Me?

                                     TEAGUE
                         Over by that tree. Over there. Take 
                         your boyfriend.

               Stobrod gets up, carrying his fiddle, heads over to a big 
               old poplar. Nods at Pangle.

                                     STOBROD
                         Come on.

               Pangle gets up, banjo in his hand. Puts his arm around Stobrod 
               as if they were about to be photographed. The Home Guard 
               gather around them. From the trees Georgia watches, helpless. 
               Pangle grins at Teague.

                                     TEAGUE
                         Don't smile.

                                     PANGLE
                         What?

                                     TEAGUE
                         Quit smiling.

                                     STOBROD
                         He always smiles. He don't mean 
                         nothing by it. I told him this world's 
                         got nothing worth a smile.

                                     TEAGUE
                         Put your hat over your face.

                                     PANGLE
                         What do you mean?

                                     TEAGUE
                         Cover your face with your hat.

               PANGLE TALES OFF HIS HAT, HOLDS IT OVER HIS FACE. THE MOMENT 
               HE OBLIGIES, TEAGUE'S CARBINE SPRINGS UP IN HIS HAND AND 
               BLOWS THE HAT AWAY SEVERAL OTHER SHOTS FOLLOW. STOBROD FALLS 
               UNDER PANGLE, THE BULLETS FLYING.

               EXT. TREES NEAR THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT

               Georgia lies prostrate in the snow, shuddering under the 
               report of each bullet.

               EXT. BOTTOM FIELD, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ruby working in the snow, in the field, clipping a sheep's 
               feet, the animal on its back between Ruby's knees. She looks 
               up to see GEORGIA RUNNING ACROSS THE FIELD TOWARDS HER, 
               calling out her name. From the kitchen window, Ada looks on 
               as he reaches Ruby, the story pouring from him. Ada emerges 
               from the house, walks towards the bad news.

               INT. STOREROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ruby sorting out a kit of shovels, blankets. Ada comes in 
               doesn't know how to help her friend, who shows no emotion.

                                     ADA
                         I told Georgia he can stop here, 
                         sleep in the barn. He's got nothing 
                         inside him. He'd walk out of here 
                         and die in the snow.

                                     RUBY
                         He can milk the cows. I was worrying 
                         about that. It'll be dark in a couple 
                         of hours. I's ten hours climb from 
                         here. He's drawn a map.

                                     ADA
                         Okay.

                                     RUBY
                              (boiling)
                         You know these fools stayed the night 
                         in the Mill? That's Stobrod -- he 
                         can't do one good thing without adding 
                         the bad. Left tracks in the snow all 
                         the way up for them Home Guards to 
                         follow. That's a sign says shoot me!

                                     ADA
                         Ruby, I'm so sorry.

               Ada moves towards her, puts her arms around her. Ruby is 
               rigid. Ada stops embracing her.

                                     RUBY
                         We should get going.

               She's tying up the kit. She doesn't know how to grieve.

                                     RUBY
                         Every piece of this is a man's 
                         bullshit. They call this a war a 
                         cloud over the land, but they made 
                         the weather. Then they stand in the 
                         rain and say: shit! It's raining!
                              (tears welling)
                         If I cry one tear for my Daddy I 
                         stole it off a crocodile.

               EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN. EVENING

               THE SNOW IS FALLING HEAVILY. RUBY AND ADA TRUDGE UP THE

               MOUNTAIN, dressed in Monroe's clothes, hats pulled down, 
               leading the horse, which is loaded up with tools and supplies. 
               A choice of paths. They start up one, then Ruby decides 
               against it, consults the map, and they reverse, pulling the 
               horse back and then yanking it up the other path.

               EXT. PI STRUCTURE, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT

               Ruby and Ada have made a fire. They sleep under a stone 
               structure, which forms a natural pi shape, the fire in the 
               entrance, the snow caught in its light.

               EXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. MORNING

               Ada and Ruby arrive at the scene of murder.

               Pangle is keeled over at the old Poplar, snow covering him. 
               Only his girth and a glimpse of coat identify him.

               Ada brushes some of the snow from his face, revealing the 
               death wound, then lays a hand in blessing on his head.

                                     ADA
                         I don't understand.

                                     RUBY
                         Maybe Teague's took him. They did 
                         that with the Swanger boys -- didn't, 
                         they? -- dragged them into town, 
                         then strung them up as warning... 
                         it's snowed since, so I can't read 
                         the story on the ground.

               Ada fishes out Pangle's banjo from the snow. It's broken and 
               the strings hang slack.

                                     RUBY
                         Let's dig.

               LATER -- and RUBY FINISHES OFF THE GRAVE, hammering in a 
               stone to mark the place. Ada walks away towards the creek, 
               to wash her hands. She bends and rinses her face.

               As she looks up SHE SEES STOBROD ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE 
               CREEK; half-in, half out of the water, slumped against a 
               tree, blood everywhere, staining the crust of snow which 
               covers him.

                                     ADA
                         Ruby! Ruby!

               Ruby arrives at Ada, looks to where she's looking, walks 
               straight into the creek, all her love contained in the urgency 
               with which she hurtles to her father, oblivious to the 
               freezing water. She puts a head to his chest, seeks out a 
               pulse at his wrist. Calls back to Ada.

                                     RUBY
                         He's still breathing!
                              (to Stobrod)
                         God damn! Daddy; Daddy -- it's Ruby. 
                         Don't you die on me again.
                              (to Ada)
                         He's still breathing!

               EXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. AFTERNOON

               A mean fire burns by the creek. RUBY TURNS A KNIFE IN THE 
               FLAMES. Stobrod's back is exposed. Just by the shoulder blade 
               is an ugly grey and purple bulge the size of a crabapple. 
               Ruby turns to Ada, who is helping.

                                     RUBY
                         Pack a pan full of snow. I need good 
                         clean water, boiled up.

               She cuts the skin and prises out a slug which she drops in 
               the snow and rolls around to clean. Stobrod doesn't move. He 
               could be dead. Ada loads the pan with snow.

                                     ADA
                         Let's get him home. We have herbs 
                         there and it's warm.

                                     RUBY
                         He'll die first. He's got hardly no 
                         blood left in him.

                                     ADA
                         He'll die lying here.

                                     RUBY
                         There's a place further on up. Used 
                         to be. Old Cherokee place. There's 
                         good water right by it.

               Ada puts the snow-packed pan on the fire.

               EXT. BY THE OUTLIER'S CAVE, COLD MOUNTAIN. AFTERNOON

               Squirrels frolic. Teague sits on the trunk of a fallen tree.

               He feeds the squirrels, looking straight ahead where the 
               mouth of a cave winks back at him.

               EXT. TREE TUNNEL NEAR CHEROKEE VILLAGE. AFTERNOON

               THE TWO WOMEN EMERGE FROM A STEEP TUNNEL OF TREES IN A 
               CHESTNUT GROVE. There's a stream and, up on the bank, A 
               CLUSTER OF BLACK CONICAL HUTS, made up of chestnut logs, 
               abandoned and slightly sinister looking. They approach one 
               of the huts, its door long lost. The snow has drifted in. A 
               second hut has a door which they pry open. It's dark and 
               cold, but apparently still weatherproof. They get Stobrod 
               off the horse and carry him inside, then come out again to 
               unload the horse of its remaining load.

                                     ADA
                         This horse is weary. He's ready to 
                         give up the ghost.

               Ruby picks up the blankets and provisions and goes back inside 
               to her father. Ada takes the horse to another hut and, despite 
               his great reluctance, pushes him inside.

                                     ADA
                         Good boy.
                              (she blows into his 
                              nostrils, calming 
                              him)
                         That's warmer, isn't it.

               Ada wouldn't even recognize this practical, hardy woman she's 
               become. Stringy and of few words. She sets off towards the 
               tree tunnel, passing Stobrod's hut.

                                     ADA
                         I'm getting firewood.

               EXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. DUSK

               Inman approaches the Killing Ground. He studies the ground, 
               finds Pangle's grave. Blood has left its black writing in 
               the snow and he finds first where Stobrod has been, where 
               the bullet had been removed, then the journey away, still 
               tiny, telltale spatters of blood, and the hoof prints and 
               boot prints of two walkers and one loaded horse. He puts his 
               hand into the ashes of Ruby's fire, can't feel any warmth. 
               It's getting dark. He takes a drink from the stream, shudders 
               at the cold.

               INT. STOBROD'S HUT, CHEROKEE VILLAGE. NIGHT

               The fire burns, a pall of smoke. Stobrod lies on the ground, 
               swathed in blankets. Coughs. Ruby sits next to him, wipes 
               the hair from his forehead. Ada opens her eyes, looks, closes 
               them, listens to the fire, a strange squeaking as it burns.

                         That wood -- that sound when it burns 
                         that mean more snow?

                                     RUBY
                         Yes, it do, country girl.

               EXT. TRACK, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAWN

               First light. The sun creeps up, a red streak of dawn. Inman 
               walking, his head bent to the tracks. He walks quickly, even 
               as the terrain gets more steep. As he bends to the snow -- 
               where a spot of blood has fallen into a hoof print -- A FLAKE 
               OF SNOW LANDS ON HIS HAND. Then a second. He looks up. The 
               snow falls.

               He starts to move more quickly, racing the snow as it seeks 
               to erase the tracks. The snow thickens.

               EXT. TREE TUNNEL NEAR CHEROKEE VILLAGE. MORNING

               In the Chestnut Grovel A DOZEN WILD TURKEYS pick their way 
               across the snow. A shotgun lines up its sight at one of them.

               The trigger is squeezed. An explosion of feathers.

               EXT. THREE WAY CROSSING, COLD MOUNTAIN. MORNING

               Inman hears the shot. Then a second, the sound ricocheting 
               around him. He can't quite identify its source but he runs 
               again, heading for the Chestnut trees he can see above him.

               EXT. TREE TUNNEL NEAR CHEROKEE VILLAGE. MORNING

               Ada collects the two turkeys, the first creatures she's ever 
               shot. Doesn't quite know how to hold them. She straightens 
               up and sees, at the other end of the tree tunnel, backlit by 
               the morning sun, THE SILHOUETTE OF A MAN. She drops the 
               turkeys tires to reload the shotgun.

               Inman comes down the tunnel, approaching the hunter he sees 
               through the snow at the other end of it.

                                     ADA
                         Turn round and go back where you 
                         came from.

               Inman is bewildered by this woman's voice in a man's outfit, 
               keeps walking, peering through the snow. Ada fires a warning 
               shot. Inman, still some distance, suddenly understands.

                                     INMAN
                         Ada? Ada Monroe?

                                     ADA
                         I do not know you.

               After all this time, all this way, Inman could give up the 
               ghost.

                                     INMAN
                         Then I believe I made a mistake.

               He turns, walks heavily away from her. Then he turns again, 
               completely lost, without compass.

                                     INMAN
                         If I knew where to go I'd go there.

                                     ADA
                              (finally recognising 
                              him)
                         Inman?

               He nods. They don't know how to speak to each other, just 
               stand awkwardly, some distance apart, the emotion stones in 
               their throats. Eventually --

                                     ADA
                         You'd better come with me.

               And with that, she starts to sob, and sob.

               VERY HIGH ANGLE: Inman walks towards Ada. They embrace.

               INT. STOBROD'S HUT, CHEROKEE VILLAGE. MORNING

               Ada enters, Inman behind her. Ruby looks up from Stobrod.

                                     ADA
                         Ruby, this is Inman.

               Ruby digests this. Considers this ghost of a man.

                                     RUBY
                         Congratulations, I should send you 
                         out with a shotgun more often. He 
                         looks as he needs sleep.

                                     INMAN
                         I may need to.

                         Be my guest. You shot or something?

                                     INMAN
                         Not lately.

                                     RUBY
                         Hungry?
                              (Inman nods, Ruby to 
                              Ada)
                         He woke up.

                         Stobrod?

                         Said -- your mommy's name was Grace 
                         then closed his eyes again.

               EXT. CHEROKEE VILLAGE. DAY

               Ada comes out of Stobrod's hut, a glimpse of Inman sleeping 
               on the floor, heads for another hut which Ruby is sweeping 
               out. The snow has stopped. Ada stands in the door, watches 
               Ruby. Ruby's resistance to Inman is palpable.

                                     ADA
                         He's asleep. They both are.

                                     RUBY
                         I'm not surprised. Your man looks 
                         played out.

                                     ADA
                         I saw him. I realize now.

                                     RUBY
                         Saw him when?

                                     ADA
                         In Sally Swanger's well. A tunnel of 
                         trees. The man like a black smudge 
                         in the snow, the sun behind him.

                                     RUBY
                         Well there you are.

                                     ADA
                         Funny thing is it wasn't the same. 
                         The image. It wasn't snowing. And in 
                         the well, he was, as if he were 
                         falling.

                                     RUBY
                         You probably don't remember it right.

                                     ADA
                         I remember it exactly. There were 
                         crows, these black crows flying 
                         towards me. I thought I was seeing 
                         him fall. Instead I was seeing him 
                         come back to me. All this while I've 
                         been packing ice around my heart. 
                         How will I make it melt?

                                     RUBY
                         Better get a fire going.
                              (goes to the fireplace)
                         I've got big plans for that farm. 
                         Got a vision in my mind of how that 
                         Cove needs to be.

                         ourselves.

               INT. ADA AND RUBY HUT, CHEROKEE VILLAGE. NIGHT

               THE FIRE BURNS. Ada lies awake. Ruby sleeping. Ada gets up, 
               steps out into the snow, her blanket around her.

               EXT. ADA AND RUBY HUT, CHEROKEE VILLAGE. NIGHT

               Inman is outside his cabin. Only the light escaping from the 
               cabin, fire lights them, almost silhouettes.

                                     INMAN
                         I'm sorry. I was trying to be quiet.

                         -- I got no appetite left to be in a 
                         room with wounded men.

                         I got three letters. Carried them in 
                         that book you gave me. The Bertram.

                         I must have sent 100. Did you write

                         Whenever I could. If you never got

                         your thoughts. You are all that keeps 
                         me from sliding into some dark place.

                         A thousand moments. They're like a 
                         bag of tiny diamonds glittering in a 
                         black heart. Don't matter if they're 
                         real or things I made up. The shape 
                         of your neck. The way you felt under 
                         my hands when I pulled you to me.

                         That kiss -- which I've kissed again 
                         every day of my walking.

                         Maybe you can't see my face, but if 
                         you could see my inside, my whatever 
                         you want to name it, my spirit, that's 
                         the fear I have deeper than any gash 
                         on my neck. I think I'm ruined. They 
                         kept trying to put me in the ground, 
                         but I wasn't ready, no ma'am, no 
                         more ready than that scoundrel in 
                         there's not ready to die on us. But 
                         if I had goodness, I lost it. If I 
                         had anything tender in me I shot it 
                         dead.

               Ruby stomps out of the hut.

                         Cove.

                                     INMAN
                         Right.

                                     ADA
                         As long as she wants. And if she 
                         never leaves I'll be glad.

                                     INMAN
                         More a question could she put up 
                         with me.

                                     ADA
                         And you understand she's my friend, 
                         she's not a hired hand and she doesn't 
                         empty a night jar unless it's her 
                         own.

                                     INMAN
                         Sure.

                                     ADA
                         This war's made some things pointless. 
                         It's hard to imagine a wedding. I 
                         think even my father would recognize 
                         that.

                                     INMAN
                         Ada, I want to marry you. If you'll 
                         have me.

                                     ADA
                         Isn't there's some religion where 
                         you just have to say I marry you, 
                         three times, and then you're man and 
                         wife.

                                     INMAN
                         I marry you. I marry you. I marry 
                         you.

               Ada laughs, unsettling Inman.

                                     INMAN
                         Why's that funny?

                                     ADA
                         No, I think it's I divorce you three 
                         times and then you're not married 
                         anymore.

                                     INMAN
                         I can wait for you.

                                     ADA
                         You waited enough. I certainly did. 
                         I marry you. I marry you. I marry 
                         you.

               And they kiss, tentative, then more urgent.

                                     ADA
                         I'm sorry about the way I look. In 
                         these clothes.
                              (Inman shakes his 
                              head)
                         And there are so many buttons.
                              (starts to undress)
                         Will you turn your back?

                                     INMAN
                         Not for all the gold dollars in the 
                         Federal Bank.

               She stands holding her clothes in front of her to cover 
               herself. He takes them from her, drops them to the floor.

               EXT. CHEROKEE VILLAGE. MORNING

               A crisp, cold beautiful morning. They're packing up, all 
               their clothes in layers. Inman prepares the horse. Ruby and 
               Ada carrying bundles out of the huts. Inman approaches Ruby.

                                     INMAN
                         You go ahead. I'll follow with the 
                         horse at a pace your daddy can 
                         tolerate.

                                     ADA
                         We can all go together.

                                     INMAN
                         It's safer this way. No one has 
                         quarrel with you.

                                     RUBY
                         He's right.

                                     INMAN
                              (to Ruby)
                         I gather I need permission if I reckon 
                         on living at Black Cove.

               Ruby gives a curt nod, goes over to Stobrod's hut. Inman 
               gets close to Ada.

                                     INMAN
                         We'll get to you by nightfall.

                                     ADA
                         You be safe.

               She puts her hand to his mouth which creases into a smile.

                                     INMAN
                         Your Mr. Bartram speaks about some 
                         category of fly born on the hide of 
                         a cow. It flies up into a tree and 
                         waits and waits until it smells cow. 
                         It can wait a year, two years, I 
                         don't know, maybe longer. Then a cow 
                         comes along and it wakes up, flies 
                         down, lays its eggs on the cow. 
                         There's purpose for you.

                         And am I the fly in this story, or 
                         the cow?

               INT. STOBROD'S HUT, CHEROKEE VILLAGE. DAY

               Ruby is wrapping a fragile Stobrod for the journey.

                                     STOBROD
                         You come up the mountain for me, 
                         darling, I'd be dead otherwise, dead 
                         and gone.

                                     RUBY
                         You'd have found some other fool to 
                         rescue you.

                                     STOBROD
                         He's sweet on you, that Georgia boy.

               He coughs for a long time.

                                     RUBY
                         If you say a thing and then cough 
                         it's a lie. Daddy, stay on that horse, 
                         and don't lose him or sell him. We'll 
                         need him on the farm.

               EXT. CHEROKEE VILLAGE. MORNING

               And then the two women are off, little men in their outfits, 
               tramping off in the snow. Inman watches.

               EXT. TRACK NEAR THREE WAY CROSSING, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

               Ruby and Ada walk.

                                     RUBY
                         I hope that Georgia boy's been seeing 
                         to the animals.

                         I was not. I was thinking on swollen 
                         udders -- and before you say same 
                         difference...

                         I'm saying nothing.

               Ruby elbows her.

                                     RUBY
                         Miss lovey-dovey!

               Ada elbows her back.

               EXT. THREE WAY CROSSING, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

               Inman has roped Stobrod to the horse which he pulls down a 
               steep slope. Behind him, their hooves muffled by the snow, A 
               GROUP OF RIDERS JOIN THE TRAIL, IN SLOW BUT STEADY PURSUIT.

               Inman walks on, apparently oblivious to who's behind him. He 
               and Stobrod are some distance from broken ground, a fringe 
               of trees.

                                     INMAN
                              (quietly to Stobrod)
                         Don't look round.

                                     STOBROD
                         Got it.

                                     INMAN
                         How many men does he have?

                                     STOBROD
                         There were five. You can't reason 
                         with that man.

                                     INMAN
                              (takes off his gloves)
                         I got a conversation stopper.
                              (they're getting closer)
                         Closer we get to that broken ground 
                         the better.

               Inman opens his coat. Stobrod looks at the Lemats. They're 
               at the edge of the trees.

                                     INMAN
                         You hold on tight, do you hear? When 
                         I say three, look round, nice and 
                         slow.

                                     STOBROD
                         Okay.

                                     INMAN
                         One, two, three.

               Stobrod looks round. Inman doesn't. Teague has some new bodies 
               in his entourage but they're all dead. A SPARE HORSE HAS 
               THREE CORPSES HUNG OVER IT, ANOTHER HORSE DRAGS A MAKESHIFT 
               LITTER WITH A COUPLE MORE, SOUVENIRS OF THEIR CAVE VISIT. 
               Teague waves.

                                     TEAGUE
                         God damn! You're a hard fucker to 
                         put down.
                              (they approach)
                         Good directions to that cave from 
                         the fat boy -- saw the squirrels, 
                         sat on the tree made some friends, 
                         brought some back with me.

               His riders begin, quite casually, to fan out.

               IN ONE MOVEMENT, INMAN SLAPS THE FLANK OF THE HORSE. WHICH 
               CAREERS DOWN THE TRACK, THEN TURNS AND FIRES, TWICE, BEFORE 
               PITCHING HIMSELF INTO A ROLL TOWARDS THE TREES. HIS FIRST 
               SHOT KNOCKS JO FROM HIS HORSE, THE SECOND MO, WHO FALLS INTO 
               THE SNOW, BLEEDING FROM THE GROIN AND SCREAMING. The riderless 
               horse gets tangled up with the others.

               Inman is in the trees, shots around him. He doesn't move 
               away from, but towards the riders inside the line of trees. 
               Grayling charges him, riding into the trees. INMAN SHOOTS 
               HIM, THEN RUSHES FROM THE TREES, FIRING, MISSING BOSIE, WHO 
               RIDES AWAY, EVIDENTLY NOT RELISHING THE FIGHT, AND THROWS 
               HIMSELF AT TEAGUE, WHOSE HORSE IS BUCKING WILDLY. Teague's 
               carbine fires an involuntary shot into the air. Inman yanks 
               the gun from his hand with his own left hand and lets go the 
               shotgun barrel of the Lemats with the other, the big pistol 
               almost leaping from his hand with the recoil. TEAGUE'S CHEST 
               OPENS OUT AS HE'S THROWN OFF THE HORSE. Mo is still screaming.

               Inman walks over and shoots him in the head, then walks to 
               Teague, who is saying something, the blood blotting the snow 
               under him.

               Inman studies him, picks up the Spencer carbine, turns to 
               look where Bosie has gone, steps up onto Teague's horse, 
               reins the horse in, and trots it over to the prostrate Teague, 
               LEANS OVER AND SHOOTS HIM DEAD. He turns the horse in the 
               direction Bosie had headed. He can't see horse or rider, but 
               in the stand of Hickory Trees ahead, THE GUSTS OF STEAMING 
               BREATH betray them both. He rides slowly towards the stand 
               of trees.

               EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

               Ada and Ruby walking. They hear the shots. Ada turns and 
               starts to run through the snow, her hat flying from her head.

               EXT. STAND OF HICKORY TREES, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

               Inman's horse is parallel to Bosie, who is deep inside the 
               trees but also riding, slowly. It's like a dance.

                                     INMAN
                         Come out of there.

                                     BOSIE
                         No, sir. Here's fine.

                                     INMAN
                         I just have to shoot the horse from 
                         under you.

                                     BOSIE
                         Shoot her. She's not mine. You riding 
                         Mr Teague's mare?

                                     INMAN
                         I am.

                                     BOSIE
                         He dead?

                                     INMAN
                         I hope so.
                              (wearily, as he brings 
                              his horse inside the 
                              trees)
                         Look, how old are you? Give me your 
                         gun and ride home, I'm done fighting. 
                         I'm sick of it.

                                     BOSIE
                         I give you my gun you'll shoot me 
                         dead.

                                     INMAN
                         I will not shoot you, but nor am I 
                         walking down that mountain looking 
                         over my shoulder for you.

                                     BOSIE
                         That's what they call a conundrum. I 
                         tell you what I've got on my side.

                                     INMAN
                         What have you got on your side?

                                     BOSIE
                         The confidence of youth.

               And in that second HE PRODUCES HIS GUN AND FIRES. INMAN HAS 
               ALREADY FIRED THE LEMATS AND THE BOY, SHOT IN THE HEAD, FALLS. 
               CAUGHT BY ONE STIRRUP THE HORSE BOLTING. INMAN WATCHES, STOCK 
               STILL, THEN MAKES A COUGH, AS IF CLEARING HIS THROAT, AND A 
               THIN MIST OF BLOOD SPRAYS FROM HIS MOUTH.

               EXT. RIDGE, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

               Ada and Ruby running. THEY REACH STOBROD, HIS HORSE STOPPED, 
               DRINKING FROM THE CREEK. Stobrod, barely conscious, hanging 
               halfway down its flank, held on by the ropes.

               Ada hurries on, taking the shotgun from Ruby, who tends to 
               her father.

               EXT. A GROVE OF TREES, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

               Ada runs past the horse dragging the cave corpses. She hardly 
               stops to look at the bodies, just rushes on.

               THE GROUND SIMPLIFIES AND SHE'S AT THE BOTTOM OF A GROVE. A 
               STEEP INCLINE, THE SUN LOW AND IN FRONT OF HER. SHE SEES A 
               BRILLIANT FRAME OF BLACK TREES, AND THEN A SUDDEN FLURRY OF 
               ANGRY CROWS FLYING TOWARDS HER. AT THE TOP OF THE HILL IS A 
               SMALL HIEROGLYPH OF A MAN.

               FINALLY, THE IMAGE FROM THE SWANGER WELL EXACTLY AS SHE FIRST 
               SAW IT.

               THE FIGURE RAISES A HAND, BRIEFLY, THEN PITCHES FORWARD INTO 
               THE SNOW.

               She runs, her heart broken, towards the body of Inman. He's 
               dead, the red flag of his life ebbed, away in the snow. Ada 
               falls to her knees and pulls him over, the snow crusted on 
               his face, which she wipes away with great tenderness, then 
               sits, his head in her lap, as Ruby slowly comes up the hill 
               towards them.

               A VIOLIN PLAYS, quite raucous.

               INT. KITCHEN, BLACK COVE FARM, EASTER. DAY

               A GIRL, about five or six, with Ada's curls, sits at the 
               table cradling a tiny lamb, which won't feed from the nippled 
               bottle she offers it. She tries again. Ada comes in suddenly, 
               takes a knife from the kitchen, and hurries out.

                                     ADA
                         You bring that lamb outside.

               The girl gets up, carries the lamb out into the field.

               EXT. FIELD, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               THE SOUND OF THE FIDDLE CONTINUING, JOINED BY A BANJO, It's 
               a glorious spring morning, Black Cove Farm at its most 
               luxuriant, the path edged with brilliant flowers. There are 
               more animals in evidence. The girl emerges from the house 
               and sees Ada in the field, surrounded by sheep. She hurries 
               over.

               ADA IS EXPERTLY SKINNING A STILLBORN LAMB. The little girl 
               is horrified.

                                     GRACE
                         What are you doing!

                                     ADA
                         He came out dead, love.

               She has the skin off the lamb, which lies like a little pink 
               cat on the ground. She approaches Grace, takes the live lamb 
               from her arms, the girl resistant, frightened.

                                     GRACE
                         Don't kill him!

                                     ADA
                         I'm not going to kill him. But we 
                         have to try something or else he's 
                         going to die.

               She takes the skin and wraps it round Grace's lamb. Then 
               puts the covered lamb into the pen with the dead lamb's 
               mother.

               It goes to the sheep and, after a few false starts, starts 
               to feed, accepted as a surrogate.

                                     ADA
                         Isn't that a small mercy.

               And A VOICE joins in with the fiddle and banjo.

               EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               STOBROD is playing, on his repaired fiddle. His hair is now 
               completely grey. GEORGIA is playing the banjo and singing, 
               although. A SMALL CHILD with Georgia's reddish coloring keeps 
               invading his picking hand trying to join in. RUBY HAS ANOTHER 
               GEORGIA CHILD IN HER ARMS, but is also trying to serve food.

               She passes Georgia and touches the top of his head. SALLY 
               SWANGER is pouring water from a jug, Ada emerges from the 
               kitchen, with a big pie, racing to the table.

                                     ADA
                              (laughing)
                         Hot hot hot hot hot!!!

               From behind her, Grace appears, carrying a jug of milk, puts 
               it on the groaning board of the table. Grace has a full plate 
               in front of her, picks up a fork to spear some meat.

                                     ADA
                         Grace Inman, nobody said eat.
                              (then to Stobrod)
                         Mr. Thewes...

               The music stops. And there's quiet except for the sound of 
               animals: lowing, barking, braying, bleating.

                                     ADA
                         For good friends, good food, good 
                         family: for all our blessings -- Oh 
                         Lord we thank thee. Amen.

                                     ALL
                         Amen !

               And they eat.

          Credits start on a black screen, then they continue during the

          MICHELLE'S PLACE - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Close-up on a silver lipstick stand made into a bad taste musical
          box. We see Michelle's hand selecting a lipstick then we see
          Michelle putting the lipstick on her lips, seated in front of the
          mirror of her dressing table. She is dressed in a green frock, and
          her face shows that she is quite disturbed.
           Her apartment's decoration is very heavy, with a lot of various
          useless objects and gold-plated furniture and many mirrors.
           She looks for a new dress in her wardrobe, and get mad at not
          finding it. She then goes to a sofa covered with cushions, which
          she throws all around the place, still madder at not finding her
          dress. A cat, who was lying on the armrest of the sofa, runs away
          hurriedly from the mad Michelle.
                         
                          MICHELLE
           God !...... No !......
                         
          Michelle is back in front of the mirror of her dressing-table. She
          takes the lipstick and put a lot of it on her lips, then on her
          teeth, then all around her mouth. She makes faces to herself in
          the mirror. She seems more and more disturbed.
           She takes a chrome-plated revolver in her drawer, starts to put
          it in her purse, then takes it out, spins the cylinder of the
          revolver, and puts the revolver in her mouth, as if she wanted to
          kill herself. But instead, she starts sucking the barrel, while
          she strokes the revolver in a quite erotic way.
                         
          BILL CAPA' OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Large planes of ground glass. We hear, without understanding them,
          some voices and laughs. Then a male voice becomes more
          understandable...
                         
                          BILL'S VOICE
           So who do you think is the enemy ?... No, no, give me a
           specific answer...
                         
          ... then Michelle appears on the screen. She is dressed in a green
          suit, she is heavily made up, et she still seems very disturbed.
           The office is very chic and evidently belongs to a very rich New-
          York psycho-analyst. Beautiful and good taste furniture. Shelves
          with leather-bound books.
                         
                          MICHELLE
           You are the goddamned enemy, Capa, you and this all tower
           of psycho-babble. You know what I hope ? That God gets real
           pissed off and He shrivels up your cock, so that it points
           straight down to Hell, where you belongs !...
                         
          During this reply, Bill Capa has appeared on the screen. He is
          seated. He is wearing a long-sleeve shirt, a necktie, but no
          jacket. He laughs at Michelle's last sentence.
                         
                          BILL
           OK... Michelle, so you will become His Avenging Angel, and
           swoop down to finish me off.
          He stands up.
                         
                          MICHELLE
           Now, I finally get it : you're are like my ex-husband. You
           think that everything got to be either black or white
           because you got color-blind. But God is on my side now. He
           knows I'm not like you
                         
                          BILL
           Well, we are pretty much the same, Michelle. We all do it.
                         
                          MICHELLE
           We all do what ?
                         
                          BILL
           Tend to view our lives as we were looking through a
           keyhole. I's a very limited view of the truth. So, we have
           to fill in the blanks. We invent things.
                         
                          MICHELLE
           I don't know what you mean.
                         
                          BILL
           You invent enemies to test your strength against. You
           invent gods to protect you from these enemies.
                         
                          MICHELLE
          Cutting him.
           What a depressing view of life you have, that is such
           horse-shit !
                         
                          BILL
           Who is the enemy ? One minute you have friends, the next
           moment they've slipped away. You leave here and I wonder
           who is Michelle really hating this week. I try to remember
           and I can't bring it to mind. Do you know why ?
                         
                          MICHELLE
           No, why don't you tell me
                         
                          BILL
           Take a look in the mirror, Michelle
                         
                          MICHELLE
           Which mirror ?... This mirror ?...
                         
                          BILL
           Any mirror. Tell me what you see.
                         
                          MICHELLE
          We see Michelle as if we were watching her from behind the mirror.
           I see... I see your reflection over my shoulder... I see... there
           is nothing much that I really like... I think I prefer the
           view outside actually...
                         
          During this last reply, Bill, standing up, is fidgeting with
          something on his desk. At Michelle's last words, he turns toward
          her, looking alarmed. But he doesn't have time to do prevent her
          from breaking through the glass pane and jumping outside. He yells
          «Michelle» twice.
                         
          A STREET IN NEW-YORK - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          We see Michelle's body falling all the way down. Capa's office
          must be around the 25th floor. The body crashes on the street. A
          police horse, who was near the impact, rears up in fright. As if
          the asphalt were translucent, we see Michelle's body from
          underneath, with the blood flowing around it.
                         
                          SEVERAL VOICES
           All right, get back there... Stay back !... Get back in your

          BILL CAPA'S OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          We see Bill with tears in his eyes. He walks to the broken window,
          and look outside.
                         
                          BILL
          Voice over.
           My God, it was the reddest blood I ever saw, poured around
           her green dress. And... Then the red disappeared...
                         
          OPHTHALMOLOGIST'S OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bill is seated with a huge ophthalmologic device on his head. He
          finishes the preceding reply.
                          BILL
           Christ, Ed. It was like a vibration of color broadcast from
           Hell. And then the red started to fade away.
                         
          The ophthalmologist moves the device away. We see Bill's face, and
          behind him, projected on the wall, an abstract drawing made of
          colored spots close together. The red spots start to blink and
          then they become grey.
                         
          LARRY'S PLACE - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          It is the apartment of an old New-York intellectual. A bit messy.
          A old Earth globe on a stand. Objects and books everywhere, but
          with an warm atmosphere. Larry wears an open shirt and a sweater.
          Bill also is in open shirt, with a sleeveless sweater. At the
          beginning of the scene, Bill is lying on a couch.
                         
                          LARRY
           Poor Capa ! You're here for me to pity you.
                         
          Larry puts down the newspaper he was reading. It is the New York
          Post. On the front page, a title in large prints : «Patient's
          family sues Manhattan shrink»
                         
                          BILL
           Hell, yes. It doesn't take Sigmund Freud to figure out I
           don't care to see the color of my patients' blood.
                         
                          LARRY
           I'm a little surprised that this happened to you.
                         
                          BILL
           Starts to stand up.
           Sure. You always thought I was a cold-hearted son of a
           bitch.
                         
                          LARRY
           Not really, but there is a kind of arrogance here.
          Bill laughs.
           Do you really believe that you're responsible for her
           illness. You were a small recent part of her life.
                         
                          BILL
           Yes, that's right, that's right. But it's all too fucking
           glib for me, Larry. I cannot dispose of this woman that
           easily.
                         
                          LARRY
           Well, you always were a romantic. Are you involved with
           anyone else ?
                         
          Larry starts to make tea in a corner of the room. Bill is seated
          on an armchair during the following reply, and strokes the grey
          cat who is lying on the table.
                         
                          BILL
           No. I am still a romantic. I just don't have anybody to be
           romantic with. They want to fuck me or marry me... None of
           them want to love me
                          LARRY
           Maybe you don't want to be loved. You had a happy marriage
           once.
                         
                          BILL
           She loved me to death. Then she ran off and loved somebody
           else to death.
                         
                          LARRY
           Of course, there is something else here. To deny red is to
           deny emotion.
                         
                          BILL
           Oh yeah !
                         
                          LARRY
           As you know, that could be very dangerous.
                         
          Bill stands up.
                         
                          BILL
           Yes, yes, I know. Very dangerous. I know and I have got
           something broken. I know it's gonna take some time to get
           fixed.
                         
          He picks up his jacket on a chair and put it on.
                         
                          LARRY
           You're a pretty good therapist. How long does it take a man
           like you to forgive himself.
                         
                          BILL
           I see you when I get back from Los Angeles.
                         
          During the two last replies, Bill has walked to the front door.
                         
                          LARRY
           Don't run away because of one treatment failure.
                         
                          BILL
           I'm not running away, Larry, it's just a little trip to Los
           Angeles. Besides, you can't really run away. It's all up
           here, isn't it...
          He shows his forehead and pretends he is shooting a bullet in it.
           Pow !... It's a package deal. The head goes with me.
                         
          ABOVE L.A. - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Shot of L.A. seen from the sky, then shot of an airplane landing.
          On these two short shots, we hear :
                         
                          STEWARDESS
           Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Los Angeles. Please remain
           seated until the aircraft comes...
                         
          The end of the sentence is not understandable, because it is mixed
          with the sound of a radio set in a car.
                         
           VOICE IN THE RADIO
           Just another Monday in paradise. There is a fender-bender
           on 405, slowing thing down.
                         
          TAXI IN A TRAFFIC JAM - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          The voice in the radio is covered by the voice of the taxi driver.
          He wears a French cap and a striped shirt. He has a strong foreign
          accent, which makes his sentences a bit hard to understand. Bill
          is seated at the back of the taxi. He is wearing a black polo
          shirt, jeans and sunglasses.
                         
                          TAXI DRIVER
           Hey ! Jerk-off ! What are you looking at ! There's an
           accident !...
          Short shot of the accident.
           ... Hey ! What happened ? Anybody is hurt ? Anybody is dead ?
          Car horns. A car bumps into the back of the taxi. Bill moves
          forward and backward, and then massages the back of his head.
           What are you doing ? You 're looking there and driving
           here ? Put the pedal on the metal... Asshole !
                         
          BOB'S OFFICE - MEETING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
          Bob's office is located in a big modern building in downtown L.A.
          A wide sitting room, called «Group Room» is reserved for group
          therapy sessions. Furniture is modern and functional, but with a
          little personal touch.
           Close-up of a woman's hand, who steals a lighter on a table. Then
          we see Sondra putting covertly the lighter in her purse. She is
          dressed in a very elegant way, and wears expensive jewels. Richie,
          a teenagers with a large checkered floating shirt, a sleeveless
          denim jacket and walkman earphones on his head, walks behind her
          without looking at her, and gets seated in an armchair. We hear
          voices, but we understand only a few words here and there. Then a
          voice becomes clearer than the other ones. It is Clark's voice
          counting the books on a shelf.
                         
           BITS OF CONVERSATION
           Is the aquarium with it ?... That's a blue shark... OK... Was
           that an after-schock I felt ?...
                         
                          CLARK
          He is dressed with a very neat grey suit. Everything on him is
          neat : not a hair going the wrong way.
           33 and 3 is... 44... 45
                         
                          CASEY
          He is seated on an armchair shaped like a giant hand. He looks ver
          «artist». He wears his hair tied in a ponytail. He is making fun
          of Clark.

                          BUCK
          He looks very rough, with his uncombed grey hair. He wears a red
          sweater without shirt, and a jacket.
           Leave him alone, will you ?

                          BUCK
          He take off his jacket.
           I was just wondering how many fucking pages it had !
          Casey laughs.
                         
                          CLARK
           Oh Christ ! I fell right into that !
                         
          We see Bob behind the glass on the door of the room. He wears a
          shirt and a necktie, but no jacket. He looks pensively at the
          group.

           Because his father's paying for his therapy.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Oh, my dead husband is paying for mine, and I still care.
                         
          Casey is looking for his lighter. We see Sondra taping her chin
          with the lighter, then giving it back to Casey.
                         
                          CASEY

           I think we should get started now... Clark...
                         
          He closes the door. We hear Bill's voice.

                          BOB

                          BILL
           You know. I'll just wait out here for a while.

          He sits next to Clark, who stands up to give him room.

           That's an anti-gender remark
                         
                          BOB
           Sondra ! Sondra, whey don't you start us off ?
                          SONDRA
          She simpers a lot and makes strange faces while she talks.
           OK... My name is Sondra Dorio... and... I always marry older men
           but...
          Richie looks at Bill's feet. Bill is wearing a red sock and a
          green sock, which makes Richie smile.
           ... I am single now... and I keep... I... I want sex all the time...
          Clark looks embarrassed. Casey sneers.
           But I mean... I really do... want... a real relationship... and...
           sometimes, I steal thing... I mean, they're little thing...
          Richie put his walkman earphones back on his ears.
           ... It doesn't make any sense. It's hard to... You know, I... Is
           that OK !
                         
                          BOB
           Thank you.
                         
                          SONDRA
                          THANKS
                         
                          BOB
           Richie !...
                         
                          CASEY
           This will be an event
                         
                          BOB
           Richie !
                         
          Richie doesn't hear a thing because of his earphones.
                         
                          BUCK
          Yelling louder.
           Richie !
                         
          He signals him to take off his earphones. Richie takes them off.
                         
                          RICHIE
           What !
                         
                          BOB
           Would you like to tell Bill a little something about
           yourself ?
                         
                          RICHIE
           No !
                         
                          CLARK
           OK... If nobody else is going to do it, I will. Richie has a
           gender identity problem, and social phobia, and he's
           promised the group no to wear the walkman in this group.
                         
                          BUCK
           Doctor Clark, to lay the inventory on. I like that.
                         
                          CLARK
           Oh, Saint Christopher rattles his chain.
                         
                          BUCK
           Saint Michael, sir.
                          CLARK
           This is not about you.
                         
                          BUCK
           You're right...
                         
                          BOB
           You know what I am saying ?...
          He talks to Richie.
                         
                          RICHIE
          One feels he has elocution problems. He stutters and looks for his
          words.
           I... I... I op... open my mouth to talk, but nothing... happens...
           except when I... when I do drugs. I... I can't... can't talk... so
           that's... how come I'm here... They... they say that I... I... that I
           blush too.
                         
                          CASEY
          Imitating him.
           Y-You c... can say that again...
                         
          Richie jumps on Casey. Sondra stands up to stop him, but she is
          toot late. Richie falls on Casey and knocks his armchair down.
                         
                          RICHIE
           Fuck you !... Fuck you !... I'll tear your fuckin' head off !
           You fuckin' cocksucker !
                         
                          BUCK
           Get up!
                         
          They fight on the floor. Buck tries to take them apart. He
          succeeds in tearing Richie away by holding him with both arms, and
          carrying him away.
                         
                          RICHIE
           Get the fuck off me !
                         
                          BOB
           Buck.
                         
          Richie gets free and walks rapidly out of the room. Sondra tries
          to follow him. Bob stops her.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Richie !
                         
                          BOB
           It's all right... He'll come back...
                         
                          BUCK
          Voice over.
           What do you think, Doctor Clark ?...
                         
          Bob straightens up the armchair and Casey stands up sneering.
                         
                          CASEY
           Was it something I said ?
                          SONDRA
           You are an asshole !
                         
                          BOB
           You know, guys... A little humanity...
                         
                          BUCK
          Talking to Bill.
           Funny... Oh, fucking laugh !...We're entertaining the shit out
           of you, aren't we ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           Why don't you stop feeling responsible for everyone.
                         
                          BUCK
           Would you stop wound-licking, Sondra.
                         
                          SONDRA
          She seems a bit shocked.
           Oh ! That's very nice !
                         
                          BOB
           Buck ?
                         
                          BUCK
           I lost my wife... and daughter... And it just can't seem to
           pass... All right ?
                         
                          BILL
           Very sorry. How did they die ?
                         
                          BUCK
           They say...
          He starts crying.
           ... I... I can't talk about it...
                         
          Sondra turns her head away : she looks disturbed and moved. Clark
          wipes his eyes.
                         
                          BOB
           Casey ?
                         
                          CASEY
          He talks in articulating his words in an affected manner.
           I am Casey Heinz. I am a painter. I live in a loft
           downtown, and I guess... you could say... I'm alienated...
          At the end of his reply, he seems to be ready to cry. He puts his
          head in his hands, then shows his laughing face.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Can't you ever be serious ?...
                         
                          BUCK
           Does a bear poop in the woods ? I sit next to Clark
                         
          He moves to sit behind Clark. He lights a cigarette.
                         
                          CLARK
           And then smoke up a storm. My name is Clark. I'm a lawyer.
           And I... I have a compulsive obsessive disorder.
                         
                          CASEY
           So what's the problem ?
          He sneers.
                         
                          CLARK
           The problem is that if you and Buck are going to smoke in
           here, then the door to Doctor Moore's office must remain
           opened in minimum of fifteen inches.
                         
          Buck comes and sits next to Casey. They smoke together.
                         
                          SONDRA
           I can't stand smoke... OK ?
                         
          Buck and Casey puff clouds of smoke.
                         
                          CLARK
           And I would also like to suggest that you buy one of those
           ashtrays...
                         
                          SONDRA
           How come you don't listen to Clark ? How come you don't do
           anything about this, Bob ?
                         
                          CLARK
           ... that sucks up the smoke and purifies it. They cost nine
           dollars and ninety-nine cents, half of which is four-
           ninety-nine point five.
                         
                          CASEY
                         HE LAUGHS
           He's going to open the door.
                         
                          CLARK
           One of you will have to pay an extra penny, but I'm sure
           you can work that out.
                          CASEY
           He's going to open the door.
                         
                          CLARK
           I'm going to open the door.
                         
          General laugh. Several incomprehensible words. We understand only
          Sondra's next reply.
                         
                          SONDRA
           You smell like an ashtray.
                         
                          CLARK
           You know, if you don't act more seriously in groups.
                         
          Richie enters the room.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Hi, Richie !
                         
                          BUCK
           He's back.
                         
                          CASEY
           He's back.
                         
                          BUCK
           Next time you get snot on the doorknob...
                         
                          SONDRA
           Come sit down here.
                         
                          BOB
           Bill... What would you like to tell us about yourself ?
                         
          Richie walks behind Bill to reach his seat.
                         
                          BILL
           Well... I have plenty of problems... the biggest of which right
           now is jet-lag. So I think I'll pass for now, Bob.
                         
                          BOB
           Fair enough...
                         
          BOB' OFFICE - MEETING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          The end of the preceding scene fades in the beginning of this one.
          We are now later in the same day. Night has come. The atmosphere
          seems more relax. Buck is half lying on a sofa. Sondra is
          finishing her story with a sweet voice, and does not simper
          anymore.
                         
                          SONDRA
           ...She's like a daughter to me... We hang out... Meaning that...
           It's wonderful...
                         
                          BOB
          He looks at this watch.
           Well, that's all for tonight. I'll see you all next week...
                          BUCK
           Way to go.
                         
          Bob gets up very quickly. Everyone does like him, but more slowly.
          Bob turns back before he leaves the room.
                         
                          BOB
           Bill... I'll be with you in a couple of minutes.
          Bill nods in agreement.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Bye...
                         
                          BUCK
           Coffee, anyone?
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah.
                         
                          CLARK
          He whispers.
           Nine.
                         
          Bill remains seated and nods to the people getting out. Clark
          remains, behind Bill, in front of the shelves. He puts something
          back in a plastic bag and mumbles something we don't understand.
          Bill turns toward him.
                         
                          CLARK
           Have you read Bob's book ?
                         
                          BILL
           No, I haven't.
                         
                          CLARK
          He puts the bag in the pocket of this jacket, and takes a book on
          a shelf. He gives it to Bill.
           It's really... it's quite excellent.
                         
                          BILL
           "Way to go"... I'm glad to hear you liked it.
                         
                          CLARK
          He wipes his hand with a white handkerchief, wipes the handle of
          his black leather case before taking it, and then puts the
          handkerchief in the pocket of his pants.
           Very much. Good night, Doctor Capa.
                         
                          BILL
          Bill holds his hand out, but Clark does not take it. He just nods
          in a friendly way and goes out.
           Good night.
          Alone, Bill flips through the books.
                         
          IN FRONT OF BOB'S OFFICE BUILDING - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Bill and Bob come out of the building where Bob's office is
          located. Bob has his jacket on and Bob is wearing a brown leather
          jacket. He is carrying his traveling bags.
                          BILL
           Alone at last !...
                         
                          BOB
           Are you OK ?
                         
                          BILL
           Well, nobody jumped out of the window. So maybe I am making
           progress...
                         
          BOB'S CAR - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Bob's expensive convertible Mercedes starts away. On the back
          license plate, we can read «WAY TO GO». The roof of the car is
          open. The rest of the scene takes place inside the car driving
          through Los Angeles.
                         
                          BOB
           You want to get a drink ?
                         
                          BILL
           Hu-hu !
                         
                          BOB
           You want to get laid ?
                         
                          BILL
          He laughs.
           No !
                         
                          BOB
           So what do you think of my little group ?
                         
                          BILL
           What's Buck's story ?
                         
                          BOB
           You mean, how did he loose his wife and kid. I don't know
           yet. He's not talking yet... Either !
                         
                          BILL
           How about Casey ?
                         
                          BOB
           You tell me !
                         
                          BILL
           Well... I smell money... Lots of it... Maybe an abusive father...
           How am I doing so far ?
                         
                          BOB
           A Plus !
                         
                          BILL
           Daddy pays for the expensive loft downtown, and the very
           expensive artistic life style, as long a junior stays in
           therapy.
                         
                          BOB
           You got the hair on the back of my neck standing up !
                         
                          BILL
           Yes, I'm a psychic when it comes to masochists. Five'll get
           you ten he likes to whack now and then.
                         
                          BOB
           Where did you get that from ?
                         
                          BILL
           I was born with it. Like a tuning fork.
                         
                          BOB
           What about Richie ?
                         
                          BILL
           Genuine nut-case.
                         
                          BOB
           Dangerous ?
                         
                          BILL
           Volatile ! Don't fuck with a trapped rat !
                         
                          BOB
           Oh, I see. "Trapped rat" syndrome with a recommendation of
           a "Non fuck with" therapy !
          Bill laughs.
           Well, can I quote you on that ?
                         
          They have reached a quieter road.
                         
                          BILL
           Yes, you may. Takes notes, there'll be a pop-quiz later !...
                         
                          BOB
           OK, I'm ready.
                         
          Bob turns on his left to enter his residence.
                         
                          BILL
           All right, if I diagnose a schizophrenia, what do you
           recommend ?
                         
                          BOB
           Don't fuck with it !
                         
                          BILL
           Now, you got it.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          A huge sliding metallic door, with spikes on the top, moves
          smoothly to let the car enter. Bill seems impressed by the
          residence of his friend. He looks at the security camera. Bob
          stops the car and they get out of it. Bill takes his luggage.
                         
                          BILL
           It's all one place ?...
          They come near a door shaped like a giant keyhole.
           Goddamn...
          A metallic gate slides behind the door to let them in.
           Like peeking through a keyhole...
          They get down a few steps and reach a lawn.
           You get a very limited... view of the truth....
                         
                          BOB
           What's that ?
                         
          Bill looks with admiration at the pool, and at the huge and
          impressive house, very Hollywood-like.
                         
                          BILL
           "Way to go" must have gone really well !
                         
                          BOB
           Yeah !
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          They enter the house. A beep is heard when Bob opens the door.
                          BOB
           After you, wise guy... Come on.
          Bill laughs.
                         
                          BILL
           Oh, men...
          He laughs, looking at the luxury that surrounds him. The best and
          the most expensive in modern furniture. Large expensive paintings
          hanged on the walls. Leather armchairs. Bob types a secret code on
          a keyboard. Then he switch on a small TV set that shows the
          pictures from all the security cameras.
           So, how are we as we approach forty ?
                         
                          BOB
           We are in a good shape. Really good shape. We finally got
           divorced. We have some money...
          He puts back in place a painting that was slightly crooked.
           ... We're meticulous.
                         
                          BILL
          He takes off his jacket.
           I don't detect a woman's touch.
                         
                          BOB
           We have a little friend... You'll meet her.
                         
                          BILL
           She's too young for you.
                         
                          BOB
           Ohh !
                         
                          BILL
          He sits behind the bar.
           Always get the clichés and you won't be disappointed.
                         
                          BOB
           This woman is not a cliché.
          He has taken two bottle of beer from the fridge and he gives one
          to Bill.
                         
                          BILL
           Thanks...
          They clink the two bottle and drink the beer from the bottle.
           Good to see you, Bob !
                         
                          BOB
           You too !... So...
          Bill plays with a «piece of art», consisting of an assembly of
          square pieces of glass glued together into a larger square. The
          object can pivot on his stand and, when you look through it, you
          get a distorted view of whatever is behind it.
           You're ready yet ?
                         
                          BILL
           Ready to what ?
          We see the distorted face of Bill through the «piece of art», or
          rather several distorted view of Bill's face seen through each of
          the individual square of glass. Bob pivot the object to have a
          better view of his friend.
           So hard to talk about... So hard to talk about...
          Bill pivot the object again to hide behind it.
           I's just a game... dumb, deceitful game. So I quit my
           practice.
          He gets up.
                         
                          BOB
           Lost you religion, huh ?
                         
                          BILL
          He takes a big book on a shelf. There is a picture of Sigmund
          Freud on the cover.
           Well, I certainly lost my belief in the scriptures.
          He puts the book back, and with his hand, makes a masturbation
          gesture.
                         
                          BOB
           I'm sorry, buddy. You gonna be in a lot of pain.
                         
                          BILL
           There is a distinctive absence of pain. I... I cannot feel
           the pain that I know that I'm supposed to be feeling right
           now. And I think I'm going crazy...
          We feel that Bill is ready to cry.
           I'm lost, man, I think I'm going crazy.
          He has tears in his eyes.
                         
                          BOB
           You may be... Your mind may be shot...
                         
          COUNTRYSIDE - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          In front of Bob's residence. The sun is shining. Bill is wearing a
          brown tank top and white jogging pants. Bob is wearing a blue
          cyclist shirt and black pants. They're both wearing caps. They are
          ready to go cycling. We hear the voice over of Bob, finishing the
          sentence from the preceding scene.
                          BOB
           ... but I hope your body isn't.
                         
                          BILL
           Do I get to warm up ?
                         
                          BOB
           Yeah !... Two mile any pace you like. And then...
          They mount their bicycles.
           ... let's do ten.
                         
          They are now on the road in front of Bob's residence.
                         
                          BILL
           Ten ?
                         
                          BOB
           Too much for you, huh ?
                         
                          BILL
           I dunno... I was thinking of maybe twenty.
          He starts full speed.
           They are now on a minor dirt road. We can see Bob's house in the
          background.
                         
                          BOB
           Gees ! Billy ! You'll never change... Why don't we just drop
           our pants to see who's got the bigger dick, and then we can
           go back and have a nice civilized breakfast ?
                         
                          BILL
           Wouldn't be civilized...
                         
                          BOB
           Why ?
                         
                          BILL
           You'll be sulking !
                         
                          BOB
          They are going uphill.
           You don't have hills in New-York...
          He slows down.
           Hang on a second... Hang on a second... Hang on a second...
          Bob stops and dismounts his bike.
                         
                          BILL
           What ?
                         
                          BOB
           What was that ?... What the hell was that ?...
                         
          Bill dismounts his bike. Bob gets his bike upside down and sets it
          upright standing on the saddle and the handlebar. He checks the
          chain. Bill is leaning on his bike.
                         
                          BILL
           What are you afraid of ?
                          BOB
           I got a gear slip, here somewhere...
                         
                          BILL
           That's not what I meant... What with the security systems,
           the security gates, looking over your shoulder.
                         
                          BOB
           I've been getting some threats.
                         
                          BILL
           What do you mean ?... Death threats ?
                         
                          BOB
           Pretty sure it's somebody in the Monday night group, I just
           don't know who...
                         
                          BILL
           Monday night as in last night ?
                         
                          BOB
           Yeah !... I was hoping that maybe with your tuning fork that
           you might have a hunch.
                         
                          BILL
           No... No hunch, Bob. What make you think it's somebody in the
           group ?
                         
          Bob spins the pedals to check the chain.
                         
                          BOB
           Only about a dozen things... I's been going on for a couple
           of months now. It's funny how it gets you after a while.
                         
                          BILL
           Call the cops ?...
                         
                          BOB
          He puts his bike back on the wheels.
           Yeah ! They say if they had to protect every shrink in
           L.A., they'll need an army ! But that I should call them if
           anything happened.
                         
          They put their sunglasses on.
                         
                          BILL
          He laughs.
           That makes sense.
                         
                          BOB
           Yeah ! Probably, it'll just blow over.
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah !
                         
                          BOB
           How about you ?
                         
                          BILL
           About me... what ?
          We see them going very fast on the minor dirt road. A horse rider
          rides near them.
           What would you give a suicidal patient that's got
           everything ?
          They ride even faster while clowning, like riding on the back
          wheel.
                         
                          BOB
           Parachute, I heard it already.
                         
                          BILL
           Out here already, huh ?
                         
                          BOB
           Come on, old timer !...
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          The heavy metal door is sliding away. Bob and Bill are getting in.
          They dismount their bikes with some difficulty. They drop their
          bikes on the ground.
                          BILL
           Oh, shit ! You may have to... You may have to carry me in.
                         
          They hold each other by the waist and the shoulders.
                         
                          BOB
           You know you lose a lot more gracefully than you used to...
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah ! Well, you know... Practice and all... Hey ! How about
           that : "Learning to loose" by Doctor Bill Capa !
                         
          A beep and the second gate gets open.
                         
                          BOB
           Got a ring to it !
                         
                          BILL
           They are making those seats smaller, huh ? Whoo !
                         
          They enter the residence. Bill is massaging his buttocks.
                         
          BOB'S OFFICE - BOB'S WORKROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Short low angle shot of the whole building, before entering Bob's
          workroom. Bob's desk is decorated with two wrought iron eagles.
          Bob is wearing jacket and necktie. He is just finishing a session
          with a patient.
                         
                          BOB
           See you next week. All right ?
                         
          He escorts his patient to the door. Enter Barbara, Bob's
          secretary.
                         
                          BARBARA
           I'm going now. You want me to lock on the way out ?
                          BOB
           That'll be great, Barbara.
                         
          She gets out. Bob takes his jacket off and sets it on a clothes
          valet. He then stops by the shelves behind his desk and starts the
          music : a concerto for piano and orchestra. He sits behind his
          desk, and starts writing in a large notebook. He hears a strange
          noise, and raises his head. He puts his pen down, open a drawer
          and takes his revolver out. A draught flips the pages of his
          notebook. He seems to feel better, puts the revolver back and
          closes the drawer. Then he closes the notebook, takes it and goes
          to the shelves. He seems to be looking for something, and feels
          worried not to find it. He gets out of his workroom.
                         
          BOB'S OFFICE - MEETING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          He enters the meeting room and goes directly to the shelves. He
          looks around and takes an art book about Van Gogh. He checks that
          the size of the art book and the size of his notebook are similar.
          He takes off the dustcover of the art book and puts it on his
          notebook, puts his notebook on the shelf where the art book was
          and puts the art book in the bottom of the shelves. A shadow moves
          on the shelves and a strange noise is heard. Bob, a bit nervous,
          goes to the door and opens it. The classical music stops. Through
          the open door, we can see Bob opening the door of his workroom.
                         
                          BOB
           Barbara ?...
                         
          He comes back into the meeting room. When he enters the room, the
          light is suddenly switched off. He crosses the meeting room. We
          can hear someone chuckling, and we can see a shadow through the
          glass on the door.
                         
          BOB'S OFFICE - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Bobs gets rapidly out of the meeting room. A man, completely
          covered in black leather, jumps through a large ground glass
          paneI, and jumps on Bob's back. Short fight on the floor. Bob gets
          up, bumps into the drinking fountain which falls on the floor, and
          falls down.
           Close-up of the mysterious man's hand. It is covered with a
          glove. The hand closes itself and a long blade appears on the top
          of the hand. Bob gets up and is stabbed in the chest. He staggers
          a bit, takes a blue vase on a table and tries to hit the head of
          the mysterious man. He misses and the vase crashes on the wall. He
          is stabbed again in the chest. His staggering increases. He turns
          around and the man stabs him several time in the back. He stumbles
          to the front door. Another stab in the back. The man grabs him by
          his hair to bring him back into the workroom.
                         
                          BOB
           No... Nooooo !... Why ?
                         
          The man stabs him several times. Bob is covered with blood. He
          falls on a glass door. The glass is shattered. Bob falls on his
          back. A big piece of glass goes through him and comes out of his
          stomach. Through the window, we can see an helicopter flying over
          Los Angeles.
          MAIN POLICE STATION - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          A car has just stopped in front of the building. The blue
          revolving light keeps on moving on top of the car. An helicopter
          is flying above the building. It could be the same that is seen at
          the end of the preceding scene. Officer Anderson goes around the
          car and opens the door for Bill. Bill is wearing a T-shirt, a
          light sweater and jeans. One can tell he had to dress quickly.
          Bills gets out of the car, and the car moves away. Anderson takes
          Bill into the building.
                         
          MAIN POLICE STATION - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Classical setup of a californian police station. The various rooms
          are separated with glass partitions. An officer enters pushing, in
          front of him, a hooker dressed with a minimum of very flashy
          clothes.
                         
           VOICE OF A POLICE WOMAN
           Have you thought about...
                          THE HOOKER
           Man, I didn't do nothing. Oh, please... You know, you're very
           cute. I love you.
                         
           THE POLICE OFFICER
           I love you too !
                         
          Anderson leads Bill into a room and leaves him there. Bill sits
          down. Enters lieutenant Hector Martinez. He is wearing a pink
          shirt with short sleeves. His tie is badly knotted on an open
          collar. He has a police badge fixed on his belt. He holds a file
          in his hand.
                         
                          HECTOR
           You're Capa ?
                         
                          BILL
           Yes, I'm Doctor Capa.
                         
                          HECTOR
          He closes the door, puts his file on the desk and sits down behind
          the desk.
           You're here because of the dead doctor ?
                         
                          BILL
           Yes...
                         
                          HECTOR
           I read something about sessions on Mondays. Tell me about
           this Monday group.
                         
                          BILL
           There's five patients in the group. I Can't really remember
           their names right now.
                         
                          HECTOR
          He taps his head with his right hand, a gesture meaning mental
          illness. He has a telephone number scribbled on the palm of his
          hand.
           Like five cuckoos.
                         
                          BILL
           No. Four neurotics of varying degrees and one killer. At
           least, that's what Bob thought.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Bob Moore ?
                         
                          BILL
           Good. Yes, Bob Moore.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Four men and one woman.
                         
                          BILL
           Right.
                         
                          HECTOR
           And you sat in one of these sessions, right ?
                          BILL
           Yes, I did.
                         
                          HECTOR
           So, who did it ?
          Anderson enters the room behind Bill, carrying a plastic cup.
           Hey-hey-hey-hey... ! Anderson ! This is civilization, man.
           What do think this is ?... Your bedroom ?...
          Anderson gives Bill the cup.
           Damn... Knock... Knock... Don't... don't come into my office like
           that, bro. Hey !
          Anderson leaves the room and closes the door.
           It's third world thing !... Where were we ?...
                         
                          BILL
          He blows on the cup.
           You were probing me about the patients. And I was about to
           tell you that I really can't help you at all. I don't
           really know any of these people.
                         
                          HECTOR
           But you're a professional like me. You gotta have some kind
           of suspicion.
                         
                          BILL
           I really don't have a clue. I'd like to help you, but even
           if I could, there is an issue of confidentiality.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Confidentiality ?...
                         
                          BILL
           Yes.
                         
                          HECTOR
          He laughs and gets up.
           You're talking to me about an issue of confidentiality.
                          BILL
           Similar to the Miranda oath.
                         
                          HECTOR
          He sits down on the desk, facing Bill.
           If a friend of mine got killed, and the only thing between
           the killer and me was Miranda, you know what I will do ?...
           Huh ?... Fuck Miranda up the ass. But don't tell anybody,
           because it's a matter of confidentiality... Shhh !...
                         
          He puts a finger on his lips.
                         
                          BILL
           Oh, look ! I'm sorry I can't help you. I've only been in
           Los Angeles four days.
                         
                          HECTOR
           You're sleeping at that... dead guy's house, aren't you ?
                         
                          BILL
           Yes.
                          HECTOR
           Maybe something will come to you in the night, you know,
           like dreams and shit. But... what happens to patients in a
           situation like this ?
                         
                          BILL
           Usually a colleague will offer to take over the group...
           continue the treatment.
                         
                          HECTOR
          He gets up. We see his pistol hooked on the back of his belt.
           How sweet !... How sweet !... It's like one of the vultures
           dies and then the others step in line and eat his portion.
          He mimes vultures walking.
           Is that what you're planning ?
                         
                          BILL
           No.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Why not ?
                         
                          BILL
           Because I really can't handle that right now.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Sure you can !... Come on !... You've been a week in L.A. and
           you already have you own private screwing farm.
          He sits back on the edge of the desk.
           How bad can that be ?... That's a great career move.... Where
           were you at the time of the killing, Capa ?
                         
                          BILL
          He pauses before answering.
           I was at his house, Bob's house.
                         
                          HECTOR
           You had to think about that ?
                          BILL
           Jesus Christ !... Are you going to arrest me, Lieutenant
           Martinez ?
                         
                          HECTOR
           Hey ! You want a lawyer ?
                         
                          BILL
           Do I need a lawyer ?
                         
                          HECTOR
           You're in L.A. Everybody needs a lawyer.
          He goes back to his seat behind the desk, and conspicuously shows
          his back to Bill.
           All right !... You can go home now, take a shower.
          He turns back to Bill.
           And keep your mouth shut. The only thing that I got going
           for me is that few people know what happened, and I don't
           want the press fucking things up.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - INTERIOR NIGHT
          Bill plays with the «piece of art» made of pieces of glass. He
          pivots it. We can see Bill's face duplicated by the object. We
          then see Bill putting back in place the same crooked painting that
          Bob had been putting back in place the first time Bill was in the
          house. Then we see him walking pensively around the house.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          A corridor. We hear the buzz of an intercom. Bill comes out of the
          bathroom, dressed in a white bathrobe. He is drying his hair with
          a towel.
                         
                          BILL
           All right !... All right !... Hold on !
                         
          He walks in the corridor, looking for the buzzer. He arrives into
          the main hall, near the video security device. On the wall near
          the TV set, two large paintings showing enlarged footprints. On
          the screen, we see Hector's face.
                         
                          BILL
           Oh shit !
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - MAIN GATE - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Hector is waiting in front of the gate. He is wearing a grey
          shirt, a beige blazer and a necktie, and a police badge on his
          belt. Next to him is Bob's car. Behind him, a uniformed police
          officer. Hector presses the bell. We hear a beep.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - HALL - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          We see and hear Hector via the TV set.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Capa !... Capa !... Are you there ?
          Bill takes the remote control.
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah...
                         
                          HECTOR
           How is it going ?
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - MAIN GATE - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          We hear Bill's voice in the intercom.
                         
                          BILL
           What do you want ?
                         
                          HECTOR
           I brought the victim's car back and I got to search the
           house.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - HALL - INTERIOR DAY
                         
                          BILL
           You got a search warrant ?
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - MAIN GATE - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
                          HECTOR
           What is it with you ? Don't you want me to find out who
           killed your friend ?... No, I don't have a warrant.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - HALL - INTERIOR DAY
                         
                          BILL
           All right... Come on in...
                         
                          HECTOR
           Open the gate.
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah... Right... How's that ?
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - MAIN GATE - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Hector waits a little, then gets sprayed by a sprinkler located
          outside the screen-field.
                         
                          HECTOR
           You got the sprinklers on !
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - HALL - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          We hears the end of Hector's sentence.
                         
                          BILL
           How about that ?
                         
          Bill taps on the remote control. We hear a beep. On the TV set, we
          see Hector taking his jacket off.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
          Hector is searching the shelves on the wall. He quickly looks
          through the books, takes a step back, then thrusts his hand behind
          a row of books, and grabs a photo album. While flipping through
          the pages, he goes to the sofa and sits next to Bill. Bill is
          wearing a white shirt and a pair of jeans. Hector goes on turning
          the pages, and stop on a page with the picture of supine naked
          woman.
                         
                          BILL
           Jill... his wife... his ex-wife...
                         
                          HECTOR
           Nice bush !
                         
          Bill closes the album, takes it from Hector's hands and gets up.
          He turns to look at Hector.
                         
                          BILL
           I'll tell you said so...
          He walks to the shelves and put the album back where it was found.
          He looks at Hector.
           I'm sure it will mean a lot to her...
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Close-up of the head of the bed. It is decorated with wooden
          sculpture of women's faces. Hector enters the room, followed by
          Bill. He goes to the bed and strokes the sculptures.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Check this fucking bed !
          He goes around the bed and sits next to the sculpture, which he
          keeps on fondling.
           Damn !... Everybody is having fun but me, goddammit !
          Hector opens a drawer, and takes a revolver out of it. He holds it
          with his pen stuck into the trigger ring.
                         
                          BILL
           I do not like guns.
                         
          Hector puts the revolver back in the drawer.
                         
                          HECTOR
           You prefer knives ?
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bill and Hector are getting out of the house.
                         
                          HECTOR
           I need you to do me a favor.
                         
                          BILL
           What's that ?
                         
          They are crossing the garden. Hector is still in shirtsleeves and
          has some papers in his hand.
                         
                          HECTOR
           I want you to tell the group about Moore's death.
                         
                          BILL
           Me ?...
                         
                          HECTOR
           Yes.
                         
                          BILL
           Why ?
                         
                          HECTOR
           Well, maybe one of them won't come in, or maybe they will
           all come in, but then you would be able to spot something
           wrong.
                         
                          BILL
           I just can't handle it right now... OK ?...
                         
                          HECTOR
           I just had all the mess in his office cleaned up. Don't you
           want to help me find the killer ? Have a heart.
                          BILL
           What does that mean?
                         
                          HECTOR
           If you don't tell them, I'll have to tell them. Am I the
           person to break the news to these people ? « Listen up, you
           fucking daffodils, your shrink is dead.
          They have reached the main gate. Hector gets out and Bill presses
          a switch. The gate starts sliding between him and Hector.
           Which means that all the time, effort and love you put in
           this relationship is wasted. You've got to remain as fucked
           up as you are or get worse. »
                         
                          BILL
           You are one sinister piece of work. All right, I'll do it.
                         
                          HECTOR
           It's better if you do it.
                         
          A ROAD - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          We are in Bob's car, with the roof open. Bill is wearing a green
          polo shirt, jeans and sunglasses. He is on the phone, while he
          drives the car, but he drives slowly.
                         
                          BILL
           No, you listen to me. You don't understand, Gene. Don't
           lie, just give the family what it wants... No... No, you don't
           understand.
          We see Bill from the back. In the rear-view mirror of the car, we
          see another convertible vehicle approaching with also its roof
          open. A young girl is driving. She comes a bit too fast and bumps
          into the back of Bill's car. Bill jumps and stops his car.
           I have to call you back. Christ !
          He puts the telephone back on his hook and gets out of the car. He
          goes to Rose's car. She is leaning on the steering wheel.
           Hey !... You're right ?... Hey !...
          He opens the door. She stands back. She is wearing a large beige
          sweater.
                         
                          ROSE
           Why me ?... Hi !... I'm Rose.
                         
                          BILL
           Hi, Rose !... I't nice to run into me like this !... I'm Bill
           Capa...
                         
          He goes away from the car.
                         
                          ROSE
           I got no insurance...
          She gets out of her car.
           I know it's against the law and everything.
          She goes around her car, and looks at the damage.
           Don't bust my chops. I'll bring the money to you, if you
           just get an estimate.
          She stoops, picks up a piece of red plastic and gives it to Bill.
           OK ?... Just give me a break !
                          BILL
           Got a pen ?
                         
          Rose goes to her car and Bill throws the piece of red plastic
          away. Rose gets into her car, looks into her purse, and takes a
          small notebook and a pen. Bill takes them but hesitates before
          writing. Rose smiles mockingly.
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh, poor old brain can't remember its own phone number.
                         
                          BILL
           I just moved here... From New York... I wrote my address down,
           because I am not sure about this number, and how long I
           gonna be there, so maybe you can call me sometimes for the
           next couple of days.
                         
                          ROSE
           I will.
                         
                          BILL
           Bye !
                         
          He goes away from the car.
                         
                          ROSE
           Hey !... Don't you want my address ?
                         
          Bill gets into his car.
                         
                          BILL
           You could lie.
                         
          He starts his car.
                         
          BOB'S OFFICE - WORKROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Bill skip through the pages of a large notebook, looking exactly
          like the one Bob had hidden under a Van Gogh dustcover just before
          he got killed. He puts his back on the two other ones, already
          lying on the desk. He is wearing a grey T-shirt and an open denim
          shirt.
                         
          BOB'S OFFICE - MEETING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Bill enters the room, coming from the workroom.
                         
                          BILL
           Hi !... Who hasn't arrived yet ?
                         
                          BUCK
          He is standing up. He is wearing a white T-shirt and a grey
          sweater with a V-shaped collar.
           Sondra... Where's Bob ?
                         
                          RICHIE
          He is wearing a grey sport jacket with a zipper and a striped T-
          shirt.
           Wha... What's wrong ?
                          BILL
           If it's all right, I'd rather wait till you're all here.
           She's always this late ?
                         
                          CLARK
          He is wearing a dark suit, very elegant. He is wiping his hand
          with a handkerchief.
           Depends on who is banging her...
                         
                          SONDRA
          She enters very rapidly through the corridor door. She seems very
          happy. She drops on the armchair next to Casey. She is wearing an
          very close-fitting overall, which is generously open on her
          throat. The top of the overall is very colorful and the bottom is
          black. On top of it, she is wearing a pink sport jacket.
           Oh, I'm sorry... Class was really, really really late.
                         
                          CASEY
          He is sitting in an armchair. He is wearing an grey collarless
          shirt and a black sleeveless vest.
           Was class was that, Sondra ? Advanced cunnilingus for the
           single woman, or a CPR for pleasure and game ?
                         
                          BUCK
           Christ, don't excite her !...
                         
                          SONDRA
           Where is Doctor Moore ?
                         
                          BILL
           There's something I want to tell you.
                         
                          RICHIE & CASEY
           What ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           What's the matter ?
                          CASEY
           Shhhh !...
                         
                          SONDRA
           I'm trying to pay attention... Shhh !
                         
                          BILL
           You should prepare yourself for bad news...
                         
                          SONDRA
           Why ?...
                         
                          BILL
           Bob's been killed.
                         
                          SONDRA
          Her face is distorted by the pain. She puts her hand in front of
          her mouth.
           Ohhhh !
                         
                          CASEY
           What are you saying ?... What are you telling me ?
                          BILL
           He was murdered.
                         
                          CASEY
           Sondra !...
                         
                          BILL
           He was locking up here late Friday night.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Here ?...
                         
                          BILL
           Yes, right here in the office.
                         
                          BUCK
           Was he shot... stabbed... beaten ?... Have they got a suspect... a
           motive ? Three days go by, and you don't call us.
                         
                          BILL
           It was easier if you were here together.
                         
                          CASEY
          He stands up.
           Oh, I see. So, even Bob's death is group therapy. That's
           great. Hey, Bob, thanks for giving us a chance to grieve
           together. Shit !...
          He gets more and more angry through the preceding reply.
                         
                          BUCK
          He has become very nervous too.
           What the fuck is going on here ? I need to know more.
                         
                          BILL
           He was stabbed to death.
                         
                          CLARK
           How many times was he stabbed ?
                         
                          SONDRA
          She jumps up. She goes to Clark and hits him.
           This man was Bob's best friend. Do you really needed exact
           numbers now ?
                         
                          BILL
          He takes Sondra very gently by the shoulders and brings her back
          to her seat.
           Sondra... Sondra... Sondra... Sondra...
                         
                          SONDRA
           Get your fucking hands off me...
                         
                          BILL
           It's OK... It's OK !
                         
                          CASEY
           It doesn't make sense to me...
                         
                          BILL
           Many times, Clark... More than thirty... It's all I can tell
           you...
                         
                          CASEY
           It wasn't a thief, I can tell you that right now.
                         
                          CLARK
           I agree.
                         
                          CASEY
          He is still very nervous.
           I mean, why stab a guy thirty times ?... Bob !... He'd piss in
           his pants if you showed him a knife, you know that...
                         
                          SONDRA
          She is crying.
           What are you saying ?
                         
                          CASEY
           I'm saying, Sondra, that you really, really have to hate a
           person to stab him that many times. You're a shrink,
           right ? You know what kind of power people hand over a
           shrink. Or maybe sometimes, they hand even more than they
           want to.
                         
                          CLARK
           That is absolutely correct... A thief would not stick around
           and stab someone thirty times.
                         
                          BUCK
          He sits down.
           Since when did you become such an expert on robbery ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           It's not the robbery he's an expert on, it's the rage.
                         
                          RICHIE
          He has seated himself behind Sondra and puts his hand on her
          shoulder.
           What... what are we gonna do now ? I mean u...us, th...the
           group ?
                         
                          CASEY
           I bet Doctor Capa has an idea...
                         
                          BUCK
           What does he mean ?
                         
          Casey hits his forehead. Buck is almost crying.
                         
                          BILL
          He sits down.
           I think Casey is suggesting that I... may have some plans to
           replace Bob...
          Casey sits down.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Maybe you should.
                         
                          BILL
           No... I can't do that... Not right now...
                         
                          SONDRA
           Why ?...
                         
                          BILL
           One reason is that I am more screwed up than you people
           are.
                         
                          CASEY
           I was just being obnoxious, and loud before. Anybody has a
           fucking Xanax ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           I have a librium...
                         
                          BUCK
           Stop with the drugs.
                         
                          CASEY
           It would be a good idea if you stayed.
                         
                          BUCK
           Bob isn't cold yet ?
                         
                          CASEY
           I mean, there'll be some connections. Right ?...
                         
                          SONDRA
          She gets up and sits down in front of Bill. She takes the cushion
          which was on the armchair and hugs it.
           You were Bob's best friend... You... you seem kind of like him...
           I'll be so much easier to trust you.
                         
                          BILL
          During the following reply, Richie comes and sits behind Sondra.
           I know what kind of force a group can become in your life...
           You tell things here... intimate things that... you wouldn't
           tell your best friend. I'm very flattered that you would...
          He stops. He seems ready to cry.
           But the truth is : You are the people that make this work.
           I would be more than happy to try to find someone for you
           to continue this, but I cannot help you.
                         
                          CLARK
           If my opinion counts for anything, I would like to ask :
           why it is you feel so inadequate for the task.
                         
          Buck comes and sits next to Clark.
                         
                          BUCK
           Maybe he just don't like us.
                         
                          BILL
           No, that's not it, Buck.
                         
                          BUCK
           Why don't you step on something?
                         
                          CLARK
           You stop.
                         
                          BILL
           Six weeks ago, I spoke harshly to a patient. And she
           committed suicide... Right in front of me.
          Clark puts his handkerchief on his lips.
           Perhaps she would have done this, anyway. That's what my
           colleagues say... But I don't know...
                         
                          SONDRA
           Oh, I'm sorry.
                         
                          BILL
          He is crying with big tears.
           And my patient... Her name was Michelle... She jumped out... of a
           window in my office... Ohh... So much blood... And so red... And in
           right time, before my eyes... the red just disappeared... it's
           turned to grey... So I don't see... red now... Then I failed... so
           I can't help you... I don't think that you want someone like
           me around right now...
                         
          Clark wipes his face again with his handkerchief. He seems to be
          extremely moved.
                         
                          BUCK
           I think I do.
                         
                          RICHIE
           M... me too.
                         
                          CASEY
           Why don't you give us a try for a month.
                         
                          CLARK
           Listen, if you need anything, any free legal advice, to
           help you wrap up Bob's affair, please don't hesitate to
           call me. I'm not with anyone right now. I'll be more than
           happy to help you in anyway.
          Clark gives his business card to Bill, who takes it. Then he gives
          him a kleenex. Bill wipes his eyes.
                         
                          BILL
           Thank you.
                         
          We see, through the window, light-beams crossing in the sky.
                         
          THE WHISKY BAR - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Usual atmosphere of a well-known bar. At a short distance from the
          entrance of the bar, a truck with two floodlights, the beams of
          which are sweeping the sky. Those beams make the connection with
          the preceding scene.
                         
          THE WHISKY BAR - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Quick shot on the very noisy orchestra. A long hair bearded guy is
          playing the drums, a girl is playing the guitar. Bill, dressed
          exactly like in the preceding scene, is looking for someone.
          Eventually he founds him, Hector, who is already seated. Bill sits
          down at Hector's table. Hector is wearing an open dark pink shirt.
                          HECTOR
           You bring me a confession ?
                         
                          BILL
           No.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Well, you win some, you lose some, right Capa ?
                         
                          BILL
           Listen, maybe it was not one of the group
                         
                          HECTOR
           Oh no... he's beginning to like them already. Your friend Bob
           Moore deserves a lot more loyalty than this.
                         
                          BILL
           Hey... Why... Why are we staying here shouting at each other
           for ? What's this place ?
                         
                          HECTOR
           I used to work in narcotics. They used to come here a lot.
           I probably fucked and, or arrested half of these people's
           parents. It's a nice place. I like it.
                         
                          BILL
           Makes sense. Look, I'm sorry I haven't got anything for
           you. I'll see you around.
                         
          Bill gets up and leaves the bar. Hector gets up behind him and
          follows him. They meet back in the street.
                         
          THE WHISKY BAR - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
                          HECTOR
           So, that's it, hey ?
                          BILL
           Yeah.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Anything you want to tell me ?...
                         
          They put back their jackets.
                         
                          BILL
                          NO
                         
           VOICE OF THE CAR VALET
           Yeah, it's a four-door, man !
                         
          Hector and Bill are walking slowly in front of the bar.
                         
                          HECTOR
           So you better shut the group down.
                         
                          BILL
           Who say I hadn't ?
                          HECTOR
           Oh, have you or haven't you ?
                         
                          BILL
           They ask me to take over the group. I couldn't say no.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Ha ! Ha !... I figured... You're gonna do real well in this
           town. Shut the fucker down.
                         
                          BILL
           Stop. You sent me over there.
                         
                          HECTOR
           No, I send you there to convey a piece of bad news...
          A pedestrian bumps into Hector.
           Will you give me a break, will you, man !...
          Hector lays the man on the hood of a car and frisks him.
           I didn't send you there to go trolling for business.
                         
                          BILL
           Come on !
                         
          Hector lets the man go and starts walking again with Bill near the
          bar.
                         
                          HECTOR
           You told me you couldn't handle it.
                         
                          BILL
           Well, it turns out that I handle it now.
                         
                          HECTOR
           You stick you dick in a barrel full of barracudas once.
           Maybe you won't lose it. You leave it in there, it's gonna
           get shewed up at the root.
                         
          They stop walking.
                          BILL
           I appreciate your concern for my dick, Hector, thank you.
                         
                          HECTOR
           I am being really nice, full of concern for your safety, in
           case it's one of them, hey ? Shut it down, OK ?...
                         
                          BILL
           No... I can't do that.
                         
                          HECTOR
          He yells.
           Shut it down, chingada ! Don't be an asshole. You'll find
           another set of wombats to exploit !
                         
                          BILL
           These sudden irrational outbursts, Hector... Did they begin
           in childhood or in puberty?
                         
                          HECTOR
           Get out of my face.
                          BILL
           Am I in your face ? What an interesting choice of words !
           Would you like me in your face ? You're married, Hector ?...
           If you wanna deal with any of these problems, I'll give you
           special rates.
                         
          Bill has moved slightly away from Hector and turns his back to
          him.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Special rates ?... Ha ! ha !... What, like frequent flyer
           miles ?...
          Hector mime something (or someone) crashing on the ground. Then he
          walks around his car.
           Let me ask you something. Are you really color-blind, or is
           that some shit you feed them with so they feel sorry for
           you ?
                         
                          BILL
           No, unfortunately I am color... Did you bug the office ?
                         
                          HECTOR
           Hey, for a shrink, you're pretty fucking dense.
                         
          Hector gets in his car, while the valet is holding the door for
          him. He closes the door and the car moves away, leaving a pensive
          Bill on the sidewalk.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Bill comes to the keyhole shaped door. We can see his car parked
          behind him. He dial a code on a keyboard and the gate opens behind
          the door. He looks cautiously around him before walking further.
          He presses a switch to close the gate.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - INTERIOR NIGHT
          Bill enters the house. It is very dark. He opens a glass door and
          walks slowly, while the door closes behind him. He hesitates a
          moment, then walk more decidedly... and falls heavily on the floor !
          He stands back up with some difficulty, and discovers that the
          whole floor is flooded.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bill enters the kitchen without switching the light on. He takes a
          big butcher's knife in a stand on the table, and looks in the
          corridor.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Bill wades in the flooded corridor. He seems worried and we see
          the knife blade shining. He enters the bathroom, the door of which
          is wide open, and opens the shower stall. A rush of water runs out
          of it. An alarm starts sounding. He goes back into the corridor
          and turns off the garden hose faucet.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - GARDEN - EXTERIOR NIGHT
          The alarm has stopped sounding. Bill is wearing short pants and he
          is emptying a bucket of water on the lawn. Then he spreads a wet
          cloth on the back of a seat. Several other wet clothes are already
          drying.
                         
                          ROSE
           Hello !
                         
                          BILL
           Who's there ?
                         
          We see Rose entering through the keyhole-shaped door.
                         
                          ROSE
           Hi !... Remember me ?... Fender-bender !...
                         
                          BILL
           There she is, a little angel, dancing on the head of a pin.
                         
          Rose gets down the few steps to the garden. She is wearing a light
          flowered summer dress.
                         
                          ROSE
           So... did you get that estimate ?
                         
                          BILL
           No.
                         
                          ROSE
           Waow !... Nice place you got here. It's a little cold... but
           it's kind of tasteful, right ?
                         
                          BILL
           And wet !
                         
                          ROSE
           You too, I guess.
                          BILL
           Cold or tasteful ?
                         
                          ROSE
           So... Are we eating in here, or you take me out ?...
                         
          Bill bursts laughing.
                         
          BIG HOTEL - MAIN HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          We still hear Bill's laugh slowly fading out. We are looking above
          the main hall of a big luxurious hotel. Two attendants are pushing
          a baggage cart. We move with them to the restaurant room. Bill and
          Rose are seated at a table.
                         
                          ROSE
           You can't ? ... At all ?... Waow !...
                         
          BIG HOTEL - RESTAURANT - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Close-up on Rose putting lipstick on.
                          ROSE
           Not even a shade of pink ?... Can't tell me if it's smeared
           or not ?
                         
                          BILL
           I can't tell you if your eyes are bloodshed.
                         
                          ROSE
           Really !... That's sad !... You know what ?... In respect for
           your infirmity, I'm gonna give up wearing lipstick.
          Close-up on Rose putting her lipstick in her glass of water.
           There is something about me that I bet you find a little
           strange. Right ?
                         
          In several shots during this dialogue, we see Bill seated in front
          of a mirror wall and Rose's reflection in the mirror behind Bill's
          back.
                         
                          BILL
           What is that ?
                         
                          ROSE
           Well, I haven't asked you what you do.
                         
                          BILL
           That's right. You showed a remarkable restraint.
                         
                          ROSE
           Well, it's because I'd rather guess. You know, I actually
           get upset if someone tries to tell me before I can... figure
           it out for myself, you know ?
                         
                          BILL
           But what if I am ashamed of what I do.
                         
                          ROSE
           Why... Why should you be ashamed of being a shrink.
                          BILL
           Who told you I was a shrink ?
                         
                          ROSE
           Well... Are you ?
                         
                          BILL
           How did you know ?
                         
                          ROSE
           The way you looked at me, you know ?
                         
                          BILL
           How I look at you ?
                         
                          ROSE
           You... you have this kindness in your eyes. But I think
           you're using it to keep me away. You know, you're trying to
           play safe. You're trying to think of a case instead of
           thinking of a female.
                         
                          BILL
           So, you have a tuning fork too.
                         
                          ROSE
           I guess we have a lot in common.
                         
                          BILL
           We seem to be playing the same game.
                         
                          ROSE
           Why do you say I'm playing a game?
                         
                          BILL
           Because you're the fantasy girl, aren't you? Quicksilver?
           The face glimpsed across a crowded room?
                         
                          ROSE
           Yeah, that's... That's exactly what I am.
                         
                          BILL
           You'll be whatever they want you to be... no substance, no
           rules. Light as air. So your feet never have to touch those
           burning hot coals the rest of us walk around on.
                         
                          ROSE
           Yeah. Sort of like... not seeing red?
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah, sort of like that.
                         
          BIG HOTEL - MAIN HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          The main hall seen from above. Bill is crossing the hall with Rose
          holding his arm.
                         
                          ROSE
           I was afraid during dinner that you had taken a room
           here... and I might have to decide whether or not to go up
           with you.
          BIG HOTEL - HOTEL MAIN ENTRANCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Rose and Bill are leaving the hotel.
                         
                          BILL
           Yes, but that was part of my plan. I mean, I wanted to.
          Bill gives a ticket to the car valet.
           Thank you.
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh, I need a taxi. Taxi !
                         
                          BILL
           No, hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait. What are you being so tough
           for ?
                         
                          ROSE
           I'm just beginning to think that maybe I'Il...
                         
          Rose kisses Bill very tenderly, and even with some spirit. While
          kissing, Bill moves Rose to a more discreet place near the
          entrance. He strokes her shoulder and gets the strap of her dress
          a bit down. Then he moves up the bottom of her dress to stroke her
          thigh.
                         
           VOICE OF THE VALET
                         VOICE OVER
           Cab's here ! Yo, who called a taxi ?
                         
                          BILL
           I am thinking you should just let me take you home and
           forget about this stupid taxi.
                         
                          ROSE
          Rose walks to her waiting cab.
           Well, I'm thinkin' you should stay exactly where you are,
           'cause...
          She smiles and looks at Bill's crotch.
           In that condition, you'd get arrested. Start another riot.
                         
                          BILL
           Give me your phone number and address.
                         
                          ROSE
           Why? You want to make me fall to earth and burn my feet ?
           Whatever happened to quicksilver and light as air?
          She opens the cab's door and climbs inside. She waves to Bill.
                         
                          BILL
           She floats away on her sweet young legs. Waves to him once.
           Drives away without a backward glance.
                         
          Rose closes the door and the cabs moves away.
                         
          BOB'S OFFICE - BUILDING - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          The first sentence of the following dialogue is heard voice-over
          on a wide shot of the modern glass building where Bob's office is
          located.
          BOB'S OFFICE - WORKROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bill sits behind the desk. In front of the desk, already seated,
          Dale, Richie's brother. He is wearing an open khaki shirt. Bill
          wipes his glasses and puts them on. He is wearing an open light-
          blue shirt.
                         
                          DALE
           Richie is what he is.
                         
                          BILL
           What exactly is that?
                         
                          DALE
           He was born back of a van going up Route 5 to a Grateful
           Dead concert. The first sound he ever heard was "Beat It On
           Down The Line."
                         
          They both laugh.
                         
                          BILL
           Well, it could be worse.
                         
                          DALE
           Not much.
                         
                          BILL
           How long have you been his guardian?
                         
                          DALE
           Since he was nine or ten. But I've always taken care of
           Richie.
                         
                          BILL
           So, what can I do for you ?
                         
                          DALE
           Um, I was hoping you would help me... get Richie out of
           therapy. Look, I know I'm just his brother, but I've been
           like a mother and a father to him...
          Bill takes his glasses off.
           and I know I can get overprotective, but...
                         
                          BILL
           Why would you want to take Richie out of therapy now ?
                         
                          DALE
           What Richie needs is normalcy.
                         
                          BILL
           Well, normalcy...
          Bill gets up and keeps on talking while walking in the room.
           Normalcy can be interpreted in a lot of different ways.
                         
                          DALE
           Richie has practically been raised by the state...
          Bill sits back.
           ... the social workers, psychiatrists... forcing him into
           this, um, psycho-servitude. He is the sweetest kid you'll
           ever meet, but he thinks of himself as handicapped. It just
           isn't right.
                         
                          BILL
           Well, he's got legal problems. Richie was sentenced by the
           court to mandatory treatment.
                         
                          DALE
           Every kid gets into trouble. And that's why I need you to
           help get him out.
                         
                          BILL
           You know, Dale, it's hard to tell when someone's feeling
           pain... but I want you to know...
                         
                          DALE
           If Richie feels pain... then I feel pain. Pretty much in
           tune with him. I just wish you'd give us a chance.
                         
                          BILL
           Let me check out Richie's status. Then, uh, I'll give
           probation a call.
          Bill gets up.
                         
                          DALE
           Oh, thanks. Thanks, Dr. Capa.
          Dale gets up and shakes Bill's hand.
           I really appreciate it.
                         
                          BILL
           You're welcome, Dale. You either lift weights or work with
           your hands.
                         
                          DALE
           Yeah, uh, I make furniture.
                         
                          BILL
           Really.
          Bill sits back, but not Dale.
                         
                          DALE
           Yeah, I made this desk for Bob, to remind him of New York.
                         
                          BILL
           No kidding.
                         
                          DALE
           We called it the Chrysler desk.
                         
                          BILL
           Chrysler.
                         
                          DALE
           You ever see his bed ?
                         
          CASEY'S LOFT - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Tracking shot starting on a large painting showing a naked woman
          tied with ribbons. We hear the phone ringing. The answering
          machine gets on while the tracking shot moves to a painting
          showing another woman naked but for very small leather panties.
          She is hung upside down with chains and ropes.
                         
           CASEY'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE
           Hi. This is Casey.
           I can't get to the phone right now, so, uh, leave a
           message. Thanks.
                         
          A beep ends the message. The tracking shot moves on to a
          motorcycle, looking old, then to another painting showing a
          redhead woman wearing a bustier, a garter belt and hoses, all red.
          She is standing on hands and knees and she is wrapped with chains.
          We hear Bill's voice leaving a message on the answering machine.
                         
           BILL'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE
           Casey, this is Bill Capa. It's around noon. Your father
           sent me a check for the private sessions you were having
           with Bob. Should I send the check back or do you want to
           continue ? Let me know, okay ?
                         
          A click ends the message. During Bill's message, the tracking shot
          moves to a giant plastic statue, with Walt Disney's Pluto's head
          on a human male body. Then the tracking shot moves more quickly to
          another painting showing a redhead woman wearing a close-fitting
          sexy black overall. Then a close shot on a painting of a woman
          wearing a harness with spikes. Further away we see another
          painting showing a redhead woman being whipped. At the end of
          Bill's message, the tracking shots ends on Casey lying supine on a
          weightlifting bench. His writs are tied to the vertical bars where
          a dumbbell is resting.
                         
                          CASEY
           I think I want to continue.
          We hear the crack of a whip. Since the shot is showing only
          Casey's head and chest, we don't see who is whipping him.
           You bitch !
          Another whip crack.
           I called you a bitch !
          Whip crack.
           I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
          Whip crack. The tracking shot starts moving backwards, but with a
          larger angle.
           Oh!
          Whip crack. Casey's voice is softer. Medium long shot on the room.
           Oh! I'm sorry.
          Almost hysterical laugh.
                         
          ROAD IN FRONT OF BOB'S RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          We see Bill, bare chest, wearing sneakers short pants and cap,
          running toward us. His T-shirt is hanging at his side, partly
          stuck in the elastic band of his shorts. Bill stops running when
          he reaches the mailbox, hesitates one moment, comes two steps back
          and opens the box. Close-up on the box, inside of which a coiled
          rattlesnake whips a menacing forked tongue. The snake rattles,
          then the front half of the snake jumps out of the box, with its
          mouth wide open. Bill falls on the road, where he remains seated
          without moving. The snake, with the back half of his body still in
          the box, doesn't seem to know what it must do next.
           A car arrives at a high rate of speed. Since a pick-up is parked
          on the other side of the road, the car must zigzag and it barely
          avoid driving on Bill.
                         
                          BILL
          Yelling to the driver.
           Hey !
                         
          The car honks. We get a close-up of the driver when the car comes
          very close to Bill.
                         
                          THE DRIVER
           You idiot !
                         
          Bill looks at the departing car and notices a city worker blowing
          dead leaves on the bank of the road.
                         
                          BILL
          He yells to the city worker, but, with the loud noise of his power
          blower, the man does not hears him and remains concentrated on his
          work.
           Hey ! Hey !... Help !... Shit !
          Bill crawls back a little, then he eventually stands up. He
          crosses the road, and takes a big shovel in the pick-up truck.
           Fuck !
          He crosses the road back. The snake is back in the mailbox.
           Hello !
          Bill hits the box very hard with the shovel. Snake and mail fall
          on the road. Bill laughs and throws the shovel on the side of the
          road.
           I am not goin' back to New York, you hear me ? You're stuck
           with me !
          Bill stoops to pick up the letters scattered on the road. He looks
          at the envelopes.
           Fuckin' bill. Great.
                         
          We see the snake disappearing through the grass on the side of the
          road. Bill, with his back to the road, is getting ready to enter
          the house. A car stops and honks. Bill turns around to face
          Hector.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Capa !
                         
                          BILL
          He comes back to the car. He looks very angry.
           Oh, that's perfect ! That's really perfect ! Just like a
           cop ! You're never there when you need one !
                         
                          HECTOR
           What did I do now ?
                         
                          BILL
           Somebody put a rattlesnake in the mailbox, Hector !
                         
                          HECTOR
          He laughs.
           A rattlesnake !
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY
          Bill is washing his arms in the sink.
                         
                          HECTOR
           You scared the shit out of me outside.
                         
                          BILL
           Oh, I scared you, huh ? What the hell are you doing here ?
                         
                          HECTOR
           I could use some assistance, some of your professional
           wisdom.
                         
                          BILL
           I'm really flattered.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Everyone in the group has an alibi. Except for Casey. He
           says he was alone in his loft.
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah ?
                          HECTOR
           Mm-hmm.
                         
                          BILL
           What does that mean ?
          He dries his arms with a dishcloth.
                         
                          HECTOR
           What do you make of Casey?
                         
                          BILL
           He's a good kid.
                         
                          HECTOR
           You're an asshole, Capa.
                         
          Bill turns the water off, throws the dishcloth on the sink. Hector
          walks in the room while wiping his hands with another dishcloth.
                         
                          BILL
           Should we analyze that statement, Hector ?
                         
                          HECTOR
           Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on. Who is our man ?
           Help me.
                         
                          BILL
           You're the cop. Figure it out.
                         
          He gets out of the kitchen, followed by Hector.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR DAY
                         
                          HECTOR
           You know what I think ? I think it was you. You've got the
           look.
                         
                          BILL
           That's right.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Yeah, I been talking to people who knew you both. Everyone
           says there was a weird competitive thing going between you.
                         
          They have come to the hall where the security TV screens are
          located. They stop walking.
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah, that's right. There was. I admit it. He was on the
           way up... and I was on the way down.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Including...
          He whistles, miming, with both hands, something crashing down.
           Splat ! It unhinged you.
                         
                          BILL
           I bet you've seen every episode of Columbo, huh?
          Sound of a buzz. The two men look at the security screen.
           Who is it?
          Bill taps on the remote control, and Rose appears on the screen.
                         
                          ROSE
           Hi. It's me, Rose. The old fender bender.
                         
          Bill taps again on the remote control to open the gate, and Rose
          leaves the TV screen.
                         
                          HECTOR
           That's a very young girl to be going around... fending
           benders.
                         
          Bill puts the remote control down and follows Hector to the main
          gate.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - GARDEN - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Hector is walking to the exit. As he reaches the bottom of the
          steps, Rose is going down. Bill, standing behind a low wall, looks
          at her coming.
                         
                          BILL
           Here she comes. Weightless, hanging from the sky... wearing
           a short dress of indeterminate color.
                         
                          ROSE
           It's red, poor thing.
                         
                          BILL
           Thank you.
                         
          They kiss. Rose takes his hand.
                         
                          ROSE
           I was thinking. Maybe I should see a shrink.
                         
                          BILL
           I can recommend someone.
                         
                          ROSE
           I feel better already.
                         
          Close-up on their kissing.
                         
                          BILL
           God, I missed you.
                         
          They are now at the edge of the pool.
                         
                          ROSE
           This time you won't miss.
                         
          They fall fully dressed in the pool.
           Underwater shot. They keep on kissing in the water. Bill takes
          her dress off. She wears nothing underneath. We can see a rose
          tattooed on her buttock. She slips Bill's short down to his
          ankles. We get a brief view of Bill's penis.
           Above water shot. They are now in the water up to their waists.
          Bill is kissing Rose's breasts.
           Underwater shot. They are back underwater. Bill is kissing Rose's
          legs, and moves slowly up to her crotch. She has trimmed pubic
          hair, but with some left. Still kissing, Bill moves up along her
          stomach and reaches hers breasts, which he kisses greedily.
           Above water shot. Bill is leaning his back against the edge of
          the pool. Rose is lying on him. They are still in the water up to
          their waists.
           Underwater shot. Rose is kissing Bill's chest et goes slowly down
          his stomach, then along one of his legs. We get another brief view
          of Bill's penis. We notice that it is not erected (certainly to
          avoid being X-rated).
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Multiple shots of Bill and Rose making love, seen through the
          «piece of art». Then tracking shot on the two bodies fondling each
          other.
           Shot on the bedroom window, and two hand-glider in the
          californian sky.
           Back to the lovers couple. They are sweating profusely. Their
          position and their movements suggest, without actually showing it,
          that Bill is inside Rose. Bill turns Rose around to put her lying
          on her stomach. Rose holds the two sculpted bed posts very
          tightly. It is suggested that Bill could be sodomizing her.
           They both moan. The moaning increases with a suggestion of an
          orgasm.
                         
                          ROSE
          Still holding the bedposts. She speaks with a breathless voice.
           I want you to get dressed up... Get dressed up... All right ?
          She turns around to face him.
           I want to get dressed up.
                         
                          BILL
           Right now ?
                         
                          ROSE
           Uh-huh.
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - DINING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Through the window, we notice that the night has fallen. Bill,
          seated behind the table, is wearing brown suit and necktie, very
          elegant. On the table, wine and water glasses and two chandeliers,
          with a lighted candle. In front of Bill, a plate with food. Rose
          enters the field, carrying another plate, which she sets on the
          other side of the table.
           In the plate, a piece of grilled beef, noodles et vegetables.
           Rose sits behind her plate. As the table is made of glass, we see
          that Rose is naked.
                         
                          ROSE
           You're not eating. Don't you like my food?
                         
                          BILL
           I'd like your food five inches to the left.
                         
                          ROSE
           Okay.
          Rose moves the plate to her left, showing her naked body though
          the glass table.
           But if you don't like this... I have something else for
           you.
           She laughs.
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah, okay.
                         
                          ROSE
           I think it's ready.
                         
          She stands up laughing. Fade out on the next scene.

          Long scene on the couple making love standing under the shower.
          Fade out on the next scene.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bill wakes up, naked, and alone in the bed. One of his hand is
          cuffed to one of the bedpost with a long strap. He laughs.
                         
          ARCHIVES ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          An archives room, congested with shelves from floor to ceiling. On
          these shelves, hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of files, stacked
          not too cleanly. Bill is leaning on one of the shelves. The
          archivist, a forty-year old lady, appears from behind another
          shelf, apparently coming down some steps. Bill stands up.
                         
                          THE ARCHIVIST
           It's a miracle. I found it.
          She starts walking between two rows of shelves. Bill follows her,
          putting his glasses on.
           Here he is. Richie Dexter. Legal guardian: Dale Dexter.
           That's his brother. Kids were put under care, let's see,
           about six years ago.
                          BILL
          He tries to read above her shoulder.
           Does it say why?
                         
                          THE ARCHIVIST
           Abandonment, abuse. The children were assigned to a, uh...
          She flips a page in the file.
           Dr. Niedelmeyer in Pasadena. A child psychiatrist. Richie
           was 12.
          Bill tries to come back to the preceding page, but the archivist
          looks angrily at him, silently meaning he is going a bit too far.
           No foster parents. Looks like the doctor retired a couple
           years after that. Then we lost track of the kids until
           recently.
                         
                          BILL
           What do you mean, "lost track" of them?
                         
                          THE ARCHIVIST
          She closes the file, and keeps on walking between the rows of
          shelves, followed by Bill.
           Like on a radar : One minute a blip, the next, no blip.
           Hey, look. This is the lost souls memorial wing. Children
           of L.A. County of the '90s: 250 000 cases in here, and
           there's two more down the hall.
                         
          SONDRA'S RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          The room is decorated in quite a luxurious way, but with a lot of
          good taste. Paintings on the walls. Bed covered with an
          embroidered bedspread, and many cushions. At the foot end of the
          bed, a small upholstered bench.
           Two women enter the room, laughing and carrying many parcels,
          which they throw on the bed.
                         
                          BONNIE
           Nobody's like your ex-husband!
                         
                          SONDRA
           That's for sure. That's for sure.
          Bonnie takes one of the parcel, a large white box.
           Okay, okay, okay.
                         
                          BONNIE
          She takes a white dress out of the box. For the first time, we see
          a close-up of her face, and we discover she is Rose, different
          hairdo, a lot of almost vulgar make-up, but still, she is Rose.
           Here it is. Oh, Sondra, it is so beautiful. Isn't it
           great ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           I know. It's incredible. Look at all these bags.
                         
                          ROSE
          She shamelessly takes off the dress, and, as she wears no bra, she
          stands naked, save for her panties, in front of Sondra.
           Oh, the man that was staring at you in the shop... was so
           funny.
          She laughs. Sondra freezes watching the naked body of her friend.
           I think I should have got it in green or something.
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh ! Oh ! Lush !
          She has put the white dress on.
           What do you think?
                         
                          SONDRA
          She seems very moved.
           I think... you look beautiful.
                         
                          ROSE
           You sure ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           Oh, yeah.
                         
                          ROSE
           Come zip me up.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Okay. Okay.
          She gets up from the bed to zip up Rose's dress.
           Oh, this is so tight.
                         
                          ROSE
           Thank you.
                         
                          SONDRA
           I need to find a new husband.
          They both laugh. Sondra goes back sitting on the bed and looking
          through the parcels.
           I need some more money.
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh, men. Who needs them ? Have you seen my earrings
           anywhere ?
                         
                          SONDRA
          She waves the earrings in front of Rose's face.
           Yes, I've got them.
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh, sweet !
          Rose takes off the large rings she is wearing to replace them by
          the earrings Sondra just gave her. She sighs.
           Oh, my God. I love these. Aren't they pretty ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           They're so gorgeous, yes.
                         
                          ROSE
           Try yours on.
                         
                          SONDRA
          Sondra doesn't move, feeling very embarrassed by the idea of
          undressing in front of her friend.
           Okay.
          She eventually gets up, an starts taking off the belt from her
          suit. Rose is putting her jacket on. A long silence : Sondra looks
          more and more embarrassed. She snickers stupidly. Rose looks at
          her without really understanding what's going on.
                         
                          ROSE
           What now ? Sondra, what ?
                         
                          SONDRA
          She sits back on the bed.
           I feel embarrassed.
                         
                          ROSE
           Why?
                         
                          SONDRA
           'Cause... the way you're looking at me.
                         
                          ROSE
           Sondra... Do men look at you like that ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           No... Yes... But it's different.
                          ROSE
          She bends to her.
           You know, Sondra... it doesn't have to be any different at
           all.
          The phone rings. Rose starts laughing.
           You better get that.
                         
                          SONDRA
          She takes the phone.
           Hello. Oh, h-hi. Um... Oh...
          She seems embarrassed. Rose is making funny faces.
           Um, mmm, okay.
          She stammers a little.
           N... My trainer's coming at 2:30, but that's... Yeah. You
           are? Okay !...
          She goes to the window and moves the curtain aside. We see Bob's
          car in the street.
           Um, oh, there you are ! Okay, okay. I'll see you in a
           minute !
                         
          STREET IN FRONT OF SONDRA'S RESIDENCE -- BOB'S CAR - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bill drives and holds his car phone on his ear.
                         
                          SONDRA'S VOICE
           Bye.
          Bill hangs up his car phone.
                         
          SONDRA'S RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
                          ROSE
          She is looking at herself in the full-length mirror.
           Who's that?
                         
                          SONDRA
           That's my analyst ! He's coming to visit me.
                         
                          ROSE
          When she hears Sondra's last reply, Rose's carefree face becomes
          very anxious.
           He what?
                         
                          SONDRA
           Oh, my God. He's coming over.
                         
                          ROSE
           Sondra, thanks. Oh, thanks a lot !
                         
                          SONDRA
           What's the matter ? What ?
                         
                          ROSE
           Nothing !
          She starts gathering her belongings.
           If you don't know, I thought we were just going to have a
           nice afternoon together... maybe have dinner.
                         
                          SONDRA
          She puts the telephone back on its stand and takes Rose's arm.
           Well, we can. Oh, don't worry. Don't be upset. You can stay
           here. Really.
                         
                          ROSE
          She closes her purse and puts it over her shoulder.
           You just don't understand, do you?
                         
                          SONDRA
           I don't.
                         
                          ROSE
           Nobody appreciates you the way that I do. People just use
           you, and you don't even see it.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Oh, don't be upset.
          She turns to Rose to look at her face.
                         
                          ROSE
          Rose kisses Sondra tenderly on the lips.
           That's more like it. Ciao.
                         
          She leaves the room. Sondra seems very disturbed by the kiss. She
          puts her hands on her chest.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Oh, my God.
                         
          SONDRA'S RESIDENCE - HALL AND SITTING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Rose gets quickly down the stairs. Chimes. Rose gets large
          sunglasses out of her purse and adjust them on her nose before
          opening the front door.
           She opens the door to face Bill whom she almost jostle to get
          outside as fast as possible. Through a low window, we see her
          going down the stairs to the street.
           Larger shot. We discover the sitting-room next to the hall. Good
          taste expensive furniture, nice paintings, concert piano.
           Sondra gets down the stairs. Bill, who was looking around him,
          turns to her.
                         
                          BILL
           Hi, Sondra. Someone just let me in.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Hi.
                         
                          BILL
           I didn't just walk in on my own.
                         
                          SONDRA
          She closes the front door, which had remained open.
           Oh... no. That was my, um... That was my girlfriend,
           Bonnie. Yeah.
                         
                          BILL
           Bonnie. Yes.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Please, come in.
                          BILL
           Thank you very much. Thank you.
          He enters the sitting-room, followed by Sondra.
           This is a really lovely place you have here. Yeah.
          He sits on a cushions-covered sofa.
                         
                          SONDRA
           You think so? Thank you.
          She sits on a small sofa without back.
                         
                          BILL
           A lot of nice, nice things. A lot of nice art.
                         
                          SONDRA
          She simpers a little.
           What did you come here for?
                         
                          BILL
           Well, I feel like I have so much... so much catching up to
           do with all of you. And I know that you're very close with
           Richie. And I was wondering if you could tell me anything
           that might help me... understand him a little better.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Richie's... my little baby.
                         
                          BILL
           His brother Dale thinks that your "little baby"... should
           be taken out of therapy.
                         
                          SONDRA
           That's insane!
                         
                          BILL
          He gets up.
           I think it's a mistake too.
          He goes to the window and looks at the children playing in a park.
                          SONDRA
           That Dale is a dangerous bastard.
                         
                          BILL
           But he obviously seems to care for Richie a great deal.
           There's a big gap in Richie's life up until about a year
           ago. Did he ever mention a Dr. Niedelmeyer to you ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           I don't have much to tell. Richie's okay. He's sweet. Did
           you know that he was... molested as a child ?
          She has tears in her eyes.
                         
                          BILL
           No, I didn't know that.
          He comes back to her.
           It's sticking out all over.
          He sits on the bench of the piano.
                         
                          SONDRA
           It's fashionable.
          She laughs nervously.
           I mean, it pays well. At least, you know, you can write a
           book, go on Oprah.
                         
                          BILL
           That was quite a show he gave us in group. You think Richie
           has a violent streak ?
                         
                          SONDRA
          She sighs.
           Oh. Let's cut to the chase. Richie did not kill Bob Moore.
           You know... it's really swell. Snooping around here...
          She gets up.
           ... sniffing for blood on other people's hands... while
           pretending to help your patients ?
                         
                          BILL
           You really think that I don't care about Richie ?
                         
                          SONDRA
          She gets upset.
           Richie wouldn't hurt a fly ! Why don't you take a look at
           someone dangerous. Why don't you take a look at someone who
           could do it ! Why don't you take a look at Clark !
                         
                          BILL
           Clark ?
                         
                          SONDRA
          She gets more and more upset.
           Clark ! Clark ! Clark is a sneaky, lying, button-down son
           of a bitch... who pretends to be this gentle creature ! I
           heard him screaming one night at Bob. It made the hairs on
           my neck stand up ! Anyway... I hope that they fry...
           whoever did it, and it takes a really long time. And
           then... And then a fuse blows. They have to start all over
           again.
          She sits back. Bill has been listening to her outburst without
          reacting.
           We hear the front door chimes, and Sondra's expression changes
          immediately. Her angry face becomes suddenly softer.
           She snickers and puts her tongue to her lips.
           Wow ! That's my trainer.
          She gets up and sniffs a bit.
           I gotta go. I gotta get the door.
          She goes to the front door and opens it to a very muscular young
          man wearing a sleeveless T-shirt.
           This is my trainer, Chris.
                         
                          BILL
           Hi.
          Chris just nods his head.
           Bye-bye.
          Bill gets out. As soon as the door is closes, Sondra literally
          jumps in Chris' arms, and starts giggling.
                         
                          SONDRA
           I don't feel like lifting weights today.
                         
                          CHRIS
           Okay.
                          SONDRA
           Let's do something else.
          She bursts laughing.
           Through the low window, we see Bill going down the stairs to the
          street. He stops for two seconds to look at the tender couple !
                         
          DALE'S WORKSHOP - PARKING - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bob's car stops in front of a slightly dilapidated building, on a
          desert parking lot. The building could be an old factory
          reconverted by Dale into a workshop to make his furniture. A very
          high chimney above the building.
           Bill, dressed in jeans and light-colored shirt, gets out of the
          car and walks toward the building. He passes a board that
          indicates the location of the «office». He knocks at a door with a
          window and a grating and a sign that says «beware of the dog». The
          dog starts barking. Bill knocks again. He tries to look through
          the door window. The dog keeps on barking.
           Bill comes back the way he came toward the «office». He stops in
          front of a window and bends to try to see something inside. He
          knocks on the window. He turns around, and we catch a quick
          glimpse of someone behind the window.
           Bill comes back to the parking lot toward a pickup that two men
          are unloading.
                         
                          BILL
           Hey! Is this Dale Dexter's shop here?
                         
          One of the men nods and shows the main door to Bill.
                         
          DALE'S WORKSHOP - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Entrance of the workshop. The door opens and Bill appears. He
          takes off his sunglasses, puts them in the pocket of his shirt and
          gets in.
           The workshop has a very high ceiling and looks a bit dilapidated.
          On the roof of a small structure (perhaps the quoted «office»)
          sits the impressive statue of a lion who gives the impression to
          watch Bill.
           Bill keeps on walking and passes a spray of burning sparks.
          Someone must be using a blowtorch in the neighborhood.
           Bill looks around him, looking a bit anxious. Several men are
          working. He approaches one of them, wearing a sleeveless T-shirt,
          and who is welding, with a protection mask covering his face.
                         
                          BILL
           Excuse me.
                         
          The man stands up and puts down the piece he was welding. He
          raises his mask : It's Dale.
                         
                          DALE
           Hello. Did you go to the house?
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah. Nobody was home. I would have phoned a...
          Dale shuts his blowtorch off.
           I would have phone ahead, but, uh, I don't have your phone
           number in our file.
                          DALE
          He takes off his mask, then his protection gloves.
           No problem. So, uh, did you make up your mind ?
                         
                          BILL
           After Dr. Niedelmeyer, did Richie get another
           psychiatrist ?
                         
                          DALE
           No. No, we moved.
          Dale goes around a huge, geometrically shaped, metallic structure.
           Richie went to school. Everything was fine.
                         
                          BILL
           Well... that's the problem, Dale. I look at Richie, and I
           don't see that everything is fine. I see a kid that's on
           the brink.
                         
                          DALE
          He starts working on the metallic structure, but stops to look at
          Bill.
           A person, uh, gets a bullet in the head. Sometimes they
           just leave it there 'cause... to fuck around in the brain
           is gonna paralyze the person. That's Richie.
                         
                          BILL
           What's the bullet ?
                         
                          DALE
           Whatever it was, I got him away.
          He has taken protection glasses to work.
                         
                          BILL
           You want to talk about that ?
                         
                          DALE
           No. I want you to stop trying to tear off the scabs. Let
           the demons rest. You dig around in Richie's head, he's
           gonna blow up in your face.
                         
                          BILL
           You think he's violent ?
                         
                          DALE
           Not with me.
                         
                          BILL
           I think you're making a mistake, Dale. This is not the time
           to take Richie out of therapy. If you don't like me, let's
           get him someone else.
                         
                          DALE
           Jesus Christ. One of you is the same as another.
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah.
                         
          NIEDELMEYER'S RESIDENCE - GARDEN - EXTERIOR DAY
          Bill gets out of his car. He is wearing light-colored pants, a
          shirt, and a very elegant leather jacket. He walks up a few steps
          toward the house.
           He crosses the garden, then reaches the very impressive main door
          of the house. Above the door, two similar faces are carved in the
          stone. Probably Doctor Niedelmeyer's face.
           A small panel opens in the door and Edith Niedelmeyer's face
          appears.
                         
                          BILL
           Mrs. Niedelmeyer?
                         
                          EDITH
           Yes.
                         
                          BILL
           Hi, I'm Bill Capa. I'm a doctor. I tracked you down through
           the Psychiatric Institute.
                         
                          EDITH
           How very enterprising of you.
                         
          She slams the panel shut. A few seconds, then she opens the door.
                         
                          BILL
           Actually, I was wondering if I could speak to Dr.
           Niedelmeyer.
                         
                          EDITH
           My husband died last year. If it makes you feel better, he
           suffered a lot. Well, anyway, it made me feel better.
                         
                          BILL
           I'm treating a young man that was a patient... of Dr.
           Niedelmeyer's when he was a child. His name is Richie
           Dexter.
                         
                          EDITH
           Why don't you leave me alone ?
                         
                          BILL
           If I could just ask you a few questions.
                         
                          EDITH
           You get out of here before I call the police !
          She angrily slams the door shut.
                         
                          BILL
           Just a few questions. Mrs. Niedelmeyer...
                         
                          EDITH
          Voice over through the door.
           Get out of here !
                         
          Bill sighs, then walks away from the door. The camera moves above
          the door and ends up on a close-up of Niedelmeyer's carved face,
          who seems to sneer at Bill.
                         
          BOB'S OFFICE - MEETING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
          Night is falling on L.A. Clark, in the foreground, is counting
          books. Behind him, Richie, Buck and Casey are seated, Casey in his
          favorite hand-shaped armchair. Sondra is standing up.
                         
                          CLARK
           Fifty-eight. Now, if I'm not mistaken... last week there
           were 59 books on the shelf and this week there are only 58
           books on the shelf somehow.
                         
                          BUCK
           Clark... what's the ashtray situation ?
                         
          Sondra sits down and Casey sits in another armchair.
                         
                          CLARK
           Three. Not four, as recommended. There are three chairs and
           five assorted sofas.
                         
                          BUCK
           Who cares ?
                         
                          BILL
          He just came in and is standing by the window. He is wearing his
          glasses, jeans, open shirt and a light grey jacket. He turns
          around to speak to the group.
           Okay, let's get started.
                         
                          BUCK
          Finishing a sentence the beginning of which was not
          understandable.
           ... an emotional tar baby.
                         
                          BILL
           Today I'd like to focus on a most enlightening... and
           challenging topic.
                         
                          SONDRA
          She is - a bit lasciviously - sprawled in her armchair.
           Sex.
                         
                          BILL
           More or less. You see, the primary romantic relationship...
           in our life is often a symptom of our illness.
          He has seated himself in the hand-shaped armchair.
                         
                          CASEY
           Glad I wore my rubber pants.
          Buck snickers.
                         
                          BILL
           We keep making the same neurotic choices over and over
           every time we choose a new mate. So... If you had a magic
           wand... if you, uh, had a wish list... and could change
           your partner... Sondra, how would you make them different ?
           What's wrong ? What's missing ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           Now ?
                         
                          BILL
           You need a minute to think about it ?
                         
                          CLARK
           She's totally forgot her Rolodex.
          Casey snickers.
           Sorry, sorry.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Well, I don't have an attachment in my life right now. The
           last one sort of went to pieces. If you enjoy sex... A man
           thinks you're doing it with everybody.
                         
                          BILL
           He was jealous.
          He gets ups, walks to a cupboard, opens its door and takes a cup.
                         
                          SONDRA
           That's right. And I was as good as gold.
                         
                          BILL
           Well, there's a good chance that he was the one that was
           sleeping around... and projecting his fantasies and desires
           onto you.
                         
                          SONDRA
           This guy had a major projection, and he couldn't keep it in
           his pants.
          The whole group laughs. Bill smiles while pouring himself a
          coffee.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Anyway, I do have this girlfriend. She really makes me
           laugh. A wish list. I wish... she was a guy.
                         
                          BILL
          He comes back with his cup in his hand.
           Fair enough. Casey, what do you got for us?
                          CASEY
          He is playing with a small statue of a monkey who looks at a
          skull.. He waits a few seconds, and puts the statue down before
          speaking.
           Well... I met this girl about a month ago. I've painted
           every inch of her in detail. She's the best model I've ever
           seen. Completely uninhibited. Does whatever I ask no matter
           how...
                         
                          BUCK
          He smiles.
           I'll bet she does.
                         
                          CASEY
           That's right, Buck. See, but this is where the problem
           comes in. It's what you see beneath the skin... when you
           study somebody endlessly, the way an artist does. I see a
           transcendental beauty there... beyond anything I could
           ever, ever imagine.
                         
                          BILL
           How does this woman feel about you?
                          CASEY
           She thinks I'm the living end because I've got talent. But,
           I mean, what's talent ? Kick a garbage can... starving
           artists crawl out, right ? But there's only one, unique
           her. And, uh, I think it's love, you know ? And, um... I
           don't know what to do about that.
          He is suddenly moved on the verge of tears.
                         
                          BILL
           Do you think she loves you ?
                         
                          CASEY
           No. No.
                         
                          BILL
           Do you care, Casey ?
                         
                          CASEY
           I don't know. I don't know.
                         
                          BUCK
           He's a romantic. He loves the suffering.
                         
                          CASEY
           Maybe being who I am... I have no choice.
                         
                          BILL
           Very good, Casey. That's good stuff.
                         
                          SONDRA
           I agree.
                         
                          BILL
           Buck, what do you got?
                         
                          BUCK
          He jumps.
           Oh, nothing to talk about, not compared to that.
                         
                          BILL
           It's not a contest.
                         
                          BUCK
          He lights a cigarette.
           Hey, Yard Sale, you want to share the ashtray ?
          Casey puts his foot on the ashtray to prevent Buck from using it.
           Thanks a lot.
          He gets up.
           Forget it. You want to share something, share the ashtray.
          He sits on a small armchair by a glass table with an ashtray on
          it.
           I got something in my life, something new. You know, she's
           young. Auburn hair, 5'5", 105. Pretty as hell. I see her on
           weekends.
          He picks up the ashtray and moves to sit in a more comfortable
          armchair.
           I don't think she'd sleep with a man unless she was married
           to him.
                          BILL
          He has taken his glasses off.
           Anything else you'd like to tell us?
                         
                          BUCK
           She doesn't mind the gray, you know.
          Bill smiles.
           She's fragile... you know ? It's like she's running through
           my fingers. Two people I loved died. I never thought that I
           could feel anything.
                         
                          BILL
           Good, Buck. Richie. How 'bout you ?
                         
                          RICHIE
          He is playing with the statue of the monkey.
           I don't have,really, relationships. I have m-my brother.
                         
                          BILL
           Okay. You want to talk about him?
                         
                          RICHIE
           H-He worries a-a lot about me. And he l-loves me. But l...
           I wish he didn't... love me so m... so much sometimes. I
           wish l-I had more of a l-life.
          He puts the statue down and gets up.
           And I know that everyone h-here thinks that I'm gay... but
           I'm-I'm not. A-And I don't want to be.
          Richie opens the cupboard, takes a can of Pepsi and opens it.
                         
                          BILL
           What would you like to be ?
                         
                          RICHIE
           I'd like t-to be a w-woman.
                         
                          BILL
           Have you seen a doctor ?
                          RICHIE
           Yeah.
                         
                          BUCK
           So the next step is the chop.
                         
                          BILL
          He cuts him very curtly.
           Thank you, Buck. Anything else you'd like to tell us,
           Richie ?
                         
                          RICHIE
           Nope.
                         
                          BILL
           Very good. Hi, Clark. What would you change about your
           partner ?
                         
                          CLARK
          He is manicuring with his handkerchief.
           Um, I think I'll pass... today.
                          SONDRA
           Excuse me. You think you're gonna pass today ? Don't you
           think that's kind of a betrayal to the rest of the group ?
           I mean, we're all sitting here sharing our most intimate
           thoughts... and you're just gonna pass today ?
                         
                          CLARK
           Well, Sondra, I have my little problems... but I don't s-
           see how it's your business...
                         
                          SONDRA
           Your "little problems" ?
                         
                          CLARK
           To decide when I'm gonna share in group and not.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Ah, I see. You're smiling. Is that a smile ? You think this
           is funny ?
          She gets up from her armchair.
           Look at you. Just look at you. Look at your hair.
          Buck snickers.
           Who do you think you are ? Huh ? You think you're God's
           gift to women ? Let me tell you something. You are nothing.
           Nothing but a shallow, rigid... self-protective, anal
           coward ! And I'll tell you what your little fucking
           problems are...
                         
                          CLARK
          He gets ups, looking angry.
           Oh, shut up ! Shut up, shut up ! You promiscuous cunt ! And
           if you must know, I do have somebody in my life ! Black,
           emotional hole, unattractive me !
          He walks nervously to the door. Sondra remains standing, looking a
          bit embarrassed.
                         
                          BUCK
          He snickers.
           You can say that again !
                         
                          CLARK
          He slams furiously the door.
           Fuck you ! Fuck all of you !
                         
                          CASEY
           Is this what you call "treatment failure" ?
          Buck snickers.
                         
                          BILL
           Well, it's not a total loss. He left without counting
           everything.
          He puts down the file he was holding in his hand.
                         
          CLARK'S RESIDENCE - STREET IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          A quiet little street, surrounded by houses an buildings of good
          standing. Children in roller skates are playing hockey on the
          pavement.
                          CHILDREN
           Come on !... Hey, right here !... Hit it !
                         
          Bob's car arrives in the street. The children moves away to let it
          pass. While Bill is parking the car, we hear, in voice over, the
          beginning of the conversation between Bill and Clark. Bill is
          wearing a light-colored shirt and beige pants.
                         
                          CLARK
          Voice over.
           So pretty soon the relevant numbers weren't enough. I had
           to know all the irrelevant numbers... like the numbers of
           pages in each deposition.
                         
          CLARK'S RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Walls are white, furniture modern, but with good taste. Everything
          is meticulously clean and tidy. Bill sits in an armchair. Clark is
          standing by the window.
                         
                          BILL
           So you were fired.
                         
                          CLARK
          He takes off his sunglasses and gets regular glasses from his
          shirt pocket. He is wearing disposable gloves.
           Yes. In effect. Obsessive-compulsive. Medical leave.
          He puts his glasses on.
           "Just please, please don't come back."
          He sits down and sighs.
           I do apologize for my outburst in group.
                         
                          BILL
           You're screwing Sondra... aren't you?
                         
                          CLARK
          He puts his sunglasses in his shirt pocket, gets back up and start
          walking in the room.
           I'm very fond of Sondra. More than that, perhaps. Sondra
           is... A very warmhearted woman, but...
          While talking, he sprays a liquid from a can on his plants.
           Tissues. Panty hose. CDs put back in the rack without
           cases. Frying pans with coagulating grease. Cotton balls.
           Cotton balls. I mean, my God, the cotton balls that woman
           used. Unspeakable items of underwear left hanging in the
           shower. Chewed gum in the ashtrays. I made a list. There
           were 22 items I couldn't take.
                         
                          BILL
           It must be difficult to find someone... to measure up to
           your keen sense of order.
                         
                          CLARK
           I found someone. This woman thinks I'm messy. It's perfect.
           She comes, she goes. I don't even know she's been except
           for the faint smell of perfume.
                         
                          BILL
          Bill sneers.
           Nice. And what does Sondra think of this woman ?
                          CLARK
           Take a look at this.
          He goes to a closet, from which he gets a paper bag. From the bags
          he takes out a tattered piece of clothing.
           Sondra tried to do this to my clothes... while I was
           wearing them; butcher knife in hand, screaming. The next
           day she came back, did this to my friend's dress. I'm
           terrified to go near the woman.
                         
          FREEWAY, THEN ROAD - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Cars on the freeway. Among them Bob's car. The car phone is
          ringing. Bill picks up the phone, while he keeps on driving. He is
          wearing sunglasses.
                         
                          BILL
           Hello ?... Hello, this is Bill Capa.
                         
           THE VOICE IN THE PHONE
          Giggly voice sounding like a child's voice.
           Hey, puke-face. Look around. Can't you see me ? I'm in the
           red car.
          Bill looks around him on the freeway, and sees a red car on his
          right.
           You got doo-doo in your eyes... or caca on the brain, Dr.
           Shithead Capa.
          Strange sounding giggles.
                         
                          BILL
           Does your mommy know you escaped from the straightjacket?
                         
           THE VOICE IN THE PHONE
           Suck my Tinkertoy, you faggot cretin... after you suck my
           scalpel, Doctor.
                         
          Bill puts the phone down and speeds the car up to avoid the red
          car which is still following him. The red car catches up with him
          and bumps into him. Bill jumps up.
                         
                          BILL
           Goddamn it !
                         
          The red car bumps into him a second time, and looses part of its
          radiator grill.
           Third bumps. Bill is now out of the freeway and on a road
          downtown.
           The two vehicles are zigzagging between the others cars. Lot of
          honking.
           Without warning, Bill turns on a side street on his right, and
          gets honked by the other cars. In spite of the very dangerous
          driving of Bill among the other cars, the red car keeps on
          following him.
           To follow Bill, the red car must take a vey sharp left turn, and
          bumps into a pickup truck full of kits and gears which fall on the
          pavement.
           The chase goes on. The red car is dented everywhere. It catches
          up with Bill, overtakes him, and bumps violently into Bill's car
          right side.
                          BILL
           Fuck you !
          The red car hits him on the right side twice in a row.
           Fuck you!
          Bill hits the red car on its left side and remains stuck to it.
          They move together, and Bill tries to bring the red car as close
          to the curb as possible.
           Get the... You... Ohh! Get the fuck...
          The red car is so close to the curb that it snatches away the open
          door of a parked car, and then knocks down the shopping caddie of
          a woman. Fortunately, the woman is able to move away, but all her
          shopping items are scattered on the pavement. The two car bump
          again into each other and arrive into a main road.
           When the red car wants to hit Bill's car again, Bill stands on
          the brake and the red car hits a big truck carrying cars. The
          truck honks and start zigzagging in the traffic. The last car on
          the upper bridge of the truck gets loose and falls on the road.
          Bill barely avoids it. Another car gets loose from the truck and
          causes a pile-up on the road.
           Bill zigzag out of the pile-up, and comes to a crossing with a
          railway. A train is approaching. The red car is still behind Bill.
          Bill brakes suddenly just after he has crossed the railway, then
          starts moving backwards. He hits the front of the red car, and
          keeps on moving backwards until he brings the red car on the
          railway itself. The train keeps on honking to move the cars away.
           Hey! You wanna die ! Huh ? You wanna die ?
          We see the driver of the train working madly on his brake, and
          looking to the red car with terror in his eyes.
           Just before the train reaches the crossing, Bill jumps his car
          forward and the red car quickly moves backward.
           Bill stops a few feet after the crossing to get his breath back.
          We see the train moving behind him.
                         
          MEXICAN BAR - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          A Mexican bar, where Hector is a regular. The first shot shows two
          hands playing the harp. Then we get a larger shot and we see
          Hector and Bill talking together. Bill is carrying his jacket on
          his arm, and Hector is wearing his necktie very loose.
           There is quite a crowd in the bar, some people dancing, others
          drinking and some are seated to eat. Electric lines with colored
          bulbs are hung in the trees. In the back, the orchestra keeps on
          playing.
                         
                          HECTOR
           I told you to stay the fuck out of it... Hey !
          He kisses a passing Mexican woman.
           ? Como esta? Gracias.
                         
                          BILL
           I almost killed somebody out there. I mean, I had that car
           wedged right on the railroad tracks. Christ, man. It's a
           spooky feeling.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Like mainlining adrenalin, huh ? The rush is really
           something, huh ? See ? You're my kind of guy !
          He takes him by the shoulders. They walk out of the field, and we
          see kids hitting a puppet hanging from a tree with a bat. The
          puppet is dressed in a cop's costume !
          Hector and Bill come to the buffet table.
                         
                          HECTOR
          He gets a notebook from his pocket.
           You want to hear what I found out about your famous Monday
           group ?
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah, sure. Can stand a little more pain.
          He takes a plate and starts helping himself at the buffet.
                         
                          HECTOR
          He takes a tray and starts reading. A woman is serving him from
          the buffet.
           Well, Clark's wife divorced him... after he put her in
           intensive care.
                         
                          BILL
           What'd she do ? Spill some wine on the rug ?
                         
                          HECTOR
           Then Sondra, she stabbed her father with a knife... and a
           fork. She must have been having dinner. One of her husbands
           died of unnatural causes.
                         
                          BILL
           Probably lost some body fluids.
                         
                          HECTOR
           And that, that kid Richie. That Richie's been busted for
           drugs... and Casey hates his father so much... he set the
           house on fire. So what do you think of that ?
                         
                          BILL
           I think it's good. They should learn to assert themselves.
                         
          A very bright light, coming from above, suddenly shines on the
          bar. Hector and Bill raises their heads. We hear the engine of a
          helicopter and a voice coming from a loudspeaker.
                         
                          THE VOICE
           Hey, the house is surrounded. Come out with your hands up
           and your legs spread !
                         
                          HECTOR
           What the hell is this ?
                         
          We see the helicopter and its powerful floodlight.
                         
                          THE VOICE
           Happy birthday, Hector ! Hey, Martinez, come on out ! We
           got something for you !
                         
          We get a better view of the helicopter. The word «police» is
          written on its fuselage. Two uniformed cops are standing on the
          right skid. One has a megaphone.
                         
           VOICES OF THE COPS
           Martinez, happy birthday, man !... Happy birthday !
          The crowd starts singing, accompanied by the Mexican orchestra.
                         
                          THE CROWD
           For he's a jolly good fellow ! For he's a jolly good
           fellow ! Which nobody can deny ! Which nobody can deny !
          Bill and Hector come in front of the crowd, and look up.
           For he's a jolly good fellow ! For he's a jolly good... !
          People yell and whistle.
                         
          One of the cops standing on the right skid is a woman. She gets
          her pants down and shows her buttocks to the crowd. Another cop,
          on the other skid, has another megaphone.
           People scream when they see the female cop's buttocks.
                         
                          BILL
           If I had known it was your birthday, I'd have come by
           tomorrow.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Me too.
                         
          The helicopter flies away.
           Large shot on the orchestra singing.
                         
                          ORCHESTRA
           Estas son las mananitas. Que cantaba el Rey David.
                         
          In a corner of the bar, Bill and Hector are eating quietly.
          Thunder rumbles and the first drops of rain start falling. The two
          men get up to find a shelter.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Oy. Oigan, ivengan a buscar el cake ! Better get your cake.
           Ivengan a buscar el cake !
                         
          People stop dancing and run to find a shelter.
                          A MAN
           Everybody inside !
                         
                          BILL
           How come you didn't mention Buck ?
                         
                          HECTOR
           There wasn't anything on him.
                         
          BUCK'S RESIDENCE - STREET IN FRONT OF HOUSE - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          It's raining. Bill drives with lights on and roof closed. On the
          side of the car, we can see the dents from the chase with the red
          car. Bill stops in front of a big vehicle. He switches off the car
          lights, gets out of the car, and pulls the collar of his jacket
          up. He stops near a car parked in front of Buck's house. He goes
          round the vehicle. There is a bullet hole in the windshield. Bill
          touches the bullet hole. He then walks toward the house, and stops
          in front of the open garage door. Inside is a red car. Bill enters
          the garage to have a better look at the car. When he gets up after
          inspecting the car, we see Buck standing behind him. Bill turns
          around. Buck has a gun in his hand.
                          BUCK
           You caught me at a bad time.
                         
                          BILL
           Can we get in out of the rain?
                         
          Slowly Buck starts walking toward the inside of the house. Bill
          starts walking too in front of Buck. They enter the house.
                         
          BUCK'S RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          They get inside the house, which is lit only by the street lights
          and a unique lamp above the desk.
           Typical bachelor's place. Very messy. The furniture is simple and
          practical.
           We hear the storm rumbling in the distance.
                         
                          BUCK
           Have a seat.
                         
          Buck gets into the bathroom, the door of which is wide open, and
          grabs a towel. He dries himself and throw the towel to Bill. Bill
          sits down. Buck sits down on an armchair covered with a tartan
          rug. Bill dries his face. He looks at the gun, still in Buck's
          hand.
                         
                          BILL
           I don't like guns.
                         
          Buck shoves angrily the gun between the armrest and the cushion of
          his seat. He lies back in his armchair which rocks a little. Bill
          takes his jacket off.
           A lightning floods the room with a very bright light. Buck puts
          his hands on his face. He moans.
                         
                         
                          BUCK
           Oh, shit !
                         
                          BILL
           Was it raining like this that night ?
                         
                          BUCK
           Yeah. We were drivin'... me, my wife, my daughter. This guy
           comes out wavin', "Stop!" So I slow down. My wife said,
           "No, not here, Buck. It's a bad neighborhood. Besides, the
           baby's asleep in the back." And I said, "Bad neighborhood,
           nothing." So I stopped. Never even made it to the other
           car. I could hear the shots being fired, but my eyes
           wouldn't open. L...
          Another lightning. Buck puts his hands on his head.
           Oh, man ! The rain brought me around. This heavy, heavy
           rain. And I'm on the sidewalk, and I crawl over... and pull
           my way up and... There are two lateral shots... to the head
           for my wife... and a single shot through the heart for my
           daughter. Oh, Jesus, God ! Oh, Jesus. They got, uh... They
           got $31. The rain nails me every time, man.
                         
                          BILL
           Did they ever find out who did it ?
                         
                          BUCK
           No. I think it was some kind of payback for something. But
           that's a long story.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - GARAGE - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          The rain has stopped, but the ground is still wet. The garage door
          opens slowly and Bob's car enters the garage. The roof is still
          closed. Bill is on the phone.
                         
          MAIN POLICE STATION - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          A telephone rings in an empty office, separated by a glass
          partition from the corridor. The door is open and Anderson comes
          running in, with a ready-cooked dish in his hand. He picks up the
          phone.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Officer Anderson. What can I do for you?
                         
                          BILL'S VOICE
           It's Dr. Bill Capa. Remember me ?

          vintage decoration, contrasting with the modern and functional
          furniture.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Oh, yeah, yeah. The Bob Moore murder case.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - INSIDE CAR - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          The car has stopped but Bill still holds the phone.
                         
                          BILL
           I need to talk to you.

                          ANDERSON
           I hope you're an early riser. I get off at 6:00.

                          BILL
           Okay.
                         
          He puts the phone down, gets his car keys and his jacket, and
          leaves the car.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - GARDEN - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Bill gets out of the car and seems very intrigued by the fact that
          the keyhole-shaped door is open. He shuts his car door, and walks
          quietly toward the house. He looks around him in the garden,
          seeming more and more anxious. Finally, he enters the house.
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Still anxious, Bill walks along the corridor.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Bill enters the kitchen. A lot of cooking ingredients scattered on
          the table. A noise makes Bill turn around. Rose, who was kneeling
          behind the table, stands up. She smiles when she sees Bill.
                         
                          ROSE
           Hey.
          She snickers. The only piece of clothing she is wearing is a hotel
          room-maid white apron.
           Busy day ? Can I get you something ?
          Bill doesn't react at all. He looks shocked.
           No ? Okay.
          She crosses the room to get something in a drawer, showing her
          naked buttocks. All of a sudden, she seems to remember she is
          naked and put the two square fireproof cloths she is holding on
          her buttocks.
           Oh! I forgot about that !
          She laughs then comes back to the stove, where she moves a dish.
           Bill's face still looks very shocked.
                         
                          BILL
           How did you get in here ?
                         
                          ROSE
           Last time I was here, I stole the key. It was by the door.
                         
                          BILL
           What about the alarm ?
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh ! I never thought about that.
                          BILL
           It didn't go off ?
                         
                          ROSE
           No. Um, did I make a mistake ? You have someone in the
           car ?
                         
                          BILL
           No, goddamn it, there isn't someone in the car ! People are
           getting killed around here ! You walk around like it's
           goddamn Disneyland ! What if something were to happen to
           you ?
                         
                          ROSE
          She seems not to understand Bill's anger.
           I just thought that it would be a nice surprise, that's
           all. You don't look too happy to see me.
                         
                          BILL
          He waits a few second before he cools down.
           This is my happiness mode. I'm sorry.
                          ROSE
          She is crying. Bill comes to her and takes her in his arms.
           I'm sorry.
                         
                          BILL
           I'm sorry. Baby, I'm sorry. This is a very nice surprise.
          He gives a quick look at her naked body. She laughs.
           Really nice. I'm sorry.
          They kiss.
                         
                          ROSE
           I'll never take a risk like that again.
                         
                          BILL
           Why don't you take the biggest risk of all and give me...
           your phone number.
                         
                          ROSE
          She laughs and goes away from him and back to her cooking.
           Christ, Capa ! I can't have people tying up the phone
           lines. I'm trying to run a business here.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Bill, with his shirt completely open, eats spaghettis in front of
          a lighted candle. Rose also eats spaghettis, still dressed only in
          her white apron. Bill drinks from a glass of white wine. Rose
          bites into a asparagus in a slightly erotic way. Under the glass
          table, we can see Bill's naked foot stroking Rose's foot. With her
          other foot, Rose moves Bill's pants up. Rose slides down on her
          chair, so Bill can reach her feet with his hands. Then Rose slides
          completely out of her chair and under the table.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          A toy remote-controlled tank is moving on Rose's naked legs. The
          shot gets larger and we discover that Rose is in a bathtub full of
          foaming water.
                          BILL
          Voice over.
           General Patton comes out of the foothills.
          The tank moves on Rose's pubis, then on her stomach.
           Oh, he's in the swamp. Oh, oh, he's in the deep abyss.
          The tank skid on Rose's naked skin and doesn't succeed in climbing
          on her breast. We then see she is lying on her back on Bill's
          naked body, who is also lying on this back in the bathtub.
           Ooh! Ooh ! And now... Oh, he's having a problem. He's up in
           the Swiss Alps, ladies and gentlemen.
          They both laugh. We see Bill's hand holding the remote control.
           Fire one. Fire... Oh !... A direct hit !
          The tank skids into the water and stops.
                         
                          ROSE
          Voice ironically disappointed.
           Oh.
                         
                          BILL
           Oh, our, our tank fleet is crippled.
                          ROSE
           Yeah ?
                         
                          BILL
           It's goin' away.
                         
                          ROSE
          She turns around and we guess she is grabbing Bill's penis under
          water.
           How's the submarine fleet ?
                         
                          BILL
           Hey, hey, hey, hey, please, please. I gotta get some sleep.
                         
                          ROSE
          They kiss.
           Oh, you're chicken.
                         
                          BILL
           I gotta be up...
                         
                          ROSE
           You're chicken.
                         
                          BILL
           I gotta be up at 6:00 in the morning.
                         
                          ROSE
          She turns around to kiss him.
           You're chicken, chicken.
                         
          LOS ANGELES CENTRAL MARKET - MARKET BUILDING - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Tracking shot down a high glass building until it reaches the
          entrance of the «Grand Central Market».
           We hear Anderson and Bill in voice over.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Nobody told me Buck was one of your patients.
                         
                          BILL
           "Nobody," like Martinez ?
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Right.
                         
                          BILL
           That's the same "nobody" who didn't tell me Buck was a cop.
                         
          The camera is now on street level and we see Bill and Anderson
          crossing the street towards the main gate of the market. They pass
          a truck delivering fresh meat.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Fucking Martinez. That's a can of worms you don't want to
           mess with.
                         
                          BILL
           What about Buck ?
          They enter the market.
                         
          LOS ANGELES CENTRAL MARKET - INSIDE THE MARKET - INTERIOR DAY
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Hey, look, you gotta promise... if I tell you what I know
           about this shit, it stays between me and you. And you never
           heard it from me, okay ?
          They walk in the market alleyways. Anderson stops near a stall,
          and starts talking to a stall-holder we do not see.
           Two, Angelo.
                         
                          BILL
           Why ?
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Why ?
          Two uniformed cops are walking between the stalls. Anderson raises
          his voice to them.
           Because cops are vindictive sons of bitches. Right, Alex ?
          He throws a chicory to a cop, who catches it.
                         
                          ALEX
           Right.
                         
                          ANDERSON
          The cops are gone away. Anderson lowers his voice.
           Fucking asshole. I don't want to spend the rest of my
           career getting pissed on from above, okay ?
                         
                          BILL
           Okay.
                         
                          ANDERSON
          He laughs nervously.
           Martinez was nailin' Buck's wife.
                         
                          BILL
           Holy shit.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Yeah. Both these guys were in narcotics. And those guys
           usually stick together like shit on a shirt... so who knows
           how long it's been going on. Anyway, one day, it came out.
           In the station, they had this big fight in front of
           everybody.
          Anderson takes two little wrapped packages from the unseen stall-
          holder and gives one to Bill.
           Two days later, Buck's wife gets blown away.
                         
                          BILL
          He follow Anderson between the stalls.
           Jesus Christ ! Was there an investigation ?
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Of course there was an investigation. Martinez was a
           suspect. Buck was a suspect. I mean nobody figured Buck
           forgiving her. For a while, half the station was a suspect.
                         
                          BILL
           What do you think ?
                         
                          ANDERSON
           I think Buck and Martinez had a lot of enemies on the
           street. This was just payback
           for both of 'em.
          They have come to a fishmonger stall. The fishmonger wraps a fish
          for Anderson.
                         
          CASEY'S LOFT - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Casey is lying on an exercise bench and lifting weight with a
          pulleys and cables device.
           The phone rings. Casey doesn't move.
                         
           CASEY'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE
           Hi, this is Casey. Can't get to the phone right now, but
           please leave a message.
          A beep, then Bill's voice.
                         
           BILL'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE
           Casey, it's Bill Capa. I got your message and, sure, I can
           make it today. Are you there ?
                         
          A hand appears holding a leather collar, which the hand wraps
          around Casey's neck.
                         
                          CASEY
           Hey !... What... What the hell are you doing here ?
                         
           BILL'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE
           Hello ? Listen, Casey, y-you sounded a little upset. Just
           hang in there, okay ?
                         
                          CASEY
           Let me get this, huh ? No ?
                         
           BILL'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE
           I'll be by this morning. So I'll see you in 30.
                         
                          CASEY
           Well, you think you can do it in 30 ?
                         
          He snickers while the hand tighten the collar around his neck.
                         
          CASEY'S LOFT - PARKING IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bob's car stops in front of the building. Bill, wearing
          sunglasses, gets out of the car and walks toward a three-story,
          impressive but a bit dilapidated, brick building. Evidently, it is
          an old workshop changed into an artist's loft. We can still read
          «Nate Starkman & Son» on the front of the building.
           Bill comes to a large metallic door and presses on an intercom
          button. No answer. He tries again. He raises his head to the above
          windows. No one. He walks a few steps back to get a better view of
          the building.
                         
                          BILL
          He yells.
           Casey !
          CASEY'S LOFT - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Casey is still lying on his exercise bench. Both his hands are
          tied to the weight-lifting device, and his mouth is gagged. He
          groans through the gag.
                         
          CASEY'S LOFT - PARKING - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
                          BILL
          He puts his hands around his mouth to make his voice louder.
           Casey !
                         
          He comes back to the door and presses the intercom button several
          times. He raises his eyes and notice a folded fire-exit ladder. He
          test the strength of the folding gate pulled in front of one of
          the doors. It seems strong enough for him to climb it. He reaches
          the ladder, which he brings down.
                         
          CASEY'S LOFT - ROOF OF THE BUILDING - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bill is now on the roof of the building. He jumps down in a sort
          of yard, in which are scattered various objects : plants, modern
          furnitures and a full-size very realistic plastic sculpture of a
          cow. Bill remains crouched a few second, pats the cow's snout,
          stands up and walks towards a glass wall located on one side of
          the yard. He notices he is above Casey's workshop. He walks along
          the glass wall to a closed window, from which smoke is coming out.
                         
                          BILL
           Oh, Jesus Christ.
          Bill succeeds in forcing the window open. A big cloud of smoke
          gets out of it.
           Casey ! Hey !
          He walks through the open window.
           Casey!
                         
          CASEY'S LOFT - INTERIOR DAY
          Bill walks on the upper gallery, coughing with the smoke. He takes
          off his sunglasses. Down he sees flames around the mantlepiece. He
          gets very quickly down the steps to ground level.
           He goes to the mantlepiece. What looks like pieces of paper are
          burning on the floor around the mantlepiece. He first tries to put
          the flames out with his foot, then he takes a small shovel and
          shovel the flaming papers back into the mantlepiece.
           A curtain suddenly opens on the glass wall above the workshop,
          flooding the room with bright light.
           Bill walks to the center of the room, and notice that paintings
          have been lacerated. On each one, it is the face of a red-hair
          woman which has been taken away. Bill runs back to the
          mantlepiece, where he picks up a piece of what he first thought
          was a piece of paper, but which is actually a piece of canvas from
          the paintings. On the half-burned piece of canvas, the face of a
          woman, who is heavily made up but looks slightly like Rose.
           He puts the piece of canvas down, and notice a slimy liquid on
          the floor. He turns around to try to find out more about this
          slimy liquid.
           He pulls a rope and the painting, hooked on an horizontal cable
          line, start moving toward him. Behind the paintings, hooked on the
          same cable, comes Casey's body, hanging upside down. He looks dead
          and sill have the gag on this mouth. The half-naked body is
          covered with graffitis. The slimy liquid on the floor is Casey's
          blood.
                         
                          BILL
           Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! Shit !
                         
          Suddenly the blood, which was grey seen through Bill's eyes, turns
          red.
                         
          A ROAD - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Sondra's car. Sondra is driving. Rose is on the passenger seat,
          with her Bonnie's hairdo and make-up. The car radio is playing a
          song.
                         
                          ROSE
           I love this song.
                         
                          SONDRA
           I know.
                         
          Honking. Two thirty-year old men, in an open convertible red car.
                         
           THE RED CAR PASSENGER
           You girls want to go dancing ?
                         
           THE RED CAR DRIVER
           Yeah. We're going to a party.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Hi ! Hi !...
                         
          Rose bends over Sondra and kisses her tenderly.
                         
           THE RED CAR PASSENGER
           Well, pardon me !
          The two men look disappointed. Their car speeds up and goes away.
          The two women start laughing. Rose stands up through the open roof
          of the car. She waves to the passing cars. She then sits down and
          moves tenderly very close to Sondra.
                         
                          SONDRA
           What are you doing ?
          Rose takes Sondra's hand and guide it under her skirt toward her
          crotch.
           Wha... No!
          Sondra bursts laughing and takes her hand away. Rose keeps on
          cuddling Sondra who tries to concentrate on her driving.
           Don't ! Don't !
                         
          SONDRA'S RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Music from preceding scene has gone on without interruption. The
          two girls are dancing in front of the mirror. Sondra is wearing a
          tight-fitting black dress and Rose a skirt and a short top which
          shows her belly.
                          SONG WORDS
           Out all night Lady did. When nobody else would. Lady did
           And she did it real good. Once was not enough.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Ah !
                         
                          ROSE
           Sondra, go !
                         
                          SONG WORDS
           Tell me, Katie What would your mama say.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Oh, I'm gonna go change the music.
                         
          While Sondra moves away to change the music, Rose goes to the
          window. In the house across the street, she sees a couple kissing.
          The music stops.
                         
                          ROSE
           Sondra, come here. Oh, come here. My God !
                         
                          SONDRA
          She comes near Rose.
           Oh, my God !
                         
                          ROSE
           These are your neighbors !
                         
                          SONDRA
           They do this all the time.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Oh, wait. Watch, watch! No!
                         
                          ROSE
          She bends down under the window sill and get Sondra down too.
           They're gonna see you !
                         
          They get up and keep on watching.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Oh, I don't believe it !
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh, this is the part ! This is the part !
                         
                          SONDRA
           Oh, my gosh !
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh !
                         
                          SONDRA
           Believe me, they can fuck.
          They laugh.
           Oh, I can't watch this anymore. I didn't see anything.
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh, Sondra, go. I love this song.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Yeah.
                         
          The two girls start cuddling each other. Sondra strokes Rose's
          naked stomach, then her face.
           Close-up on the mirror, which shows the fire in the mantelpiece,
          between the girls legs.
                         
                          ROSE
           Sondra, through the window ! Look ! Look !
                         
          The camera remains on the mirror, which shows the two girls
          climbing on the bed to get a better look.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Oh, what are they doing now ?
                         
                          ROSE
           I can't tell.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Are they gonna do it ? No !
                         
          We see the couple in the house across the street. She is only
          wearing panties and her breast is naked. He is only wearing his
          trunks. They flirt on the couch.
                         
                          ROSE
           My God ! It's gonna happen right now.
                         
          Back to the mirror shot. The two girls, still standing up, are
          slapping each other buttocks. Rose raises Sondra's dress.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Ow !
                          ROSE
           Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
          She sits on the bed and picks up a champagne glass.
           Oh, champagne.
                         
          Sondra comes and sits next to her. Rose gives her her glass.
          Sondra drinks.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Mmm.
                         
          Sondra gives the glass back to Rose, who puts it on a furniture.
          The two faces come very close, and the two girls start exchanging
          tender little kisses. Then Rose moves Sondra's dress down and
          takes her own top off, showing her breast. Sondra seems very moved
          by what she sees. She strokes Rose's face. Their lips are getting
          very close.
           We see Sondra's hand going down Rose's back, and slipping under
          the top of her skirt, showing her buttocks. We see the tattooed
          rose.
                         
                          ROSE
          She moves her face away from Sondra.
           No, no, Sondra. I can't. I can't.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Why ? It's wonderful.
                         
                          ROSE
           Sondra, I'm a jinx.
                         
                          SONDRA
           No. We can cancel each other out.
                         
                          ROSE
          She sobs a little.
           No. I'm not who you think I am. Oh, God, I'm in love with
           somebody and it's all falling apart. I'm sorry.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Look, the sky isn't falling down.
                         
                          ROSE
           Yes, it is.
                         
                          SONDRA
           No. Let's get that silly thing off your head. There. I love
           your brown hair.
          She strokes her hair.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bill sleeps on a leather couch, dressed with a western-style shirt
          and jeans. There is a gun on the low table near his head. We hear
          a buzz. Bill wakes up, gets up and looks at the security TV set.
          He takes the remote control to change the camera.
                         
                          BILL
           Who is it ?
          After two unsuccessful pictures, Rose appears on the screen. She
          is wearing very short pants, a flowered blouse knotted under her
          breast and a small backpack.
                         
                          ROSE'S VOICE
           I'm back.
                         
          Bill opens the gate and looks through the window at Rose crossing
          the garden.
                         
                          BILL
           Here she comes. Wearing a backpack on her back... making
           her look even younger than she is.
          Rose enters the room, puts her backpack down and falls in Bill's
          arms.
           She falls into his arms. And they kiss.
          They kiss.
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh, God. I'm so glad that you're here. I didn't know if
           you'd be in.
                          BILL
           I don't have to be anywhere until this evening.
                         
                          ROSE
           Yeah ?
          She opens her blouse. She doesn't wear a bra and her nipple
          appears.
           So, what color are my nipples ?
                         
          They both laugh. She covers and uncovers her nipple. They kiss
          tenderly.
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh, God. To be normal like this all the time.
                         
                          BILL
           Oh, God, this is better than normal. This is much better
           than normal. It's just driving me crazy, that's all. I
           mean, I don't really know you... who you are... what you
           do... if you're safe, when you're coming by. You have all
           the power. I just sit around here and wait for you.
                         
                          ROSE
          She cries.
           You do ?
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah. I mean, other things happen, but... in the "what I
           wait for" department, you're it.
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh, my.
                         
          Time has elapsed. They are now seated next to each other. Bill is
          bare-chest and Rose is wearing one of Bill's denim shirts. They
          look at a photo album. Rose puts her finger on the pictures and
          Bill tells her who it is.
                          BILL
           Bob's wife. My ex-wife.
                         
                          ROSE
           She's pretty.
                         
                          BILL
           Pretty fucked up.
          Rose flips the page. A picture of Bob.
           Oh, God. I forget that he's dead.
          She kisses him tenderly to comfort him.
                         
                          ROSE
          She flips the page.
           He looks so young here. God, how long ago were these
           taken ?
                         
                          BILL
           Ten years ago.
                         
                          ROSE
           Really ? Do you have anything more recent ?
                          BILL
           Maybe. Hold on.
          He gets up and goes to the shelves. He start looking for another
          album.
           I don't know why he kept this hidden back here except
           maybe... because it had a picture of his wife naked, which
           leads me to believe that... the relationship wasn't as dead
           as they were pretending.
          He sits back next to Rose, and start looking at the new album.
           I don't know who these people are.
                         
                          ROSE
          She seems very worried all of a sudden.
           No. It's morbid. I don't want to see anymore. Let's go
           outside. Let's pretend it's Sunday. Yeah? You wanna?
                         
          Bill looks at her, a bit disconcerted by her unexpected reaction.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - GARDEN - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          We hear the birds chirping. By the poolside, Bill is lying on his
          back on a mattress. He is wearing sunglasses, and is naked except
          for a white towel spread on his pelvis. Rose is lying on her
          stomach, head to foot with Bill. She is naked but is wearing one
          thick woolen sock on one foot.
                         
                          BILL
           One of my patients was killed last night. He was murdered.
                         
                          ROSE
          She seems very disturbed by the news.
           What ?
                         
                          BILL
           The painter. Casey.
                         
                          ROSE
          She has tears in her eyes.
           Were you there ?
                         
                          BILL
           A little bit after.
                         
                          ROSE
           What did you see ?
                         
                          BILL
           You don't want to know.
          He takes off his sunglasses and start getting up, covering his
          crotch with the towel.
           About a half hour before group. I'm gonna get a shower. You
           gonna be okay out here ?
                         
                          ROSE
           Yeah.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - BATHROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bill enters the bathroom and turn the shower faucet on. Then he
          gets out of the room.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bill takes a pair of jeans in the closet and puts it on, without
          underwear.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Rose has dressed up. She enters the room and goes directly to the
          shelf where the photo album was hidden. She gets it and starts
          turning the pages.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - UPPER GALLERY - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bill comes out of the dressing room, and into a gallery above the
          sitting room. He sees Rose looking through the album, taking a
          picture out of the album and then putting the album back where it
          was. He hides behind a wall for her not to see him. She is looking
          inside a photo-lab envelope. Bill comes out of his hiding.
                         
                          BILL
           Rose.
                         
                          ROSE
          She jumps.
           Oh ! Oh !
          She drops the envelope, picks up her backpack and runs out of the
          room.
                         
                          BILL
           Rose ! Rose !
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - GARDEN - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Rose runs to the keyhole-shaped door. The gate opens and Rose runs
          out.
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bill runs down the stair from the upper gallery. He is bare chest
          with his shirt in his hand.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - ROAD IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Rose gets out of the residence and runs to her car, a small ORV.
          She climbs in and starts very fast. Bill gets out of the house.
                         
                          BILL
          He jumps into his car without opening the door.
           Rose ! Jesus !
                         
          Bob's car get's out of the residence.
                         
          MAIN ROAD, THEN CITY STREETS - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          We see Bill driving his car. He chases Rose, whom we then see in
          her car. Tires screech with the high speed driving. Bill comes
          closer to Rose and tries to memorize her license plate numbers.
                          BILL
           2ASB... 185...
                         
          The chase goes on. Rose drives very recklessly, Bill too. He
          drives through the cross roads without slowing down.
           A man, who was seated on a low wall, has to climb on it to avoid
          Bill's car, which is driving on the sidewalk. Bill stops near him.
          We hear the voice of an angry woman.
                         
           VOICE OF THE ANGRY WOMAN
           Oh ! Stupid, crazy bastard ! They'll give anybody a
           license !
                         
          BOB'S OFFICE - MEETING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Outside, night has fallen and it is raining.
                         
                          CLARK
          He is very smartly dressed, and even wears a bow tie. He counts
          the books on the shelves.
           Five and six are 31. Seven, seven, that makes 45. And that
           will remain 45, and every single time you count it, it will
           be 45, no matter what. And then this is five, and that
           makes 50. And nine is 59. Now that's odd. That's really
           odd. Now there's 59 again.
                         
                          BILL
          He has just come into the room.
           What ?
                         
                          CLARK
           Well, last week... there were 58 books on the bookshelf
           where there is always... and I mean always, 59 books, and
           this week there are 59 again, so I don't...
                         
                          BILL
          He turns toward Sondra.
           Which one, Sondra ?
                          SONDRA
          She is very smartly dressed too, in a white suit with black
          collar. She sighs.
           I didn't read any of it. Really. I felt so bad when I got
           it home. I couldn't help myself.
                         
                          BILL
          He moves rapidly to the shelves.
           Which one, Sondra ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           It... The Van Gogh. But I didn't read any of it. Honestly,
           I promise !
                         
          Bill takes the book and moves away from the shelves. Sondra signs
          menacingly to Clark.
                         
                          CLARK
           What did I do ?
                         
          Bill has seated himself, and he looks through the book. Sondra
          tries to read above his shoulder. Close-up of the book. It is
          Bob's diary. Close-up on one paragraph. We hear Bob's voice
          reading the paragraph.
                         
                          BOB'S VOICE
           I was right about the threats from the Monday group. This
           cycle of pain. Yesterday's victim becomes tomorrow's
           monster. Today's the day.
                         
          Buck enters the room.
                         
                          BILL
           Hi.
                         
          Buck starts closing the door, but Richie comes in.
                         
                          BUCK
           Hi, Bill.
                         
                          BILL
           Hi, Buck.
          Buck sits down.
           Casey, uh... is not gonna be joining us tonight, so I think
           we should get started.
                         
                          BUCK
           That's typical.
          Thunder rumbles. Buck puts his hands on his head. Richie looks at
          him.
           Oh, shit!
                         
                          CLARK
           Buck, are you all right ?
                         
                          BUCK
           It's none of your fucking business.
                         
                          SONDRA
           You know, I can't stand this arguing. Really.
                         
                          CLARK
           I'd like to start, if I may. I'd like to apologize to the
           group and Sondra.
          While he is talking, Bill keeps on looking through his friend's
          diary. A photo is stuck between two pages. It is a photo of Rose
          naked.
           Everything that you said last week in group was right, and
           that's why I lost my temper. Uh, the young lady that I
           mentioned last week... that relationship has been
           terminated. No reason and no hope. She just, just called...
           and told me, and that's it.
                         
                          BILL
          He reads what is written on the back of the photo.
           "The sociopath, lacking the restraints that... hold a
           normal character together, can become anything. Amorality
           frees her to be universally perfect. A charming chameleon
           with a scorpion's tail." Do any of you recognize...
           recognize this woman ?
          He gives the photo to Sondra.
                          SONDRA
          She laughs and brings the picture to her chest.
           Oh, my God ! Oh ! This is my girlfriend. This is Bonnie.
                         
                          BUCK
          He tears the picture away from her hands.
           Give me that !
          He looks at the picture and turns to her.
           This your Bonnie ? This is your Bonnie ? Yeah ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           Yeah. Yeah.
                         
                          BUCK
           The one you've been boring the living shit out of us with ?
           This is the one that's saving you from yourself ? Your
           shopping mall hag ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           Shut up.
                         
                          BUCK
           The one that makes you smile ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           Shut up !
                         
                          BUCK
           The one that you wish was a man ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           What are you getting at, Buck ?
                         
                          BUCK
           That Bonnie ? Is that it ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           That's right, that's it. That's right, That's right.
                         
                          BUCK
           Sondra... this is my Bonnie.
                         
                          SONDRA
          She bursts laughing, but she has tears in her eyes.
           You're lying. You're lying. You're lying. You're lying ! I
           don't believe you !
                         
          Bill looks intensely at her. Sondra has started sobbing.
                         
                          CLARK
          He tears the picture away from Buck's hands.
           Let me see that.
                         
                          BUCK
          He puts his head in his hands.
           Fuckin' A !
                         
                          CLARK
          He looks at the picture.
           Well, yes, of course. This is the woman that I've been
           talking about. This is my Bonnie.
          Buck tears the picture away from his hands.
           Goddamn it, Buck ! Don't do that ! Do not do that !
                         
                          BUCK
           Hey, hey, hey !
                         
          They are ready to fight. Sondra comes between them. The three of
          them are talking together.
                         
                          SONDRA
           You're lying to me ! Why are you lying to me ?
                         
                          CLARK
           Stop acting like an... Like an emotional child !
                         
                          BUCK
           Goddamn tar baby !
                         
                          SONDRA
           You're making it up ! You're making it up !
                         
                          CLARK
           Nobody's making anything up... and stop it, stop it, stop
           it !
                         
          During this heated verbal exchange, Richie has picked the fallen
          picture from the floor.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Stop it !
                         
                          CLARK
           Quit it ! You're crumpling the picture up ! I want you to
           stop showing off ! You're a little brat !
                         
                          BUCK
           Fuck it ! You have the emotions of a styrofoam cup !
                         
          We see Richie putting the picture away and leaving hurriedly.
                         
                          CLARK
           You calm down, and you stop...
                         
                          SONDRA
           Where's the picture ?
                         
          Lightning, thunder, and the pictures appears close-up in a hand.
          It is Hector's hand, who looks at them all, sneering.
                         
                          HECTOR
           How in the name of God... could all of you be going out
           with the same woman and not know ? Not have a clue ?
           Including you, Mr. Psycho-fucking-analyst ? Not to mention
           Bob Moore... who probably took this amazing picture himself
           in front of his expensive painting. I'm gonna call the
           Guinness Book of World Records... because I think this
           woman deserves credit. And I'm gonna make sure that all of
           your names are included... so you can all share in the
           glory.
                         
                          BILL
           Well, you should know something about sharing, huh,
           Hector ? I mean, you and Buck must have shared some very
           tender moments... discussing his wife. Huh ? Why didn't you
           tell me the truth ?
                         
                          HECTOR
           What truth is that ?
                         
                          BILL
           Why didn't you tell me Buck was a cop... not to mention a
           suspect in a murder case ? Not to mention you, goddamn it.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Because... I'm not your patient, and I don't have to tell
           you shit !
                         
                          BILL
          He jumps on Hector. Bucks tries to take them apart.
           That's right, you don't have to tell me shit ! Fuckin' tell
           me anything, do you ? Why won't somebody tell me some
           fucking truth ?
                         
                          BUCK
          He has succeeded in taking them apart.
           Get the fuck out of here !
                         
                          BILL
           One fuckin' thing ! Can you do that, Buck ?
                         
                          HECTOR
           You really know how to pick your women, you know that ?
                         
                          BILL
           I know you can't... you lyin' sack of shit !
          He wants to jump again on Hector. Buck holds him back.
           You can't fuckin' do it !
                         
                          BUCK
           Listen. After my wife died, I wanted to slaughter this
           cock-sucker !
                         
                          SONDRA
           Don't ! No more !
                         
                          BUCK
           But I realized we both loved her. It became a, sort of a
           bond between us. Isn't that right, Hector ? Isn't it ?
           Hector ! Jesus God ! I never got the chance to forgive her.
           So I forgave him instead.
                         
                          HECTOR
           All right ! So much for the famous fucking Monday group !
           Now we have a suspect with a tattoo on her ass and no
           address. Now the cops need your help. What about the car ?
           Anybody around here wrote down the license plates numbers ?
                         
                          BUCK
           "The license plates numbers" ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           We didn't even...
                         
                          HECTOR
           Huh ?
                         
          Bill looks at Hector, but says nothing.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Well, I didn't think to-to-to write it down.
                         
          PALACE HOTEL - HALL - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Revolving door of the entrance of the hotel. People are coming
          incessantly in and out. Among them we see Bill coming in. The
          following dialogue is in voice over on the shot of the revolving
          door.
                         
                          HOTEL ATTENDANT
           Hey, welcome back to L.A., Miss Brown.
                         
           HOTEL FEMALE GUEST
           Thanks. Put my bags in my room.
                         
                          BILL
           Dr. Ashland from New York with the psychiatric convention.
                         
                          HOTEL ATTENDANT
           Dr. Ashland ? In the health club.
                         
          HOTEL FITNESS CENTER - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Larry, dressed in tracksuit, is working with one of the fitness
          devices. Bill is standing in front of him.
                         
                          BILL
           I don't think she is a sociopath.
                         
                          LARRY
           Well, then how about something simple and snappy like a
           multiple personality disorder ? You've fallen into a trap.
           You are not well. She is not well. And to you, Iit feels
           like a bond.
          He gets up and starts walking in the room. Bill follow him.
                         
                          BILL
           She's been acting this thing out as if... it's the only way
           for her to have a life.
                         
                          LARRY
           Or lives.
                         
          HOTEL SWIMMING POOL - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Larry is sitting in a whirlpool. Hot water is bubbling all around
          him. Bill is seated by the pool side.
                         
                          LARRY
           You really want to go on seeing her, do you ?
                         
                          BILL
           Yes, I want to see her.
                         
                          LARRY
           In a, a nonprofessional sense ?
                         
                          BILL
           In every sense.
                         
                          LARRY
           I don't have your magical tuning fork. All I know is that
           two people are dead... and she seems an excellent suspect.
           Bill, salmon swim upstream to mate and die. And so do men.
                         
                          BILL
           Is that what I'm doing?
                         
          A STREET NEAR THE MAIN POLICE STATION - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Anderson is walking in the street, a coffee paper cup in his hand.
          He is wearing suit and sunglasses, but also a very flashy necktie.
          Bill dressed in open shirt and sunglasses, walks toward him.
                         
                          BILL
           Anderson ! I need your help with something.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Hey, man, how ya doin'?
                         
          They start walking together in the street.
                         
                          BILL
           I'm sitting in a restaurant last night, and I'm looking out
           the window... watching this woman trying to back out of a
           space right in front of mine.
                          ANDERSON
           A beautiful woman ?
                         
                          BILL
           Stunning. Anyway, the next thing I know, she busted out the
           headlight on my car.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Uh-oh. Drives away, right ?
                         
                          BILL
           I don't even think she knew what she did.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           But you'd like to meet her ?
          Bill answers with a silly smile.
           All right, um, I'll see what I can do. You got the license
           number ?
                         
                          BILL
          He gets a piece of paper out of his shirt pocket and gives it to
          Anderson.
           Yeah. Thanks, man. All right. Thanks.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Sure.
                         
          The two men split up. Anderson walks into the police office.
                         
          STREETS, THEN PARKING BUILDING IN L.A. - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bob's car, still dented all over, starts, with open roof, and Bill
          driving. He is wearing sunglasses.
           As the car passes a crossroad, we see, coming on its right , the
          «red car», also dented all over. It starts following Bill.
           Bill parks his car on a parking lot, at the bottom of a parking
          building. The red car climbs to the roof of the building.
           Bill cuts the ignition off, takes his keys and gets out of the
          car. He starts walking along the building, the red car following
          him from the roof.
           The red car stops behind a car parked on the edge of the roof,
          then starts pushing the car. The car breaks the guardrail and
          falls down to the ground. Bill raises his head, sees the car
          coming down, jumps away and falls flat on the ground, just
          avoiding the falling car, which crashes on two other parked cars.
          We see the front of the red car appearing behind the broken
          guardrail. Bill bangs his fist on the ground, while pieces of
          broken cars are flying all around him.
                         
                          BILL
          He yells.
           Damn !
                         
          BUILDING WITH GALLERIES - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          A very picturesque building with multiple open air galleries. On
          one of the galleries, Anderson walks toward Hector who is pointing
          a menacing finger to him.
                         
                          HECTOR
           I ought to shoot you!
                         
                          ANDERSON
           I came to make amends.
                         
                          HECTOR
           So make 'em, loudmouth !
                         
          Full shot of the building. Very typical L.A. architecture, looking
          almost like a movie set. Anderson and Hector are leaning against
          the bannister of one of the upper galleries.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           I just spoke to Bill Capa. This license plate might belong
           to our mystery lady.
                         
          Close up on Anderson and Hector. Anderson gives to Hector the
          piece of paper Bill had given to him. Hector reads the paper.
                         
          NIEDELMEYER'S RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bill runs to the door of the house. He knocks repeatedly and
          forcefully.
                         
                          BILL
           Mrs. Niedelmeyer ! It's Dr. Capa again.
                         
          Edith Niedelmeyer opens the small panel in the door. She looks
          furious.
                         
                          EDITH
           You leave me alone ! Get away from here !
                         
                          BILL
           I need your help, please !
                         
                          EDITH
           Why are you torturing me like this ?
                         
                          BILL
           Mrs. Niedelmeyer, please !
                         
          NIEDELMEYER'S RESIDENCE - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Edith closes the small panel. Several heavy blows on the door,
          which eventually crashes open and gives access to Bill.
           The house is very heavily decorated.
                         
                          BILL
           I need you to listen to me ! My best friend was killed. He
           was stabbed with a knife...
                         
                          EDITH
           You get out of my house !
                         
                          BILL
           ... 38 times in the chest !
                         
                          EDITH
           You-You go away!
                          BILL
          He follows her through the sitting room. They arrive near a bay
          window, behind which we can see a large swimming pool.
           Another patient was bled to death ! I think that I might be
           next !
                         
                          EDITH
           Go away !
                         
                          BILL
           I don't have anywhere else to go, Mrs. Niedelmeyer ! What
           are you hiding from me ? What is it ?
                         
                          EDITH
           Nothing.
                         
                          BILL
          Why won't you tell me the truth ?
          Edith picks up a cordless phone on a table. Bill tears the phone
          away from her hands.
           Put that phone down.
                          EDITH
           I'm calling the police !
                         
                          BILL
           Put the phone down ! Put the phone down !
                         
                          EDITH
          She falls on the armchair in which Bill has pushed her.
           Please ! What kind of twisted creature are you ? I've never
           done anything to you.
                         
                          BILL
           My patient Richie is involved...
                         
                          EDITH
           Why in God's name are you doing this horrible joke ?
                         
                          BILL
           If you just help me...
                         
                          EDITH
           Richie Dexter is dead ! He killed himself four years ago.
                         
                          BILL
           Why ?
                         
                          EDITH
           Because he couldn't stand... what my husband was doing to
           him.
          She gets up goes to the window bay and open a glass door. She
          leans against the frame of the door.
           He hung himself with a belt. He was 12. I didn't know ! I
           mean, how could I know ? Nobody knew.
                         
                          BILL
           What about the family ?
                          EDITH
           He is survived by his brother, Dale. If Richie Dexter were
           alive today... he'd be 16 years old. He also had a sister,
           Rose.
                         
          Bill stands still for a few seconds. He has just understood the
          truth. Then he sighs and rushes out of the house. He runs near a
          impressive mantlepiece decorated with a fierce lion head pulling
          its tongue out.

          Bob's car arrives on the empty parking lot in front of Dale's
          workshop. The atmosphere is even more uncomfortable at night than
          during the day. Lightnings in the sky. There are lights evenly
          placed all along the high chimney. Several windows are lit on the
          first floor of the building.
           Bill parks the car in front of the building, gets out the car
          and runs toward the building. He enters using the door with the
          sign «Beware of dog».
                         
          DALE'S WORKSHOP - LIVING QUARTERS - INTERIOR NIGHT
          Bill gets in the living quarters of the Dexter. It is quite dark.
          In one corner, a large kitsch statue of Christ of the Sacred
          Heart. A sink with two cabinets with glass doors..
           Bill pushes the sliding door leading to the workshop.
                         
          DALE'S WORKSHOP - WORKSHOP - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Bill walks between statues being worked on. He bumps into a small
          cage hanging from the ceiling.
           He opens a door which leads him into a small room covered with
          spiderwebs. Something liquid drops on his hand. It's blood. Bill
          raises his head.
           Though a gate in the ceiling, he sees the crying face of Richie.
           He gets out of the small room, takes a big piece of carved wood
          on a table, and climbs the steps leading to the upper parts of the
          workshop.
           When he arrives in the upper gallery, he menacingly waves the
          piece of wood, and walks very cautiously. Richie is seated with
          his back to him. He has blood on his T-shirt.
                         
                          BILL
           Richie.
          He gets nearer and puts the piece of wood down.
           Jesus Christ !
          When he is close to Richie, he sees that his T-shirt is badly torn
          down and full of blood. He wants to touch it, but Richie starts
          moaning. Bill kneels near him.
           What did he... What did he do to you ?
                         
                          RICHIE
          He can hardly talk, and stammers even more than usual.
           W-What I... d-deserved. Y-You shouldn't be here. Get away
           from me.
                         
                          BILL
           Richie... Richie... I have to see Rose.
          He takes off Richie's glasses.
           I need her.
          He takes off Richie's wig, and Rose's face appears.
                         
                          ROSE
          She has gone back to Rose's voice, and doesn't stammer anymore.
           Get away from me, please ! You'll make it worse !
                         
                          BILL
           Where's Dale ?
                         
                          ROSE
          She cries.
           L-I don't know, but he'll be back ! L-I don't know where he
           is.
                         
                          BILL
          He is also crying.
           Was this your idea, to become Richie ?
                         
                          ROSE
           No ! No ! L-It happened. It just happened.
                          BILL
           What? What happened, Rose ? Please. I need to know.
                         
                          ROSE
           When Richie died... Dale buried the body and then he said,
           "Richie, come here." And I told him, I told him, "My name
           is Rose !" He slapped me so hard, I couldn't get up. A-And
           he, he made me dress in these clothes... and h-he did
           things to me that made me not want to be a woman anymore. I
           was Richie from then on.
                         
                          BILL
           What happened to Rose ?
                         
                          ROSE
           After a while, I forgot about Rose. Then Richie got busted.
                         
                          BILL
           And you had to come to group.
                         
                          ROSE
           They were our world. They were our family.
                         
                          BILL
           But then what ? Rose started coming back ?
                         
                          ROSE
           No! Rose, Rose was too scared, so Bonnie came out. Bonnie
           was first.
                         
                          BILL
           Oh, honey.
                         
                          ROSE
           Help me, please ! Help me.
          Rose moves her eyes down and Bill follows her eyes. He discovers
          that Rose's hand has been nailed to the carved armrest of the
          armchair.
                          BILL
           Jesus! Oh, my God !
          Bill stands up.
           Oh! Jesus Christ ! Jesus Christ !
          He goes to the table where he had dropped the piece of wood and
          start looking for an appropriate tool. He finds a big hammer.
           That crazy bastard !
          With the forked end of the hammer, he raises the nail.
                         
                          ROSE
          She cries and yells.
           Oh, God !
                         
          Bill gets the nail off. Rose can't breathe anymore. Her eyes are
          rolling upwards.
                         
                          BILL
          He feels that she is going away from him.
           Rose !
                         
                          ROSE
          She goes back to Richie's voice and face. She starts stammering
          again.
           Get away f-from me!
                         
                          BILL
           Rose, come back ! Richie ! Richie, leave her alone !
                         
                          ROSE
          Still talking like Richie.
           I never get to be out a-anymore.
                         
                          BILL
           Rose. Come on.
                         
                          ROSE
          Rose's head stands up : she is gone back being Rose.
           And then I met you and the fog... Started to lift.
          Bill takes off the other nail.
           It did. It did.
                         
                          BILL
           I know. Come on, let's go.
          He helps her to stand up, and then to walk.
           Let's go. Here we go. Come on. Shh. Come here.
          They start going down to the workshop.
           Here we go. Here we go. Let's move.
                         
          We hear the sound of a nail-gun, and a nail clicks on a piece of
          metal near them.
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh !
                         
          Several nail-gun shots. Nails are getting stuck in the various
          wooden objects around them.
                         
                          DALE
          Shot from behind Dale. He holds a nail-gun and keeps on shooting
          nails.
           Back up!
          He sticks a nail in Bill's shirt. Bill remains nailed against a
          carved wooden panel.
                         
                          ROSE
          She yells and holds Bill tightly.
           No ! No, Dale, don't !
                         
                          BILL
           Get back ! Get back !
                         
                          ROSE
           Dale, no !
                         
                          DALE
           Quick tongue, slow wit. Deadly, Doctor.
          Bill tries to take the nail off. The nail must have gone through
          his flesh, because there is blood on his shirt.
           Deadly.
                         
          Dale raises his nail-gun slowly, but Hector appears from behind a
          wall, holding a «real» gun.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Hi, Dale. You fucking daffodil. Put that toy down. Put it
           in the toolbox. Now ! I got .45 caliber nails in this gun !
                         
                          BILL
           What are you doing here, Martinez ?
                         
                          HECTOR
          He talks to Bill who is behind him, but without taking his eyes
          away from Dale.
           Aren't you glad I'm here ? Anderson snitched you out !
           That's what happens when you try to outsmart a cop ! Let
           that be your psych lesson for the day !
                         
          At the end of his sentence, Hector slightly turns his head toward
          Bill. Immediately Dale shoots him. Hector bends down a little
          because of the pain, and stands back up to shoot Dale. But Dale is
          faster than him and nails both of his hands against the wood
          panel.
                         
                          HECTOR
          He yells.
           Go ! Run !
                         
                          BILL
           Go ! Get over there ! Get over there !
                         
                          ROSE
           No ! No !
                         
          Dale keeps on shooting and sticks several nails in Hector's
          fingers.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Go ! Run ! Run ! Run ! Run ! Go !
          Bill succeeds in getting the nail off his arm. He runs away with
          Rose.
           We follows them through the workshop. As they reach a staircase,
          we hear an engine starting. Then a whole block of shelves falls in
          front of them. We see Dale in a small glass cabin, his hands on
          the controls of a handling machine.
           Bill moves Rose away from him...
                         
                          BILL
           Let's go!
                         
          ... just as a huge piece of furniture falls on Bill, who falls
          down, stuck under the furniture.
                         
                          ROSE
           No ! Get out !
                         
          Dale appears behind Bill, and wraps a leather belt around his
          neck. He tightens the belt. Bill suffocates. Dale pulls him by the
          belt across the workshop.
                         
                          DALE
           Come on ! Come on !
                         
          He puts him inside a metal cage. He ties the belt on the top of
          the cage. Bill tries, with both hands to move the belt away from
          his throat.
                         
                          BILL
           You fucking son of a bitch !
          Dale takes a small electric saw, switches it on and tests it on
          the bars of the cage. Sparks spring up.
           You really fucked it up, didn't ya ? Got your little
           brother killed.
                         
                          DALE
           No !
                         
                          BILL
           You let old Niedelmeyer do it to him.
                         
                          DALE
           No, I saved him !
                         
                          BILL
           You knew what was happening...
                         
                          DALE
           I didn't know !
                         
                          BILL
           Because it happened to you before !
                         
                          DALE
           Would you goddamn shut up ?
                         
                          BILL
           Could have saved your little brother, but he killed
           himself.
                          DALE
          He is getting angry.
           Shut up ! Shut the fuck up !
                         
                          BILL
           You failed, Dale. And you made Rose become Richie !
                         
                          DALE
          He calms down and smiles.
           Oh, you're smart. You're really smart. Bob Moore was smart,
           but I put a stop to that.
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah, you did.
          He coughs.
           Why'd you kill Casey, Dale?
                         
                          DALE
           Why are you head-shrinkers all alike, huh ? Y-You can't
           keep your fucking hands off of us. Huh ? Always pokin' and
           pushin'. Huh ?
          While talking, he keeps on switching his saw on and off.
                          BILL
           Why'd you do it, Dale ?
                         
                          DALE
           Because... that little bitch, Rose, she started sneaking
           out... playing like Bonnie, modeling for him night after
           night. Christ, Bill, he was lookin' right through her...
           gonna recognize Richie in group. Well, I might have missed
           old Niedelmeyer... but I sure as hell got Bob... real good.
           - And now...
          He starts his saw. Sparks spring up on the edge of the cage.
           I'm gonna cut you into little pieces and sand the skin off.
                         
                          BILL
          He snickers.
           The inspiration of madness, Dale.
                         
                          DALE
           The tyranny of normalcy, Bill.
                         
          He starts his saw again, and slowly moves it close to Bill. We
          hear the sound of the nail-gun and a nail gets stuck in Dale's
          shoulder. The saw stops. Dale walks back a few steps to face Rose,
          holding the nail-gun pointed on him.
                         
                          DALE
           Richie.
                         
                          ROSE
           My name is... My name is Rose.
          He rushes on her. She shoots and sticks a nail in the middle of
          his forehead. Dale falls down. Rose starts screaming.
           No ! No !
          Bill tries to get the belt off his neck. Rose raises the gun to
          her throat, and presses the trigger. But it doesn't work. She
          tries again. It still doesn't work. The gun must be empty.
           No !
          Bill eventually succeeds in getting free, but Rose, after she has
          thrown the gun away, starts running through the workshop.
           No !
                         
                          BILL
          He runs after her.
           Rose ! Rose ! Come back ! Rose !
                         
          DALE'S WORKSHOP - CHIMNEY - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Rose starts climbing the ladder mounted on the body of the
          chimney. Bill follows her and yells.
                         
                          BILL
           Rose ! Rose ! Stop ! Rose !
          Rain is soaking both of them, but they keep on climbing. Thunder
          is rumbling.
           A long distance shot shows the whole chimney, with Rose and Bill
          climbing on it.
           Wait ! Rose!
                         
                          ROSE
          She sobs.
           Don't !
                         
                          BILL
           For God's sakes, don't jump ! Rose !
                         
                          ROSE
          She has reached the circular platform on the top of the chimney.
          She yells.
           No !
                         
                          BILL
           Rose ! Stop !
                         
                          BILL
          He reaches the platform.
           No ! No. No !
                         
                          BILL
           Wait !
                         
                          ROSE
           Why ?
                         
                          BILL
           Rose ! No ! Stop, please !
          Rose jumps on the very narrow ring which circles the platform.
           Just stay there !
                         
                          ROSE
           It's too late. I've gone too far. I can't go back.
                         
                          BILL
           If you go, I go ! I swear to God ! I swear to God.
                         
                          ROSE
           Why would you do that ?
                          BILL
           Please, God, just come over here. I don't want you to die.
           Just give me your hand. Take a risk ! There's no risk in
           dying. Come on.
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh, Capa.
                         
                          BILL
           Come on.
                         
                          ROSE
          She puts her hand out to Bill's strutted hand. We hear the sound
          of a high gust of wind, and Rose looses her balance and starts
          falling backward.
           L... No...
                         
                          BILL
           No !
                         
                          ROSE
           Capa !
          She yells.
           No !
                         
          Bill jumps from the platform and catches a chain hanging under the
          platform. His momentum makes him swing and he catches Rose's arm
          just as she was falling from the outer ring. With his other arm he
          holds on the chain and they start swinging back and forth. They
          eventually reach the chimney ladder. Rose grabs one of the rungs,
          followed by Bill, who pushes her up.
                         
                          BILL
           Come on.
                         
          They move back to the platform, and, as soon as they reach it,
          they hug each other very tight. Bill looks at the beacon on the
          top of the chimney. From white, the beacon becomes red, which is
          its real color. Bill smiles : he sees red again. He hugs Rose even
          more tightly.
                         
                          HECTOR'S VOICE
          While the camera pans away from the platfom, showing the whole
          platform with Bill and Rose holding each other, we hear Hector's
          voice.
           Hey! Listen up, you fucking daffodils ! You gonna leave me
           hanging here all night, huh ?
          Bill starts laughing.
           Get me down, you goddamn cuckoos ! Get me some fucking
           Band-Aids !
          Bill keeps on laughing. Rose starts laughing too.
           Come on, you fucking daffodils ! Get me out of here !
