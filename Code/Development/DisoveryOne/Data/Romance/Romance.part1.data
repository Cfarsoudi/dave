INT. EXAM ROOM - DAY

We're not exactly sure where we are. And we're not exactly
sure who's talking. All we know is that we are looking at a
foot. One bare foot with chipped red polish.

                    ZOE (V.O.)
          I can't believe I didn't get a
          pedicure for this. How
          embarrassing. Look at that...

The toes open and then curl down as if trying to hide.

                    ZOE (V.O.)(CONT'D)
          What's wrong with me? If I were
          with a real guy doing this, I
          would've gotten a pedicure. And a
          wax. I'm pathetic.

The CAMERA PANS to the other foot, which is also chipped.

                    ZOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Fuck, that one's even worse. And
          when did my toes get so fat? No
          wonder I'm alone. I'm a fat-toed
          animal.

Zoe lets out a sigh.    She speaks out-loud now.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          Sorry I didn't get a pedicure.

                       DR. HARRIS
          What?

DR. HARRIS (mid-fifties, jovial) looks up from between Zoe's
knees, the light on his head flashing right in Zoe's eyes.

                    ZOE
          My toes...sorry.

                    DR. HARRIS
          I'm not looking at your toes.

                     ZOE
          Right.   Duh.

Dr. Harris stands and takes off his gloves.


                       DR. HARRIS
          All done.
                                                           2.


                       ZOE
          That's it?

And now, for the first time, we see ZOE. Despite the paper
gown and worried look on her face, she's a late-30-something,
girl-next-door type. She could be your best friend.

                    DR. HARRIS
          I'll elevate your legs for ten
          minutes and then you're good to go.

He sets a kitchen timer and then pushes a button to raise her
legs. We hear the loud TICK TOCK of the timer.

                    ZOE
          This is the first time I've heard
          that ticking clock sound and it
          doesn't freak me out.

                     DR. HARRIS
          Good.   Just relax.

                    ZOE
          I can't, I'm totally freaking out.

                    DR. HARRIS
          Everything's going to be great. I
          have a feeling you and...
              (checks empty syringe)
          Number CRM-101404 are going to make
          beautiful babies together.

Zoe smiles.   Maybe he's right.   Yeah...of course he's right.

                    BOBBY (V.O.)
          Number CRM-101404? Are you high?


INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY

TITLE UP: FOUR WEEKS AGO

BOBBY, 39 (but says he's 33,) gay and gorgeous, opens a file
and points to a piece of paper.

                    BOBBY
          Says here he has red hair and
          freckles.

                    ZOE
          And glasses, too.

                    BOBBY
          And why are we picking him?
                                                 3.


                    ZOE
          Because he's honest.

                       BOBBY
          He's ugly.

Zoe points to a stack of potential donors.

                    ZOE
          You think they're all telling the
          truth? If they're so smart and
          good looking, why are they beating
          off into a cup?

                    BOBBY
          Have you ever fucked a guy with red
          hair and freckles?

                    ZOE
          No, and I won't have to.

                     BOBBY
          But what about your kid? No one's
          going to want to fuck your kid.
              (beat)
          That came out wrong.

                    ZOE
          Yeah...it's a good thing you're not
          going to be the father.


INT. WAVERLY INN   - NIGHT

TITLE UP: EIGHT WEEKS AGO

Bobby spits out a mouthful of Sauvignon Blanc.

                      BOBBY
          What?    I can't be the father!

                    ZOE
          Come on, we don't have to have sex.

                    BOBBY
          Oh, Jesus, I didn't even think
          about that. Rewind, rewind,
          rewind...

                    ZOE
          You're one of my best friends.
          Don't you want to help me?
                                                           4.


                    BOBBY
          Yeah, but...that's too much. I'll
          walk your dog, tell you when you
          look fat, be honest about your
          eyebrows...

                    ZOE
          Just a few sperm. Big deal. You
          waste billions of them every night.

                    BOBBY
          You know I flee at the slightest
          chance of intimacy. Do you see
          these bags under my eyes? Ricardo
          slept over last night, and he
          wanted to hold me. I actually had
          to fake a seizure.

                       ZOE
          Forget it.     Forget the whole thing.

Zoe sighs and puts her head in her hands.

                     MONA (V.O.)
          Forget the whole thing.    It's just
          a phase...


INT. MONA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

TITLE UP: TWELVE WEEKS AGO.

Zoe and MONA, Zoe's age but looks much older, sit at the
kitchen table.

                    MONA
          You don't want kids.    Trust me.

                    ZOE
          Easy for you to say.    You have
          four.

                    MONA
          Yeah, and it's awful.

Three CHILDREN run through the kitchen yelling and screaming.
A beat later, a TODDLER runs after them crying.

                    MONA (CONT'D)
          They've ruined my life.

                       ZOE
          Come on...
                                                   5.


                    MONA
          Have you seen my vagina?

Zoe shakes her head.

                    MONA (CONT'D)
          Do you want to?

Zoe shakes her head again.

                    MONA (CONT'D)
          I would do that for you. To prove
          to you that you don't want to have
          kids, I will show you my vagina.

                    ZOE
          I don't want to see your vagina.    I
          want a baby. My own baby.

                    MONA
          Is it possible you're just a little
          lonely? You know, you haven't met
          the right guy and--

                    ZOE
          It's not about a guy. I don't need
          a guy. I don't even think I want a
          guy at this point. I've dated a
          hundred guys in the last five
          years, and not one of them is even
          close to being the one. How long
          am I supposed to wait?

                    MONA
          You never know. He could be right
          around the corner.

                    ZOE
          Well, then he's late. And I hate
          people who are late. And what if
          he's not right around the corner?
          What if he's miles away?

Zoe shakes her head.   She becomes very serious.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          I want to have a baby. And time is
          running out. I hear a clock
          ticking every time I close my eyes.
          I need it to stop.

We hear a loud DING.
                                                            6.


INT. EXAM ROOM - DAY

Zoe opens her eyes. We're back in the exam room.      She looks
at the timer, which just hit zero. She smiles.

                        ZOE
          Ding.

Then a tear forms in the corner of her eye. She wipes it
away. She wipes a tear from the other eye. Happy tears.
Then she looks at her legs high above her on the table.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          How the fuck am I supposed to get
          down from here?


INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE HALLWAY - LATER

Zoe walks down the hall with her legs pressed firmly
together, moving only from the knees down. Dr. Harris
passes.

                    DR. HARRIS
          You don't have to walk like that.

                        ZOE
          Oh.   Okay.

Zoe separates her legs an inch.     And then closes them.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          Should we hug? We might have just
          made a baby together.


INT. WAITING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Zoe walks through the waiting room with her legs still
pressed together. She sees two PREGNANT WOMAN, touches her
own stomach and smiles. She finally feels part of this
exclusive baby club.

                        ZOE
          Hi.

                        PREGNANT WOMEN
          Hi.


INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

Zoe enters the elevator where there is a WOMAN holding a
BABY. Zoe smiles at them. Another member of the club...
                                                            7.


                      ZOE
          Hi.

                      WOMAN
          Hi.

The elevator descends. Zoe continues to stare at the baby
with a big smile. She stares for an uncomfortably long time.

                    WOMAN (CONT'D)
          You're starting to freak me out.

                      ZOE
          Sorry.

Zoe looks down.    After a beat, she sneaks another look.

                      WOMAN
          Stop it.


EXT. MADISON AVENUE - DAY

It's POURING outside. The kind of rain that turns umbrellas
inside out. NEW YORKERS run for cover with newspapers over
their heads.

Despite the rain, Zoe skips out of the building with her
hands in the air and twirls around. Realizing that she's
spread her legs too far apart, she snaps them back together.

A WOMAN pushing a baby stroller covered in plastic runs by.

                      ZOE
          Hi!

Zoe looks uptown for a cab. Nope. Nothing. She starts to
walk, still keeping her legs firmly pressed together. She
rounds the corner towards the subway station and then,
miraculously, spies a cab.

                      ZOE (CONT'D)
          Taxi!

She runs (little steps) across the street.


INT. TAXI - MOMENTS LATER

Zoe closes the door behind her.

                    ZOE
          Hallelujah!
                                                          8.


As soon as the word comes out of her mouth, she notices
someone entering the cab from the other side.

This is STAN, early 40s, but looks more like a college kid --
faded jeans, t-shirt, cute, messy hair.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          Uh...excuse me. This is my cab.

                    STAN
          You own it?

                    ZOE
          No, but I'm about to rent it.

                    STAN
          Actually, if we're being technical,
          you kind of stole it.

                    ZOE
          I don't think so.

                    STAN
          If you see someone about to get in
          a cab, you can't just run in from
          the other side and say it's yours.

                    ZOE
          I didn't see you.

                    STAN
          I saw you see me.

                    ZOE
              (to the cabbie)
          Sir, who saw you first?

The CABBIE picks up his paper and starts to read.

                    STAN
          Maybe you're not from around here,
          but there's a code. It's like war,
          even though it's brutal and bloody,
          there are still certain rules we--

                     ZOE
          Fine.   Forget it.   I'll get out.

Zoe grabs the door handle and then turns back.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          But not because you're right, but
          because I am in a terrific mood,
          and you are ruining it.
                                                          9.


                     STAN
          No.   I'll get out.

They each get out.


EXT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS

Zoe and Stan stand on opposite sides of the taxi in the
POURING RAIN. Zoe crosses her arms.

                       ZOE
          Now what?

                    STAN
          I don't know. You tell me.

That question is answered by the cabbie, who now peels out.

                     ZOE
          What? Where's he going?!
              (waving her hands, then)
          Come back!

They both stand there with a taxi's width between them.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          Well, that was stupid. Why'd you
          get out, you, stupid-head?

                     STAN
          You said you were in a great mood
          and I was ruining it. I felt bad.
              (then)
          Did you just call me stupid-head?

Zoe storms off with her little steps.


INT. 68TH STREET SUBWAY STATION - DAY

Stan and Zoe each swipe their Metrocards at the same time.

They enter the subway platform which is jam packed with all
the other NEW YORKERS who are shit-out-of-luck in the cab
department. Rain droplets drip from the ceiling above.

                       ZOE
          Oh, man...

                    STAN
          How's your great mood now?
                                                           10.


INT. 6 TRAIN - DAY

A packed subway car. Zoe and Stan are back-to-back, pushed
together by the crowd. Zoe tries to read her paper.

                    STAN
          How `bout now?

                    ZOE
          Please stop talking to me.


INT. UNION SQUARE SUBWAY STATION - DAY

Zoe and Stan walk up the stairs a few feet apart from each
other. Zoe does her best to ignore the obvious.

                    STAN
          So, why are you in such a good mood
          anyway?

They reach the top of the stairs. The rain has stopped, and
the sun is just starting to peek through. Everything is wet
and has a magical quality.

                    ZOE
          Not that it's any of your business,
          but...good things are happening to
          me.

Stan is moved by this.   What a thing to say.

                    STAN
          That's nice. I hope it continues.

                    ZOE
          Thanks. Well, have a nice life.
          Try not to steal any more cabs.

                    STAN
          You do the same.

They nod and separate.


INT. HUDSON PETS - DAY

Hudson Pets is a small but quaint West Village pet store
filled with dogs, cats and a few rabbits.

Zoe enters. Her dog, NUTS, a raggedy, pug-like dog with hind
legs in a WHEELCHAIR, bounds/wheels towards her, barking.
                                                         11.


                    ZOE
          Hey, Nutsy. How's it going?

She gives Nuts a good scratch. JALISA, mid-30s, Latina
hottie, and Bobby run from the back.

                    BOBBY
          Oh, my God, you're glowing.
              (to Jalisa)
          She's glowing, right?

                     JALISA
          Glowing.   Tell us everything.

                    BOBBY
          Everything.

                    ZOE
          There's not much to tell.

                    BOBBY
          You just got shot up with a wad of
          red-headed-freckle sperm. There's
          something to tell.

                    JALISA
          He had red hair and freckles?

                    BOBBY
          I tried to talk her out of it.

                    JALISA
          Why'd you do that, Mami?

                    BOBBY
              (to Jalisa)
          I know, right?

                       JALISA
          Red pubes.     Eek...

                    ZOE
          I'm never going to see his pubes!

                    BOBBY
          You'll see your kid's pubes.

                    ZOE
          I doubt it.

                    BOBBY
          But you'll know they're there.
                                                          12.


                    ZOE
          What is wrong with you?

                    JALISA
          So, what happened?    Come on...

                    ZOE
          I lay down, put my feet up, five
          minutes later it was over. I
          barely felt a thing.

                    BOBBY
          Sounds like Ricardo.

                    JALISA
          Tell me about it, Papi.

Bobby and Jalisa high five.    Bobby then turns to Zoe.

                    BOBBY
          So...what happens now?

                    ZOE
          Now, we wait.

                    BOBBY
          That's no fun, I want to know if
          I'm going to be a fairy godmother.

                    ZOE
          We'll just have to wait and see.

Zoe smiles and heads for the back.


EXT. HUDSON PETS - NIGHT

The lights in the pet store go dark.   Moments later, Zoe,
Bobby, Jalisa and Nuts exit.

                    BOBBY
          Come on, Zoe, one drink. You can
          have an O'Dhouls or something.

                    JALISA
          We'll go to the piano bar and get
          Bobby to sing some Ace of Base.

                    BOBBY
          Forget it, she's not coming. I can
          tell by the dull look on her face.

                      ZOE
          Love you.
                                                         13.


They all hug.   Bobby and Jalisa walk away arm-in-arm,
singing.

                    BOBBY/JALISA
          I saw the sign and it opened up my
          eyes, I saw the sign...

Zoe turns to lock up.   While her back is turned, Stan appears
from the shadows.

                     STAN
          Hi.

                     ZOE
          Aahhh!

Zoe screams and drops the keys. Nuts, overexcited by Zoe's
reaction, starts to run/wheel in circles and then tips over.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          You scared the hell out of me!

                     STAN
          Oh, wow.   Is he...okay?

Nuts is still on the ground, his wheels spinning.   Zoe sets
him upright.

                    ZOE
          What are you doing here?

                    STAN
          I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare
          you. Or hurt your dog. Don't
          worry, I'm not a stalker.

                    ZOE
          How'd you know I worked here?

                    STAN
          I followed you after the subway.
              (thinks, then)
          That sounds a little stalkery, huh?

                     ZOE
          Yeah.

                     STAN
          I just really wanted to see you
          again. Almost like I had to see
          you again. Can I walk you home?
              (then)
          Is it me or does everything I say
          make me sound more like a stalker?
                                                        14.


Zoe allows a small smile.

                    STAN (CONT'D)
          Can I just give you my card? Here.
          Take my card. I'm not a freak.
          Really. I sell cheese.

This hangs out there for a beat.

                    ZOE
          Cheese?

                    STAN
          Yeah. My family has a goat farm.
          We make cheese. You like cheese?

                    ZOE
          I guess. I've never really thought
          about it.

                     STAN
          Little Goat. Maybe you've seen us
          at the Farmer's market? Come by
          sometime and you can taste my
          cheese.
              (then)
          Okay, I'm going to go. This has
          not gone as planned.

Stan smiles meekly and then turns to go.

                    ZOE
          Bye.

Stan lifts his hand to wave but doesn't even turn around.
Clearly, he feels like an idiot. Zoe watches him go.


EXT. WEST VILLAGE BROWNSTONE - MORNING

Establishing shot of a cute brownstone with window boxes and
a front stoop. We TILT UP to the third floor window.


INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Zoe is asleep with the morning sun on her face. Nuts is
beside her, his two little, lame legs hanging off the pillow.
Zoe opens her eyes.

After a beat, she gets up and walks to the mirror. She lifts
up her pajama top and looks at her stomach, sticking it out
as far as it will go. It's flat as a board.
                                                        15.


INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - DAY

Seven WOMEN sit around the cramped living room of this small,
East Village apartment. At least one woman is nursing a
child that looks entirely too old to still be nursing.

This is the SINGLE MOTHERS BY CHOICE Support Group. CAROL,
40's, short hair, tank top and no bra, is the leader.

                    CAROL
          Everyone, please say hello to Zoe.

                       EVERYONE
          Hi, Zoe.

                    CAROL
          Welcome to Single Mother's By
          Choice. As the name suggests, we
          are all single mothers by choice.
          Some of us have adopted, some
          conceived with a donor, every story
          is different, but with the same
          common denominator. We wanted to
          have a child, and we didn't need a
          partner to make it happen.

The women smile and nod. They are a proud, no-nonsense,
somewhat masculine bunch. LORI, pregnant with a buzz cut,
turns to Zoe.

                    LORI
          Are you a doer or a tryer?

                       ZOE
          Excuse me?

                    LORI
          Are you already a single mother or
          are you trying to become one?

                     ZOE
          Oh, I guess I'm trying. I was just
          inseminated a few days ago.
              (then)
          Inseminated...makes me feel like a
          cow or something.

                     CAROL
          Well, when we don't have partners
          with penises, we do what we've got
          to do, right?
              (then)
          So, tell us a little bit about
          yourself.
                                                       16.


                    ZOE
          Okay. Let's see...um, I own a pet
          store on Hudson Street. Dogs,
          cats, rabbits...no birds, they
          creep me out. Before that, I
          worked for Google, which I
          completely hated. One day, I
          decided life was too short, and,
          against my accountant's advice, I
          quit Google, cashed out and bought
          the pet store. Now I'm really
          happy on the work front, but I
          still haven't found, you know, the
          one.

                     CAROL
          Ah, yes.   The elusive "one."

                    ZOE
          I always imagined I'd be married
          with kids by now, but it doesn't
          look like it's going to happen that
          way. So, time for Plan B.

                    CAROL
          Society tells us we're supposed to
          find that special person to make us
          happy and complete. But guess
          what...you have to create your own
          happiness. You don't need someone
          to complete you, some...man. You
          already are complete.

                    LORI
          Amen, sister.

                    CAROL
          If you want to have a baby, we here
          at Single Mothers By Choice can be
          your partners. We will be your
          emotional rocks.

Zoe looks around at her new "partners." There's SARA, the
one nursing the toddler. And TABITHA, a tall women with an
even taller afro and a nose ring. BRIDGET, a young girl
covered in tatoos. And several more...

                    CAROL (CONT'D)
          From inception to college
          graduation and everything in
          between. We're here for each
          other.

Sara smiles and nods at her nursing child.
                                                        17.


                    SARA
          Dakota was actually born right here
          in this very room. Right where
          you're sitting, actually.

                    ZOE
              (uncomfortable)
          Really? Right here?      Imagine that.

                    SARA
          Best day of my life.

                    ZOE
          And how old is she now?

Dakota looks up from the breast.

                       DAKOTA
          I'm three.


INT. LE PAIN QUOTIDIEN - DAY

Zoe and Mona are sitting by the window sharing a plate of
pastries and a pot of coffee.

                    MONA
          Why did you join a support group of
          unattractive, militant lesbians
          when you have me?

                    ZOE
          Because you're really not that
          supportive.

                       MONA
          Sure I am.

                    ZOE
          You just told me that if I breast-
          feed "my girls" will end up looking
          like empty tube socks.

                    MONA
          I'm just being honest. And don't
          even get me started on what
          childbirth does to your bladder.

                    ZOE
          What does it do to your bladder?

Mona cracks up and then stops abruptly.
                                                      18.


                    MONA
          I just peed a little bit.

                    ZOE
          I don't think I'm pregnant. The
          doctor says it will probably take
          several tries. Something about
          frozen sperm being lazy.

                     MONA
          Good.   Take your time.

Zoe takes a sip of coffee and looks out the window.

                    ZOE
          So, should I call this guy?   Do you
          think that would be weird?

                    MONA
          Do I think it's weird that you're
          pursuing someone at the exact
          moment in time that you might be
          most unavailable? No. Because
          that's what you do. You sabotage.

                    ZOE
              (ignoring her)
          He works at the Farmer's market.
          And it's right around the corner.
          Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

                    MONA
          I look fat and old?

                      ZOE
          No.

                      MONA
          Then, no.

                    ZOE
          Let's go spy on him. Come on. It
          will be fun. Like high school.

                    MONA
          I can't.
              (checks watch)
          This twenty minute breakfast
          concludes my "me" time for the
          week. More proof that you should
          not have kids.
                                                          19.


EXT. FARMER'S MARKET - DAY

The Farmer's Market is crowded with people. We hear the
sounds of a bluegrass band playing somewhere nearby.

Zoe spies the LITTLE GOAT sign. But Stan is not there.    She
looks around the neighboring stalls for him, but no luck.

                      ZOE
          Oh, well.

She walks towards 14th street. We see the bluegrass band on
the steps by the subway station. It's not a big band, just a
few guys with an open banjo case and a sign that reads, "The
Organics." The country twang of the music is in sharp
contrast with the tall buildings all around.

As she gets closer, she notices that Stan is in the band.
He's playing banjo.

Zoe quickly ducks into the nearest food stall, OLIVIA'S
BERRIES. OLIVIA, mid-twenties, natural beauty, approaches.

                    OLIVIA
          Can I help you?

                    ZOE
              (distracted)
          No, I'm fine.

Zoe watches Stan. She mindlessly starts eating some
blueberries out of the display pint. Olivia sees that Zoe is
looking at Stan.

                    OLIVIA
          Tasty, huh?

Zoe nods and takes another berry.

                    OLIVIA (CONT'D)
          All ripe and juicy. And firm, too.
          Bet you could just eat him up in
          one bite, right?

Zoe now turns, confused.

                      ZOE
          What?

                    OLIVIA
          And don't look now, but he's coming
          this way.
                                                            20.


Olivia winks and moves off. Zoe turns back and is now face-
to-face with Stan, who's smiling from ear-to-ear, his banjo
slung over his shoulder.

                     STAN
          A-ha! I didn't scare you away
          after all.

                     ZOE
               (trying to be casual)
          I was just in the neighborhood. I
          thought I'd come by and get some
          blueberries. I'm going to make a
          pie.

                    STAN
          I love blueberry pie.

Stan takes two pints of blueberries and hands them to Zoe.

                    ZOE
          I'm confused. I thought you made
          cheese or something.

                    STAN
          What makes you think I don't?

                    ZOE
          I don't know, you're over there
          playing the banjo.

                    STAN
          Can't someone do both?

                    ZOE
          Honestly, I didn't know anyone did
          either.

Olivia returns.

                    OLIVIA
          Aren't you going to introduce me to
          your new friend?

                    STAN
          Nope.
              (to Zoe)
          Come on. Let me show you around.

Stan puts his arm around Zoe and leads her away.   Olivia
watches them go with her arms crossed.
                                                        21.


EXT. THE LITTLE GOAT CHEESE STAND - LATER

Stan walks Zoe through his cheese stand.

                    STAN
          This is our basic chevre, probably
          our best seller. The cheese that
          started it all, as they say. Then
          over here we have our surface-
          ripened cheeses. These are the
          aged/raw milk cheeses.
              (realizing)
          This is really boring, huh?

                    ZOE
          No, not at all.

                    STAN
          It's like you're in a foreign
          country and the only thing to watch
          on tv is a documentary on cheese.
          You don't want to watch it, but
          somehow you can't stop...

                    ZOE
              (laughing)
          I think it's interesting.    Really.

                    STAN
          All right, you asked for it...
              (boring voice)
          The aged/raw milk cheeses are made
          from raw milk and then aged for
          four to six months. Sometimes
          more. Sometimes less. Usually
          more. Depends on the cheese.

                     FRED
          Stop.   You're killing me.

FRED, early twenties, white guy with Rasta-type dreads, looks
up from behind the counter.

                     STAN
          Fred, Zoe, Zoe, Fred.
              (then)
          She's the one I followed from the
          subway the other day like a total
          psychopath.

                    FRED
          Right...I heard about you.
                                                       22.


                    ZOE
          I don't know whether to be
          flattered or terrified.

                       FRED
          Be afraid.

                    STAN
          Don't scare her away.   I'm trying
          to redeem myself.

                    FRED
          Then you should put down the banjo.
          You look like a doofus.

                    STAN
          Doofus?
              (then, to Zoe)
          Do you think I look like a doofus?

                    ZOE
          I don't really know what a doofus
          looks like.

Fred points to Stan.

                    STAN
          Okay. If I put the banjo down, can
          I take you to lunch or something?

                    ZOE
          I should really get back to work.

                    STAN
          Come on, say the word and we can
          have a six-course tasting menu at
          Union Square Cafe. I know the
          chef.

                    ZOE
          That sounds nice, but, I should
          probably go.

                    STAN
          Well, can I call you?

Zoe smiles.


INT. HUDSON PETS - DAY

Zoe enters the pet store with two big bags of vegetables. As
soon as she steps foot in the store, Bobby and Jalisa accost
her.
                                     23.


          BOBBY
Okay, spill it.

          JALISA
Who is he? What does he do?    How
do we know him?

          ZOE
What are you talking about?

          JALISA
Stan from the Farmer's Market?
He's called twice already.

           ZOE
Really?

          BOBBY
Is he a farmer? Because that's not
okay.

           ZOE
No.   He makes cheese.

          BOBBY
He's a pilgrim?

           ZOE
I don't know what he is. He's cute
and different and plays the banjo.
    (then)
I think I like him.

          BOBBY
What about the, you know, bun in
the oven?

          ZOE
I really doubt I'm pregnant.

          JALISA
You want to be pregnant. You don't
want to be pregnant. I'm confused.

           ZOE
I want to be pregnant. Of course I
want to be pregnant. I mean, I put
a lot of thought into this, right?
    (then)
So what did Stan say?

          BOBBY
He says to name any restaurant you
want to go to.
          (MORE)
                                                        24.

                     BOBBY (CONT'D)
          He'll be there with bells on.
              (then)
          He didn't say the "bells on" part.
          I added that. Sounds a little too
          gay, though, so I take it back.


EXT. 8TH STREET - NIGHT

Zoe walks down 8th street. This is the first time we've seen
her really pulled together, and she looks hot. She turns
into the restaurant she's chosen for the big date.


INT. GRAY'S PAPAYA HOT DOGS - NIGHT

Zoe and Stan stand at the counter with an array of hot dogs
in front of them. Stan looks at the hot dogs skeptically.

                    STAN
          We could have gone anywhere.

                    ZOE
          Just take a bite.   You'll see.

                    STAN
          Per Se, Jean Georges, Nobu...

                    ZOE
          Gray's Papaya.   Cheers.

She clinks his dog and then they each take a bite.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          Good, right?

Stan nods, covering his mouth because the bite is so big.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          You've lived here your whole life
          and never been to Gray's Papaya.
          What's wrong with you?

                    STAN
          I actually haven't lived here my
          whole life. We moved out of the
          city when my parents bought the
          farm....not died, but actually
          bought a farm and moved upstate.

                    ZOE
          That must have been a nice place to
          grow up. On a farm.
                                                         25.


                    STAN
          What about your family?

                     ZOE
          It's just me and my grandmother.
          She lives in a retirement community
          in Queens.
              (an awkward beat)
          My parents died when I was young.

                    STAN
          I'm so sorry.

There is a long silence.   They both stare at the hot dogs.

                    STAN (CONT'D)
          I don't know what to say now.    I've
          made it all awkward and sad.

                     ZOE
          It's okay.
              (then)
          My dad was kind of a bad guy,
          anyway.

                     STAN
          Shit.   I'm so sorry, Zoe.

                    ZOE
          No, come on, we'll get all this
          stuff out of the way so we never
          have to talk about it again. Let's
          ask all the awkward, get-to-know-
          you questions right now.

                     STAN
          Okay.   Good idea.

                    ZOE
          Let's see...are you religious?

                     STAN
          Nope.   What about you?

                     ZOE
          No.

                    STAN
          Have you ever been married?

                     ZOE
          No.
                                                         26.


                      STAN
            Aren't you sick of going to
            weddings?

                      ZOE
            If I have to listen to one more
            couple write their own vows...

                      STAN
            I hate when they write their own
            vows!

They clasp hands. Not in a high-fivey way, but in a
connected, we have so much in common way. Their hands stay
together, feeling the charge between them.

                      STAN (CONT'D)
            What about kids?

Zoe feels the blood rush to her cheeks.   Like everyone there
must now be looking at her.

                      ZOE
            What about them?

                      STAN
            Well, do you want them?

                       ZOE
            Yeah.   I want kids.

She pulls her hand away. This has all gotten suddenly real.
She looks at Stan, almost afraid to ask the next question.

                       ZOE (CONT'D)
            Do you?

                       STAN
            Yeah.   Absolutely.

Zoe nods.   Slowly, she starts to breathe again.


EXT. PERRY STREET - NIGHT

They are now walking home together, arm-in-arm.

                      ZOE
            Okay, first kiss...

                      STAN
            Jen Salzer. Seventh grade. She
            wore a head-gear. What about you?
                                                           27.


                    ZOE
          Summer camp. I think his name was--

Stan interrupts by kissing her. And it's a great kiss. Full
of promises and answers. They linger there for a moment...

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          That was way better.

                    STAN
          When can I see you again?

Zoe feels her heart jump.    She kisses him again.


INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Zoe is lying in bed with Nuts on the pillow next to her.    The
sun is shining and they are both waking up.

She gets up and goes to the mirror. She lifts up her
nightgown and looks at her stomach, this time with a slight
look of concern on her face.


INT. EQUINOX - DAY

Zoe and Mona are side-by-side on the elliptical machines.
Zoe is going very fast, while Mona is barely moving at all.

                    ZOE
          What if I'm pregnant?

                    MONA
          Then you'll get fat and hormonal
          and I'll say, "I told you so."

                     ZOE
          But what if this could go somewhere
          with Stan? Like, really go
          somewhere.

                    MONA
          Then it will work out perfectly.

                    ZOE
          What do you mean?

                    MONA
          Because just when you really like
          him, you'll break up because you're
          pregnant and then you never have to
          put yourself out there and possibly
          get hurt. That's your dream.
                                                        28.


                    ZOE
              (thinks, then)
          I'm not pregnant.

She gets off the machine.


INT. EQUINOX STEAM ROOM - DAY

We are in a foggy steam room with Zoe, Mona and a few other
WOMEN.

                    MONA
          So, when are you seeing him again?

                     ZOE
          Tonight.

                    MONA
          Well, don't have sex with him.
          That's the last thing we need. You
          get knocked up and we'll have no
          idea who the father is.

A few women look over.

                    MONA (CONT'D)
          And then we'll have to do a
          paternity test. Is it the cheese
          farmer or the red-pubed bandit?

More women look over.

                    ZOE
          I'm not going to have sex with him
          tonight. It's too soon.
              (for the women's benefit)
          I'm not a slut.

                    MONA
          Well, bring condoms, just in case.
              (thinks, then)
          And a pregnancy test.

                    ZOE
          Very funny.

                    MONA
          I'm not joking.

All of the women are now staring at Zoe.

                    ZOE
          I'm really not a slut.
                                                              29.


INT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Zoe sits on the bed, holding a pregnancy test in her hands.
Nuts is beside her. He looks up at her.

                    ZOE
          There's no way, right?


INT. ZOE'S BATHEROOM - NIGHT

Zoe pees on the stick.   Nuts is beside her, watching with his
head tilted.

                    ZOE
          Stop looking at me like that.   I'm
          not pregnant.

Zoe finishes peeing and looks at the test.   Nothing yet.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          Come on, come on, come on...

We hear the doorbell RING.

                      ZOE (CONT'D)
          Shit.

Zoe looks down at the test. Still nothing.      We wait and
watch the test. The doorbell RINGS again.

                      ZOE (CONT'D)
          Shit!

A faint PLUS SIGN is forming.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          Shitshitshitshit...

The plus sign then turns BRIGHT PINK. Zoe's heart stops.
There it is. Plain as day. Pregnant.

                      ZOE (CONT'D)
          No, shit.

Zoe stands.   Looks at herself in the mirror.   And then...

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          Holy fucking shit!
                                                        30.


INT. TAXI - NIGHT

Manhattan fades into the distance, as they drive over the
Brooklyn Bridge. Zoe cracks the window.

                      STAN
            Are you feeling okay?

Zoe nods.   Her face looks pale.

                      STAN (CONT'D)
            Good, because this should really
            be a culinary adventure. This is
            an underground restaurant that
            moves from apartment to apartment,
            depending on the chef.

Zoe nods again. Hasn't heard a word he's said. She rolls
the window all the way down and hangs her head out.

                        STAN (CONT'D)
            And some of the guys from the band
            will be there. So, we might get a
            little jam going. Sounds fun,
            right?
                 (then)
            Zoe?

Zoe's POV. Headlights from passing cars whiz by, and the
wind swirls her hair into her face. Brooklyn approaches like
a bad dream.


INT. UNDERGROUND RESTAURANT/SMALL APARTMENT - NIGHT

Stan walks down a long table filled with appetizers. He is
making a plate for each of them. Zoe trails behind, beads of
sweat on her forehead.

                      STAN
            And this looks like a mache salad
            with grapes and feta.

He takes some for each of them.

                      STAN (CONT'D)
            And this, oh this must be white
            beans and lamb's tongue. You've
            got to have some of this. Etienne
            is famous for his lamb's tongue.

Olivia approaches.
                                                          31.


                    OLIVIA
          Hey, stranger.

                    STAN
          Oh, hey, Olivia.   You remember Zoe.

                    OLIVIA
          Right. How'd that blueberry pie
          turn out?

                      ZOE
          What?

                    OLIVIA
          You bought blueberries from me?
          Said you were going to make a pie?

                    ZOE
          Um, can you excuse me for a second?

Zoe hurries off.   Olivia watches her go.   Eyes narrowing.

                    OLIVIA
          No way she knows how to bake a pie.


INT. UNDERGROUND RESTAURANT/SMALL APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Zoe hovers by the window, whispering into the phone.

                    ZOE
          I'm pregnant.

                     BOBBY (O.S.)
          What?!   Where are you? I'm on my
          way.

                      ZOE
          Brooklyn.

                    BOBBY (O.S.)
          Where's that?

Zoe hangs up the phone.


INT. UNDERGROUND RESTAURANT/SMALL APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Zoe is now on the phone with Mona.

                    MONA (O.S.)
          Don't panic. Could be a false
          positive. Take another test.
                                                          32.


                    ZOE
          I can't. I'm at some underground
          foodie party in Brooklyn. Where am
          I gonna--

Out the window and across the street, we see a drugstore.


INT. DRUGSTORE - NIGHT

Zoe runs down the aisle and empties one, two, three...what
the fuck, every pregnancy test into her basket.

Her cell phone RINGS.    It's Bobby.   She picks it up.

                    BOBBY (O.S.)
          Okay, I'm looking at a subway map.
          Which way is Brooklyn?

She hangs up again.


INT. UNDERGROUND RESTAURANT/SMALL APARTMENT - NIGHT

Zoe hurries through the living room, a packed drugstore bag
hidden under her arm. Stan comes up behind her.

                    STAN
          Where have you been?

Zoe jumps and accidentally drops the bag. The tests spill
out onto the floor. She quickly scoops everything back in.

                     ZOE
          Sorry.   You scared me.

                    STAN
          Did you just go to the store?

                    ZOE
          Yeah, I had a little emergency. I
          have a, a, um...corn, and I needed
          to get those little...corn pads.

                       STAN
          Corn pads?

                    ZOE
          I know, it's gross. Do you know
          where the bathroom is?

Zoe walks off leaving him to ponder.
                                                        33.


                    STAN
          What's a corn pad?


INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

Zoe pees on eight sticks at once.

                      ZOE
          Corn pad?    What the hell is wrong
          with you?

Someone KNOCKS on the door.

                      ZOE (CONT'D)
          Corn pad.    Jesus Christ.

The knocking turns to an angry BANGING.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          Relax! I'll be out in...
              (checks box)
          Three to five minutes.

Zoe holds up the tests. One by one, the little windows all
show PLUS SIGNS and CHECK MARKS and DOUBLE HASH MARKS.


INT. UNDERGROUND RESTAURANT/SMALL APARTMENT - NIGHT

Zoe exits the bathroom with a wide-eyed, terrified look on
her face. By the bar, she sees a PREGNANT WOMAN sipping a
glass of wine. She rushes over.

                    ZOE
          Excuse me, are you allowed to drink
          when you're...

Zoe makes hand motions at her belly, but can't say the word.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          You know...

More hand gestures.

                    PREGNANT WOMAN
          Pregnant?
              (off Zoe's nod)
          My doctor says one glass is--

Zoe doesn't wait for her to finish. She rushes the bar,
pours a glass of wine and downs it like a frat boy funneling
a beer.
                                                         34.


Outside, we hear a banjo and guitar tuning up.


EXT. BACK PATIO - SAME

Stan, JERRY and SCOOTER are just starting to play. A small
crowd gathers round. Stan starts to sing an old tune called
"Sweet Little Miss Blue Eyes."

                    STAN
          Who makes me forget all the other
          girls I met, sweet, little Miss
          Blue Eyes. Who's sweeter to me,
          than she really ought to be, sweet
          little Miss Blue Eyes.

Zoe appears at the door to the patio.   Stan smiles at her
while he sings.

                    STAN (CONT'D)
          Who's gonna start takin' care of my
          heart, she makes me realize. And
          it's lucky for me and I really want
          to be with...
              (winks at Zoe)
          sweet, little Miss--

Stan's POV as Zoe covers her mouth with two hands and bolts
for the bathroom, puking.

                       STAN (CONT'D)
          Blue eyes?


INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

Zoe's head is in the toilet. Just when we think she's done,
she pukes again. Finally, she lifts her head.

                       ZOE
          Ohhhhhhhh.

She spies an unused pregnancy test on the floor.  One that
must have dropped. Maybe this will be the one with the
answer she's looking for. She sits back on the toilet,
mustering up all of her focus to pee again. She closes her
eyes.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          Please, God...

But she can't pee.   She tries and tries.
                                                         35.


                     ZOE (CONT'D)
          Water, water everywhere, but not a
          drop to...

She doubles over and pukes between her knees.   When she's
done, she holds up the test.

CU of the stick, which has no pee on it but is covered in
vomit. Slowly the test reveals a PLUS SIGN.

                       ZOE (CONT'D)
          Fuck me.


EXT. PERRY STREET - NIGHT

Stan and Zoe walk towards Zoe's brownstone. Stan is
practically holding her up. Zoe stumbles along.

                    STAN
          My singing made you vomit.

                      ZOE
          No.    It's not that.

                    STAN
          Sure, we were a little out of tune,
          but...

                    ZOE
          I really don't feel well.

                    STAN
          Is it your corns?    Hurts to walk?

ANGLE on Carol, from Single Mother's By Choice, approaching.
Zoe's face pales.

                       CAROL
          Zoe?

                       ZOE
          Wow.   Hi.    Hey, there...

                    CAROL
          Where have you been?    You haven't
          been coming to any--

                    ZOE
              (cutting her off)
          Right. I know. I've been so busy.
          Next one, I'm there. For sure.
              (then, awkward)
          This is my friend, Stan.
                                                         36.


                     STAN
          Hi.

                    CAROL
              (eyeing Stan suspiciously)
          Hello. Are you two--

                     ZOE
          Late. Yes. We are. We really
          are.
               (pushing Stan along)
          I'll see you at the meeting. Bye.

They walk on.   Stan looks at Zoe.

                    STAN
          An old...boyfriend?

                    ZOE
          Her name is Carol. We're on
          a...committee together.

They reach Zoe's front stoop.   Zoe peers over Stan's shoulder
to make sure Carol's gone.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          All right. I have to go to bed
          now. I'll call you, okay?

                     STAN
          Okay.
              (then)
          Hey, I was thinking, if you don't
          have any plans this weekend, maybe
          you'd like to come up to the farm
          and get away for a few days.

                    ZOE
          I'll call you tomorrow.
          Something's not agreeing with me.

                    STAN
          Was it the lamb's tongue?

Zoe runs inside holding her hand over her mouth.   Stan stands
there for a beat. He calls after her.

                    STAN (CONT'D)
          Okay, well...this weekend.   Think
          about it.
                                                         37.


INT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Zoe lies in bed. Nuts sleeps beside her. Zoe stares out the
window at a flickering street lamp, her face full of fear.

                    ZOE
          What the hell have I done?


EXT. SHADYBROOK RETIREMENT COMMUNITY - DAY

Establishing shot of a retirement compound in Queens.


INT. SHADYBROOK LOBBY - DAY

The lobby is well-appointed and cheery. A young STAFF works
behind a front desk area. Were it not for a scattering of
PEOPLE IN WHEELCHAIRS, you might think we were at a Ramada.

Zoe walks by the front desk.   ANNIE, an employee, looks up.

                     ANNIE
          Hi, Zoe.   You look fantastic.

                    ZOE
          I don't know how that's possible.

                    ANNIE
          Something's different. Did you get
          highlights or a spray tan? Your
          face looks like it's...

                    ZOE
          Please don't say glowing.

                     ANNIE
          Yes!   Exactly!


EXT. SHADYBROOK COURTYARD - LATER

There is a small group of WOMEN speed walking around the
courtyard. They are fully decked out in jogging suits,
visors and nose shields. The ringleader is NANA, 83, fit and
fabulous.

On the sidelines is ARTHUR, 87, with his walker and big grin,
as he watches the ladies exercise.

                    ZOE
          Morning, Arthur.
                                                        38.


                    ARTHUR
          Hello, my dear!

He struggles to get up.

                    ZOE
          No, no, no, don't get up.

                    ARTHUR
          Good, because I can't get up. Came
          to see my lovely fiance? She's
          looking fine today, let me tell
          you. Fine.

Nana rounds the bend and waves enthusiastically.

                      ZOE
          Hi, Nana.

                    NANA
          One more mile to go. Do you have a
          minute? Talk to Arthur.

Zoe looks at Arthur who's now watching Nana's ass, nodding.

                    ARTHUR
          That's what I'm talking about.
          Work it.

Horrified, Zoe quickly runs after Nana.


EXT. SHADYBROOK COURTYARD - LATER

Zoe is now speed walking with the ladies. She mimics the
same strong arm movements and heel-toe foot action.

                    NANA
          Do you want a nose guard?   I have
          an extra.

                    ZOE
          No, I'm fine.

                    SHIRLEY
          Are you sure? Ethel Silverbeck
          just had another carcinoma removed
          from her nose.

                    ZOE
              (to Nana)
          I kind of need to talk to you.
          Alone.
                                                           39.


Nana gives her friends a nod, and they fall back several
paces. Zoe waits for them to be out of earshot.

                    NANA
          Don't worry, they can't hear
          anything anyway.

                    ZOE
          I'm pregnant.

                    NANA
              (can't hear her)
          What?

                    ZOE
          I'm pregnant.

                       NANA
          What?

                    ZOE
          I'm pregnant.

                    NANA
          I can't hear you, darling.

                    SHIRLEY
          Jesus, Judy, she's pregnant.   Turn
          your hearing aide up.

Zoe closes her eyes.    Nightmare.


INT. NANA'S ROOM - LATER

Nana hands Zoe a cup of tea.   Zoe's eyes well with tears.

                    ZOE
          What am I going to do?

                    NANA
          I'm confused. Isn't this what you
          wanted? You bought sperm and were
          inseminated by your doctor. This
          isn't what we would call an
          accident.

                    ZOE
          But now it's all happening so fast.
          Did I really think this through?
                                       40.


          NANA
We talked about it for months. You
said it was what you wanted more
than anything in the world.

          ZOE
But this guy, he's...special.   It's
all going to fall apart now.

          NANA
What makes him so special?

          ZOE
I don't know. He's very...real.
And funny. And different. The
other guys I've been with all had
their briefcases and their five-
year plans and their secretaries
they were fucking. Stan doesn't
have a five-year plan. I don't
even know if he has a plan.

          NANA
What about a secretary?

           ZOE
Some kid named Fred.
    (then)
I like him, Nana.

          NANA
Well, if he's the right one, he'll
stay.

          ZOE
Do you really think so?

          NANA
Gosh, I don't know. I hoped that
would be enough to appease you.

          ZOE
Should I still visit him for the
weekend? Or should I just vanish
and hope he forgets I ever existed.

          NANA
Don't be silly. Go up there for
the weekend. Spend some time with
him and see what he's really like.

           ZOE
Yeah.   You're right.
                                                            41.


                    NANA
          You might find out he's a total
          douchebag and then the whole thing
          is moot.

Zoe looks at Nana.   Douchebag?


INT. CAR - DAY

Zoe is in the car. We are CLOSE on her as she talks rapidly
and a bit maniacally.

                    ZOE
          Okay, so we'll just hope that he's
          a douchebag. Could happen, right?

WIDEN to reveal Nuts in the passenger seat.      He's yawning.

                       ZOE (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry.     Am I keeping you up?

Nuts closes his eyes and lays down.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          My whole life is falling apart and
          you can't keep your bug-eyes open?
              (yawning)
          Thanks. Now I'm yawning. But why
          am I so tired? I slept nine hours.
              (thinks, then)
          And I'm starving, too. What the
          hell is going on?

Zoe sees a gas station and jams on the breaks.


INT. GAS STATION MINI MART - DAY

Zoe pours a massive cup of coffee. One of those gas station
Big Gulp cups. Even the TRUCKER next to her chooses a
smaller cup. Then, a look crosses her face.

                    ZOE
          Am I even allowed to drink coffee?

The trucker looks at her.    She looks at him.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          Do you know anything about being
          pregnant?
                                                          42.


EXT. CAR - LATER

Zoe's car is now parked on the side of a highway in the
middle of nowhere.


INT. CAR - SAME

Zoe is sound asleep with her head back and her mouth open. A
small, empty coffee cup in her hand, crumpled candy bar
wrappers on the floor, and an almost empty bag of Cheetos is
in her lap.

Her cell phone RINGS. Zoe doesn't move. After the third
ring, she lifts her head and looks around. It takes her a
few moments to realize what's happened. She looks at the
little coffee cup.

                    ZOE
          Thanks a lot, decaf.

She picks up the phone.

                    STAN (O.S.)
          Where are you?

Zoe looks around.

                    ZOE
          I have no idea.


EXT. LITTLE GOAT FARM - DAY

Zoe bumps along the winding driveway of this idyllic Hudson
River farm. There are red barns in the distance and green
pastures filled with goats and sheep. The house is an old
carriage house with a rusty weather-vane on top.

Zoe parks the car and takes in the whole scene. Stan opens
the front door, with a huge smile on his face. Zoe sighs.

                    ZOE
          He's so not a douchebag.


INT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

They enter the front door.    Zoe takes in the charming
carriage house.

                    ZOE
          I can't believe you live here.
          This is ridiculous.
                                                         43.


                    STAN
          I just come on weekends. My
          parents really live here.

                     ZOE
          Oh.   Where are they now?

                    STAN
          In the kitchen.

Zoe stops short.

                    ZOE
          Wait, they're here? Now? Is this
          a "meet the parents" kind of thing?
          I wasn't prepared for this.

                    STAN
          No. Not at all.    I mean, you'll
          meet them, but--

                     ZOE
          When you said come up for the
          weekend, I assumed it was just us.
              (then)
          I think I need to lay down.


INT. STAN'S BEDROM - MOMENTS LATER

Zoe lies in the small bed with the covers pulled up to her
chin. Stan stands above her with an odd look on his face.

                    STAN
          Are you hung-over or something?

                    ZOE
          I'm just...not myself. Give me ten
          minutes. A ten-minute power nap
          and I'm good. I need to regroup.

                     STAN
          Are you sure you're okay?
              (then)
          Zoe? Hello?

But she's already out.   Stan gives her a little poke.


INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Stan enters the kitchen. His parents, JOAN and EDWARD look
up expectantly, as if about to meet their new daughter-in-
law.
                                                           44.


                     EDWARD
          Oh.   It's just you.

                    STAN
          She's taking a nap.

                     JOAN
          A nap?   Now? She just got here.

                    STAN
          Mom, I need you to not be
          judgemental, okay. I like this
          girl a lot.

                    JOAN
          How can I be judgemental?    We
          haven't even met her yet.

We hear a SQUEAK, SQUEAK, SQUEAK coming down the hall.

                    JOAN (CONT'D)
          What the heck is that?

The SQUEAKING continues and then all eyes turn as Nuts rolls
into the kitchen and stops. He tilts his head.

                     STAN
          Oh.   This is Nuts.

Joan and Edward take in the raggedy/wheelchair-bound dog and
then look at Stan. Stan shoots his mom a look.

                    JOAN
          Who's judging?!


INT. STAN'S BEDROOM - LATER

It's now dark. Zoe is asleep in the exact same position.
Suddenly, we hear a loud GRUMBLE. Her eyes open.

                    ZOE
          What was that?

We hear the GRUMBLE again.    It's her stomach.   She puts her
hands over it.

                     ZOE (CONT'D)
          Whoa.

Zoe gets out of bed and goes right for the Cheetos. The bag
is empty. She smears her hand on the inside of the bag and
then licks the orange cheese from her fingers.
                                                         45.


INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Zoe peeks out of the bedroom and looks both ways.

                    ZOE
              (whispering)
          Stan?

No one in sight.   She waits a beat and then whispers louder.

                       ZOE (CONT'D)
          Stan!


INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Zoe peers her head into the empty kitchen.   Nuts is with her.

                      ZOE
          Stan?    Hello?

Zoe stands there unsure of what to do next. Then we hear her
stomach GROWL again. Her eyes turn to the stove. Something
smells out of this world. She tiptoes over and opens the
pot. It's beef stew.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          Oh, my God.

She makes sure the coast is clear and then looks for a spoon.
She can't find one. She spies a loaf of white bread. Grabs
a piece, folds it and then scoops up a heaping bite of stew
and devours it.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
              (mouth full)
          Oh, my God.

She replaces the lid on the pot. And now she just stands
there. And stands there some more.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          Oh, who am I kidding?

She quickly takes two slices of bread and goes back in. This
time, she uses one piece of bread as a ladle and then the
other to turn it into a sandwich. She takes a huge bite.

                       ZOE (CONT'D)
          Oh.   My.    God.

Stew dribbles down her chin. She takes a third piece of
bread to wipe her face and then takes a bite of that one.
                                                              46.


Nuts starts to whine and beg. Zoe uses her bread-ladle to
toss some stew on the floor for him. It lands with plop.

And now Joan enters. Zoe and Nuts turn, their mouths
bursting. Joan doesn't quite know what to do. All she knows
is she's supposed to be open-minded.

                      JOAN
            Would you like a plate?

Zoe shakes her head no.     Wow.   This is embarrassing.

                        JOAN (CONT'D)
            A napkin?

Zoe nods her head. Joan gives her one. Zoe holds it over
her mouth as she tries in vain to swallow this inhuman bite.

                        JOAN (CONT'D)
            I'm Joan.

Zoe nods.   Still can't swallow the bite.

                      JOAN (CONT'D)
            And you must be Zoe.

Zoe nods again. She tries to shake Joan's hand. It's the
best she can do. Unfortunately, her fingers are fluorescent
orange from the Cheetos powder. Joan pulls her hand back.


INT. DINING ROOM - LATER

The dining room is warm and lovely. There's faded wallpaper
and an old stagecoach lamp serving as a chandelier. Despite
the inviting room, Zoe looks very uncomfortable.

                      EDWARD
            The stew is delicious, honey.

                      STAN
            Yeah, Mom, it's awesome.

                      EDWARD
                (to Zoe)
            Have you ever in your life had stew
            like this? Come on, be honest.

Zoe looks at Joan.      Joan smiles.    It will be their secret.

                        ZOE
            Uh...no.    Never.
                                                       47.


INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

They are having coffee and dessert in the living room.
Things seem more comfortable now. Zoe actually looks like
she might be enjoying herself. Nuts sits beside her.

                      JOAN
            So are all the animals in your pet
            store...differently abled?

                       ZOE
            Oh, you can say paralyzed. He
            doesn't mind.
                (then)
            No, our pets are all in great
            shape. Purebreads mostly, but not
            from puppy mills.

                      JOAN
            Those puppy mills are terrible.    I
            read about them in the paper.

                      ZOE
            Well, that's actually how I ended
            up with Nuts. I bought him from
            this pet store near my house. Six
            months later, I had thousands of
            dollars in vet bills and had to put
            him in a wheelchair.

                      EDWARD
            You should have sued that place.

                      ZOE
            I thought about it, but what was
            that really going to do? They were
            still going to sell inbred dogs.
            So...I took the money I made when I
            left Google and just bought the
            place figuring I would do better.

                      STAN
            You worked for Google?

Zoe nods.

                      STAN (CONT'D)
            How could I not know that?

                      ZOE
            You never asked.
                                                        48.


                    STAN
          And you made a lot of money and
          then bought a pet store?

Stan puts his arm around her and gives her a squeeze.

                    STAN (CONT'D)
          I love that.

                    ZOE
          It's been fun. Beats brand
          management, that's for sure.

                    JOAN
              (to Edward)
          That sounds like us, honey.

                     EDWARD
          It's true.
              (to Zoe)
          When we bought this farm we just
          wanted to make cheese because we
          couldn't find anything we liked in
          the stores. And now, twenty years
          later, here we are...

                    JOAN
          Sometimes in life you just have to
          take matters into your own hands.
          Make things happen your own way,
          you know?

Zoe forces a smile.   If only they knew.


EXT. LITTLE GOAT FARM - NIGHT

The moon is full and fireflies dot the air as Zoe and Stan
walk the grounds of the farm.

Nuts trots/rolls ahead of them in a different wheelchair.
This one is more rugged, with mountain-bike-type wheels.

                    STAN
          I can't believe that Nuts has an
          off-road wheelchair.

                    ZOE
          He's got one for snow, too.      With
          little skis on the bottom.

Stan smiles and shakes his head.
                                               49.


                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          What?

                    STAN
          You're really something.

                    ZOE
          Are you making fun of me?   Do you
          think I spoil him?

                    STAN
          No, I really think you're amazing.
          I mean, that story you told
          tonight. You just quit your whole
          professional life because of this
          little dog? Started your own
          business, just like that?

Zoe shrugs.

                    STAN (CONT'D)
          You're very...unique.

                    ZOE
          Well, you're a dime a dozen. I
          can't tell you how many banjo
          playing, cheese makers I've been
          with.

                    STAN
          I keep waiting for the other shoe
          to drop. Like, how can you be so
          perfect? Why are you even still
          single? I can't believe no one's
          snatched you up by now.

                    ZOE
          I drive them all away, I guess.

                    STAN
          Yeah, right.

Stan takes her in his arms.

                    STAN (CONT'D)
          Look, I know this is all going
          fast...the time we're spending
          together, meeting my parents and
          everything...but, I'm okay with
          that. I want it to go fast.

                    ZOE
          It is going fast.
                                                         50.


                    STAN
          But isn't that okay? Aren't we old
          enough to skip all the bullshit?
          What are we waiting for? I...want
          to be with you.

Zoe opens her mouth. She's got to tell him.    Before this
goes any further, she has to tell him.

                    ZOE
          Stan.

                    STAN
          Come on. There's something I want
          to show you.


INT. CHEESE CAVE - NIGHT

It's floor to ceiling wooden shelves all filled with cheese.
Stan ceremoniously unwraps a wheel.

                    ZOE
          What is it?

                    STAN
          It's cheese.

                    ZOE
          I can see that.

                    STAN
          It's a new kind of goat's milk
          we're using. I've been developing
          the recipe, and now it needs to
          age. It'll be ready for market in
          several months.
              (then, excited)
          Want to know what it's called?

                    ZOE
          Okay.

                    STAN
          Zoe.

                    ZOE
          You named a piece of cheese after
          me?

                    STAN
          Not just one piece. The whole
          line. This will forever in history
          be known as the Zoe.
                    (MORE)
                                                        51.

                    STAN (CONT'D)
          Unless, of course, it tastes like
          shit, and then we'll just scrap it.
              (with a wink)
          But that'll never happen.

                    ZOE
          How do you know?

                    STAN
          Because it's going to be fantastic.
          Sweet and sassy and very complex.
          Why do you think I'm calling it
          Zoe?

                    ZOE
          No one's ever named a piece of
          cheese after me before.

Zoe stares at the cheese for a long time.

                    STAN
          You're kind of hard to read right
          now. You're either seriously
          flattered or totally repulsed.

Zoe smiles.

                    STAN (CONT'D)
          What?

                    ZOE
          I want to kiss you right now, but
          it really smells like cheese in
          here.


EXT. DAIRY - MOMENTS LATER

The door to the dairy kicks open and Stan carries Zoe out.
Her legs are around his waist and they are making out like
crazy.


INT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Stan carries Zoe up the stairs. They are tripping and
kissing and now tearing at each other's clothes.


INT. STAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Stan throws Zoe on the bed and then peels off his shirt. His
body looks amazing in the shadowy moonlight. Zoe lies there,
looking at him before he jumps on top of her.
                                                          52.


                    ZOE
              (under her breath)
          You're such a douchebag.

                     STAN
          What?

Zoe shakes her head and then melts into him.

                                                DISSOLVE TO:


INT. STAN'S ROOM - LATER

They are now on their backs staring at the ceiling.    They
look happy and worn out

Their P.O.V. Those little glow-in-the-dark star stickers are
all over the ceiling. There's barely any glow left.

Stan lets out a big sigh as he looks at the "stars"...

                    STAN
          That was amazing. I mean, like,
          totally and exceptionally, over-the-
          top, amazing.

Zoe turns to him.   Takes a deep breath.

                     ZOE
          Stan.

                     STAN
          Yeah.

                    ZOE
          There's something I really have to
          tell you.

                    STAN
          There's something I have to tell
          you, too.

Now Stan turns to her.     They are face-to-face.

                    STAN (CONT'D)
          Can I go first? `Cause if we're
          going to say the same thing, I want
          to say it first.

                    ZOE
          We're not going to say the same
          thing.
                                                            53.


                    STAN
          Well, let me go, because this is
          really embarrassing, and I just
          have to say it.

                      ZOE
          Okay.

                     STAN
          I've dated a lot of women. I mean,
          not tons, but a lot. And, the
          thing is, I've never...been in love
          before. I've never even told
          anyone I love them before. Because
          I just never felt it. But from the
          day we met, from the first time our
          backs accidentally touched in the
          subway, I feel this, this...
              (he shakes his head)
          Maybe this is too much to say right
          now, but...I love you, Zoe. I
          really do.

Stan finishes.    He looks at her and smiles.   Zoe just stares
at him.

                    STAN (CONT'D)
          In my mind, you were supposed to
          say, I love you, too.

Instead, Zoe covers her mouth and runs to the bathroom.     A
beat later, we hear her vomit.


INT. STAN'S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Zoe is at the sink, furiously brushing her teeth.    Stan
enters.

                      STAN
          Zoe?

He looks at her.   Sees the tears in her eyes.

                    STAN (CONT'D)
          Why are you crying? Everything's
          perfect.

                      ZOE
          It's not.

                    STAN
          Sure it is.
                                                 54.


Zoe takes a deep breath.

                         STAN (CONT'D)
            What?

                      ZOE
            I'm pregnant.

                      STAN
            Uh, I'm pretty sure it doesn't
            happen that fast.

Zoe shakes her head.

                      ZOE
            I just found out.

                      STAN
            Pregnant? As in you're going to
            have a baby?

Zoe nods.

                      STAN (CONT'D)
            I don't understand.

                       ZOE
            I know.   It's hard to explain.

                      STAN
            Well, who's it?

                      ZOE
            I don't know.

                         STAN
            What?

                      ZOE
            I don't know who the father is. I
            kind of know him. I just don't
            know his name exactly. It was sort
            of anonymous.

                         STAN
            Anonymous?

                      ZOE
            He's a donor. From a sperm bank.

                      STAN
            Seriously, what the fuck are you
            talking about? Sperm bank? What?
                                                    55.


                    ZOE
          I know, this is so fucked up.

                    STAN
          When did all of this happen?

                    ZOE
          The day we met. That same day.
          And I didn't tell you because I
          didn't think there was any way I
          could be pregnant.

                       STAN
          But...why?

                    ZOE
          Because supposedly with frozen
          sperm it takes a few tries and...

                    STAN
          No, why would you do this?

                    ZOE
          Because I wanted a baby. And I'm
          almost forty, and I never met the
          right guy. I was afraid if I
          waited any longer it would all pass
          me by, and I'd miss my chance.

Stan just looks at her.       Speechless.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          I didn't know you. I would have
          never done it if--

                    STAN
          I just told you I loved you.

                    ZOE
          Well....do you not now?

                    STAN
          You're pregnant.

                    ZOE
          Don't say it like that.

                    STAN
          You're pregnant.

                     ZOE
          Yes.   I'm pregnant.      I'm pregnant!
                                                            56.


                    STAN
          I tell you I'm in love with you and
          you tell me your pregnant with some
          stranger's child?

                    ZOE
          Don't say it like that.     You make
          it sound dirty.

                    STAN
          I'm sorry. I...I'm stunned. I
          don't know what to say. What the
          fuck am I supposed to say?! This
          is great fucking news?
          Congratulations?! Why did you wait
          so long to tell me?

                    ZOE
          Because I'm freaking out, okay! I
          didn't know what to do. I made
          this big decision to do this and
          then I met you--

                    STAN
          Well, what am I supposed to do now?
          This isn't how it was supposed to
          be. This isn't what--

                    ZOE
          I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay? Life
          isn't perfect. It's not all neat
          and tidy like your perfect family
          and your perfect farm and your
          bluegrass band. It's messy. It's
          fucked up. This is real life,
          okay? I'm sorry to break it to
          you.

They both stand there.    After the raised voices, the silence
feels more pronounced.

                       ZOE (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry.

                     STAN
          Sorry?   What's sorry going to do?

Stan walks out. Zoe stands there.     And stands there.   And
then she starts to cry.


INT. STAN'S BEDROOM - LATER

Zoe lies in bed awake.    Nuts is beside her.    They are alone.
                                                           57.


EXT. LITTLE GOAT FARM - DAY

It's daybreak at the farm. FARM HANDS move herds of goats
from one pasture to another.


INT. GUEST ROOM - MORNING

Stan lies awake in a small guest room.   Joan enters and is
startled to find him in there.

                     JOAN
          Oh, I thought you were in your
          room. Sorry.
              (then)
          Everything okay?

Stan doesn't answer.   Joan sits on the corner of the bed.

                    JOAN (CONT'D)
          Well, she seems really terrific.
          Dad and I both think so. She's
          smart and poised and...

Next door, we hear Zoe puking again. Joan stops.   Then,
wanting to seem open-minded, continues.

                    JOAN (CONT'D)
          And warm and gracious...

Another very LOUD HURL.

                    JOAN (CONT'D)
          And pretty and...

Another HURL.    Joan looks at Stan.

                    JOAN (CONT'D)
          What the hell's going on in there?

                    STAN
          She's pregnant.

                    JOAN
          Oh, dear God.

We hear the toilet FLUSH.


INT. CAR - DAY

Zoe sits in the passenger seat with the key in the ignition.
Stan leans against the car. They are both quiet.
                                                          58.


                    ZOE
          I don't know what to say.

Neither does Stan, who says nothing.    He runs his foot back
and forth in the gravel.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          I guess I'd given up on meeting
          someone like you, and I did what I
          thought was best.

Stan still doesn't say anything.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          But, for what it's worth...I love
          you, too.

She puts the car in gear and pulls out.    Stan watches her go.
His hands in his pockets.


EXT. MONA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Zoe stands in the hallway of Mona's apartment building.   A
beat later, Mona opens the door and holds out her arms.

                       MONA
          Come here.

Zoe walks slowly into her embrace. They stand like this for
a long time. Just holding each other. Until Mona's three
kids run out with wiffle-ball bats and chase each other down
the hall. A beat later, the toddler runs after them crying.


INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Zoe lies in bed with Nuts. She opens her eyes and stares at
the ceiling. Then, with a sigh, she gets up and does her
morning ritual.

She pulls up her nightgown and sticks out her stomach.    For
the first time, we actually see a little bump.


INT. EXAM ROOM - DAY

Zoe lies on the table with a paper gown over her lap. She
looks down at her feet in the stirrups. Sadly, we notice a
perfect pedicure.

Dr. Harris comes in with a big smile.
                                                             59.


                    DR. HARRIS
          Congratulations! What luck to get
          pregnant on the first try, huh?
          And with frozen sperm, too. So,
          how are we feeling?

                    ZOE
              (unconvincing)
          Okay.

                    DR. HARRIS
          You sure about that?

                    ZOE
          It's been hard. I don't know if I
          was really prepared for this.

                    DR. HARRIS
          Well, your hormones aren't helping,
          and going through this without a
          partner must be difficult.

Dr. Harries readies the ultrasound wand and inserts the
device. He turns the monitor so that Zoe can see.

                    DR. HARRIS (CONT'D)
          Well, the good news is everything
          looks great. You are now eight
          weeks pregnant, which is an
          important milestone. With a little
          luck, we should be able to see a
          heartbeat today.

On the screen we see a small flickering dot.    Dr. Harris
smiles.

                       ZOE
          That's it?     That's...my baby?

Saying these words out loud for the first time hits Zoe.
Tears fill her eyes.

                     ZOE (CONT'D)
          Hi, Baby.
              (then)
          Is it okay? Is it healthy?

                    DR. HARRIS
          Everything's just...
              (makes a face, then)
          Wait, a minute...

                     ZOE
          What?   Wait a minute, what?
                                                         60.


                    DR. HARRIS
          Well...I see another heartbeat.

                    ZOE
              (freaking out)
          It has two hearts?

                    DR. HARRIS
          No...but you have two babies.

Zoe's mouth falls open.


NT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - DAY

We're back at Single Women By Choice. The women are sitting
on the floor. Sara is still nursing Dakota. Zoe has her
head in her hands.

                     CAROL
          Twins!   That's fantastic!

Zoe bursts into tears.

                    LORI
          Why are you crying?   That's so
          lucky.

                     ZOE
          Yup.   That's me.   Lucky, lucky, me.

The women are sensing the sarcasm, but not getting it.

                    CAROL
          Are you okay? Is it a financial
          concern? There are many programs--

                     ZOE
          No. I'm fairly loaded, actually.
          Used to work for Google.
               (blows nose)
          I'm sorry. This is hard for me. I
          don't know if I can talk about it
          yet.

                     CAROL
          Take your time. When you feel like
          sharing, we're here for you. We're
          all sisters here.
               (then, to the group)
          Let's give Zoe some space. When
          she's ready to talk, we're ready to
          listen. Deep, cleansing breaths,
          Zoe.
                                                        61.


Carol takes a deep breath and then lets it out.

                    CAROL (CONT'D)
          Now, in the meantime, does anyone
          else have anything they want to
          discuss? Problems? Concerns?

Tabitha, the tall woman with the nose ring, raises her hand.

                    TABITHA
          I'm having a hard time. Luca keeps
          asking why he doesn't have a daddy,
          and I just don't know what--

                    ZOE
              (blurting out)
          There's this guy. His name is
          Stan. And he's fantastic.

                       CAROL
          I knew it!

                    TABITHA
          Uh...wasn't I just speaking?

                    CAROL
          I knew you were with that guy!

                       SARA
          What guy?

                    LORI
          Zoe, this group is called Single
          Mother's By Choice.

                     ZOE
          I know.   I'm sorry--

                    TABITHA
          Um, excuse me. What about Luca?
          He's been really, really sad.

                    ZOE
              (floodgates opening)
          Have you ever met a guy and you get
          butterflies and you think this is
          the kind of man who could take care
          of me forever? The kind of guy who
          makes you re-examine everything?
          Like, maybe I can be a stay-at-home
          mom and be barefoot and pregnant.

The women stare blankly at Zoe.
                                                        62.


                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          He actually lives on a farm! Plays
          the banjo! Maybe I could learn to
          sew and take care of the animals.
          Like Laura Ingalls.

Even Dakota stops nursing and looks over at that one.


EXT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - LATER

The women file out. No one dares look at Zoe. It's very
awkward, although Zoe seems unaware. She turns to Carol.

                    ZOE
          Carol, thank you. This has been
          really helpful. Just getting it
          all out and being with other women
          who--

                     CAROL
          I'm going to have to ask you not to
          come back.

                     ZOE
          What?   Why?

                     CAROL
          I don't think we can help you, and,
          quite frankly, you're against
          everything we stand for.

                    ZOE
          But, I thought we were all sisters.

                     CAROL
          No.  Not you.
              (then)
          Do you know how long it took me to
          conceive? Five years. I had three
          miscarriages and spent every last
          dime on in-vitro. And Dana? The
          woman with the short hair?

                       ZOE
          Which one?

                    CAROL
          The one with the really short hair?

                     ZOE
          Yeah, that doesn't really narrow it
          down much.
                                                           63.


                        CAROL
            She   just flew to Memphis to watch
            her   baby being born. Seconds after
            the   birth, the birth mother changed
            her   mind and refused to give it up.

Zoe's face changes.     She starts to get it.

                      CAROL (CONT'D)
            So, as you can see, we are really
            dedicated and choosing to be single
            mothers, and you seem to be in a
            slightly different place. You're
            carrying two healthy babies, and
            you have no idea how lucky you are.

                      ZOE
                (after a beat)
            You're right.

                      CAROL
            I like you, Zoe. We all like you.
            But you kind of need to figure out
            where you are.

Zoe nods.


EXT. SHADYBROOK RETIREMENT COMMUNITY - DAY

Zoe and Nana are walking the loop around the courtyard. Zoe
looks terrible. Like she hasn't slept in days. They
complete a lap. Arthur gives them the double thumbs up sign.

                      NANA
            That man is obsessed with my ass.

                       ZOE
            I know.   It's kind of upsetting.

                      NANA
            He wants to take me on a cruise so
            that we can finally tie the knot.
            But, I don't know. What's the
            hurry?

                      ZOE
            You've been engaged for nine years.

                      NANA
            No reason to rush into anything.

Nana looks over at Zoe.     She sees the bags under her eyes.
                                                           64.


                    NANA (CONT'D)
          You look terrible, dear.

                    ZOE
          Thanks.

                    NANA
          You must really love him, huh?

                    ZOE
          I guess I do.

                    NANA
          Honey, I'm sure he's wonderful, and
          I'm sure he loves you, too. But,
          you have put him in a really
          awkward position. Having a baby is
          a big adjustment for any couple.
          And you're not married. And he's
          not the father. And you've only
          been together a little while. And
          now you're having twins. And--

                    ZOE
          Please stop.

                    NANA
          I'm just saying, if he actually
          wanted to stay with you right now,
          he'd be the greatest man in the
          world, and, quite frankly, I don't
          think any man is that great.

They complete another lap around the courtyard.   Arthur
smiles at them and then "raises the roof."

                    NANA (CONT'D)
          Arthur's just about the best man I
          know, and look at him. He's a
          fucking idiot.


EXT. LITTLE GOAT FARM - DAY

Stan leans against the fence looking at the goats. He has
the beginnings of a beard growing. The scruff makes him look
older. Thinner.

Joan approaches and stands next to him for a bit.

                    JOAN
          You know, people thought we were
          crazy when we bought this farm.
                    (MORE)
                                                            65.

                       JOAN (CONT'D)
             All of our friends in New York,
             they thought we'd lost our minds.

Stan nods.    We get the feeling he's heard this before.

                       JOAN (CONT'D)
             I guess I'm saying that you may
             have envisioned your life going one
             way, but the reality is, it could
             go a totally different direction.
             You just have to be open to it.

Stan watches a nearby goat coaxing her baby to nurse.      He
shrugs.

                       STAN
             Having a baby with someone I barely
             know, someone else's baby...it's
             just not how I pictured it.

                       JOAN
             I used to work on Wall Street. Now
             I wear boots covered in goat shit.
             This isn't how I pictured it,
             either. But guess what...I'm
             happy.

She gives him a sympathetic hug and walks away.


INT. STAN'S BEDROM - NIGHT

Stan lies in bed looking up at the "stars." There's even
less glow now than last time. He sighs and then turns over
to try and sleep.

ANGLE ON Nuts' off-road wheelchair in the corner of the room.
Stan looks at it and can't help but smile.


INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Zoe and Nuts lie in the bed. They are looking at each other
on the pillow. Zoe scratches behind his ears.

Zoe goes to the mirror and does her usual. The bump is
growing. For the first time, we see a smile.


INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - DAY

The Single Mother's By Choice women are sitting in their
usual circle. Lori is passing around a list.
                                                        66.


                    LORI
          Make sure you put your numbers
          down. I want to have everyone's
          number handy in case I go into
          labor early.

Zoe enters.   All eyes turn.    She waves sheepishly.

                      ZOE
          Hi, guys.

No one knows what to say.

                      CAROL
          Hi, Zoe.

                    ZOE
          I just wanted to apologize. I'm
          sorry I got into a relationship and
          wasn't honest with you guys, and
          I'm sorry I interrupted you,
          Tabitha. I hope Luca is doing
          better.

                      TABITHA
          Thanks.

                     ZOE
              (to Carol)
          And I've thought a lot about what
          you said, about how lucky I am. I
          got into this whole situation
          because I wanted to have a baby.
          And, somehow, I lost sight of that.
              (then)
          Anyway, I need partners in this,
          and I hope you'll take me back.

Lori smiles and hands her the piece of paper.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          What's this?

                    LORI
          It's a phone tree. I'm due next
          month, but my midwife thinks I may
          go sooner. I want everyone to be
          there. Are you in?

Zoe smiles.

                      ZOE
          I'm in.
                                                           67.


EXT. HUDSON STREET - DAY

Zoe has her head held high and her cute belly pushed out as
far as it will go.

A WOMAN with a double stroller approaches.   Zoe smiles.

                    ZOE
          Hi.

                    WOMAN
          Hi.

                    TWIN TODDLERS
          Hi./Hi.

Zoe walks on. She sees her reflection in a store window and
smiles. She looks like an actual pregnant person now. As
she is walking and smiling to herself, we hear a familiar
voice.

                    STAN
          Hi.

Her P.O.V. Stan appears next to her in the reflection.     For
a brief second, they look like a family.

Zoe turns. They both stop. Unsure of whether to hug or
what. They just stand there.

                    ZOE
          Hi.

                    STAN
          Hi.

                    ZOE
          You said that already.

                    STAN
          You...look great.

Zoe touches her belly.    Proud but protective.

                    STAN (CONT'D)
          How are you feeling?

                    ZOE
          Okay.

                    STAN
          Good.

A long silence.
                                                        68.


                      ZOE
            You have a beard.

                      STAN
            Yeah, it's awful isn't it.

                      ZOE
            No.

                       STAN
            Don't lie.
                (then)
            Did I tell you how pretty you look?

Zoe nods.   Another silence.

                      STAN (CONT'D)
            I miss you.

A group of SCHOOL KIDS, lost in their own conversations, push
up the block, separating Zoe and Stan for a moment. This
separation makes the moment all the more tense.

                      ZOE
            I miss you, too.

                      STAN
            This whole time we've been apart,
            I've been trying to figure out what
            it is about you that I love so
            much. And I think that it's that a
            lot of people talk about doing
            things, but you actually do them.
            You're really kind of daring. How
            you quit your job and took over a
            pet store all because some asshole
            sold you a lame dog. You came and
            found me at the Farmer's Market
            even though the night before I
            acted like a total stalker...

Zoe smiles at the memory.      Stan continues.

                      STAN (CONT'D)
            And now you're pregnant. Because
            you wanted to have a baby and
            didn't think you could wait any
            longer. Well, that's just the same
            kind of thing. It's...brave. And
            I can't love you for being that way
            but then walk away for the same
            reason.

Stan takes her hands.
                                                          69.


                    STAN (CONT'D)
          I love you. I've been waiting my
          whole life for you. And I can't
          let one little baby get in the way
          of that. I just...can't.

                    ZOE
          There's something I need to tell
          you.

                       STAN
          Okay.

                    ZOE
          It's big. And you're allowed to
          take all of this back when I tell
          you.

                       STAN
          What.

                    ZOE
          It's not just one baby....I'm
          having twins.

Stan looks at her. Is she joking? Her look says no. He
takes a beat. And then, even though it's not a joke, he
starts to laugh. A little laugh at first and then a big one.

And then, Zoe starts laughing too.   The whole thing is just
so ridiculous.

                    STAN
          This is insane.


INT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

It's late. Zoe and Stan are naked in bed, lying face to
face. Stan puts his hand on her stomach. He feels the
little bump, new since he's last been with her.

                    STAN
          Do you feel any kicking?

                       ZOE
          Sometimes.

                    STAN
          What does it feel like?

                    ZOE
          Like butterflies.
                                                                 70.


Stan smiles. He likes this image. He runs his hand over her
belly. Zoe moves in closer. Touches his cheek.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          Are you really sure you want to do
          this?

                       STAN
          Yeah.     I'm really sure.

They look at each other for a long time. Finally, Zoe closes
her eyes and settles in for sleep, with Stan watching her as
she dozes off.


INT. EXAM - ROOM

CU of a MONITOR where we see two distinct baby shapes
floating head-to-toe.

Dr. Harris holds the ultrasound wand to her belly. Stan
doesn't say anything. He looks on in total amazement.

                    ZOE
          Are you okay?

                    STAN
          They're so...perfect.      They look
          like real babies.

                    DR. HARRIS
          Would you like to know the sexes?

They look at each other.      Zoe smiles.   Stan shrugs.   Zoe
nods. Stan does, too.

                       ZOE
          Yes.     Tell us.

                    DR. HARRIS
          You're having two healthy little
          girls.

Stan gets tears in his eyes.

                       STAN
          Two girls?

                       ZOE
          Two girls.

                    DR. HARRIS
          Congratulations.
                                                         71.


EXT. MADISON AVENUE - DAY

Stan and Zoe walk down Madison Avenue. All of the other NEW
YORKERS are on some kind of mission -- shopping, rushing to
meetings, or fighting for cabs.

But Zoe and Stan just walk slowly hand-in-hand. Every so
often looking at each other and just smiling or laughing.
Then, suddenly, Stan picks her up in the middle of the
street.

                       STAN
          Two girls!

A WOMAN with a BABY in a Baby Bjorn passes by.   Stan smiles.
Now he's part of this exclusive club.

                       STAN (CONT'D)
          Hi.

                       WOMAN
          Hi.


INT. UNION SQUARE CAFE - NIGHT

We PAN past several small plates of food on a table.   A chef
tells us what delectable items we are looking at.

                    CHEF
          Here we have a yellowtail sashimi
          with ponzu sauce and pea shoots.
          This is carpaccio with shaved white
          truffles. And, finally, an
          heirloom tomato salad with fresh
          Buratta flown in from Italy this
          morning.

                    STAN
          Thanks, Sam. It looks incredible.

Sam tops off their champagne and exits.   Stan picks up his
fork and starts eating. Zoe does not.

                    STAN (CONT'D)
          Aren't you hungry?

                    ZOE
          I can't eat any of this.

                       STAN
          Why not?
                                                           72.


                    ZOE
              (pointing to each dish)
          Raw. Raw. Unpasteurized.
              (re: champagne)
          Alcohol.

                    STAN
          Let me get Sam back. He'll make
          you anything you want.

                    ZOE
          I don't want to hurt his feelings.
          You go ahead. I'm fine.

                    STAN
          Well, what are you going to eat?


INT. MCDONALD'S - NIGHT

The CASHIER reads back Zoe's order.

                    CASHIER
          Big Mac, Quarter Pounder with
          cheese, four large fries, and a six
          piece chicken McNuggets?

                     ZOE
          Make that an eight, no, ten-piece
          McNuggets.
              (to Stan)
          You'll have some, right?

                    STAN
          No.

                    ZOE
              (back to the cashier)
          Ten-piece. Someone will eat them.

Stan stands behind Zoe with an incredulous look on his face.


INT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Zoe and Stan lie in bed, each reading a copy of "What to
Expect when You're Expecting."

Zoe has the McNuggets box on her chest. She dips each nugget
in three different sauces and then takes a bite. Stan
watches with a mixture of amusement and revulsion.
                                                        73.


                    ZOE
              (re: book)
          Have you gotten to page 79 yet?

                    STAN
          No. I stopped reading when you
          ripped out one of my pages and used
          it as a napkin.

                    ZOE
          Says here many women in the second
          trimester experience an increased
          sexual appetite.

                     STAN
          Really?

Zoe smiles and then slowly triple dunks another McNugget.
She takes a seductive bite.

                    STAN (CONT'D)
          Are you coming on to me? It's kind
          of hard to tell right now.

                     ZOE
          Yeah.   I'm coming on to you.

Zoe throws the McNuggets on the floor and climbs on top of
him. She puts his hands on her body and then starts to kiss
him voraciously. After a beat, Stan stops.

                     ZOE (CONT'D)
          What?

                    STAN
          You have chicken in your hair.


INT. EQUINOX GYM - DAY

Zoe and Mona are on the elliptical machines. Zoe is going
very fast, while Mona is barely going at all.

                    MONA
          Why are you even working out? This
          is the one time in your life you're
          allowed to let it go.

                    ZOE
          Because look at me. I just keep
          getting bigger and bigger.
                                                          74.


                    MONA
          Well, yeah. That's kind of how it
          goes.

                    ZOE
          I'm afraid I'm going to scare him
          away. I'm like one of those giant
          bouncy castles. Soon I'm going to
          take over the whole back yard.

                     MONA
          Come on.   He loves you for you.

                    ZOE
          I'm just getting kind of freaked
          out by everything. He asked me to
          go to this wedding with him. What
          kind of first impression am I going
          to make on all of his friends?

                    MONA
          Well, you're knocked up with some
          stranger's twins. So, already
          you're not exactly...

                    ZOE
          Not helping.

                    MONA
          Do you have anything to wear at
          least?


INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Stan, dressed in a tux, sits on Zoe's bed.    He turns to the
closet.

                    STAN
          Everything okay in there?

A cocktail dress FLIES out and hits him in the head.

                    STAN (CONT'D)
          Never mind.

He waits a few beats.   Another dress FLIES out.

                    ZOE (O.S.)
          This SUCKS!!!

                    STAN
          Honey, whatever you wear is fine.
                                                           75.


                    ZOE (O.S.)
          I don't have anything to wear!
          That's the problem.

Another dress sails through the air.

                       ZOE (CONT'D)
          Fuuuuuuck!

                    STAN
          You always look great. I've never
          seen you not look great.

Stan goes to the closet. Zoe is pulling on a long black
dress. She tries to smush her boobs down into the top.

                    STAN (CONT'D)
          That's perfect. You look hot.

                      ZOE
          Really?    You think?

Zoe turns to reveal the back.     The two sides of the zipper
are ten inches apart.

                    STAN
          Do you have a shawl or something?

Zoe bursts into tears.


EXT. PERRY STREET - LATER

A cab pulls up in front of Zoe's brownstone. Stan opens the
door for Zoe who is now wearing a long silver dress. While
it's certainly hugging every curve and bump, it looks great.

                    STAN
          You look smokin'.

                    ZOE
          Thanks, honey.

Zoe pauses in front of the open taxi door.

                       STAN
          Let's go.     We're super late.

She tries to bend at the waist, but the dress is too tight.
Then she tries to go in butt first and swing her legs around,
but again, the dress is too tight.

                       ZOE
          Hmmmm...
                                                           76.


                    STAN
          Why don't you sort of go in...head
          first and then turn around.

Zoe leans her head in and then has no other choice but to lie
down sideways on the seat. Stan tries not to laugh.

                    ZOE
          Shut up and push me.

                      STAN
          Push you?

                    ZOE
          Just do it.

Stan pushes her legs, and Zoe disappears inside the cab.


INT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS

Zoe lies down straight across the seats like a board.

                    ZOE
          I hate everyone.

She sucks in her breath and tries to sit up. As soon as she
bends at the waist, we hear a horrific RIP. She bursts into
tears again.


INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - LATER

We PAN over the coffee table. There's a pint of melty Ben
and Jerry's, a roll of cookie dough (half eaten,) US Weekly,
and The National Enquirer.

Zoe and Bobby lie on the floor looking at the ceiling.

                    ZOE
          Do you think he's telling everyone
          why I didn't go? I'm too much of a
          fat-ass walrus to go to the
          wedding?

                    BOBBY
          You're not a fat ass walrus.
          You're pregnant.

Zoe eyes well up with tears again.

                    BOBBY (CONT'D)
          Why are you crying? So what?   You
          missed a stupid wedding.
                    (MORE)
                                               77.

                    BOBBY (CONT'D)
          You got to have girls' night with
          me. This is way more fun.

                    ZOE
          I don't know. I'm just so
          emotional lately. It's the
          hormones.

                    BOBBY
          You can't help it. Being pregnant
          sucks. You're emotional, and
          irrational, and you get back fat.

                    ZOE
          I have back fat?

                     BOBBY
          No.  I'm just kidding.
              (then)
          Okay, yes. You have back fat.

Zoe feels her back.

                    ZOE
          How's Stan going to stay with me
          through this? I'm disgusting.

                    BOBBY
          We'll go shopping tomorrow. We'll
          get some hip maternity clothes...
          whatever that means.

                    ZOE
          Look at me, Bobby.

                      BOBBY
          What?

                    ZOE
              (pinching back fat)
          Look at me. What do you see?

                    BOBBY
          I see the most amazingly wonderful
          person I know.

Zoe smiles.   Tears come to her eyes again.

                    BOBBY (CONT'D)
          With back fat.
                                                        78.


INT. PUCK BUILDING - NIGHT

Stan leans against the bar with a beer in hand. He is
watching all of the Farmer's Market girls and his co-worker,
Fred, on the dance floor. Everyone looks drunk and happy.

Olivia stumbles towards him with an empty glass of champagne.

                    OLIVIA
          Why aren't you dancing?

                    STAN
          I'm just about to go.    It's late.

                    OLIVIA
          Come on, one dance.

The spaghetti strap of her dress falls over her shoulder.
Stan notices. She steps in closer.

                    OLIVIA (CONT'D)
          For old time's sake.

                    STAN
          I have a girlfriend, Olivia.

                    OLIVIA
          Never stopped you before.

She tries to kiss him.    Stan steps away.

                    STAN
          It's serious this time.

Olivia pulls back, surprised.


INT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - LATER

Zoe is asleep in the bed. Her bump looks very cute under the
covers. Stan quietly gets ready for bed. She turns to him,
half asleep.

                    ZOE
          How was it?

                    STAN
          Boring.

                    ZOE
          Good.

Stan gets in bed next to her.   Zoe scoots into him.
                                      79.


          ZOE (CONT'D)
I miss my old ass.

             STAN
Excuse me?

          ZOE
It was one of my best features.

          STAN
You know what's weird?   I never
knew your old ass.

          ZOE
It's kind of like this ass but way
hotter.

          STAN
I also don't know what you really
like to eat and what's just a
craving, or when you start laughing
hysterically and then crying and
you say, this isn't me, if that's
true because I don't really know
the real you. All I know is the
pregnant you.

          ZOE
That is weird.

          STAN
Or like how you're horny all the
time? Is that you? Or is that
pregnant you?

           ZOE
    (lying)
That's me.

          STAN
When all of this is over, who will
you be?

          ZOE
Hopefully, myself again.

          STAN
But...who is that?
                                                           80.


INT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - LATER

The clock by the bed says 2:30 a.m. Stan is snoring
slightly. Nuts is on the pillow beside him. Zoe's side is
empty.


INT. ZOE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Zoe sits on the floor of the living room sifting through a
box of photographs.

We FOLLOW her back into the bedroom and onto the bed. As
Stan slowly opens his eyes, she holds up a photograph.

His P.O.V.    It's a picture of a woman's ass.

                       ZOE
             This is my old ass.

Stan blinks a few times.      His eyes adjusting.

                       STAN
             Why do you have a picture of your
             ass?

                       ZOE
             My college boyfriend took it. So,
             I guess in fairness, my ass doesn't
             look exactly like this anymore, but
             it's pretty close. It's held up.

                       STAN
             It's a nice ass.

                       ZOE
             You said you don't know the real
             me, so I thought I'd show you.

She picks up another photograph. This one is of Zoe at
twelve and at her most awkward -- short hair, braces and
acne.

                       ZOE (CONT'D)
             This is me in seventh grade.

Stan props himself up in one elbow.

                       STAN
             Wow.

                       ZOE
             I know.
                                                        81.


                    STAN
          You look like Anthony Michael Hall.

                     ZOE
          This period, as horrible as it was,
          made me who I am. I think every
          person should go through a
          hideously ugly phase. It builds
          character.
              (then)
          It also taught me that I should
          never, under any circumstances,
          have short hair and a perm again.

She picks up another picture. It's Zoe in a bathing cap and
Speedo. She's holding up a yellow ribbon and has her arm
around Nana.

                      ZOE (CONT'D)
          This   is one of my favorites because
          look   how happy I am. I don't even
          know   what place yellow is, but I'm
          sure   it's not good.

                    STAN
          Fifth place.

                    ZOE
          But I still look super happy,
          right? That's all because of Nana.
          Whatever I did, she thought it was
          the best.

The next picture is a Halloween shot of Bobby, Mona and Zoe.
Bobby is all in green, Zoe is all in yellow and Mona is in
regular clothes.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          These are my best friends, Bobby
          and Mona. Mona and I met in high
          school and Bobby passed out on my
          couch in college and never left.
          You haven't met them yet because
          they might scare you away.

                    STAN
          Why are you dressed like that?

                    ZOE
          Halloween. We were supposed to be
          a traffic light but Mona bagged out
          at the last minute and so Bobby and
          I just look like idiots. That's
          typical Mona, by the way.
                                                        82.


Zoe puts the picture down and picks up another. It's a woman
in a hospital bed. She's giving the thumbs up sign.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          This is my mom.

Stan takes the picture and studies it.

                    STAN
          You look just like her.

                    ZOE
          This is the last picture of her
          that I have. She lived for a few
          more years, but we never took any
          pictures because she didn't want us
          to remember her like that. I was
          eight when she died.

                    STAN
          I...can't imagine.

                    ZOE
          She had a great laugh. And really
          soft hands. She used to rub my
          back before I went to sleep.

Zoe puts the picture on the bedside table, propping it up
next to her clock.

                    STAN
          Do you have any pictures of your
          dad?

Zoe doesn't say anything.

                    STAN (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry. If you don't want to
          talk about it...

                    ZOE
          My mother was in a coma for two
          years before the end. That's when
          my dad left her.

                      STAN
          Oh.

                    ZOE
          So...that's when he died.    To us,
          anyway.

                      STAN
          God, Zoe.    I'm so sorry.
                                                         83.


                    ZOE
              (after a beat)
          It's okay. It was an important
          lesson. That's when I realized
          that nothing lasts forever.

This sad statement hangs in the air for a few moments.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          So, that's my story. That's the
          real me.

                    STAN
          Things can last forever, you know.

                    ZOE
          Not for me they can't.

Stan takes her hand, and they stay like that for a while.
Just holding hands on the floor of her moonlit room.
Finally, the silence is broken by the telephone RINGING.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          That's weird.


INT. LORI'S APARTMENT BUILDING LOBBY - NIGHT

Zoe and Stan enter the lobby of an old building in Tribeca.

                    STAN
          I'm confused. Why did you say you
          would come witness this birth in
          the first place?

                    ZOE
          I don't know. Seemed like a good
          idea at the time. I was trying to
          get back in their good graces. Go
          home. I'll meet you there. I
          don't want them to see you anyway.

                    STAN
          It's four in the morning. I'm not
          letting you walk home alone.

                    ZOE
          Fine. I'll just pop in, show my
          face and leave. Ten minutes, tops.
                                                          84.


INT. LORI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

There are candles everywhere and a table of food and drinks.
Kind of like a birthing cocktail party. Zoe eats a brownie.

Carol approaches with Lori, who is wearing a caftan and
rubbing her large stomach. They all hug.

                      CAROL
            Zoe, it's so nice of you to come,
            especially at this crazy hour.

                      LORI
            You're really one of us now.

                      ZOE
            Are you sure you're in labor?
            You're so calm.

                      LORI
            Oh, I'm sure.

                      ZOE
            Well, I just wanted to come and say
            a quick hi and good luck.

                      LORI
            You're not staying?

                      CAROL
            You have to stay. Lori wants us
            all to be together for this.

                      ZOE
            Well, I really want to be here
            but...um, the truth is...actually
            I've been wanting to tell you guys
            for a while but, the truth is...

Lori drops her head on Zoe's shoulder and lets out a giant
MOAN. It's long and it's awkward.

                      CAROL
                (whispering)
            She's having a contraction.

Zoe nods.   This is weird.   Lori breathes through it.

                       LORI
            Okay.   What was it you were saying?

                      ZOE
            I'm back with Stan.
                                                          85.


                      LORI
          Stan who?

                    CAROL
          The farmer?

                    ZOE
          Actually, he makes cheese. He
          named a cheese after me. Isn't
          that romantic? Sort of?
              (off their blank stares)
          Well, anyway, I'm not technically a
          single mother by choice anymore.
          So, if you want me to leave right
          now, I totally understand. I'll
          just walk out the door and--

                    LORI
          No, I really want you to stay.

                      ZOE
                (bummed)
          Oh.

                    CAROL
          Listen, Zoe, if you're happy, we're
          happy. We'd love to meet him.
          Bring him to group any time.

                    ZOE
          Well, actually, he's downstairs, so
          I should probably get back to--

                     LORI
          Great.   Invite him up.

                    ZOE
          Oh, no, no, no...

                    LORI
          I'm not shy. I've been through
          this before. It's quite beautiful,
          really.

Zoe stands there trying to come up with another excuse.
After a few moments, it's clear that she cannot.


INT. LORI'S APARTMENT BUILDING LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

Stan looks up from the Hunan Lotus take-out menu he's been
reading to pass the time.
                                                       86.


                       STAN
          Excuse me?

                    ZOE
          Just a few minutes.

                    STAN
          I don't know, Zoe.

                    ZOE
          You have to come up. They begged
          me. And truthfully, I'm kind of
          scared of them. Please?


INT. LORI'S APARTMENT - LATER

Zoe and Stan hover over the dessert table. They both eat
brownies and keep their eyes down. Sara is next to them
nursing Dakota.

                    STAN
          This is weird.

                    ZOE
          Good brownies, though. This one
          has peanut butter in it.

Carol walks by with a little DRUM, which she bangs
rhythmically.

                    CAROL
          Come on everybody, it's time.
          She's getting into the water.

                       STAN
          The what?

                    CAROL
          Oh, it's a water birth.   Didn't Zoe
          tell you?

Carol starts banging the drum again and moves off.

                    STAN
          What's a water birth?

                    ZOE
          I don't know. But just so we're
          clear, this...
              (re. the whole scene)
          Is not the real me.
                                                          87.


                    STAN
          I'll wait here.

Zoe grabs another brownie and exits.


INT. LORI'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

In the middle of this very small, very cramped living room is
an inflatable baby pool. And in this baby pool is Lori, who
is now naked and pushing.

Zoe watches, horrified, the brownie still in her hand.    Carol
is beside her, playing the drum and chanting.

                    CAROL
          Hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-hi-ya-ya.

                    ZOE
              (eyes wide)
          Wow. Wow. Wow.

                    CAROL
          I know. It's amazing how the body
          can open up like that.

Zoe covers her mouth. It looks like she is going to throw
up. She stumbles for the door.

                    ZOE
          I'm just going to get some air.
          I'm feeling a little...

                    LORI
          Don't move, Zoe, you're my focal
          point.

Lori then GRUNTS through another big contraction.

                    MIDWIFE
          Push, Lori. Push.

While Lori's eyes are closed, Zoe tries to sneak out.    Carol
chases after, still beating the drum.

                    CAROL
          You can't leave.   You're her focal
          point.

                    ZOE
          Can't she use someone else?
                                                            88.


                    CAROL
          She's in labor. You want to argue
          with her now?

                                               DISSOLVE TO:


INT. LORI'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

Carol beats the drum faster now. Some of the other Single
Mothers by Choicers join her in the chant.

                    CAROL
          Hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-hi-ya-ya.

Lori lets out a SCREAM as Tabitha and the MIDWIFE pull her
legs back. Zoe watches with both hands over her mouth.

                     ZOE
          Oh, Jesus.
              (then)
          What is...that?

                    CAROL
          Sssshh. It's perfectly natural.
          Sometimes the bowels just let go.
              (then, back to chanting)
          Hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-hi-ya-ya.

The midwife fishes out the poop with a plastic bag.   Zoe
turns away, gagging. She drops her brownie.

                    LORI
              (yelling)
          Don't move, Zoe, I need you!
          You're my focal point.

                    ZOE
          What does that even mean?

Zoe turns back.   Her face white as a sheet.   Lori lets out
another WAIL.

                    LORI
          I need to turn over.    Please!

                    JESSIE
          Do it, Lori. We're here for you.
          We're all here for you.

Carol beats the drum faster as Lori gets on all fours. The
midwife lifts Lori's leg up to the side.   Lori lets out a
loud, WHALE-LIKE MOAN.
                                                         89.


                    CAROL
              (excited)
          Here comes the head.

Lori's moan turns into a DONKEY-LIKE BRAY.

                    JESSIE
          We can see the head, Lori.

                    CAROL
          There's so much hair!

                    ZOE
              (woozy, afraid)
          I don't think that's the baby's
          hair.

                    LORI
          I want to see the head. Get me a
          mirror. It's in the bedroom.

                    ZOE
          I'll get it.

Zoe makes a desperate attempt to run from the room.

                    LORI
          GOD DAMN IT ZOE, DON'T MOVE!!!!


INT. LORI'S FOYER - SAME

Out in the foyer, Stan is paralyzed.   Next to him is Dakota,
who is crying.

Through the hallway mirror, he can see what's going on in the
living room: a hefty woman on all fours in a dirty inflatable
swimming pool with a hairy head coming out of a hairy vag.

                    CAROL (O.S.)
          Stan, get the mirror!


INT. LORI'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Stan, walks backwards with his head down, holding a mirror.

                       STAN
          Excuse me.     Hello. I'm Stan.
          Excuse me.     Hi. I'm Stan.

Carol grabs the mirror and holds it under Lori. Lori lifts
her leg like a dog taking a piss and then starts to cry.
                                                           90.


                    LORI
          Look at all that wet, curly hair.

Stan steals a look, starts to dry heave and rushes to Zoe.

                    STAN
              (freaking out)
          Let's get the hell out of here.

                     ZOE
          I can't.   I'm her focal point.

                    STAN
          What does that mean?

                    ZOE
          I don't know.

Suddenly, we hear a huge SCREAM.

Zoe and Stan turn just in time to see the baby emerge and
plop into the water.

CU of the baby in the dirty water still attached to the
umbilical cord.

CU of Zoe and Stan's horrified faces.

Zoe's eyes roll back and we:

                                              FADE TO BLACK.

OVER BLACK we hear silence. Blessed silence. No drums. No
chants. No screams. Nothing. Until, we hear the SPLASH.


INT. LORI'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

We are CLOSE on Zoe's face.    She opens her eyes.   Blinks a
few times.

                    STAN
          Are you okay?

                    ZOE
          I don't know. Why am I wet?

WIDEN to reveal that Zoe is lying in the inflatable pool.
Her eyes go from side to side. The horror of the situation
becoming clear. A spongy, purple thing floats by.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          What is that?
                                                         91.


                    STAN
              (afraid)
          I think it's the placenta.

Zoe's eyes roll back again and we...

                                             FADE TO BLACK.


EXT. 14TH STREET - DAY

14th street is just coming to life as the FARMERS start to
unload their wares.

Zoe and Stan head up the street slowly, wearily, like
soldiers back from battle.

                   ZOE
          Wow. We really shouldn't have seen
          that.

                    STAN
          No.

                    ZOE
          I did mention that I barely know
          those people, right?

                    STAN
          Like forty times.

                    ZOE
          I feel the need to say it again.

They turn into the Farmer's Market.

ANGLE ON Fred unloading cheese from the back of the Little
Goat truck. Stan and Zoe slowly walk towards him.

                    STAN
          It won't be like that for us.

                    ZOE
          How do you know?

                    STAN
          Well, for starters, you wax.

ANGLE ON Olivia crossing from her berry stand to the cheese
stand with a blueberry pie. She is about to place the pie on
Stan's table when she looks up and sees Stan and Zoe.

                    OLIVIA
          Oh, hi.
                                                         92.


                       STAN
          Hi.
              (awkward beat, then)
          You remember Zoe.

                       OLIVIA
          Right, hi.

And then Olivia notices Zoe's pregnant belly.

                       OLIVIA (CONT'D)
          Wow.
                 (then, to Stan)
          Wow.

At the same time, Zoe notices the post-it on the pie.   It
says, SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

                    ZOE
          What is that supposed to mean?

                    OLIVIA
          It's nothing.

Olivia crumples the post-it and turns to Stan.

                    OLIVIA (CONT'D)
              (re. Zoe's pregnant belly)
          I had no idea it was that serious.

                    STAN
          I told you it was serious.

                    ZOE
              (interrupting)
          What the hell does, "sorry about
          last night" mean?

                    OLIVIA
          It's stupid. I was drunk and...

                    STAN
          It was nothing.

                    ZOE
          What was nothing?

Olivia turns back to Stan, flabbergasted.

                    OLIVIA
          You're having a baby? I didn't
          know you'd been together that long.
                                                        93.


                    STAN
          Well, they're not mine...but, yeah,
          we're having a baby. Two actually.

On Zoe's look of shock we...

                                                  CUT TO:


EXT. FARMER'S MARKET - MOMENTS LATER

The fruits and vegetables and flowers become a blur as Zoe
runs out of the Farmer's Market. Stan chases after her.

                    STAN
          Nothing happened.

                    ZOE
          Get away from me.

Stan runs in front of her, forcing her to stop.

                    STAN
          Nothing happened!

                    ZOE
          You said, "they're not mine."

                    STAN
          I didn't mean to say it.

                    ZOE
          How could you say that?

                    STAN
          I don't know. I was flustered.

                       ZOE
          Flustered?

                    STAN
          I'm sorry, I'm not exactly thinking
          straight. I've been up all night
          watching Orca give birth!

                    ZOE
              (incredulous)
          "They're not mine?"

                     STAN
               (at a loss )
          Well, I mean...technically, they're
          not.
                                                          94.


The minute he says this, he wishes he could take it back.
Zoe just looks at him. She shakes her head.

                    ZOE
          You know, all this time you're
          trying to figure out who the real
          me is, but who the fuck are you?

                     STAN
          Zoe.

She runs to a nearby cab and slams the door.


INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Zoe enters the apartment and slams the door behind her. She
runs to the couch and collapses in tears. Nuts wheels over
and stands beside her.


INT. LE PAIN QUOTIDIEN - DAY

Zoe and Mona are at their usual table.    Zoe looks like she
hasn't slept.

                    MONA
          Do you really think something
          happened with the berry girl?    They
          both said nothing happened.

                    ZOE
          Well, are they going to come out
          and tell me? And that's not even
          the point. He said, the babies
          weren't his. And if he says that,
          he thinks that. And if he thinks
          that, he's not really committed.

                    MONA
          So, now you run?

                    ZOE
          Why should I stick around for the
          end of the story when I know what
          it's going to be?

Mona says nothing.   She looks like she might say something
and then doesn't.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          What? If you want to say
          something, say it.
                                                    95.


                    MONA
          Do you know the end of the story?
          Can't you just give him the benefit
          of the doubt? He seems like such a
          good guy.

                    ZOE
          You haven't even met him.

                    MONA
          Yeah, and don't think I don't know
          the reason for that. You were
          never going to see this through,
          Zoe. Never. It was doomed before
          it began. Just like all of your
          relationships. You get out before
          you get hurt.

                    ZOE
          You don't think I'm hurt right now?

                    MONA
          Every man is not your father. When
          are you going to realize that?

                    ZOE
          You don't know what you're talking
          about.

                    MONA
          I've known you for thirty years. I
          know you don't trust people. You
          and your grandmother, both. She's
          been engaged to Arthur for how long
          now?

                    ZOE
          Leave Nana out of this.

                    MONA
          She's never going to marry him.
          Just like you'd never marry Stan.
          No wonder you ended up with a sperm
          donor. He'll never let you down.
          It's your ideal boyfriend.

Zoe's face changes.    She looks incredibly hurt.

                    ZOE
          I used a donor because I wanted a
          baby.

                       MONA
          I'm sorry.     I went too far.
                                                            96.


                    ZOE
          Because I wanted to have a family.
          Because Nana is the only one I've
          got and she's eighty-four years
          old. And then it will just be me.
          So, yeah, you went a little too
          far.

Zoe leaves Mona at the table.


INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Zoe and Nuts lie on the pillow together.    Zoe scratches
behind his ears.

                    ZOE
          Guess it's just you and me again.

Nuts licks her face. She gets out of bed and goes to check
her belly in the mirror. It's actually getting kind of huge.


EXT. ZOE'S BROWNSTONE - DAY

Zoe walks down the steps. Stan is waiting for her on the
sidewalk. His hands in his pockets.

                       ZOE
          What.

                    STAN
          It's Thursday. We have a doctor's
          appointment.

                    ZOE
          There is no "we", Stan.

                    STAN
          Come on, I didn't mean to say it,
          and that's not how I feel.

Zoe shakes her head.

                    ZOE
          I made a mistake trusting you.

                    STAN
          Don't say that.     That's not true.

                    ZOE
          You're not good for me. You made
          me think I needed you, and I don't.
                                                         97.


                    STAN
          So that's it? Because of one
          stupid, asinine thing that I said,
          it's all over? This is how it
          ends?

                     ZOE
          Yes.  This is how it ends.
              (then)
          I don't know why you're so
          surprised. I told you, nothing
          lasts forever.

Zoe gives him a matter-of-fact shrug and walks off.


INT. DR. HARRIS' OFFICE - DAY

Dr. Harris moves the ultrasound wand over Zoe's belly.   Zoe
holds up her shirt and watches the monitor.

                    DR. HARRIS
          Things look great.

                      ZOE
          Good.

                    DR. HARRIS
          So, I'll see you back in two weeks,
          and we'll start checking to see if
          the babies are dropping.

                    ZOE
          It's hard to believe we're in the
          home stretch.

Dr. Harris helps Zoe sit up.

                    DR. HARRIS
          Now's the time I start discussing a
          birthing plan with my patients. Do
          you want me to wait until next time
          when Stan's here?

                      ZOE
          Oh.    Uh, no. He won't be here.

                    DR. HARRIS
          He's out of town or something?

                      ZOE
          No.    He's just...out.
                                                          98.


                     DR. HARRIS
          Oh.   I'm sorry to hear that.

                    ZOE
          It's back to just you and me now.
          We've come full circle.

                    DR. HARRIS
          Well, don't you want anyone with
          you in the delivery room? You
          know, like a birthing partner?


INT. SHADYBROOK COURTYARD - DAY

Zoe and Nana are speed-walking.    Nana stops, excited.

                       NANA
          Me?

                     ZOE
          Yeah.   Is that okay?

                       NANA
          Of course.

                     ZOE
          Good.   `Cause you're all I've got.

                    NANA
          What do I have to do?

                    ZOE
          I don't know. It will be a
          c-section, so, basically, just
          stand there and try not to faint.

                    NANA
          I can do that.

                    ZOE
          Thanks, Nana. It means a lot to me
          that you'll be there.

                    NANA
          Are you kidding me? I've been
          waiting my whole life for this.

They pass Arthur, who is in his usual spot, but instead of
leering at Nana, he's in his chair with his head back and
eyes closed.

                    ZOE
          Holy shit, is he dead?
                                                     99.


                       NANA
          Sleeping.

                    ZOE
          How can you tell?

                    NANA
          He's been like that all morning.    I
          wore him out last night.

                     ZOE
          Wow.   I did not need to know that.

                    NANA
          We were celebrating.
              (with a smile)
          We finally set a date.

Zoe stops dead in her tracks.

                       ZOE
          Excuse me?


INT. SHADYBROOK DINING ROOM - DAY

Nana walks Zoe through the Shadybrook dining room.

                    NANA
          So, we'll put the band here and the
          dance floor right here.

                    ZOE
          I can't believe you're getting
          married. What made you change your
          mind?

                    NANA
          All of a sudden it just hit me,
          what am I waiting for? I love him.
          He loves me. What am I so afraid
          of?

                     ZOE
          Wow.   This is...really big news.

                    NANA
          You don't seem happy.

                    ZOE
          No, I am. It's just...it just
          makes my situation seem all the
          more tragic. You're getting
          married and here I am...
                                                        100.


Her voice trails off.

                      NANA
          Zoe.

                    ZOE
          Don't worry. I'm fine.    I'm really
          happy for you.

                    NANA
          I'm worried about you, honey.

                      ZOE
          I'm fine.

                    NANA
          I just don't want you to make the
          same mistakes I made. I've been
          alone for over thirty years now,
          and that's too long. Sometimes in
          life you have to forgive and move
          on.

                    ZOE
          Are you talking about my father or
          Stan?

                    NANA
          Both, baby.


INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Zoe has her box of photographs.   She pulls out a picture from
the very bottom.

                    NANA (V.O.)
          Because if you don't learn how to
          forgive, you will always be stuck
          in the past.

The photo is Zoe at age four and a man who looks so much like
her, that it can only be her father.

After a long beat, she puts it on her bedside table, next to
the one of her mother. The two pictures, side-by-side make
up a family. Zoe and her father in one shot and her mother
from the hospital bed giving the thumbs up sign in the other.

Over this image, we hear a quartet playing WEDDING MUSIC.
                                                        101.


INT. CHURCH - DAY

The music takes us into the church and there we find Nana,
lovely in her wedding gown, and Arthur, dashing in his
morning suit, standing at the alter holding hands. Both have
tears in their eyes. Arthur lifts her veil and gives her the
sweetest kiss.

ANGLE ON Zoe and Bobby in the first pew, passing a
handkerchief back and forth.


INT. SHADYBROOK REC ROOM - LATER

Bobby leans against the piano singing a beautiful rendition
of "What a Wonderful World."

Nana and Arthur are alone on the dance floor.   It's their
first dance as husband and wife.

                    BOBBY
              (singing)
          I see trees of green, red roses
          too. I see them bloom for me and
          you...

Zoe watches, her hands on her belly.   Mona stands beside her.

                    MONA
          This song always makes me cry.

                     ZOE
          Me, too.

                    MONA
          Is it happy or sad? The words are
          happy but the song is so sad.

                    ZOE
          I guess it's both.   Happy and sad.

                    BOBBY
              (singing)
          I see skies of blue and clouds of
          white. The bright blessed day, the
          dark and sacred night...

                    MONA
          I'm sorry about the things I said.

                     ZOE
          I know.
                                                       102.


                    MONA
          It was really shitty of me.

                    ZOE
          It was. Especially because you
          were right.

Mona takes Zoe's hand.

                    BOBBY
              (singing)
          And I think to myself...what a
          wonderful world...

                    ZOE
          I don't want to be alone forever,
          Mona.

                    MONA
          Then don't be.


EXT. FARMER'S MARKET - DAY

Stan stares off into space. His beard is back.   A CUSTOMER
surveys the different cheeses on the table.

                    CUSTOMER
          Is this new? The Zoe?

                    STAN
          Yeah. This is the first week it's
          been out.

                    CUSTOMER
          Can I have a sample?     What's it
          like?

                    STAN
          It's...very stubborn, overly
          suspicious and distrustful of men.

The customer looks up at Stan.

                    CUSTOMER
          Huh?


INT. SHADYBROOK REC ROOM - LATER

Bobby pulls Zoe onto the dance floor.

                    BOBBY
          Come on, you old maid.
                                                       103.


                       ZOE
          No.

                    BOBBY
          Dance with me. One dance.

                       ZOE
          Forget it.

                    BOBBY
          Fine. But it doesn't mean that I
          won't dance with you.

                       ZOE
          What?

Bobby starts dancing. But really dancing. Justin Timberlake
style. Zoe smiles at the absurdity and then tries to walk
away. But Bobby won't let her escape. He blocks her path
and keeps dancing. This time turning around and shaking his
ass triple-time, like Beyonce.

                       BOBBY
          Haaaaaay.

                    ZOE
          Go away, you freak.

A crowd of old people gather round. They start clapping,
thinking this is some kind of young person's dance routine.

                    BOBBY
          Smack it, Bitch.

Bobby takes Zoe's hand and smacks his ass with it.

                    BOBBY (CONT'D)
          You know you love it. Uh-huh.
          That's right. Smack it.

The old people do the same. Trying to learn the hip new
dance the kids are doing. Several octogenarian couples
smacking each other's asses.

While this is happening, a weird look crosses Zoe's face.

Bobby jumps up and turns around to face Zoe. But when he
lands on the ground, his feet slide out from under him and he
hits the floor.

                    BOBBY (CONT'D)
          What the hell?

An OLD MAN in the crowd looks down at the puddle.
                                                         104.


                    OLD MAN
          Damn it. Not again.
              (then, checks pants)
          Nope. Not me.

A few other old people look down and check themselves.   At
which point, Zoe looks down and realizes.

                    ZOE
          I think my water just broke.


EXT. SHADYBROOK RETIREMENT HOME - DAY

The whole retirement community is outside throwing rice as
Zoe, Bobby, Mona, Nana and Arthur try to figure out the
logistics of the trip to the hospital.

                    ZOE
          I'll drive.

                    NANA
          You're in labor.   You can't drive.

                    ARTHUR
          I'll drive.

                     NANA
          You don't have a car or a license.
              (then, to Bobby)
          You drive.

                    BOBBY
          We're in Queens. I don't even know
          what side of the road they drive on
          here.

                    ZOE
          Will someone please just drive me
          to the fucking hospital?

All of a sudden, a white ROLLS ROYCE pulls up.   Mona's at the
wheel. She leans out and waves.

                    MONA
          This was my surprise for after the
          wedding, but let's hit it.

                    BOBBY
          This works.

They all pile in.
                                                       105.


And then the car pulls off, revealing a sign that says, JUST
MARRIED...FINALLY! "Ensure" cans tied to strings bump along
behind them.


INT. ROLLS ROYCE - LATER

Things are a bit frantic in the car.

                    NANA
          Are you okay? Remember to breathe.
          Breathe in, breathe out, breathe
          in.

Mona looks at Zoe in the rearview and does Lamaze breaths.

                    MONA
          Hee-hee, hoo-hoo, hee-hee.

                    NANA
              (joining in)
          Hoo-hoo. Hee-hee...

                     MONA/NANA
          Hoo-hoo.   Hee-hee...

                    ZOE
          Please stop. It's getting really
          breathy in here. I'm fine.

                    BOBBY
          What about me? I have amniotic
          fluid on my Gucci tux.

ANGLE on the mini bar, which is fully stocked.

                    ARTHUR
          Who needs a drink?

Everyone (including Zoe) raises their hands.


INT. LENOX HILL HOSPITAL - DAY

Zoe is being wheeled into Labor and Delivery with the gang in
tow. Bobby still has a glass of champagne in his hand. Nana
grabs the glass and swigs it.

                    NANA
              (whispering)
          Bobby...

                     BOBBY
          What?
                                                         106.


                    NANA
          I don't know if I can do this.

                       BOBBY
          What?!

                    NANA
          I can't go in with her.

                    BOBBY
          Well, I certainly can't do it.   I
          don't do vaginas.

They look at Arthur, who struggles to keep up with his
walker.

                    ARTHUR
          Don't look at me.

Nana starts to hyperventilate.

                    NANA
          Help me, Bobby.

                    BOBBY
          Nana, pull yourself together. This
          is the biggest moment of Zoe's
          life, and you can't let her down.
          I'd slap you right now, but I'm
          afraid your teeth would fly out.


INT. LABOR AND DELIVERY ROOM - DAY

Zoe is now alone in a room wearing a hospital gown.

                    ZOE
          Hee-hee, hoo-hoo, hee-hee, hoo-hee.

 Bobby enters, all sweetness and light.

                       BOBBY
          Hey, girl.     How ya doing?

                       ZOE
          Okay.

                    BOBBY
          Good.
              (smiles, then)
          So, I really don't want you to
          worry, but Nana just passed out at
          the nurse's station and is now down
          in the ER getting stitches.
                                                        107.


                       ZOE
          What???

                    BOBBY
          Everything's under control. Good
          thing we're at the hospital, right?

Zoe jumps out of bed.

                    ZOE
          Where is she?

                    BOBBY
          Get back in bed. All is well.
          Arthur's with her. Now, on to
          bigger and better...who do you want
          to be your birthing partner? Your
          choices are me or Mona.

Zoe starts to cry.

                    BOBBY (CONT'D)
          I know. They're shitty choices.
          Do you want me to call your scary
          lesbian friends from your group?

                    ZOE
          I don't know.

                    BOBBY
          We're going to get through this,
          okay? You just have to really
          think about it. Who do you want
          with you in the delivery room?

Zoe wipes her tears.

                     BOBBY (CONT'D)
          Who is the one person you want by
          your side?


EXT. 77TH STREET - DAY

Zoe runs down the street with a blanket over her hospital
gown.

                       ZOE
          Taxi!


INT. TAXI - MOMENTS LATER

Zoe jumps in.   The cabbie looks at her in the rearview mirror
                                                       108.


                    CABBIE
          You're not an escaped mental
          patient, are you?

                       ZOE
          Kind of.


EXT. 14TH STREET - DAY

Zoe runs across 14th street. The blanket flaps behind her
like a cape. She looks like a hugely pregnant super-hero.

And suddenly, she has to slow down and then stop completely
for a contraction. She leans against a parked van to steady
herself.

                     ZOE
          Ow.   Son of a bitch, that hurts.

                    OLIVIA
          Are you okay?

Out of the corner of her eye, Zoe sees an enormous strawberry
on the side of the van. And then next to it, she sees
Olivia.

                    OLIVIA (CONT'D)
          Are you in labor?

As soon as the contraction ends...

                       ZOE
          Fuck off.

Zoe takes off again.    Olivia watches her go.


EXT. FARMER'S MARKET - LATER

Zoe runs through the market looking for Stan.

ANGLE ON Stan's truck, where Stan and Fred are unloading
cheese.

                       ZOE
          Stan!

Fred turns around and sees Zoe running. All belly and boobs
bouncing towards him. Her gown starting falling off.

                    FRED
          Whoa. I've had nightmares that
          started like this.
                                                      109.


                      ZOE
          Stan!

Stan turns.

                      STAN
          Zoe?

                      ZOE
          Stan!

                    STAN
          Are you okay? Don't run!

                    ZOE
          I can't help it!

She keeps running towards him. He now runs towards her.
They finally meet. Zoe is out of breath and can barely talk.

                    STAN
          Are you all right?

                    ZOE
              (panting)
          Great. I'm great.

                    STAN
          Why are you in a hospital gown?

                    ZOE
          I'm in labor.

                     STAN
          What?   What the hell are you doing
          here?

                      ZOE
          It's you.

                      STAN
          What?

                      ZOE
          Nana's my birthing partner, but she
          passed out and needed stitches, and
          Bobby asked me who I most wanted
          with me, and...it's you. It's only
          you.
               (then)
          I don't want to be alone anymore.
          I love you. You don't know how
          much I love you.
                                                          110.


Stan doesn't know what to say.   He's literally speechless.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          More than anything in the world, I
          love you.

                    STAN
          I've been in love with you since
          the moment you stole my cab.

Zoe bends over, holding her stomach.   A contraction.

                    ZOE
          Hee-hee, hoo-hoo, it was my cab,
          hee-hee, hoo-hoo.

The contraction ends. Zoe can finally smile again.      Stan
laughs and throws his arms around her.

                      ZOE (CONT'D)
          Ow.   Ow.   Ow.

                     STAN
          I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. I just
          love you. I love you so much.
              (then)
          Let's get the hell out of here.

                    ZOE
          Yeah. I think I really need to go
          to the hospital now.

They kiss again. And then pull apart and look at each other.
Stan has tears in his eyes.

                    STAN
          Let's go have our babies.

People clap and cheer as they hurry out of the Farmer's
Market. Even Olivia, watching from a distance, can't help
but applaud the big moment.


INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY

Some fantastic song that makes us want to cry is playing...

We are CLOSE on Zoe's face. She is smiling.    She does not
look scared. And she does not look alone.

WIDEN to reveal Stan by her side.
                                                        111.


And we PULL BACK and above the operating table and see Dr.
Harris performing the C-section. He pulls out the babies one
by one.

We FOLLOW the babies as they get swaddled tight and handed
back to Zoe and Stan.

Zoe and Stan look at the little girls and then at each other.
They are both in tears. Even Dr. Harris can't help but cry.


INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

It's night.   Zoe is asleep.

She opens her eyes and takes a moment to figure out where she
is. She turns to the side and finds Stan sleeping next to
her, curled up against her in the tiny hospital bed.

To the side of the bed are two bassinets.   Each baby sleeping
soundly in a little pink hat.

And in the next bed is Nana, asleep with a bandage on her
forehead.


EXT. 6TH AVENUE - DAY

Nuts trots/rolls down the sidewalk wearing a sweater that
says, "I'M A BIG BROTHER."

We TILT up and see Zoe and Stan strolling arm in arm, each
with a Baby Bjorn with a rosy-cheeked baby girl in it. Both
girls have flaming red hair.

A woman pushing a stroller passes by.   She smiles at Zoe and
Stan. They smile back.

                     WOMAN
          Hi.

                     ZOE
          Hi.

                     STAN
          Hi.


INT. GRAY'S PAPAYA HOT DOGS - DAY

They are now at the counter with hot dogs in front of them.

                    ZOE
          Who knew you were such a romantic.
                                                112.


                     STAN
          Well, it's the anniversary of our
          first date. Where else would I
          take you?
              (then)
          Cheers.

They clink dogs and each take a bite.

                    STAN (CONT'D)
          What a year, huh?

                    ZOE
          Incredible. Wouldn't change a
          thing. Well, except for the part
          where you dumped me.

                    STAN
          And the part where you dumped me.
              (to the babies)
          Girls...Mommy and Daddy were
          stupid.

The babies smile and coo.

                    ZOE
              (baby-talk)
          Yes, we were. Yes, we were.

                    STAN
          The first time we held hands was in
          here. It started out as a high-
          five, but then I strategically
          turned into a hand-hold.

                    ZOE
          How do you remember that?

                    STAN
          We both agreed that we were totally
          sick of weddings and hated when
          people wrote their own vows.

                    ZOE
          That's right. I remember that.

                    STAN
          So...I hope you won't hold it
          against me.

                    ZOE
          What?
                                                         113.


Nana and Arthur come through the door smiling.    Zoe looks at
them, confused.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          What are you doing here?

And then Bobby comes through the door.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          Bobby?

And then Mona.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          What's happening?

And Joan and Edward. And Jalisa. And Fred. And Carol, Lori
and Sara with Dakota planted on her breast. And a priest.
And we...

                                                DISSOLVE TO:


INT. GRAY'S PAPAYA HOT DOGS - LATER

Zoe and Stan, still wearing the Baby Bjorns, stand face to
face in front of the guests and the priest.

                    STAN
          I promise to love you even though
          you still eat chicken McNuggets in
          bed. I promise to name cheeses
          after all of our children no matter
          how embarrassed they are by it. I
          promise to always check out your
          ass when you walk away, and I
          promise to love you more tomorrow
          than I do today, which doesn't even
          seem impossible...

And slowly, the sound of Stan's voice fades out and the sound
of Louis Armstrong's voice fades in...

And we watch Zoe's face as she realizes that there are some
things that really will last forever.

                                           FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

EXT.  PARK - DAY

Brief shot of duel.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My father, who was well-known to the
	best circles in this kingdom under
	the name of roaring Harry James, was
	killed in a duel, when I was fifteen
	years old.

EXT.  GARDEN - DAY

Mrs. James, talking with a suitor; Roderick, at a
distance.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My mother, after her husband's
	death, and her retirement, lived in
	such a way as to defy slander.  She
	refused all offers of marriage,
	declaring that she lived now for her
	son only, and for the memory of her
	departed saint.

EXT.  STREET - DAY

Mother and son walking together.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My mother was the most beautiful
	women of her day.  But if she was
	proud of her beauty, to do her
	justice, she was still more proud of
	her son, and has said a thousand
	times to me that I was the
	handsomest fellow in the world.

EXT.  CHURCH - DAY

Mother and son entering church.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The good soul's pleasure was to
	dress me; and on Sundays and
	Holidays, I turned out in a velvet
	coat with a silver-hilted sword by
	my side, and a gold garter at my
	knee as fine as any lord in the
	land.  As we walked to church on
	Sundays, even the most envious souls
	would allow that there was not a
	prettier pair in the kingdom.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

A picnic.  The Dugan family.  Roderick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My uncle's family consisted of ten
	children, and one of them was the
	cause of all my early troubles; this
	was the belle of the family, my
	cousin, Miss Dorothy Dugan, by name.

EXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY

A sprawling run-down Irish manor house with large garden,
stables, barn and farm.

Idealized images of Dorothy.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Ah!  That first affair, how well one
	remembers it!  What a noble
	discovery it is that the boy makes
	when he finds himself actually and
	truly in love with some one!  A lady
	who is skilled in dancing or singing
	never can perfect herself without a
	deal of study in private.  So it is
	with the dear creatures who are
	skilled in coquetting.  Dorothy, for
	instance, was always practicing, and
	she would take poor me to rehearse
	her accomplishments upon...

Dorothy talking with the exciseman.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	... or the exciseman, when he came
	his rounds.

Dorothy talking to the steward.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	... or the steward.

Dorothy sitting under a tree with the curate, reading a
book.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	... or the poor curate.

Dorothy talking to the apothecary's lad.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	... or the young apothecary's lad
	from Dugan's Town whom I recollect
	beating once for that very reason.

Roderick, fighting with apothecary's lad.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The torments of jealousy she made me
	endure were horrible.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

Dorothy, like a greyhound released from days of
confinement, and given the freedom of the fields at last,
runs at top-speed, left and right, back and forth,
returning every moment to Roderick.

She runs and runs until she is out of breath, and then
laughs at the astonishment which keeps Roderick motionless
and staring at her.

After catching her breath, and wiping her forehead, she
challenges Roderick to a race.

			RODERICK
	I accept, but I insist on a wager.
	The loser must do whatever the
	winner pleases.

			DOROTHY
	Agreed.

			RODERICK
	Do you see the gate at the end of
	the field?  The first to touch it
	will be the winner.

They line up together and start on a count of three.
Dorothy uses all her strength, but Roderick holds back,
and Dorothy touches the gate five or six paces ahead of
him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I was certain to win, but I meant to
	lose to see what she would order me
	to do.

Dorothy catches her breath, thinking of the penalty.  Then
she goes behind the trees and, a few second later, comes
out and says:

			DOROTHY
	Your penalty is to find a cherry-
	colored ribbon which I have hidden
	somewhere on my person.  You are
	free to look for it anywhere you
	will, and I will think very little
	of you if you do not find it.

They sit down on the grass.  Roderick searches her
pockets, the fold of her short bodice and her skirt, then
her shoes; then he turns up her skirt, slowly and
circumspectly, as high as her garters, which she wears
upon the knee.  He unfastens them and finds nothing; he
draws down her skirt and gropes under her armpits.  The
tickling makes her laugh.

			RODERICK
	I feel the ribbon.

			DOROTHY
	Then you must get it.

Roderick has to unlace her bodice and touch her pretty
breasts, over which his hand must pass to reach it.

			DOROTHY
	Why are you shaking?

			RODERICK
	With pleasure at finding the ribbon.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

Military review.  One hundred English troops, a few
mounted officers, a small military band, fifty local
people.

The Dugan family, Roderick and his mother, Captains Best
and Grogan.

Roderick admires the troops in their splendid uniforms.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	About this time, the United Kingdom
	was in a state of great excitement
	from the threat generally credited
	of a French invasion.  The noblemen
	and people of condition in that and
	all other parts of the kingdom
	showed their loyalty by raising
	regiments of horse and foot to
	resist the invaders.  How I envied
	them.  The whole country was alive
	with war's alarums; the three
	kingdoms ringing with military
	music, while poor I was obliged to
	stay at home in my fustian jacket
	and sigh for fame in secret.

INT.  BALLROOM AT FENCIBLES - NIGHT

Dorothy and Roderick entering.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Once, the officers of the Kilwangen
	regiment gave a grand ball to which
	Dorothy persuaded my to take her.

Several cuts depicting the evening.

Dorothy ignores Roderick; dances, chats, laughs, drinks
punch, and finally, strolls outside with Captain Best.

Roderick makes a half-hearted try at dancing with Miss
Clancy.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I have endured torments in my life,
	but none like that.  Some of the
	prettiest girls there offered to
	console me, for I was the best
	dancer in the room, but I was too
	wretched, and so remained alone all
	night in a state of agony.  I did
	not care for drink, or know the
	dreadful comfort of it in those
	days; but I thought of killing
	myself and Dorothy, and most
	certainly of making away with
	Captain Best.

EXT.  FENCIBLES BALLROOM - DAWN

The guests leaving and saying their goodbyes.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	At last, and at morning, the ball
	was over.

EXT.  ROAD - DAWN

Dorothy and Roderick on horseback together.

			DOROTHY
	Sure it's a bitter night, Roderick
	dear, and you'll catch cold without
	a handkerchief to your neck.

To this sympathetic remark, from the pillion, the saddle
made no reply.

			DOROTHY
	Did you and Miss Clancy have a
	pleasant evening, Roderick?  You
	were together, I saw, all night.

To this, the saddle only replies by grinding his teeth,
and giving a lash to Daisy.

			DOROTHY
	Oh!  Mercy, you make Daisy rear and
	throw me, you careless creature,
	you.

The pillion had by this got her arm around the saddle's
waist, and gave it the gentlest squeeze in the world.

			RODERICK
	I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do!
	And I only danced with her because
	-- because -- the person with whom I
	intended to dance chose to be
	engaged the whole night.

			DOROTHY
	I had not been in the room five
	minutes before I was engaged for
	every single set.

			RODERICK
	Were you obliged to dance five times
	with Captain Best, and then stroll
	out with him into the garden?

			DOROTHY
	I don't care a fig for Captain Best;
	he dances prettily to be sure, and
	is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He
	looks well in his regimentals, too;
	and if he chose to ask me to dance,
	how could I refuse him?

			RODERICK
	But you refused me, Dorothy.

			DOROTHY
	Oh!  I can dance with you any day,
	and to dance with your own cousin at
	a ball as if you could find no other
	partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain
	Best's a man, and you are only a
	boy, and you haven't a guinea in the
	world.

			RODERICK
	If ever I meet him again, you shall
	see which is the best man of the
	two.  I'll fight him with sword or
	with pistol, captain as he is.

			DOROTHY
	But Captain Best is already known as
	a valiant soldier, and is famous as
	a man of fashion in London.  It is
	mighty well of you to fight farmers'
	boys, but to fight an Englishman is
	a very different matter.

Roderick falls silent.

EXT.  SMALL BRIDGE OVER A STREAM - DAWN

They come to an old, high bridge, over a stream,
sufficiently deep and rocky.

			DOROTHY
	Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are
	such a hero, was passing over the
	bridge and the enemy on the other
	side.

			RODERICK
	I'd draw my sword, and cut my way
	through them.

			DOROTHY
	What, with me on the pillion?  Would
	you kill poor me?

			RODERICK
	Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd
	do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river,
	and swim you both across, where no
	enemy could follow us.

			DOROTHY
	Jump twenty feet!  You wouldn't dare
	to do any such thing on Daisy.
	There's the captain's horse, Black
	George, I've heard say that Captain
	Bes --

She never finished the word for, maddened by the continual
recurrence of that odious monosyllable, Roderick shouts:

			RODERICK
	Hold tight to my waist!

And, giving Daisy the spur, springs with Dorothy over the
parapet, into the deeper water below.

The horse's head sinks under, the girl screams as she
sinks, and screams as she rises.

Roderick lands her, half-fainting, on the shore.

INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

Various cuts showing illness and convalescence.

Roderick feverish:  the doctor taking his pulse.

Mother brings a tray of food.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I went home, and was ill speedily of
	a fever, which kept me to my bed for
	a week.

Dorothy visiting him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Dorothy visited me only once, but I
	quitted my couch still more
	violently in love than I had been
	ever before.

EXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY

The air is fresh and bright, and the birds sing loud
amidst the green trees.  Roderick is elated, and springs
down the road, as brisk as a young fawn.

He encounters an orderly whistling "Roast Beef of Old
England," as he cleans down a cavalry horse.

			RODERICK
	Whose horse, fellow, is that?

			ORDERLY
	Feller, indeed!  The horse belongs
	to my captain, and he's a better
	fellow nor you any day.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I did not stop to break his bones,
	as I would on another occasion, for
	a horrible suspicion had come across
	me, and I made for the garden as
	quickly as I could.

Roderick see Captain Best and Dorothy pacing the path
together.  Her arm is under his, and he is fondling and
squeezing her little hand which lies closely nestling
against his arm.

Some distance beyond them is Captain Grogan, who is paying
court to Dorothy's sister, Mysie.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The fact is that, during the week of
	my illness, no other than Captain
	Best was staying at Castle Dugan,
	and making love to Miss Dorothy in
	form.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	No, Dorothy, except for you and four
	others, I vow before all the gods,
	my heart had never felt the soft
	flame.

			DOROTHY
	Ah, you men, you men, John, your
	passion is not equal to ours.  We
	are like -- like some plant I've
	read of -- we bear but one flower,
	and then we die!

			CAPTAIN BEST
	Do you mean you never felt an
	inclination for another?

			DOROTHY
	Never, my John, but for thee!  How
	can you ask me such a question?

Raising her hand to his lips.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	Darling Dorothea!

Roderick rushes into view, drawing his little sword.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I pulled out a knot of cherry-
	colored ribbons, which she had given
	me out of her breast, and which
	somehow I always wore upon me, and
	flung them in Captain Best's face,
	and rushed out with my little sword
	drawn.

			RODERICK
	She's a liar -- she's a liar,
	Captain Best!  Draw, sir, and defend
	yourself, if you are a man!

Roderick leaps at Captain Best, and collars him, while
Dorothy makes the air echo with her screams.

Captain Grogan and Mysie hasten up.

Though Roderick is a full growth of six feet, he is small
by the side of the enormous English captain.

Best turns very red at the attack upon him, and slips back
clutching at his sword.

Dorothy, in an agony of terror, flings herself round him,
screaming:

			DOROTHY
	Captain Best, for Heaven's sake,
	spare the child -- he is but an
	infant.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	And ought to be whipped for his
	impudence, but never fear, Miss
	Dugan, I shall not touch him, your
	favorite is safe from me.

So saying, he stoops down and picks up the bunch of
ribbons, which Roderick had flung at Dorothy's feet, and
handing it to her, says in a sarcastic tone:

			CAPTAIN BEST
	When ladies make presents to
	gentlemen, it is time for other
	gentlemen to retire...

			DOROTHY
	Good heavens, Best!  He is but a boy
	and don't signify any more than my
	parrot or lap-dog.  Mayn't I give a
	bit of ribbon to my own cousin?

			RODERICK
		   (roaring)
	I'm a man, and will prove it.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	You are perfectly welcome, miss, as
	many yards as you like.

			DOROTHY
	Monster!  Your father was a tailor,
	and you are always thinking of the
	shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I
	will!  Roddy, will you see me
	insulted?

			RODERICK
	Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to
	have his blood as sure as my name's
	Roderick.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	I'll send for the usher to cane you,
	little boy, but as for you, miss, I
	have the honor to wish you a good
	day.

Best takes off his hat with much ceremony, and makes a low
bow, and is just walking off, when Michael, Roderick's
cousin, comes up, whose ear has likewise been caught by
the scream.

			MICHAEL
	Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the
	matter here?

			CAPTAIN BEST
	I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan.
	I have had enough of Miss Dugan here
	and your Irish ways.  I ain't used
	to 'em, sir.

			MICHAEL
		   (good-humoredly)
	Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make
	you used to our ways, or adopt
	English ones.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	It's not the English way, for ladies
	to have two lovers, and, so, Mr.
	Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the
	sum you owe me, and I resign all
	claims to this young lady.  If she
	has a fancy for school-boys, let her
	take 'em, sir.

			MICHAEL
	Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	I never was more in earnest.

Best exits.

			MICHAEL
		   (in a towering rage)
	You -- you!  Hang you for a meddling
	brat, your hand is in everybody's
	pie.  What business had you to come
	brawling and quarreling here, with
	a gentleman who has fifteen hundred
	a-year?

Michael runs after Best.

			DOROTHY
		   (gasps)
	Oh, I shall die; I know I shall.  I
	shall never leave this spot.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
		   (whisper to Dorothy)
	The Captain is gone.

Dorothy, giving him an indignant look, jumps up and walks
towards the house.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
		   (in a soothing tone
		    to Roderick)
	This is a pretty way to recommend
	yourself to the family.

			RODERICK
		   (shouts after
		    Michael)
	The man that marries Dorothy Dugan
	must first kill me -- do you mind
	that?

			MICHAEL
		   (shouting back from
		    a distance)
	Pooh, sir.  Kill you -- flog you,
	you mean!  I'll send for Nick the
	huntsman to do it.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	You are a gallant lad, and I like
	your spirit.  But what Dugan says is
	true.  It's a hard thing to give a
	lad counsel who is in such a far-
	gone state as you; but, believe me,
	I know the world, and if you will
	but follow my advice, you won't
	regret having taken it.  Dorothy
	Dugan has not a penny; you are not a
	whit richer.  And, my poor boy,
	don't you see -- though it's a hard
	matter to see -- that she's a flirt,
	and does not care a pin for you or
	Best either?

			RODERICK
	Dorothy might love me or not, as she
	likes, but Best will have to fight
	me before he marries her!

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Faith, I think you are a lad that's
	likely to keep your word.

He looks hard at Roderick for a second to two, then he
walks away, humming a tune, looking back at Roderick as he
goes through the old gate out of the garden.

When Grogan is gone, Roderick is quite alone, and he
flings himself down on the bench where Dorothy had made
believe to faint, and had left her handkerchief and the
ribbons and, taking them up, hides his face in them, and
bursts into a passion of tears.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I must have sat for some hours
	bemoaning myself on the garden-bench,
	for the dinner-bell clanged as usual
	at three o'clock, which wakened me
	from my reverie.

EXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY

As Roderick passes the courtyard, he sees the Captain's
saddle still hanging up at the stable-door, and his odious
red-coated brute of a servant, swaggering with the
scullion-girls and kitchen people.

			MAID
	The Englishman's still there, Master
	Roderick.  He's there in the parlor.
	Go in, and don't let 'im browbeat
	you, Master Roderick.

INT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

Roderick enters and takes his place at the bottom of the
big table; the butler speedily brings him a cover.

			UNCLE
	Hello, Roddy, my boy!  Up and well?
	That's right.

			AUNT
	He'd better be home with his mother.

			UNCLE
	Don't mind her.  It's the cold goose
	she ate for breakfast -- didn't
	agree with her.  Take a glass of
	spirits, Mrs. Dugan, to Roderick's
	health.

It is evident that his uncle doesn't know of what
happened, but Michael, who is at dinner too, and Harry,
and almost all the girls, look exceedingly black and the
captain foolish; and Miss Dorothy, who is again by his
side, ready to cry.  Captain Grogan sits smiling, and
Roderick looks on as cold as stone.

His uncle is in high good-humor.

			UNCLE
	Dorothy, divide that merry thought
	with the captain!  See who'll be
	married first.  Jack Best, my dear
	boy, never mind a clean glass for
	the claret, we're short of crystal
	at Castle Dugan; take Dorothy's and
	the wine will taste none the worse.
	Mrs. Dugan and ladies, if you
	please; this is a sort of toast that
	is drunk a great deal too seldom in
	my family, and you'll please to
	receive it with all the honors.
	Here's to Captain and Mrs. John
	Best, and long life to them.  Kiss
	her, Jack, you rogue; for faith,
	you've got a treasure.

			RODERICK
		   (spring up)
	His already?!

			HARRY
	Hold your tongue, you fool -- hold
	your tongue!

			RODERICK
		   (shouting)
	He has already been slapped in the
	face this morning, Captain John
	Best; he's already been called a
	coward, Captain John Best; and this
	is the way I'll drink his health.
	Here's your health, Captain John
	Best.

Roderick flings a glass of claret into his face.  The next
moment, he is under the table, tripped up by Harry, who
hits him a violent cuff on the head; as he goes down, he
hardly has time to hear the general screaming and
scurrying that is taking place above him, being so fully
occupied with kicks, and thumps and curses, with which
Harry is belaboring him.

			HARRY
	You fool!  You great blundering
	marplot -- you silly beggarly
	brat --
		   (a thump at each)
	Hold your tongue!

When Roderick gets up from under the table, the ladies are
all gone; but he has the satisfaction of seeing the
captain's nose is bleeding, as his is -- Best is cut
across the bridge, and his beauty spoiled forever.

			UNCLE
	In Heaven's name, what does all the
	row mean?  Is the boy in fever
	again?

			HARRY
		   (turning to his
		    father)
	The fact is, sir, that the young
	monkey has fallen in love with
	Dorothy, and finding her and the
	captain mighty sweet in the garden
	today, he was for murdering Jack
	Best.

			CAPTAIN BEST
		   (bristling up)
	And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan,
	I've been insulted grossly in this
	house.  I ain't at all satisfied
	with these here ways of going on.
	I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man
	of property; and I -- I --

			HARRY
	If you're insulted, and not
	satisfied, remember there's two of
	us, Best.

On which, the captain falls to washing his nose in water,
and answering never a word.

			RODERICK
		   (in dignified tone)
	Mr. Best may also have satisfaction
	any time he pleases, by calling on
	Roderick James, Esquire, of
	Jamesville.

His uncle bursts out laughing, and in this laugh, Captain
Grogan joins.

			RODERICK
	Captain Grogan, I beg you to
	understand that, for my cousin
	Harry, who has been my best friend
	through life, I could put up with
	rough treatment from him; yet, even
	that sort of treatment I will bear
	from him no longer; and any other
	person who ventures on the like will
	not like the cost.  Mr. Best knows
	that fact very well; and, if he's
	man, he'll know where to find me.

			UNCLE
	It is getting late, and your mother
	will be anxious about you.  One of
	you had better go home with him.
		   (turning to his sons)
	Or the lad may be playing more
	pranks.

			HARRY
	Both of us ride home with Best here.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My
	man is armed, and so am I.

			HARRY
	You know the use of arms very well,
	Best, and no one can doubt your
	courage; but Michael and I will see
	you home for all that.

			UNCLE
	Why, you'll not be home till
	morning, boys.  Kilwangan's a good
	ten miles from here.

			HARRY
	We'll sleep in Best's quarters.
	We're going to stop a week there.
	And, in another week, my boy.

And here, Harry whispers something in the Captain's ear.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	I'll go home with the boy.

EXT.  ROAD - LATE DAY

Grogan walks with Roderick.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	A pretty day's work of it you have
	made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your
	uncle to be distressed for money,
	and try and break off a match which
	will bring fifteen hundred a-year
	into the family?  Best has promised
	to pay off the four thousand pounds
	which is bothering your uncle so.
	He takes a girl without a penny -- a
	girl that has been flinging herself
	at the head of every man in these
	parts these ten years past, and
	missing them all, and a boy who
	ought to be attached to your uncle
	as to your father.

			RODERICK
	And so I am.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	And this is the return you make for
	his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you
	in his house when your father died,
	and hasn't he given you and your
	mother, rent-free, your fine house
	of Jamesville yonder?

			RODERICK
	Mark this, come what will of it, I
	swear I will fight the man who
	pretends to the hand of Dorothy
	Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into
	the church, and meet him there.
	I'll have his blood, or he shall
	have mine.  Will you take my message
	to him, and arrange the meeting?

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Well, if it must be, it must.  For a
	young fellow, you are the most
	bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No
	officer, bearing His Majesty's
	commission, can receive a glass of
	wine on his nose, without resenting
	it -- fight you must, and Best is a
	huge, strong fellow.

			RODERICK
	He'll give the better mark.  I am
	not afraid of him.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	In faith, I believe you are not; for
	a lad I never saw more game in my
	life.  Give me a kiss, my dear boy.
	You're after my own soul.  As long
	as Jack Grogan lives, you shall
	never want a friend or a second.

They embrace.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Poor fellow!  He was shot six months
	afterwards, at Minden, and I lost
	thereby a kind friend.  But we don't
	know what is in store for us, and
	that's a blessing.

EXT.  HOUSE - LATE DAY

Mother greeting Roderick and Captain Grogan.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	In spite of my precautions to
	secrecy, I half-suspected that my
	mother knew all from the manner in
	which she embraced me on my arrival,
	and received our guest, Captain
	Grogan.

His mother looks a little anxious and flushed and, every
now and then, gazes very hard into the Captain's face.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But she would not say a word about
	the quarrel, for she had a noble
	spirit, and would as lief have seen
	any one of her kindred hanged as
	shirking from the field of honor.

INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - RODERICK'S BEDROOM - DAY

Roderick waking up.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I never slept sounder in my life,
	though I woke a little earlier than
	usual, and you may be sure my first
	thought was of the event of the day,
	for which I was fully prepared.

Roderick at table with paper and ink.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And now I sat down and wrote a
	couple of letters; they might be the
	last, thought I, that I should ever
	write in my life.

See him write:  "Dearest Mother."

INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Then I went down to breakfast, where
	my mother was waiting for me, you
	may be sure.  We did not say a
	single word about what was taking
	place.

Roderick eats his breakfast with a good appetite; but in
helping himself to salt, spills it, on which his mother
starts up with a scream.

			MOTHER
	Thank God, it's fallen towards me!

And then, her heart being too full, she leaves the room.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Ah!  They have their faults, those
	mothers; but are there any other
	women like them?

There is an elegant, silver-mounted sword that hangs on
the mantelpiece under the picture of Roderick's late
father.

A pair of pistols hang on each side of the picture.

Roderick takes down the sword and pistols, which are
bright and well-oiled, and collects flints, balls and
gunpowder.

EXT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY

Captain Grogan and Orderly arrive.

			RODERICK
	Have you taken my message to him?

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	The meeting is arranged.  Captain
	Best is waiting for you now.

			RODERICK
	My mare is saddled and ready; who's
	the captain's second?

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Your cousins go out with him.

Roderick and Grogan, and the Orderly ride off.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I didn't take leave of Mrs. James.
	The curtains of her bedroom-windows
	were down, and they didn't move as
	we mounted and trotted off.

EXT.  COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

They ride their horses at a leisurely pace.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	That's a very handsome sword you
	have there.

			RODERICK
	It was with this sword that my late
	father, Harry James, God rest his
	soul, met Sir Huddelstone
	Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet,
	and was fatally run through the
	neck.  He was quite in the wrong,
	having insulted Lady Fuddelstone,
	when in liquor, at the Brentford
	Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he
	scorned to apologize.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	And now you risk the same fate.  If
	you are killed, your mother is all
	alone in the world.

			RODERICK
	I am Harry James' son, and will act
	as becomes my name and quality.

EXT.  FOREST CLEARING - DAY

Harry, Michael and the Captain are already there.  Best,
flaming in red regimentals, a big a monster as ever led a
grenadier company.  The party are laughing together.

			RODERICK
		   (to Captain Grogan)
	I hope to spoil this sport, and
	trust to see this sword of mine in
	that big bully's body.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You
	are no match for Best with the
	sword.

			RODERICK
	I'll match any man with the sword.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	But swords are today impossible;
	Captain Best is -- is lame.  He
	knocked his knee against the
	swinging park gate last night, as he
	was riding home, and can scarce move
	it now.

			RODERICK
	Not against Castle Dugan gate, that
	has been off the hinges these ten
	years.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	It must have been some other gate.

They alight from their horses, and join and salute the
other gentlemen.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	I have just explained to Mister
	James that Captain Best is lame, and
	that swords are impossible.

			HARRY
	Oh, yes!  Dead lame.

Harry comes up to shake Roderick by the hand, while
Captain Best takes off his hat, and turns extremely red.

			HARRY
	And very lucky for you, Roderick, my
	boy.  You were a dead man else, for
	he is a devil of a fellow -- isn't
	he, Grogan?

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	A regular Turk.  I never yet knew
	the man who stood to Captain Best.

			HARRY
	Hang the business.  I hate it.  I'm
	ashamed of it.  Say you're sorry,
	Roderick.  You can easily say that.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	If the young feller will go to
	Dublin, as proposed...

			RODERICK
	I'm not sorry -- I'll not apologize
	-- and I'll as soon go to Dublin as
	to hell!

Grogan takes him aside.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is
	silly business.  The girl will marry
	Best, mark my words; and as sure as
	she does, you'll forget her.  You
	are but a boy.  Best is willing to
	consider you as such.  Dublin's a
	fine place, and if you have a mind
	to take a ride thither and see the
	town for a month, here are twenty
	guineas at your service.  Make Best
	an apology, and be off.

			RODERICK
	A man of honor dies, but never
	apologizes.  I'll see the captain
	hanged before I apologize.

			HARRY
		   (with a laugh to
		    Grogan)
	There's nothing else for it.  Take
	your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces,
	I suppose?

			CAPTAIN BEST
		   (in a big voice)
	Ten, sir, and make them short ones,
	do you hear, Captain Grogan?

			HARRY
	Don't bully, Mr. Best.  Here are the
	pistols.
		   (with some emotion
		    to Roderick)
	God bless you, my boy; and when I
	count three, fire.

			RODERICK
	This is not one of my pistols.

			HARRY
	They are all right, never fear.
	It's one of mine.  Yours will serve,
	if they are needed, for the next
	round.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Roderick, fire at his neck -- hit
	him there under the gorget; see how
	the fool shows himself open.

Michael, who has not spoken a word, Harry, and the Captain
retire to one side, and Harry gives the signal.

It is slowly given, and Roderick has the leisure to cover
his man well.

Captain Best changes color and trembles as the numbers are
given.

At "three" both pistols go off.  Best gives a most
horrible groan, staggers backwards and falls.

			THE SECONDS
		   (crying out)
	He's down!  He's down!

Running towards him, Harry lifts him up -- Michael takes
his head.

			MICHAEL
	He's hit here, in the neck.

Laying open his coat, blood is seen gurgling from under
his gorget.

			HARRY
	How is it with you?

The unfortunate man does not answer, but when the support
of Harry's arm is withdrawn from his back, groans once
more and falls backwards.

			MICHAEL
		   (with a scowl)
	The young fellow has begun well.
	You had better ride off, young sir,
	before the police are up.  They had
	wind of the business before we left
	Kilwangan.

			RODERICK
	Is he quite dead?

			MICHAEL
	Quite dead.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Then the world's rid of a coward.
	It's all over with him, Roddy -- he
	doesn't stir.

He gives the huge prostrate body a scornful kick with his
foot.

			HARRY
	We are not cowards, Grogan, whatever
	he was!  Let's get the boy off as
	quick as we may.  Your man shall go
	for a cart, and take away the body
	of this unhappy gentleman.  This has
	been a sad day's work for our
	family, Roderick James, and you have
	robbed us of fifteen-hundred a-year.

			RODERICK
	It was Dorothy did it.

Roderick takes the ribbons she gave him out of his
waistcoat, and the letter, and flings them down on the
body of Captain Best.

			RODERICK
	There!  Take her those ribbons.
	She'll know what they mean; that's
	all that's left of her of two lovers
	she had and ruined.

			MICHAEL
	And now, in Heaven's name, get the
	youngster out of the way.

			HARRY
	I'll go with you.

They mount up and gallop off.

EXT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY

Upon seeing Roderick and Harry ride up, his mother, who
has been waiting outside, rushes to her son with wild
screams of joy.  He dismounts, and she kisses and embraces
him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I need not tell you how great was my
	mother's pride and exultation when
	she heard from Harry's lips the
	account of my behavior at the duel.

INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - PARLOR - DAY

Still much excitement and hustle and bustle.

			HARRY
	The boy must go into hiding, for a
	short time anyway.  Dublin is the
	best place for him to go, and there
	wait until matters are blown over.

			MOTHER
	Dublin?  But the poor lad has never
	been away from home.  He will be as
	safe here as in Dublin.

			HARRY
	I wish that were true, Auntie dear,
	but I'm afraid the bailiffs may
	already be on their way from
	Kilwangan.

INT.  RODERICK'S BEDROOM - DAY

His mother is rushing about and packing a valise.  Harry
sits on the bed.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Harry persisted in the necessity of
	instant departure, in which
	argument, as I was anxious to see
	the world, I must confess, I sided
	with him; and my mother was brought
	to see that, in our small house, in
	the midst of a village, escape would
	be impossible, and capture would be
	impossible to avoid.

INT.  MOTHER'S BEDROOM - DAY

His mother takes out a stocking from her escritoire, and
gives Roderick twenty golden guineas.

			MOTHER
		   (gravely)
	Roderick, my darling, my wild boy, I
	have forebodings that our separation
	is to be a long one.  I spent most
	of all night consulting the cards
	regarding your fate in the duel, and
	all signs betoke a separation.  Here
	is twenty guineas -- all that I have
	in the world -- and I want you to
	keep your father's sword and
	pistols, which you have known to use
	so like a man.

EXT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY

Roderick's departure.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She hurried my departure now, though
	her heart, I know, was full, and
	almost in half-an-hour from my
	arrival at home, I was once more on
	the road again, with the wide world,
	as it were, before me.

Roderick waves.  His mother cries.

EXT.  HIGH ROAD TO DUBLIN - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	No lad of seventeen is very sad who
	has liberty for the first time, and
	twenty guineas in his pocket; and I
	rode away, thinking, I confess, not
	so much of the kind of mother left
	alone, and of the home behind me, as
	of tomorrow, and all the wonders it
	would bring.

Roderick happily riding down the road.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had no doubts of the future;
	thinking that a man of my person,
	parts, and courage, could make his
	way anywhere.  So I rode on, singing
	to myself, or chatting with the
	passersby; and all the girls along
	the road said, "God save me, for a
	clever gentleman."

Farm girls in the fields flirting with him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	As for thoughts of Dorothy Dugan,
	there seemed to be a gap of a half-
	a-score of years.

EXT.  ROAD TO DUBLIN - DAY

A well-armed gentleman dressed in green, and a gold cord,
with a patch on his eye, and riding a powerful mare, puts
his horse alongside.

			ARMED GENTLEMAN
	Good day to you, young sir.

			RODERICK
	Good morning.

			ARMED GENTLEMAN
	Where are you bound for?

			RODERICK
		   (after a long look at
		    his companion)
	That is none of your business.

			ARMED GENTLEMAN
	Is your mother not afraid on account
	of the highwayman to let one so
	young as you travel?

			RODERICK
		   (pulling out a
		    pistol)
	Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of
	good pistols that have already done
	execution, and are ready to do it
	again.

At this, a pock-marked man coming up, the well-armed
gentleman spurs into his bay mare, and leaves Roderick.

EXT.  ROAD TO DUBLIN - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	A little later on, as I rode towards
	Kilcullen, I saw a crowd of peasant
	people assembled round a one-horse
	chair, and my friend in green, as I
	thought, making off half-a-mile up
	the hill.

A footman howls, at the top of his voice.

			FOOTMAN
	Stop thief!

But the country fellows only laugh at his distress, and
make all sorts of jokes at the adventure which had just
befallen.

			COUNTRY FELLOW #1
	Sure, you might have kept him off
	with your blunderbush!

			COUNTRY FELLOW #2
	O the coward!  To let the Captain
	bate you, and he only one eye!

			COUNTRY FELLOW #3
	The next time my lady travels, she'd
	better leave you at home!

			RODERICK
	What is this noise, fellows?

Roderick rides up amongst them, and seeing the lady in the
carriage, very pale and frightened, gives a slash of his
whip, and bids the red-shanked ruffians keep off.

Pulling off his hat, and bringing his mare up in a prance
to the chair-window.

			RODERICK
	What has happened, madam, to annoy
	your ladyship?

			MRS. O'REILLY
	Oh, I am grateful to you, sir.  I am
	the wife of Captain O'Reilly
	hastening to join him at Dublin.  My
	chair was stopped by a highwayman;
	this great oaf of a servant-man fell
	down on his knees, armed as he was,
	and though there were thirty people
	in the next field, working, when the
	ruffian attacked, not one of them
	would help but, on the contrary,
	wished him "good luck."

			COUNTRY FELLOW #1
	Sure, he's the friend of the poor,
	and good luck to him.

			COUNTRY FELLOW #2
	Was it any business of ours?

			RODERICK
		   (shouting)
	Be off to your work, you pack of
	rascals, or you will have a good
	taste of my thong.
		   (to Mrs. O'Reilly)
	Have you lost much?

			MRS. O'REILLY
	Everything -- my purse, containing
	upwards of a hundred guineas, my
	jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches.
	And all because this blundering
	coward fell to his knees...

			FOOTMAN
	Be fair, ma'am, them wasn't so much.
	Didn't he return you the thirteen
	pence in copper, and the watch,
	saying it was only pinchbeck?

			MRS. O'REILLY
	Don't be insolent, or I'll report
	you to the Captain.

			FOOTMAN
	Sorry, ma'am.

He shuffles a few steps away and frowns in the direction
that the Captain has vanished.

			MRS. O'REILLY
	That fool didn't know what was the
	meaning of a hundred-pound bill,
	which was in the pocket-book that
	the fellow took from me.

			RODERICK
	I am riding to Dublin myself, and if
	your ladyship will allow me the
	honor of riding with you, I shall do
	my best to protect you from further
	mishap.

			MRS. O'REILLY
	But I shouldn't like to put you to
	such trouble, Mister...?

			RODERICK
	O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.

EXT.  ROADSIDE INN - DAY

They stop at the inn.

			RODERICK
		   (very gallantly)
	As you have been robbed of your
	purse, may I have permission to lend
	your ladyship a couple of pieces to
	pay any expenses which you might
	incur before reaching your home?

			MRS. O'REILLY
		   (smiling)
	That's very kind of you, Mr.
	O'Higgins.

He gives her two gold pieces.

INT.  INN - DAY

Roderick and Mrs. O'Reilly finishing their meal.

We will hear dialogue underneath Roderick's voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	How different was her lively rattle
	to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan
	assemblies.  In every sentence, she
	mentioned a lord or a person of
	quality.  To the lady's question
	about my birth and parentage, I
	replied that I was a young gentleman
	of large fortune, that I was going
	to Dublin for my studies, and that
	my mother allowed me five hundred
	per annum.

			MRS. O'REILLY
	You must be very cautious with
	regard to the company you should
	meet in Dublin, where rogues and
	adventurers of all countries abound.
	I hope you will do me the honor of
	accepting lodgings in my own house,
	where Captain O'Reilly will welcome
	with delight, my gallant young
	preserver.

Paying the bill.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Perhaps had I been a little older in
	the world's experience, I should
	have begun to see that Madame
	O'Reilly was not the person of
	fashion she pretended to be; but, as
	it was, I took all her stories for
	truth, and, when the landlord
	brought the bill for dinner, paid it
	with the air of a lord.  Indeed, she
	made no motion to produce the two
	pieces I had lent her.

EXT.  DUBLIN - STREET - NIGHT

They ride by.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And so we rode on slowly towards
	Dublin, into which city we made our
	entrance at nightfall.  The rattle
	and splendor of the coaches, the
	flare of the linkboys, the number
	and magnificence of the houses,
	struck me with the greatest wonder;
	though I was careful to disguise
	this feeling.

EXT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - DUBLIN - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	We stopped at length at a house of
	rather mean appearance, and were let
	into a passage which had a great
	smell of supper and punch.

INT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Captain O'Reilly, a stout red-faced man, without a
periwig, and in a rather tattered nightgown and cap.
Roderick and Mrs. O'Reilly.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how
	grateful I am for your timely
	assistance to my wife.

			RODERICK
	I am only sorry that I was unable to
	prevent the villain from carrying
	off all her ladyship's money and
	pearls.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt,
	and rest assured, sir, you have
	friends in this house whenever you
	are in Dublin.
		   (pours a glass)
	Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know
	your good father?

			RODERICK
	Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I
	have never heard your name mentioned
	in my family.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins
	of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins
	was a close friend of my wife's dear
	father, Colonel Granby Somerset.

			RODERICK
	Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine
	are the O'Higgins of Watertown.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	I have heard of them.

There are relics of some mutton-chops and onions on a
cracked dish before them.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	My love, I wish I had known of your
	coming, for Bob Moriaty and I just
	finished the most delicious venison
	pasty, which His Grace the Lord
	Lieutenant, sent us, with a flash of
	sillery from his own cellar.  You
	know the wine, my dear?  But as
	bygones are bygones, and no help for
	them, what say ye to a fine lobster
	and a bottle of as good claret as
	any in Ireland?  Betty, clear these
	things from the table, and make the
	mistress and our young friend
	welcome to our home.

Captain O'Reilly searches his pockets for some money to
give to Betty.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	I'm sorry, Mr. O'Higgins, but I
	don't seem to have any small change.
	May I borrow a ten-penny piece to
	give to the girl?

			MRS. O'REILLY
	I have some money, my dear.  Here,
	Betty, go to the fishmonger and
	bring back our supper, and mind you
	get the right change.

She takes out one of the golden guineas Roderick gave to
her.

INT.  DINNING ROOM - LATER

They are eating.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Our supper was seasoned, if not by
	any great elegance, at least by a
	plentiful store of anecdotes,
	concerning the highest personages of
	the city, with whom, according to
	himself, the captain lived on terms
	of the utmost intimacy.  Not to be
	behind hand with him, I spoke of my
	own estates and property as if I was
	as rich as a duke.

INT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

The couple wishing Roderick goodnight.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Had I been an English lad, the
	appearance of the chamber I occupied
	might, indeed, have aroused
	instantly my suspicion and distrust.
	But we are not particular in Ireland
	on the score of neatness, hence the
	disorder of my bed-chamber did not
	strike me so much.

Broken door.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Was there a lock to the door, or a
	hasp to fasten it to?

Dress lying over bed.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Though my counterpane was evidently
	a greased brocade dress of Mrs.
	O'Reilly.

Cracked mirror.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And my cracked toilet-glass not much
	bigger than a half-crown, yet I was
	used to these sort of ways in Irish
	houses, and still thought myself to
	be in that of a man of fashion.

Drawers, full of junk.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	There was no lock to the drawers,
	which, when they did open, were full
	of my hostess' rouge-pots, shoes,
	stays, and rags.

INT.  BEDROOM - O'REILLY HOUSE - NIGHT

In the middle of the night, Mrs. O'Reilly comes to
Roderick's room on a flimsy pretext, and in the course of
events, he has his first woman.

INT.  COACH - DAY

Roderick, Captain and Mrs. O'Reilly.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	I needn't ask whether you had a
	comfortable bed.  Young Fred
	Pimpleton slept in it for seven
	months, during which he did me the
	honor to stay with me, and if he was
	satisfied, I don't know who else
	wouldn't be.

EXT.  PROMENADE - PHOENIX PARK - DAY

Roderick, Captain and Mrs. O'Reilly, their friends.
Various cuts.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	After breakfast, we drove out to
	Phoenix Park, where numbers of the
	young gentry were known to Mrs.
	O'Reilly, to all of whom she
	presented me in such a complimentary
	way that, before half an hour, I had
	got to be considered as a gentleman
	of great expectations and large
	property.

INT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had little notion then that I had
	got amongst a set of impostors --
	that Captain O'Reilly was only an
	adventurer, and his lady a person of
	no credit.  The fact was, a young
	man could hardly have fallen into
	worse hands than those in which I
	now found myself.

An evening of gambling.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Their friends were always welcome on
	payment of a certain moderate sum
	for their dinner after which, you
	may be sure, that cards were not
	wanting, and that the company who
	played did not play for love merely.

Various cuts of the characters present.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	What could happen to a man but
	misfortune from associating with
	such company?  And in a very, very
	short time I became their prey.

Roderick loses two hundred guineas to Captain O'Reilly in
a single hand.

We see Captain O'Reilly cheat, but Roderick does not.

He pays him the 18 gold guineas, remaining from the sum
his mother gave him.

			RODERICK
	I shall have to write out a note for
	the rest of it, Captain O'Reilly.

EXT.  STREET - OUTSIDE O'REILLY HOUSE - DAWN

Roderick exits to the street.  The sound of the gambling
can still be heard in the street.  He is soon joined by
Councillor Mulligan.

			COUNCILLOR MULLIGAN
	Master Roderick, you appear a young
	fellow of birth and fortune; let me
	whisper in your ear that you have
	fallen into very bad hands -- it's a
	regular gang of swindlers; and a
	gentleman of your rank and quality
	should never be seen in such
	company.  The captain has been a
	gentleman's gentleman, and his lady
	of no higher rank.  Go home, pack
	your valise, pay the little trifle
	you owe me, mount your mare, and
	ride back again to your parents --
	it's the very best thing you can do.

Roderick does not reply, and walks slowly away from him
down the street.

INT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - RODERICK'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

Roderick enters.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Into a pretty nest of villains,
	indeed, was I plunged!  When I
	returned to my bed-chamber, a few
	hours later, it seemed as if all my
	misfortunes were to break on me at
	once.

Valise open, wardrobe lying on the ground, and Roderick's
keys in the possession of O'Reilly and his wife.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	Whom have I been harboring in my
	house?  Who are you, sirrah?

			RODERICK
	Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a
	gentleman as any in Ireland!

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	You're an impostor, young man, a
	schemer, a deceiver!

			RODERICK
	Repeat the words again, and I run
	you through the body.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	Tut, tut!  I can play at fencing as
	well as you, Mr. Roderick James.
	Ah!  You change color, do you?  Your
	secret is known, is it?  You come
	like a viper into the bosom of
	innocent families; you represent
	yourself as the heir to my friends
	the O'Higgins of Castle O'Higgins; I
	introduce you to the nobility and
	gentry of this methropolis; I take
	you to my tradesmen, who give you
	credit.  I accept your note for near
	two hundred pounds, and what do I
	find?  A fraud.

He holds up the name, Roderick James, printed on the
linen.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	Not Master O'Higgins of Watertown,
	but Roderick James of the devil only
	knows where...

Captain O'Reilly gathers up the linen clothes, silver
toilet articles, and the rest of Roderick's gear.

			RODERICK
	Hark ye, Mr. O'Reilly, I will tell
	you why I was obliged to alter my
	name, which is James and the best
	name in Ireland.  I changed it, sir,
	because, on the day before I came to
	Dublin, I killed a man in deadly
	combat -- an Englishman, sir, and a
	Captain in His Majesty's service;
	and if you offer to let or hinder me
	in the slightest way, the same arm
	which destroyed him is ready to
	punish you.

So saying, Roderick draws his sword like lightning, and
giving a "ha, ha!" and a stamp with his foot, lunges it
within an inch of O'Reilly's heart, who starts back and
turns deadly pale, while his wife, with a scream, flings
herself between them.

			MRS. O'REILLY
	Dearest Roderick -- be pacified.
	O'Reilly, you don't want the poor
	child's blood.  Let him escape -- in
	Heaven's name, let him go.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
		   (sulkily)
	He may go hang for me, and he's
	better be off quickly, for I shall
	go to the magistrate if I see him
	again.

O'Reilly exits.  His wife sits down on the bed and begins
to cry.

EXT.  DUBLIN STREET - DAY

Roderick riding down the street, with his valise.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Where was now a home for the
	descendant of the James?  I was
	expelled from Dublin by a
	persecution occasioned, I must
	confess, by my own imprudence.  I
	had no time to wait and choose.  No
	place of refuge to fly to.

INT.  ALE HOUSE - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	There was a score of recruiting
	parties in the town beating up for
	men to join our gallant armies in
	America and Germany.

Roderick approaches a Captain and a Sergeant, who quickly
make him welcome.

			RODERICK
	I will tell you frankly, sir.  I am
	a young gentleman in difficulties; I
	have killed an officer in a duel,
	and I am anxious to get out of the
	country.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But I needn't have troubled myself
	with any explanations; King George
	was in too much want of men to heed
	from whence they came -- and a
	fellow of my inches was always
	welcome.  Indeed, I could not have
	chosen my time better.  A transport
	was lying at Dunleary, waiting for a
	wind.

EXT.  BRITISH WARSHIP AT SEA - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I never had a taste for any thing
	but genteel company, and hate all
	descriptions of low life.  Hence my
	account of the society in which I at
	present found myself must of
	necessity be short.  The
	reminiscences of the horrid black-
	hole of a place in which we soldiers
	were confined, of the wretched
	creatures with whom I was now forced
	to keep company, of the plowmen,
	poachers, pickpockets, who had taken
	refuge from poverty, or the law, as,
	in truth, I had done myself, is
	enough to make me ashamed even now.

Roderick sits very disconsolately over a platter of rancid
bacon and moldy biscuit, which is served to him at mess.
When it comes to his turn to be helped to drink, he is
served, like the rest, with dirty tin noggin, containing
somewhat more than half a pint of rum and water.  The
beaker is so greasy and filthy that he cannot help turning
round to the messman and saying:

			RODERICK
	Fellow, get me a glass!

At which, all the wretches round him burst into a roar of
laughter, the very loudest among them being Mr. Toole, a
red-haired monster of a man.

			MR. TOOLE
	Get the gentleman a towel for his
	hands, and serve him a basin of
	turtle-soup.

Roars the monster, who is sitting, or rather squatting, on
the deck opposite him, and as he speaks, he suddenly
seizes Roderick's beaker of grog and empties it in midst
of another burst of applause.

			LINK-BOY
		   (whispers)
	If you want to vex him, ask him
	about his wife, the washerwoman, who
	bates him.

			RODERICK
	Is it a towel of your wife's
	washing, Mr. Toole?  I'm told she
	wiped your face often with one.

			LINK-BOY
		   (whispers)
	Ask him why he wouldn't see her
	yesterday, when she came to the
	ship.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And so I put to him some other
	foolish jokes about soapsuds, hen-
	pecking, and flat-irons, which set
	the man into a fury, and succeeded
	in raising a quarrel between us.

Roderick and Toole fight with cudgels.  Roderick gives him
a thump across his head which lays him lifeless on the
floor.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	This victory over the cock of the
	vile dunghill obtained me respect
	among the wretches among whom I
	formed part.

EXT.  MILITARY DRILL FIELD - CUXHAVEN - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Our passage was very favorable, and
	in two days we landed at Cuxhaven,
	and before I had been a month in the
	Electorate, I was transported into a
	tall and proper young soldier, and,
	having a natural aptitude for
	military exercise, was soon as
	accomplished at the drill as the
	oldest sergeant in the regiment.

Various cuts.

Roderick learning the soldierly arts, musket drill, manual
of arms, bayonet, marching.

EXT.  MILITARY COURTYARD - CUXHAVEN - DAY

The Cuxhaven troops are drawn up to receive a new
regiment, arrived from England.

Roderick sees, marching at the head of his company, his
old friend, Captain Grogan, who gives him a wink.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Six weeks after we arrived in
	Cuxhaven, we were reinforced by
	Gales regiment of foot from England,
	and I promise you the sight of
	Grogan's face was most welcome to
	me, for it assured me that a friend
	was near me.

INT.  GROGAN'S QUARTERS - DAY

Roderick and Grogan.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Grogan gave me a wink of
	recognition, but offered no public
	token of acquaintance and it was not
	until two days afterwards that he
	called me into his quarters, and
	then, shaking hands with me
	cordially, gave me news which I
	wanted, of my family.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith,
	you've begun early, like your
	father's son, but I think you could
	not do better than as you have done.
	But why did you not write home to
	your poor mother?  She has sent
	half-a-dozen letters to you in
	Dublin.

			RODERICK
	I suppose she addressed them to me
	in my real name, by which I never
	thought to ask for them at the post
	office.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	We must write to her today, and you
	can tell her that you are safe and
	married to "Brown Bess."

Roderick sighs when Grogan says the word "married," on
which Grogan says with a laugh:

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	I see you are thinking of a certain
	young lady at Duganstown.

			RODERICK
	Is Miss Dugan well?

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	There's only six Miss Dugans now...
	poor Dorothy.

			RODERICK
	Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she
	died of grief?

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	She took on so at your going away
	that she was obliged to console
	herself with a husband.  She is now
	Mrs. John Best.

			RODERICK
	Mrs. John Best!  Was there another
	Mr. John Best?!

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	No, the very same one, my boy.  He
	recovered from his wound.  The ball
	you hit him with was not likely to
	hurt him.  It was only made of tow.
	Do you think the Dugans would let
	you kill fifteen hundred a-year out
	of the family?  The plan of the duel
	was all arranged in order to get you
	out of the way, for the cowardly
	Englishman could never be brought to
	marry from fear of you.  But hit him
	you certainly did, Roderick, and
	with a fine thick plugget of tow,
	and the fellow was so frightened
	that he was an hour in coming to.
	We told your mother the story
	afterwards, and a pretty scene she
	made.

			RODERICK
	The coward!

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	He has paid off your uncle's
	mortgage.  He gave Dorothy a coach-
	and-six.  That coward of a fellow
	has been making of your uncle's
	family.  Faith, the business was
	well done.  Your cousins, Michael
	and Harry, never let him out of
	their sight, though he was for
	deserting to England, until the
	marriage was completed, and the
	happy couple off on their road to
	Dublin.  Are you in want of cash, my
	boy?  You may draw upon me, for I got
	a couple of hundred out of Master
	Best for my share and, while they
	last, you shall never want.

EXT.  VARIOUS LOCATIONS - BRITISH ON THE MARCH - DAY

Roderick on the march.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Our regiment, which was quartered
	about Stade and Luneberg, speedily
	had got orders to march southwards
	towards the Rhine, where we would
	fight the famous battle of Minden.
	It would require a greater
	philosopher and historian than I am
	to explain the causes of the famous
	Seven Years' War in which Europe was
	engaged, and, indeed, its origin has
	always appeared to me to be so
	complicated, and the books written
	about it so amazingly hard to
	understand, that I have seldom been
	much wiser at the end of a chapter
	than at the beginning, and so shall
	not trouble you with any personal
	disquisitions concerning the matter.

Various cuts featuring Roderick; marching, cooking at open
fires, gambling, resting in a farm yard, officers riding
by; shivering in his blanket.

EXT.  BATTLEFIELD OF MINDEN - BATTLE FRAGMENT - DAY

Roderick and his company.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Were these memoirs not characterized
	by truth, I might easily make myself
	the hero of some strange and popular
	adventures.

EXT.  MINDEN - BATTLE FRAGMENTS - DAY

Officers ride by in smoke.  Troops marching to the attack.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But I saw no one of the higher ranks
	that day than my colonel and a
	couple of orderly officers riding by
	in the smoke -- no one on our side,
	that is.  A poor corporal is not
	generally invited into the company
	of commanders and the great.

Roderick advancing.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But, in revenge, I saw, I promise
	you, some very good company on the
	French part, for their regiments of
	Lorraine and Royal Cravate were
	charging us all day; and in the sort
	of melee high and low are pretty
	equally received.  I hate bragging,
	but I cannot help saying that I made
	a very close acquaintance with the
	colonel of the Cravates.

Roderick firing his musket.  He bayonets a French colonel,
amidst shouts and curses.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And finished off a poor little
	ensign, so young, slender, and
	small, that a blow from my pigtail
	would have dispatched him.

Roderick kills a French ensign with a blows from the butt
of his musket.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And in the poor ensign's pocket
	found a purse of fourteen louis
	d'or, and a silver box of sugar-
	plums, of which the former present
	was very agreeable to me.

Roderick taking money and the box of sugar-plums from the
ensign.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	If people would tell their stories
	of battles in this simple way, I
	think the cause of truth would not
	suffer by it.  All I know of this
	famous fight of Minden, except from
	books, is told here above.

Captain Grogan is shot, cries out, and falls.

A brother captain turns to Lieutenant Lakenham.

			CAPTAIN
	Grogan's down; Lakenham, there's
	your company.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	That was all the epitaph my brave
	patron got.

Roderick kneels above Grogan.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	I should have left you a hundred
	guineas, Roderick, but for a cursed
	run of ill-luck last night at faro.

He gives Roderick a faint squeeze of the hand; and, as the
word is given to advance, Roderick leaves him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	When we came back to our ground,
	which we presently did, he was lying
	still, but he was dead.  Some of our
	people had already torn off his
	epaulets, and, no doubt, had rifled
	his purse.

EXT.  VARIOUS ROUGH RURAL LOCATIONS - DAY

Short cuts to voice over.

Roderick and British troops rape, pillage and burn.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	After the death of my protector,
	Captain Grogan, I am forced to
	confess that I fell into the very
	worst of courses and company.  In a
	foreign country, with the enemy
	before us, and the people
	continually under contribution from
	one side or the other, numberless
	irregularities were permitted to the
	troops.  It is well for gentlemen to
	talk of the age of chivalry; but
	remember the starving brutes whom
	they lead -- men nursed in poverty,
	entirely ignorant, made to take
	pride in deeds of blood -- men who
	can have no amusement but in
	drunkenness, debauch, and plunder.
	It is with these shocking
	instruments that your great warriors
	and kings have been doing their
	murderous work in the world.

EXT.  BATTLEFIELD - WARBURG - BATTLE FRAGMENTS - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The year in which George II died,
	our regiment had the honor to be
	present at the Battle of Warburg,
	where Prince Ferdinand once more
	completely defeated the Frenchmen.

Lieutenant Lakenham is shot, falls, and cries for help.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	During the action, my lieutenant,
	Mr. Lakenham, of Lakenham, was
	struck by a musket-ball in the side.
	He had shown no want of courage in
	this or any other occasion where he
	had been called upon to act against
	the French; but this was his first
	wound, and the young gentleman was
	exceedingly frightened by it.

			LAKENHAM
	Here, you, Roderick James.  I will
	pay you five guineas if you will
	carry me into the town which is hard
	by those woods.

Roderick and another man take him up in a cloak, and carry
him towards the nearby town of Warburg.

EXT.  A FARMHOUSE - GERMAN STREET - WARBURG - DAY

In order to get into the house, Roderick and the other man
are obliged to fire into the locks with their pieces,
which summons brings the inhabitants of the house to the
door; a very pretty and black-eyed, young woman, and her
old, half-blinded father.

They are at first unwilling to accommodate the guest, but
Mr. Lakenham, speaking to them in German, and taking a
couple of guineas out of a very full purse, speedily
convinces the people that they have only to deal with a
person of honor.

INT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

They carry Lieutenant Lakenham to bed and receive their
five guineas.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	We put the patient to bed, and he
	paid me the stipulated reward.  A
	young surgeon, who desired nothing
	better than to take himself out of
	the fire of the musketry, came
	presently to dress the wound.

In his German jargon, Roderick pays some deserved
compliments to the black-eyed beauty of Warburg, thinking,
with no small envy, how comfortable it would be to be
billeted there.

EXT.  STREET - WARBURG - OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE - DAY

He starts back to the regiment, with his comrade, when the
man interrupts his reverie by suggesting they divide the
five guineas.

			PRIVATE
	I should get half.

			RODERICK
	Your share is one guinea.

Roderick gives him one guinea.

			PRIVATE
	He gave you five guineas, and I
	bloody well expect half.

			RODERICK
	Go to the devil.

The private lifting his musket, hits Roderick a blow with
the butt-end of it, which sends him stunned to the ground,
allowing his comrade to take the other four guineas from
his pocket.

Recovering his senses, Roderick bleeding, with a large
wound in the head, has barely time to stagger back to the
house where he had just left the lieutenant, when he
falls fainting at the door, just as the surgeon exits.

INT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

Roderick is carried by the surgeon and the black-eyed
girl, into another bed in the room where the Lieutenant
has been laid.

			LAKENHAM
		   (languidly, in pain)
	Who are you putting into that bed?

			LISCHEN
	We have the Corporal, wounded, to
	you bringing.

			LAKENHAM
	A corporal?  Turn him out.  Schicken
	sie Herrn Koporal weg!

INT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT AND DAY

Lischen brings Roderick a refreshing drink; and, as he
takes it, he presses the kind hand that gave it to him;
nor does this token of his gratitude seem unwelcome.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I found Lischen the tenderest of
	nurses.  Whenever any delicacy was
	to be provided for the wounded
	lieutenant, a share was always sent
	to the bed opposite his, and to the
	avaricious man's no small annoyance.

Lischen serving food.

Various cuts, representing different days.

Lakenham behaving as rottenly as Roderick describes:

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Nor was I the only person in the
	house to whom the worthy gentleman
	was uncivil.  He ordered the fair
	Lischen hither and thither, made
	impertinent love to her, abused her
	soups, quarreled with her
	omelettes, and grudged the money
	which was laid out for his
	maintenance, so that our hostess
	detested him as much as, I think,
	without vanity, as she regarded me.

Roderick making lover to Lischen while Lieutenant Lakenham
sulks in the next bed.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	For if truth must be told, I had
	made very deep love to her during my
	stay under her roof, as is always my
	way with women, of whatever age or
	degree of beauty.  Do not think me
	very cruel and heartless, ladies;
	this heart of Lischen's was like
	many a town, which had been stormed
	and occupied several times before I
	came to invest it,

Roderick sitting up in bed.  Lischen has just served him
his supper.

Enter a British officer, an aide who carries a notebook,
and a surgeon.  In a brief scene to be written, we learn
that a sudden movement on the part of the French requires
the British army to follow them.  The town is to be
evacuated, except for some Prussian line-of-communication
troops, whose surgeons are to visit the wounded in the
place; and, when they are well, they are to be drafted to
their regiments.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I began to reflect how pleasant my
	quarters were to me, and that I was
	much better here than crawling under
	an odious tent with a parcel of
	tipsy soldiers, or going the night-
	rounds, or rising long before
	daybreak for drill.  I determined
	that I never would join mine again.

EXT.  VIEW OUT OF WARBURG FARMHOUSE WINDOW - DAY

Roderick stands by the window, watching English troops and
wagons leaving the town.

INT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

Roderick walks into Lakenham's room attired in his full
regimentals, and with his hat cocked over his left eye.

			RODERICK
	I'm promoted Lieutenant.  I've come
	to take my leave of you.  I intend
	to have your papers and purse.

			LAKENHAM
	You great scoundrel!  You mutinous
	dog!  What do you mean by dressing
	yourself in my regimentals?  As sure
	as my name's Lakenham, when we get
	back to the regiment, I'll have your
	soul cut out of your body.

With this, Roderick puts his hand under his pillow, at
which Lakenham gives a scream that might have called the
whole garrison about his ears.

Roderick threatens him with a knife at his throat.

			RODERICK
	Hark ye, sir!  No more noise, or you
	are a dead man!

Roderick, taking his handkerchief, binds it tight round
his mouth, and, pulling forward the sleeves of his shirt,
ties them in a knot together, and so leaves him, removing
the papers and the purse, and wishing him politely a good
day.

EXT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - STREET - DAY

Lischen, waiting outside the house, with a saddled horse,
throws her arms around him, and makes the tenderest adieu.

Roderick mounts his newly-purchased animal, waves his hat
gallantly, and, prances away down the street.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Roderick happily riding along a wooded country road,
rounds a blind bend and sees suddenly before him, about
two hundred yards away, a company of Prussian infantry
resting along the sides of the road, together with a dozen
mounted dragoons.

A quick calculation tells him that is is better to proceed
than to turn back, and he rides into their midst,
approaching a group of officers.

He presents himself as Lieutenant Lakenham and asks for
directions to join his regiment.  He is told that he is
riding in the wrong direction, and is shown a map.

During the explanation, Captain Galgenstein approaches
with an open, smiling countenance, introduces himself, and
says he, too, is bound for the same place, and asks if
Roderick will honor him with his company.

To avoid suspicion, Roderick readily accepts the offer,
and the two men mount up, and ride off together.

EXT.  ROAD - GERMANY - DAY

Roderick and Galgenstein riding together.

Dialogue under voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My companion treated me with great
	civility, and asked me a thousand
	questions about England, which I
	answered as best I might.  But this
	best, I am bound to say, was bad
	enough.  I knew nothing about
	England, and I invented a thousand
	stories which I told him; described
	the king and the ministers to him,
	said the British ambassador in
	Berlin was my uncle, and promised my
	acquaintance a letter of
	recommendation to him.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	What is your uncle's name?

			RODERICK
		   (slowly)
	O'Grady.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
		   (with a laugh)
	Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador
	O'Grady...

EXT.  DESOLATE GERMAN ROAD - DAY

Roderick and Captain Galgenstein.  Their horses' heads
together, jogging on.

They pass a party of recruits under the armed guard of a
red-coated Hanoverian sergeant.

He exchanges signs of recognition with Captain
Galgenstein.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	It hurts my feelings to be obliged
	to commune with such wretches, but
	the stern necessities of war demand
	men continually, and hence these
	recruiters whom you see market in
	human flesh.  They get five-and-
	twenty thaler a man from our
	government for every man they bring
	in.  For fine men -- for men like
	you.
		   (he adds laughing)
	They would go as high as hundred.

EXT.  DESOLATE GERMAN INN - LATE AFTERNOON

Roderick and Captain Galgenstein approach a very lonely-
looking place.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	This is a very good inn.  Shall we
	stop for dinner?

			RODERICK
	This may be a very good inn for
	Germany, but it would not pass in
	old Ireland.  Corbach is only a
	league off, let us push on for
	Corbach.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Do you want to see the loveliest
	woman in Europe?

Roderick smiles.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will
	influence you.

			RODERICK
	The place seems more a farm than an
	inn-yard.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	The people are great farmers, as
	well as inn-keepers.

They enter by a great gate into a court, walled round, and
at on end of which is the building, a dingy ruinous place.

A couple of covered wagons are in the courtyard; their
horses are littered under a shed hard by.

Lounging about the place are some men, and a pair of
sergeants in the Prussian uniform, who both touch their
hats to the captain.

The inn has something foreboding about it, and the men
shut the great yard-gates as soon as they enter.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
		   (explaining the gate)
	Parties of French horsemen are about
	the country, and one cannot take too
	many precautions against such
	villains.

The two sergeant take charge of the horses; the captain
orders one of them to take Roderick's valise to his
bedroom.

Roderick promises the sergeant a glass of schnapps for his
pains.

They enter into supper.

INT.  GERMAN INN - LATE AFTERNOON

A dish of fried eggs and bacon is ordered from a hideous
old wench that comes to serve them, in place of the lovely
creature which had been expected; and the captain,
laughing, says:

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Well, our meal is a frugal one, but
	a soldier has many a time a worse.

Taking off his hat, sword-belt, and gloves, with great
ceremony, Galgenstein sits down to eat.  Roderick puts his
weapons securely on the old chest of drawers where the
captain's is laid.

The hideous old woman brings in a pot of very sour wine,
at which, and at her ugliness, Roderick feels a
considerable ill-humor.

			RODERICK
		   (when she leaves)
	Where's the beauty you promised me?

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
		   (laughing and looking
		    hard at Roderick)
	It was my joke.  I was tired, and
	did not care to go farther.  There's
	not prettier woman here than that.
	If she won't suit your fancy, my
	friend, then you must wait awhile.

This increases Roderick's ill-humor.

			RODERICK
		   (sternly)
	Upon my word, sir, I think you have
	acted very coolly.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	I have acted as I think fit.

			RODERICK
	Sir, I'm a British officer.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	It's a lie!  You're a deserter!
	You're an impostor, sir; Your lies
	and folly have confirmed this to me.
	You pretend to carry dispatches to a
	general who has been dead these ten
	months; you have an uncle who is an
	ambassador and whose name you don't
	know.  Will you join and take the
	bounty, sir, or will you be given
	up?

			RODERICK
	Neither!

Springing at him like a tiger.

But, agile as he is, Galgenstein is equally on his guard.
He takes two pistols out of his pockets, fires one off,
and says, from the other end of the table where he stands
dodging Roderick, as it were.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Advance a step, and I send this
	bullet into your brains!

The door is flung open, and the two sergeants enter, armed
with musket and bayonet to aid their captain.

The game is up.  Roderick flings down a knife with which
he had armed himself, for the old hag, on bringing in the
wine, had removed his sword.

			RODERICK
	I volunteer.

EXT.  A ROAD - DAY

Prussian troops on the march.  Roderick is now one of
them.

Captain Galgenstein rides by.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	At the close of the Seven Years' War,
	the Prussian army, so renowned for
	its disciplined valor, was
	officered and under-officered by
	native Prussians, it is true, but
	was composed for the most part of
	men hired or stolen, like myself,
	from almost every nation in Europe.
	The deserting to and fro was
	prodigious.

EXT.  A FIELD - DAY

Prussian punishment gauntlet.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The life the private soldier led was
	a frightful one to any but the men
	of iron courage and endurance.  The
	punishment was incessant.

EXT.  VARIOUS RURAL LOCATIONS - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I was not near so unhappy, in spite
	of all, as I had been on my first
	enlisting in Ireland.  At least,
	there will be no one of my
	acquaintance who will witness my
	shame, and that is the point which I
	have always cared for most.

Rape, pillage and burn.

Brief thematic repeat of British army version.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I reasoned with myself thus:  "Now
	you are caught, there is no use in
	repining -- make the best of your
	situation, and get all the pleasure
	you can out of it.  There are a
	thousand opportunities of plunder,
	offered to the soldier in war time,
	out of which he can get both
	pleasure and profit; make use of
	these, and be happy."

EXT.  BATTLEFIELD - FRAGMENT

Prussians against Austrians, or French, or Saxons.

Roderick fighting.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I do not intend to make a history of
	battles in the Prussian any more
	than in the English service.  I did
	my duty in them as well as another,
	and there was not a braver,
	cleverer, handsomer, and, I must
	own, wickeder soldier in the
	Prussian army.

EXT.  BATTLEFIELD - ACTION - DAY

			RODERICK
	I had formed myself to the condition
	of the proper fighting beast; on a
	day of action, I was savage and
	happy.

Roderick saves Captain Galgenstein's life.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

Roderick is decorated by Colonel Bulow for his heroism in
saving Captain Galgenstein.

Colonel Bulow gives Roderick two Frederic d'or in front of
the regiment.

			COLONEL BULOW
	You are a gallant soldier, and have
	evidently come of good stock; but
	you are idle, dissolute, and
	unprincipled; you have done a deal
	of harm to the men; and, for all
	your talents and bravery, I am sure
	you will come to no good.

			RODERICK
	I hope Colonel Bulow is mistaken
	regarding my character.  I have
	fallen into bad company, it is true;
	but I have only done as other
	soldiers have done; and, above all,
	I have never had a kind friend and
	protector before, to whom I might
	show that I was worthy of better
	things.  The Colonel may say I am a
	ruined lad, and send me to the
	devil; but be sure of this, I would
	go to the devil to serve the
	regiment.

Captain Galgenstein looks pleased with Roderick's
performance.

BERLIN - 1763

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Soon after the war ended, our
	regiment was garrisoned in the
	capital, the least dull, perhaps, of
	all the towns of Prussia; but that
	does not say much for its gaiety.

INT.  ANTE-ROOM - CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN'S OFFICE - DAY

Roderick enters and approaches the Captain's sergeant.

			RODERICK
	Private Roderick James.  First
	Hanoverian Guards.  Captain
	Galgenstein sent for me.

			PRUSSIAN SERGEANT
	You may wait.

			RODERICK
	Thank you, sir.

Roderick stands stiffly.  We can make out the sound of
loud talking behind the closed door.

Enter a private huffing and puffing.

			PRIVATE
	Sergeant, the wagon has arrived with
	the Captain's furniture, but the
	driver says he is not supposed to
	unload it.  Is it possible for you
	to talk to him?

Exit the sergeant, muttering.  Roderick, now alone in the
office, walks closer to the door so that he can hear what
is being said.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN (O.S.)
	Give him his discharge!  Bon Dieu!
	You are a model of probity!  You'll
	never succeed to my place, my dear
	nephew, if you are no wiser than you
	are just now.  Make the fellow as
	useful to you as you please.  You
	say he has a good manner and a frank
	countenance, that he can lie with
	assurance, and fight, you say, on a
	pinch.  The scoundrel does not want
	for good qualities.  As long as you
	have the regiment in terrorem over
	him, you can do as you like with
	him.  Once let him loose, and the lad
	is likely to give you the slip.
	Keep on promising him; promise to
	make him a general, if you like.
	What the deuce do I care?  There are
	spies enough to be had in this town
	without him.

Roderick hears the sergeant returning and walks back to
the door.

Then the office door opens, Captain Galgenstein looks out,
sees Roderick, smiles and say:

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Good morning, Private James.  Please
	come in.  I should like you to meet
	my uncle, Herr Minister of Police
	Galgenstein.

			RODERICK
	How do you do, sir?

The Minister nods.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The captain was the nephew and heir
	of the Minister of Police, Herr
	Galgenstein, a relationship which,
	no doubt, aided in the younger
	gentlemen's promotion.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Your loyalty to me and your service
	to the regiment has pleased me very
	well -- and now there is another
	occasion on which you may make
	yourself useful to us; if you
	succeed, depend on it, your reward
	will be your discharge from the
	army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.

			RODERICK
	What is the service, sir?

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	There is lately come to Berlin a
	gentleman in the service of the
	Empress Queen, who calls himself the
	Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears
	the red riband and star of the
	pope's order of the Spur.  He is
	made for good society, polished,
	obliging, a libertine, without
	prejudices, fond of women, of good
	food, of high play, prudent and
	discreet.

The Captain smiles at Roderick.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	He speaks Italian and French
	indifferently; but we have some
	reason to fancy this Monsieur de
	Belle Fast is a native of your
	country of Ireland, and that he has
	come here as a spy.

The Captain rises and begins to pace back and forth.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Naturally, your knowledge of English
	makes you an ideal choice to go into
	his service.  Of course, you will
	not know a word of English; and if
	the Chevalier asks as to the
	particularity of your accent, say
	you are Hungarian.  The servant who
	came with him will be turned away
	today, and the person to whom he has
	applied for a faithful fellow will
	recommend you.

Roderick nods.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	You are a Hungarian; you served in
	the army, and left on account of
	weakness in the loins.  He gambles a
	great deal, and wins.  Do you know
	the cards well?

			RODERICK
	Only a very little, as soldiers do.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	I had thought you more expert.  You
	must find out if the Chevalier
	cheats.  He sees the English and
	Austrian envoys continually, and the
	young men of either ministry sup
	repeatedly at his house.  Find out
	what they talk of, for how much each
	plays, especially if any of them
	play on parole.  If you are able to,
	read his private letters, though
	about those which go to the post,
	you need not trouble yourself -- we
	look at them there.  But never see
	him write a note without finding out
	to whom it goes, and by what channel
	or messenger.  He sleeps with the
	keys of his dispatch-box with a
	string around his neck -- twenty
	frederics, if you get an impression
	of the keys.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	Does this assignment interest you?

			RODERICK
	Yes, Minister, I am interested in
	any work in which I can be of
	service to Captain Galgenstein.

The Minister studies Roderick, coldly.

EXT.  CHEVALIER DE BELLE FAST'S HOUSE - BERLIN - DAY

Roderick, now dressed in civilian clothes, admires a
beautiful carriage, waiting at the door.  Then he enters.

INT.  CHEVALIER DE BELLE FAST'S APARTMENT - DAY

			CHEVALIER
	You are the young man who M. de
	Seebach recommended?

			RODERICK
	Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.

Roderick bows, and hands him a letter from that gentleman,
with which the Captain had taken care to provide him.

As the Chevalier reads the letter, Roderick has the
leisure to examine him.

He is a man of sixty years of age, dressed superbly,
wearing rings, diamonds and laces.

One of his eyes is closed with a black patch, and he wears
a little white and red paint, and a pair of moustachios,
which fall over his lip.

The Chevalier is seated at a table near the window to read
the letter.

			CHEVALIER
	Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?

			RODERICK
	Yes, sir.

			CHEVALIER
	You come highly recommended by Herr
	Seebach.

			RODERICK
	Herr Seebach was a very kind
	employer.

			CHEVALIER
	For whom else have you worked?

			RODERICK
	No one, sir.  Before that I served
	in the army but had to leave due to
	weakness of the loins.

			CHEVALIER
	Who else can give me information
	about you?

			RODERICK
	Only the agency of servants.

The Chevalier puts the letter down, looks at Roderick for
a few seconds, and then smiles.

			CHEVALIER
	You will do.  I will give you 30...
	a day.  I do not provide your
	clothing; you will sleep at home,
	and you will be at my orders every
	morning at seven o'clock.

He notices Roderick begin to tremble and look peculiar.

			CHEVALIER
	Is there something wrong?

He goes up to Roderick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	It was very imprudent of me; but
	when I saw the splendor of his
	appearance, the nobleness of his
	manner, I felt it impossible to keep
	disguise with him.  You, who have
	never been out of your country know
	little what it is to hear a friendly
	voice in captivity; and there's a
	many a man that will understand the
	cause of the burst of feeling which
	was about to take place.

The Chevalier takes Roderick by the shoulder.

			RODERICK
		   (as he speaks,
		    bursting into tears)
	Sir, I have a confession to make.  I
	am an Irishman, and my name is
	Roderick James.  I was abducted into
	the Prussian army two years ago, and
	now I have been put into your
	service by my Captain and his uncle,
	the Minister of Police, to serve as
	a watch upon your actions, of which
	I am to give information to the same
	quarter.  For this odious service, I
	have been promised my discharge, and
	a hundred guineas.

Sobbing, Roderick falls into his arms.

			CHEVALIER
	The rascals!  They think to catch
	me, do they?  Why, young man, my
	chief conspiracy is a faro-bank.
	But the king is so jealous, that he
	will see a spy in every person who
	comes to his miserable capital, in
	the great sandy desert here.

EXT.  BERLIN - PARK - DAY

Roderick and the Chevalier walking.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And I think he was as much affected
	as I was at thus finding one of his
	kindred; for he, too, was an exile
	from home, and a friendly voice, a
	look, brought the old country back
	to his memory again, and the old
	days of his boyhood.

			CHEVALIER
	I'd give five years of my life to
	see the old country again, the
	greenfields, and the river, and the
	old round tower, and the burying
	place.

EXT.  BERLIN - STREET - DAY

Roderick and the Chevalier walking.

			CHEVALIER
	My lad, I have been in every
	service; and, between ourselves, owe
	money in every capital in Europe.  I
	have been a rolling stone.  Play --
	play has been my ruin!  That and
	beauty.  The women have made a fool
	of me, my dear boy.  I am a soft-
	hearted creature, and this minute,
	at sixty-two, have no more command
	of myself than when Peggy O'Dwyer
	made a fool of me at sixteen.

EXT.  BERLIN - LAKE WANNSEE - DAY

Roderick and the Chevalier walking along the bank.

			CHEVALIER
	The cards are now my only
	livelihood.  Sometimes I am in luck,
	and then I lay out my money in these
	trinkets you see.  It's property,
	look you, and the only way I have
	found of keeping a little about me.
	When the luck goes against me, why,
	my dear, my diamonds go to the
	pawnbrokers and I wear paste.  Do
	you understand the cards?

			RODERICK
	I can play as soldiers do, but have
	no great skill.

			CHEVALIER
	We will practice in the mornings, my
	boy, and I'll put you up to a thing
	or two worth knowing.

INT.  CHEVALIER'S ROOMS - BERLIN - DAY

Quick cuts -- Roderick being taught the profession of
cards and the dice-box.

EXT.  GARDEN HOUSE - BERLIN - DAY

Roderick, Minister Galgenstein, and Captain Galgenstein.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I carried my little reports to
	Captain Galgenstein at the Garden
	house outside the town where he gave
	me rendezvous.  These reports, of
	course, were arranged between me and
	the Chevalier beforehand.  I was
	instructed, and it is always the
	best way, to tell as much truth as
	my story would possible bear.

Dialogue comes up from under voice over.

			RODERICK
	He goes to church regularly -- he is
	very religious, and after hearing
	mass comes home to breakfast.  Then
	he takes an airing in his chariot
	till dinner, which is served at
	noon.  After dinner, he writes his
	letters, if he has any letters to
	write; but he has very little to do
	in this way.  His letters are to the
	Austrian envoy, with whom he
	corresponds, but who does not
	acknowledge him; and being written
	in English, or course, I look over
	his shoulder.  He generally writes
	for money.  He makes his party with
	Calsabigi, the lottery contractor,
	the Russian attaches, two from the
	English embassy, my lords Deuceace
	and Punter, who play a jeu d'enfer,
	and a few more.  He wins often, but
	not always.  Lord Deuceace is a very
	fine player.  The Chevalier Elliott,
	the English Minister, sometimes
	comes, on which occasion the
	secretaries do not play.

INT.  CHEVALIER'S APARTMENTS - NIGHT

The Chevalier is at play against several gentlemen,
including the Prince of Turbingen, while Roderick signals
the cards.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	It was agreed that I should keep my
	character of valet, that in the
	presence of strangers I should not
	know a word of English, that I
	should keep good lookout on the
	trumps when I was serving the
	champagne and punch about; and,
	having a remarkably fine eyesight,
	and a great natural aptitude, I was
	speedily able to give my dear
	benefactor much assistance against
	his opponents at the green table.

Several cuts of playing and cheating to illustrate voice
over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Simplicity was our secret.
	Everything successful is simple.
	If, for instance, I wiped the dust
	off a chair with my napkin, it was
	to show that the enemy was strong in
	diamonds; if I pushed it, he had an
	ace, king; if I said, "Punch or
	wine, my lord?" hearts was meant.
	If "Wine or punch?" clubs.  If I
	blew my nose, it was to indicate
	that there was another confederate
	employed by the adversary; and then,
	I warrant you, some pretty trials of
	skill would take place.  The Prince
	of Turbingen, although so young, had
	a very great skill and cleverness
	with the cards in every way; and it
	was only from hearing Ritter von
	Brandenburg, who came with him, yawn
	three times when the Chevalier had
	the ace of trumps, that I knew we
	were Greek to Greek, as it were.

The Prince loses a big hand, and, in a fury, throws down
his cards.  He stares at the table, then at the Chevalier.

			PRINCE
	Chevalier, though I cannot say how,
	I believe you have cheated me.

			CHEVALIER
	I deny your Grace's accusations, and
	beg you to say how you have been
	cheated?

			PRINCE
		   (glaring at Roderick)
	I don't know.

			CHEVALIER
	Your Grace owes me seventy thousand
	frederics, which I have honorably
	won.

			PRINCE
	Chevalier, if you will have your
	money now, you must fight for it.
	If you will be patient, maybe I will
	pay you something another time.

			CHEVALIER
	Your Grace, if I am so tame as to
	take this, then I must give up an
	honorable and lucrative occupation.

			PRINCE
	I have said all there is to be said.
	I am at your disposal for whatever
	purposes you wish.  Good night.

He exits.

EXT.  GARDEN HOUSE - DAY

Roderick, Captain Galgenstein and Minister Galgenstein.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	Was he cheated?

			RODERICK
	In so far as I can tell these things
	-- no.  I believe the Chevalier won
	the money fairly.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	Hmm-mmmm.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	What are the Chevalier's intentions?

			RODERICK
	I am not sure.  The Prince told him
	quite clearly that if he wished to
	have the money, he would have to
	fight for it.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	A meeting with the Prince of
	Turbingen is impossible.

			RODERICK
	The Prince left him only that
	choice.

The Captain and the Minister walk a few steps away and
speak in whispers.

Then they return to Roderick.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	Will you be able to return here
	tomorrow without arousing suspicion?

INT.  CHEVALIER'S APARTMENTS - DAY

			CHEVALIER
	Tell them I intend to demand
	satisfaction from the Prince.

			RODERICK
	But they will prevent a meeting at
	whatever the cost.

			CHEVALIER
	Have no fear.  It will come out well
	for me.

			RODERICK
	I believe they will deport you.

			CHEVALIER
	I have faced that problem before.

			RODERICK
	But, if they send you away, then
	what is to become of me?

			CHEVALIER
		   (with a smile)
	Make your mind easy, you shall not
	be left behind, I warrant you.  Do
	take a last look at your barracks,
	make your mind easy, say a farewell
	to your friends in Berlin.  The dear
	souls, how they will weep when they
	hear you are out of the country,
	and, out of it, you shall go.

			RODERICK
	But how, sir?

EXT.  GARDEN HOUSE - BERLIN - DAY

Roderick, Captain Galgenstein and Minister Galgenstein.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	The King has determined to send the
	Chevalier out of the country.

			RODERICK
	When is he to go?

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Has he sent the challenge yet?

			RODERICK
	Not yet, but I believe he intends
	to.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	Then this must be done tomorrow.

			RODERICK
	What is to be done?

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	You say he drives after breakfast
	and before dinner.  When he comes
	out to his carriage a couple of
	gendarmes will mount the box, and
	the coachman will get his orders to
	move on.

			RODERICK
	And his baggage?

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Oh!  That will be sent after him.  I
	have a fancy to look into that red
	box which contains his papers, you
	say; and at noon, after parade,
	shall be at the inn.  You will not
	say a word to any one there
	regarding the affair, and will wait
	for me at the Chevalier's rooms
	until my arrival.  We must force
	that box.  You are a clumsy hound,
	or you would have got the key long
	ago.

EXT.  CHEVALIER'S APARTMENTS - DAY

Action as per voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	At ten o'clock the next morning, the
	carriage of the Chevalier de Belle
	Fast drew up as usual at the door of
	his hotel, and the Chevalier came
	down the stairs in his usual stately
	manner.

Looking around and not finding his servant to open the
door.

			CHEVALIER
	Where is my rascal, Lazlo?

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
		   (standing by the
		    carriage)
	I will let down the steps for your
	honor.

No sooner does the Chevalier enter than the officer jumps
in after him, another mounts the box by the coachman, and
the latter begins to drive.

			CHEVALIER
	Good gracious!  What is this?

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
		   (touching his hat)
	You are going to drive to the
	frontier.

			CHEVALIER
	It is shameful -- infamous!  I
	insist upon being put down at the
	Austrian ambassador's house.

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
	I have orders to gag your honor if
	you cry out, and to give you this
	purse containing ten thousand
	frederics if you do not.

			CHEVALIER
	Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel
	owes me seventy thousand.

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
	Your honor must lower his voice.

			CHEVALIER
		   (whispering)
	All Europe shall hear of this!

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
	As you please.

Both lapse into silence.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

The coach drives by.  Suddenly -- "boom," the alarm cannon
begins to roar.

INT.  COACH - DAY

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
	Do not be alarmed.  The alarm cannon
	only signals a deserter.

Chevalier nods.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

The coach drives by and action as described.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Hearing the sound of the alarm
	cannon, the common people came out
	along the road, with fowling-pieces
	and pitch-forks, in hopes to catch
	the truant.  The gendarmes looked
	very anxious to be on the lookout
	for him too.  The price of a
	deserter was fifty crowns to those
	who brought him in.

EXT.  SAXON CUSTOM-HOUSE - DAY

The black and white barriers came in view at last hard by
Bruck, and opposite them the green and yellow of Saxony.
The Saxon custom-house officers came out.

			CHEVALIER
	I have no luggage.

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
	The gentleman has nothing
	contraband.

The Prussian officers, grinning, hand the Chevalier the
purse and take their leave of their prisoner with much
respect.

The Chevalier de Belle Fast gives them three frederic a-
piece.

			CHEVALIER
	Gentlemen, I wish you a good day.
	Will you please go to the house from
	whence we set out this morning, and
	tell my man there to send my baggage
	on to Three Kings at Dresden?

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Then ordering fresh horses, the
	Chevalier set off on his journey for
	that capital.  I need not tell you
	that I was the Chevalier.

INT.  ROOM - HOTEL DES TROIS COURONNES - DAY

Roderick reading a letter over his breakfast in bed.

			CHEVALIER (V.O.)
	From the Chevalier de Belle Fast to
	Roderick James, Esquire, Gentilhomme
	Anglais.  At the Hotel des trois
	Couronnes, Dresden, Saxe.  My dear
	Roderick -- This comes to you by a
	sure hand, no other than Mr. Lumpit,
	of the English mission, who is
	acquainted, as all Berlin will be
	directly, with our wonderful story.
	They only know half as yet; they
	only know that a deserter went off
	in my clothes, and all are in
	admiration of your cleverness and
	valor.

INT.  CHEVALIER'S ROOM - DAY

Action as per description in letter.

			CHEVALIER (V.O.)
	As I lay in my bed two and a half
	hours after your departure, in comes
	your ex-captain, Galgenstein.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
		   (in his imperious
		    Dutch manner)
	Roderick!  Are you there?

No answer.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	The rogue is gone out.

Action as per voice over.

			CHEVALIER (V.O.)
	Straightaway he makes for the red
	box where I keep my love letters, my
	glass eye which I used to wear, my
	two sets of Paris teeth, and my
	other private matters that you know
	of.  He first tries a bunch of keys,
	but none of them fit the English
	lock.  Then he takes out of his
	pocket a chisel and hammer, and
	falls to work like a professional
	burglar, actually bursting open the
	little box!  Now was my time to act!
	I advance towards him armed with an
	immense water-jug.  I come
	noiselessly up to him just as he has
	broken the box, and, with all my
	might, I deal him such a blow over
	the head as smashes the water-jug to
	bits, and sends the captain with a
	snort lifeless to the ground.  Then
	I ring all the bells in the house;
	and shout, and swear, and scream,
	"Thieves! -- Thieves! -- Landlord!
	-- Murder! -- Fire!" until the whole
	household comes tumbling up the
	stairs.

			CHEVALIER
	Where is my servant?  Who dares to
	rob me in open day?  Look at the
	villain whom I find in the act of
	breaking my chest open!  Send for
	the police, send for his Excellency
	the Austrian Minister!  All Europe
	shall know of this insult!

			LANDLORD
	Dear heaven!  We saw you go away
	three hours ago.

			CHEVALIER
	Me!  Why, man, I have been in bed
	all morning.  I am ill -- I have
	taken physic -- I have not left the
	house this morning!  Where is that
	scoundrel, Lazlo?  But, stop!  Where
	are my clothes and wig?

			CHAMBERMAID
	I have it -- I have it!  Lazlo is
	off in your honor's dress.

			CHEVALIER
	And my money -- my money!  Where is
	my purse with forty-eight frederics
	in it?  But we have one of the
	villains left, Officers, seize him.

			LANDLORD
		   (more and more
		    astonished)
	It's the young Herr Galgenstein.

			CHEVALIER
	What!  A gentleman breaking open my
	trunk with hammer and chisel --
	impossible!

			CHEVALIER (V.O.)
	Herr Galgenstein was returning to
	life by this time, with a swelling
	on his skull as big as a saucepan;
	and the officers carried him off,
	and, to make a long story short,
	poor Galgenstein is now on his way
	to Spandau; and his uncle, the
	Minister of Police Galgenstein, has
	brought me five hundred louis, with
	a humble request that I would leave
	Berlin forthwith, and hush up this
	painful matter.

INT.  GERMAN PALACE - BALLROOM - NIGHT

Roderick, the Chevalier and the Duke of Wurttemberg.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The Chevalier de Belle Fast was in
	particularly good order with the
	Duke of Wurttemberg, whose court
	was, at this period, the most
	brilliant in all Europe.

The Duke of Wurttemberg chatting with ballet dancers, who
will perform at the party.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	He spent fabulous sums on the
	ballets and operas.  All the
	ballerinas were pretty, and they all
	boasted that they had all at least
	once made their amorous sovereign
	happy.

Roderick and the Chevalier kissing hands, hobnobbing with
the nobility, and dancing minuets.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	There was not a party of the
	nobility to which the two Irish
	gentlemen were not invited, and
	admired, nor where we did not make
	the brave, the high-born and the
	beautiful talk to us.  There was no
	man in Europe more gay in spirits,
	more splendid in personal
	accomplishment, than young Roderick
	James.

EXT.  GERMAN STREET - DAWN

Roderick and the Chevalier in a comfortable coach, on
their way home to bed, pass troops marching out on early
parade.

INT.  COACH - DAWN

Roderick sinks back into the comfortable cushion and
yawns.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	What a delightful life did we now
	lead!  I knew I was born a
	gentleman, from the kindly way in
	which I took to the business, as
	business certainly it is.

INT.  BEDROOM - GERMANY - DAY

Roderick in a tub, being washed by a servant.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	For though it seems all pleasure,
	yet I assure any low-bred persons
	who may chance to read this, that
	we, their betters, have to work as
	well as they; though I did not rise
	until noon, yet had I not been up at
	play until long past midnight?

INT.  ANOTHER BEDROOM - GERMANY - DAY

His hair being done.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I came into it at once, and as if I
	had never done anything else all my
	life.  I had a gentleman to wait
	upon me, a French friseur to dress
	my hair of a morning.

INT.  DINING ROOM - NIGHT

A candle-lit supper.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I knew the taste of chocolate as by
	intuition almost, and could
	distinguish between the right
	Spanish and the French before I had
	been a week in my new position.

INSERTS - JEWELRY

Action and cuts as voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had rings on my fingers, watches
	in both my fobs, trinkets, and
	snuff-boxes, of all sorts, and each
	outvying the other in elegance.

INT.  RECEPTION ROOM - GERMANY - DAY

As described.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had the finest natural taste for
	lace and china of any man I ever
	knew.

EXT.  STABLES - GERMANY - DAY

Buying horses.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I could judge a horse as well as any
	dealer in Germany.  I could not
	spell, but I could speak German and
	French cleverly.

INT.  DRESSING ROOM - GERMANY - DAY

Roderick being fitted for clothes.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had at least twelve suits of
	clothes; three richly embroidered
	with gold, two laced with silver;
	one of French grey, silver-laced and
	lined with chinchilla.  I had damask
	morning robes, to which a peacock's
	tail is as sober as a Quaker's drab
	skirt.

INT.  ORANGERY - DAY

Action as voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I took lessons on the guitar, and
	sang French catches exquisitely.
	Where, in fact, was there a more
	accomplished gentleman than Roderick
	James?

INT.  GAMING ROOM - GERMANY - NIGHT

Action as per voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	How have we had the best blood, and
	the brightest eyes, too, of Europe
	throbbing round the table as I and
	the Chevalier have held the cards
	and the bank against some terrible
	player, who was matching some
	thousands out of his millions
	against our all which was there on
	the baize!

INT.  GAMING ROOM - GERMANY - NIGHT

Roderick dealing a faro bank.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Our principles were:  play grandly,
	honorably.  Be not, of course, cast
	down at losing; but, above all, be
	not eager at winning, as mean souls
	are.

INT.  GAMING ROOM - GERMANY - NIGHT

Action as voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	When the Duke of Courland brought
	fourteen lackeys each with bags of
	florins, and challenged our bank to
	play against the sealed bags, what
	did we ask?

			CHEVALIER
	Sir, we have but eighty thousand
	florins in bank, or two hundred
	thousand at three months; if your
	highness' bags do not contain more
	than eight thousand, we will meet
	you.

Playing.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And we did, and after eleven hours
	play, in which our bank was at one
	time reduced to two hundred and
	three ducats, we won seventeen
	thousand florins off him.

Four crowned heads look on at the game, and an imperial
princess, when Roderick turns up the ace of hearts, bursts
into tears.

INT.  MASQUERADE BALL - NIGHT

Roderick and a girl.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Nor need I mention my successes
	among the fairer portion of the
	creation.  One of the most
	accomplished, the tallest, the most
	athletic, and the handsomest
	gentleman in Europe, as I was then,
	a young fellow of my figure could
	not fail of having advantages, which
	a person of my spirit knew very well
	how to us.

INT.  BOUDOIR - NIGHT

Making love to a masked lady.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Charming Schuvaloff.

INT.  COACH - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Black-eyed Sczortarska.

INT.  BOUDOIR - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Dark Valdez.

			RODERICK
	Do you expect me to believe that
	your lover brought you here tonight?

			VALDEZ
	Yes.  He brought me in his carriage,
	and he will call for me at midnight.

			RODERICK
	And he doesn't care about me?

			VALDEZ
	He is only curious to know who you
	are.

			RODERICK
	If his love were like mine, he would
	not permit you to come here.

			VALDEZ
	He loves me, as I love you.

			RODERICK
	Will he wish to know the details of
	this night?

			VALDEZ
	He will believe that it will please
	me if he asks about it, and I shall
	tell him everything except some
	circumstances which might humiliate
	him.

EXT.  GARDEN - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Tender Hegenheim.

INT.  BOUDOIR - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Brilliant Langeac.

Roderick takes from his portfolio a little jacket of very
fine transparent skin, eight inches long and closed at one
end, and which by way of a pouch string at its open end,
has a narrow pink ribbon.

He displays it to her, she looks at it, and laughs.

			LANGEAC
	I will put in on you myself.

She puts it on, out of shot.

			LANGEAC
	There you are, dressed by my hand.
	It is nearly the same thing; but
	despite the fineness and
	transparency of the skin, the little
	fellow pleases me less well in
	costume.  It seems that this
	covering degrades him, or degrades
	me -- one of the other.

			RODERICK
	Both, my angel.  It was Love who
	invented these little jackets:  for
	he had to ally himself with
	Precaution.

INT.  ROOM OFF A BALLROOM - NIGHT

Roderick making love to the Countess von Trotha.  Enter
the Count, in the uniform of a Colonel.

			COUNT
	I entered here, monsieur, at a bad
	moment for you; it seems that you
	love this lady.

			RODERICK
	Certainly, monseigneur, does not
	Your Excellency consider her worthy
	of love?

			COUNT
	Perfectly so; and what is more, I
	will tell you that I love her, and
	that I am not of a humor to put up
	with rivals.

			RODERICK
	Very well!  Now that I know it, I
	will no longer love her.

			COUNT
	Then you yield to me.

			RODERICK
	On the instant.  Everyone must yield
	to such a nobleman as you.

			COUNT
	Very well; but a man who yields
	takes to his legs.

			RODERICK
	That is a trifle strong.

			COUNT
	Take to your legs, low Irish dog.

Roderick smiles at him.

			RODERICK
	Your Excellency has wantonly
	insulted me.  That being so, I
	conclude that you hate me,
	Monseigneur, and that hence you
	would be glad to remove me from the
	number of the living.  In this wish,
	I can and will satisfy Your
	Excellency.

EXT.  BEAUTIFUL GARDEN - EARLY MORNING

Roderick's sword duel with the Count.

Details to be worked out.

INT.  BILLIARD ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick watches the Chevalier play with a Prussian
officer, Lieutenant Dascher.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	It was my unrivaled skill with
	sword and pistol, and readiness to
	use them, that maintained the
	reputation of the firm.

Towards the end of the game, Dascher, seeing that he is
losing, makes an unfair stroke, so obvious that the marker
tells him so to his face.

Lieutenant Dascher, for whom the stroke wins the game,
takes the money which is in the stake bag, and puts it in
his pocket, paying no attention to the marker's
adjurations, or to Roderick's.

Roderick, who is without his sword, reaches for a billiard
cue and swings it at Dascher's face.

He wards off the blow with his arm, drawing his sword and
runs at Roderick, who is unarmed.

The marker, a sturdy young man, catches Dascher around the
waist and prevents murder.

			DASCHER
	I see that you are without your
	sword, but I believe you are a man
	of mettle.  Will you give me
	satisfaction?

			RODERICK
	I shall be delighted; but you have
	lost and you must pay me the money
	before we meet, for, after all, you
	cannot pay me when you are dead.

			ANOTHER OFFICER
	I will undertake to pay you the 20
	louis, but only tomorrow morning at
	the meeting.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

On the field, there are six people waiting with Dascher,
and his seconds.  Dascher takes 20 louis from his pocket
and hands them to Roderick, saying:

			DASCHER
	I may have been mistaken, but I mean
	to make you pay deadly for your
	brutality.

Roderick takes the money and puts it in his purse with the
utmost calm, making no reply to the other's boasting.

			RODERICK
		   (privately)
	It is distasteful to kill a
	scoundrel -- that should be work for
	a hangman.

			CHEVALIER
	To risk one's life against such
	people is an imposition.

			RODERICK
		   (laughs)
	I risk nothing, for I am certain to
	kill him.

			CHEVALIER
	Certain?

			RODERICK
	Perfectly certain, because I shall
	make him tremble.

He takes his station between two trees, about four paces
apart, and draws a pair of dueling pistols.

			RODERICK
	You have only to pace yourself at
	ten paces difference, and fire
	first.  The space between these two
	trees is the place where I choose to
	walk back and forth.  You may walk
	too, if you wish, when it is my turn
	to fire.

No one could have explained his intentions more clearly or
spoken more calmly.

			DASCHER
	But we must decide who is to have
	the first shot.

			RODERICK
	There is no need of that.  I never
	fire first; and, in any case, you
	have that right.

Dascher places himself at the specified distance.

Roderick walks slowly back and forth between the two trees
without looking at him.

Dascher takes aim and fires, missing.

			RODERICK
		   (with the greatest
		    composure)
	You missed me, sir.  I was sure you
	would.  Try again.

The others think he is mad, and had expected some kind of
discussion between the parties, but not a bit of it.

Dascher takes careful aim and fires a second shot, again
missing Roderick.

Without a word, but in a firm and confident manner,
Roderick fires his first shot into the air.

Dascher looks amazed.  Then, aiming at Dascher with his
second pistol, he hits him in the center of the forehead
and stretches him out dead on the ground.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Roderick and Chevalier traveling in their coach.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Thus is will be seen that our life,
	for all its splendor was one of
	extreme difficulty and danger,
	requiring high talents and courage
	for success, and sudden and
	unexpected departures.

They meet a four-wheel carriage, drawn by two horses,
carrying a master and a servant.

The driver of the four-wheel carriage wants Roderick's
driver to make way for him.

Roderick's driver protests that if he does, he will upset
his master in the ditch, but the other insists.

Roderick addresses the master, a handsome young man, and
asks him to order his driver to make way for him.

			RODERICK
	I am posting, monsieur, and
	furthermore I am a foreigner.

			STRANGER
	Monsieur, here in Saxony, the post
	has no special right, and if you are
	a foreigner, you must admit that you
	have no greater claim than mine,
	since I am in my own country.

At that, Roderick gets out and holding his drawn-sword
tells the stranger to get out, or to make way for him.

The stranger replies, with a smile, that he has no sword
and that, in any case, he will not fight for such a silly
reason.

He tells Roderick to get back in his chaise, and he makes
way for him.

INT.  GAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick and the Chevalier running a faro bank when an
important lady suffers a huge loss.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The ladies were passionately fond of
	play, and hence would often arise no
	small trouble to us; for the truth
	most be told, that the ladies loved
	to play, but not to pay.  The point
	of honor is not understood by the
	charming sex; and it was with the
	greatest difficulty that we could
	keep them from the table, could get
	their money if they lost or, if they
	paid, prevent them from using the
	most furious and extraordinary means
	of revenge.

EXT.  ROAD - DAWN

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	On this evening, the lady of high
	rank, after I had won a considerable
	sum in diamonds and pearls from her,
	sent her lover with a band of cut-
	throats to waylay me.

Roderick and the Chevalier are sound asleep in their
carriage when they are awakened by a violent jolt, upon
which the carriage overturns in the middle of the road.

The Chevalier is underneath, and screams from the pain in
his right arm, which he thinks is broken.

Their servant forces the door open to help them out,
telling them that the two postilions have fled.

Roderick easily gets out of the carriage through the door,
which is above him, but the Chevalier, unable to move
because of his disabled arm, has to be pulled out.

His piercing shrieks make Roderick laugh, because of the
strange oaths with which he interlards his prayers.

From the carriage, Roderick takes his dueling pistols,
and sword.

Roderick tells his servant to mount and to looking for
armed peasants in the vicinity; money in hand, he leaves.

The Chevalier has lain down on the hard ground, groaning
and in no condition to resist robbers.

Roderick makes his own preparations to sell his fortune
and his life at the highest price.

His carriage is close to the ditch, and he unhitches the
horses, tieing them to the wheels and the pole in a
circle, and stations himself behind them with weapons.

In this predicament, Roderick cannot help laughing at the
poor Chevalier, who is writhing like a dying dolphin on a
seashore, and uttering the most pitiful execrations, when
a mare, whose back was turned to him, take it into her
empty head to empty her bladder on him.  There is nothing
to be done; he has to put up with the whole stinking rain,
and to forgive Roderick's laughter, which he has not the
strength to hold in.

The chill wind and the silence are suddenly broken by an
attack, which is half-hearted and uncertain, by the lady's
lover, and his hesitant band of six cut-throats.

Some falter and run away as soon as Roderick fires his
pistol.

The leader and two heartier followers engage Roderick.
During the fight, they mortally wound the helpless
Chevalier and two of them are killed.

After they flee, Roderick kneels by the Chevalier, who
utters some appropriate last words, then dies.

His servant finally arrives at full gallop, shouting at
the top of his voice, and followed by a band of peasants,
each with his lantern, come to his rescue.  There are ten
or twelve of them, all armed with muskets, and all ready
to obey his orders.

EXT.  SPA - HOTEL - DAY

Roderick's carriage arrives.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	After making suitable arrangements
	for the Chevalier's burial, in
	proper accord with his church, I
	traveled to Spa, which was now in
	season, alone, to continue my
	profession which formerly had the
	support of my friend and mentor.

INT.  GAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Crowds surround Roderick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I was by this time one of the best-
	known characters in Europe; and the
	fame of my exploits, my duels, my
	courage at play, would bring crowds
	round me in any public society where
	I appeared.

INT.  CASINO - NIGHT

Attractive women alone, while men are at the gaming table.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The passion for play is stronger
	than the passion for gallantry; the
	gamester at Spa has neither time to
	stop to consider the merits of a
	woman, nor the courage to make
	sacrifices for her.

EXT.  GARDEN IN SPA - DAY

The Countess of Cosgrove walks beside her husband, Sir
William Cosgrove, who is in a wheelchair.  They are
accompanied by their young son, Lord Brookside, and two
servants.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	In evoking the recollections of
	these days, I have nothing but
	pleasure.  I would if I could say as
	much of a lady who will henceforth
	play a considerable part in the
	drama of my life -- I mean the
	Countess of Cosgrove, whose fatal
	acquaintance I made at Spa, very
	soon after the tragic events which
	caused me to quit Germany.

Closer shot of the Countess.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Victoria, Countess of Cosgrove.  A
	Countess and a Viscountess in her
	own right.

Closer shot of Sir William Cosgrove.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She was the wife of her cousin, the
	Right Honorable Sir William Reginald
	Cosgrove, Knight of the Bath, and
	Minister to George II and George III
	of several of the smaller courts of
	Europe.

Closer shot of young Lord Brookside, walking behind them
in the care of his governor.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She was the mother to Viscount
	Brookside -- a melancholy, deserted,
	little boy, about whom his father
	was more than indifferent, and whom
	his mother never saw.

INT.  GAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Shots of Sir William Cosgrove being wheeled in, and at
play with Roderick, and some other gentlemen.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I made Sir William Cosgrove's
	acquaintance as usual at the play-
	table.  One could not but admire the
	spirit and gallantry with which he
	pursued his favorite pastime; for,
	though worn out with gout and a
	myriad of diseases, a cripple
	wheeled about in a chair, and
	suffering pangs of agony, yet you
	would see him every morning, and
	every evening at his post behind the
	delightful green cloth.

			SIR WILLIAM
	Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you
	have no more manners than a barber,
	and I think my black footman has
	been better educated than you; but
	you are a young fellow of
	originality and pluck, and I like
	you, sir.  because you seem
	determined to go to the devil by a
	way of your own.

Laughter at the table.

			RODERICK
	I am obliged to observe, Sir William
	Cosgrove, that since you are bound
	for the next world much sooner than
	I am, I will depend on you to get
	comfortable quarters arranged for
	me.

Laughter.

			SIR WILLIAM
	Indeed, you are right, sir.  Look at
	me.  Marriage has added forty years
	to my life.  I am dying, a worn-out
	cripple, at the age of fifty.  When
	I took off Lady Cosgrove, there was
	no man of my years who looked so
	young as myself.  Fool that I was!
	I had enough with my pensions,
	perfect freedom, the best society in
	Europe -- and I gave up all these,
	and married and was miserable.  Take
	a warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and
	stick to the trumps.  Do anything,
	but marry.

			RODERICK
	Would you have me spend my life all
	alone?

			SIR WILLIAM
	In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must
	marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.

			RODERICK
		   (laughing)
	The milkmaid's daughter?

			SIR WILLIAM
	Well, why not a milkmaid's daughter?
	No man of sense need restrict
	himself or deny himself a single
	amusement for his wife's sake; on
	the contrary, if he selects the
	animal properly, he will choose such
	a one as shall be no bar to his
	pleasure, but a comfort in his hours
	of annoyance.  For instance, I have
	got the gout; who tends me?  A hired
	valet who robs me whenever he has
	the power.  My wife never comes near
	me.  What friend have I?  None in
	the wide world.  Men of the world,
	as you and I are, don't make
	friends, and we are fools for our
	pains.

Polite laughter at the table.

			SIR WILLIAM
	My lady is a weak woman, but she is
	my mistress.  She is a fool, but she
	has got the better of one of the
	best heads in Christendom.  She is
	enormously rich, but somehow I have
	never been so poor, as since I
	married her.  I thought to better
	myself, and she has made me
	miserable and killed me, and she
	will do as much for my successor
	when I'm gone.

There is a reflective silence at the table.

			RODERICK
	Has her ladyship a very large
	income?

This question causes Sir William to burst out into a
yelling laugh, joined by the rest of the table, and makes
Roderick blush not a little at his gaucherie.

EXT.  ORNAMENTAL GARDEN - SPA - NIGHT

A beautiful scene, lit by the flambeaux, held by a dozen
footmen.  A small orchestra, playing in a Temple of Love,
some dancers, people gambling and lounging along a line of
trees.

Roderick approaches the Countess.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Despite my friend's strong warning.
	I resolves to become acquainted with
	his lady.  Sir William Cosgrove was
	dying.  His widow would be a rich
	prize.  Why should I not win her,
	and, with her, the means of making
	in the world that figure which my
	genius and inclination desired?
	When I determine, I look upon the
	thing as done.

			RODERICK
	Charming lady, tell me the truth and
	earn my gratitude.  Have you a
	lover?

The countess laughs.

			COUNTESS
	No.

			RODERICK
	Have you had one?

			COUNTESS
	Never.

			RODERICK
	But, for a time... a passing fancy?

			COUNTESS
	Not even that.

			RODERICK
	How can I believe that there is not
	a man who has inspired desires in
	you?

			COUNTESS
	Not one.

			RODERICK
	Have you not a man whom you value?

			COUNTESS
	That man has, perhaps, not yet been
	born.

			RODERICK
	What!  You have not met a man worthy
	of your attention?

			COUNTESS
	Many worthy of attention; but
	valuing is something more.  I could
	value only someone whom I loved.

			RODERICK
	Then you have never loved?  Your
	heart is empty.

			COUNTESS
	Your word "empty" makes me laugh.
	Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If
	it is fortunate, I congratulate
	myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do
	not care, for I am not aware of it.

			RODERICK
	It is nonetheless a misfortune, and
	you will know it when you love.

			COUNTESS
	But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I
	will know that my empty heart was my
	good fortune.

			RODERICK
	That is true, but it seems to me
	impossible that you should be
	unhappy in love.

			COUNTESS
	It is only too possible.  Love
	requires a mutual harmony which is
	difficult, and it is even more
	difficult to make it last.

			RODERICK
	I agree; but God put us on earth to
	take that risk.

			COUNTESS
	A man may need to do that, and find
	it amusing; but a girl is bound by
	other laws.

			RODERICK
	I believe you, and I see I must
	hasten to leave, for otherwise I
	shall become the unhappiest of men.

			COUNTESS
	How so?

			RODERICK
	By loving you, with no hope of
	possessing you.

She laughs.

			COUNTESS
	You want my heart?

			RODERICK
	It is my only object.

			COUNTESS
	To make me wretched in two weeks.

			RODERICK
	To love you until death.  To
	subscribe to all your commands.

			COUNTESS
	The amusing thing is that you
	deceive me without knowing, if it is
	true that you love me.

			RODERICK
	Deceiving someone without knowing it
	is something new for me.  If I do
	not know it, I am innocent.

			COUNTESS
	But you deceive me nonetheless if I
	believe you, for it will not be in
	your power to love me when you love
	me no longer.

Roderick laughs and kisses her.

			COUNTESS
	Be so good as to tell me with whom
	you think you are?

			RODERICK
	With a woman who is completely
	charming, be she a princess or a
	woman of the lowest condition, and
	who, regardless of her rank, will
	show me some kindness, tonight.

She laughs.

			COUNTESS
	And if she does not choose to show
	you some kindness?

			RODERICK
	Then I will respectfully take leave
	of her.

			COUNTESS
	You will do as you please.  It seems
	to me that such a matter can hardly
	be discussed until after people know
	each other.  Do you not agree?

			RODERICK
	Yes -- but I am afraid of being
	deceived.

			COUNTESS
	Poor man.  And, for that reason, you
	want to begin where people end?

			RODERICK
	I ask only a payment on account
	today -- after that, you will find
	me undemanding, obedient and
	discreet.

She laughs.  He kisses her again.  They exit.

EXT.  ROAD - SPA - NIGHT

Coach and four moves slowly along.

INT.  COACH - NIGHT

They kiss.  She gently struggles as he tries to undo her
dress.  He stops.

			RODERICK
	Will we always leave it at this?

			COUNTESS
	Always, my dear one, never any
	further.  Love is a child to be
	pacified with trifles.  A full diet
	can only kill it.

			RODERICK
	I know better than you do.  Love
	wants a more substantial fare, and
	if it is stubbornly withheld, it
	withers away.

			COUNTESS
	Our abstinence makes our love
	immortal.  If I loved you a quarter
	of an hour ago, now I should love
	you even more.  But I should love
	you less if you exhausted my joy by
	satisfying all my desires.

			RODERICK
	Let us give each other complete
	happiness, and let us be sure that
	as many times as we satisfy our
	desires, they will each time be born
	anew.

			COUNTESS
	My husband has convinced me of the
	contrary.

			RODERICK
	Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is
	dying, and yet I envy him more than
	any man in Christendom.  He enjoys a
	privilege of which I am deprived.
	He may take you in his arms whenever
	he pleases, and no veil keeps his
	senses, his eyes, his soul from
	enjoying your beauty.

She silences him with her fingertips.

			COUNTESS
	Shall I tell you something -- I
	believed what was called love came
	after the union -- and I was
	surprised when my husband, making me
	a woman, made me know it only by
	pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure.
	I saw that my imaginings had stood
	me in better stead.  And so we
	became only friends, seldom sleeping
	together and arousing no curiosity
	in each other, yet on good terms for
	a while, as whenever he wanted me, I
	was at his service, but since the
	offering was not seasoned with love,
	he found it tasteless, and seldom
	demanded it.

			RODERICK
	O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg
	you.  Stop believing in your
	experience.  You have never known
	love.  My very soul is leaving me!
	Catch it on your lips, and give me
	yours!

They kiss ardently.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	To make a long story short, her
	ladyship and I were in love six
	hours after we met; and after I once
	got into her ladyship's good graces,
	I found innumerable occasions to
	improve my intimacy, and was
	scarcely ever out of her company.

EXT.  COUNTESS' HOUSE - SPA - DUSK

Action as per voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I shall never forget the
	astonishment of Sir William Cosgrove
	when, on one summer evening, as he
	was issuing out to the play-table,
	in his sedan-chair, her ladyship's
	barouche and four came driving into
	the courtyard of the house which
	they inhabited and, in that
	carriage, by her ladyship's side,
	sat no other than "the vulgar Irish
	adventurer," as she was pleased to
	call me.

Sir William makes the most courtly of bows and grins, and
waves his hat in as graceful a manner as his multiplicity
of illness permits, and her ladyship and Roderick reply to
the salutation with the utmost politeness and elegance on
their part.

INT.  RODERICK'S APARTMENT - SPA - NIGHT

Making ardent love.

			COUNTESS
	Without you, my dearest, I might
	have died without ever knowing love.
	Inexpressible love!  God of nature!
	Bitterness than which nothing is
	sweeter, sweetness than which
	nothing is more bitter.  Divine
	monster which can only be defined by
	paradoxes.

			RODERICK
	Let me give a thousand kisses to
	that heavenly mouth which has told
	me that I am happy.

			COUNTESS
	As soon as I saw you loved me, I was
	pleased, and I gave you every
	opportunity to fall more in love
	with me, being certain that, for my
	part, I would never love you.  But
	after our first kiss, I found that I
	had no power over myself.  I did not
	know that one kiss could matter so
	much.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	We then spent an hour in the most
	eloquent silence except that, from
	time to time, her ladyship cried
	out:  "Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I
	am not dreaming?"

INT.  GAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick enters and approaches a table at which Sir
William Cosgrove, who is drunk, is at play with several
other jovial fellows.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Sir William Cosgrove, with his
	complication of ills, was dying
	before us by inches.  He was
	continually tinkered up by doctors,
	and, what with my usual luck, he
	might be restored to health and live
	I don't know how many years.  If
	Cosgrove would not die, where was
	the use of my pursing his lady?  But
	my fears were to prove groundless,
	for on that very night, patient
	nature would claim her account.

			SIR WILLIAM
	Good evening, Mr. James, have you
	done with my lady?

			RODERICK
	I beg your pardon?

			SIR WILLIAM
	Come, come, sir.  I am a man who
	would rather be known as a cuckold
	than a fool.

			RODERICK
	I think, Sir William Cosgrove, you
	have had too much drink.  Your
	chaplin, Mr. Hunt, has introduced me
	into the company of your lady to
	advise me on a religious matter, of
	which she is a considerable expert.

Sir William Cosgrove greets this line with a yell of
laughter.  His laugh is not jovial or agreeable, but
rather painful and sardonic, and ends in a violent fit of
coughing.

			SIR WILLIAM
	Gentlemen, see this amiable youth!
	He has been troubled by religious
	scruples, and has flown for refuge
	to my chaplin, Mr. Hunt, who has
	asked for advise from my wife, Lady
	Cosgrove, and between them both,
	they are confirming my ingenious
	young friend in his faith.  Did you
	ever hear of such doctors and such a
	disciple?

			RODERICK
	Faith, sir, if I want to learn good
	principles, it's surely better I
	should apply for them to your lady,
	and your chaplin than to you?

			SIR WILLIAM
		   (laughing, but pretty
		    red)
	He wants to step into my shoes!  He
	wants to step into my shoes!

Roderick stares at him coldly.

			RODERICK
	Well, if my intentions are what you
	think they are -- if I do wish to
	step into your shoes, what then?  I
	have no other intentions than you
	had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's
	wealth may be great, but am I not of
	a generous nature enough to use it
	worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but
	not so lofty as my ambition.  I will
	be sworn to muster just as much
	regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you
	ever showed her; and if I win her,
	and wear her when you are dead and
	gone, corbleu, knight, do you think
	that it will be the fear of your
	ghost will deter me?

			SIR WILLIAM
	Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for
	me, as I am drawing near the goal,
	to find my home such a happy one; my
	wife so fond of me, that she is even
	now thinking of appointing a
	successor?  Isn't it a comfort to
	see her; like a prudent housewife,
	getting everything ready for her
	husband's departure?

			RODERICK
	I hope that you are not thinking of
	leaving us soon, knight?

			SIR WILLIAM
	Not so soon, my dear, as you may
	fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have
	been given over many times these
	four years, and there was always a
	candidate or two waiting to apply
	for the situation.  Who knows how
	long I may keep you waiting.

			RODERICK
	Sir, let those laugh that win.

			SIR WILLIAM
	I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm
	grieved to keep you or any gentleman
	waiting.  Had you not better to
	arrange with my doctor or get the
	cook to flavor my omelette with
	arsenic?  What are the odds,
	gentlemen, that I don't live to see
	Mr. James hang yet?

There is laughter around the table, and Sir William starts
dealing the cards.

			VOICE
	Dies at Spa, in the Kingdom of
	Belgium, the Right Honorable Sir
	William Cosgrove, Knight of the
	Bath, Member of Parliament for
	Cosgrove and Devonshire and many
	years His Majesty's representative
	at various European courts.  He hath
	left behind him a name which is
	endeared to all his friends for his
	manifold virtues and talents, a
	reputation justly acquired in the
	service of His Majesty, and an
	inconsolable widow to deplore his
	loss.

Sir Williams keels over dead.

INT.  CHURCH - DAY

The wedding of Roderick and the Countess.  The service is
preformed by Reverend Hunt, her ladyship's chaplain.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	A year from that day, on the
	fifteenth of May, in the year 1773,
	I had the honor and happiness to
	lead to the altar Victoria, Countess
	of Cosgrove, widow of the late Right
	Honorable Sir William Cosgrove, K.B.
	I had procured His Majesty's
	gracious permission to add the name
	of my lovely lady to my own, and,
	henceforward, assumed the title of
	James Cosgrove.

EXT.  A GARDEN - LONDON - DAY

The Wedding reception.

Roderick and the Countess are approached by young Lord
Brookside, aged 12.

			COUNTESS
	My Lord Brookside, come and embrace
	your papa!

Brookside walks slowly towards them, and shakes his fist
in Roderick's face.

			BROOKSIDE
	He, my father!  I would as soon call
	one of your ladyship's footmen,
	papa!

Roderick laughs, as the Countess unsuccessfully tries to
get the boy to shake hands.

			COUNTESS
	Lord Brookside, you have offended
	your father.

			BROOKSIDE
	Mother, you have offended my father.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	It was a declaration of war to me,
	as I saw at once; though I declare I
	was willing enough to have lived
	with him on terms of friendliness.
	But as men serve me, I serve them.
	Who can blame me for my after-
	quarrels with this young reprobate,
	or lay upon my shoulders the evils
	which afterwards befell?

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Three carriages, each with four horses, proceed along the
picturesque track.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	After we had received the
	congratulations of our friends in
	London -- I and Victoria set off to
	visit our country estate, Castle
	Hackton, where I had never as yet
	set foot.

INT.  CARRIAGE - DAY

Roderick and his Lady.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The first days of a marriage are
	commonly very trying; and I have
	known couples, who lived together
	like turtle-doves for the rest of
	their lives, peck each other's eyes
	out almost during the honeymoon.  I
	did not escape the common lot.  In
	our journey westwards, my Lady
	Cosgrove chose to quarrel with me
	because I had pulled out a pipe of
	tobacco.  Lady Cosgrove was a
	haughty woman, and I hate pride, and
	I promise you that, in this instant,
	I overcame this vice in her.

Roderick blows smoke into the Countess' face.  She is
shocked into an apprehensive silence.

INT.  COACH - DAY

Young Lord Brookside with his governor, glowering and
petulant.  A parrot, in a cage, on his lap.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

As the carriages drive past, there is a band, floral
arches, flags, church bells ringing.  The parson and the
farmers assemble in their best by the roadside, and the
school-children and the laboring people are loud in their
"hurrahs" for her ladyship.

Roderick flings pennies among the cheering tenants, from
two bags of coppers, stored in the carriage for the
occasion.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Fifty, or so, servants have turned out to greet their
mistress, and their new master.  The land steward, who is
the senior servant, introduces the others -- the clerk of
the kitchen, clerk of the stables, head gardener, ladies
in waiting, butler, valet, chef, cook.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had not arrived at the pitch of
	prosperity, and having, at thirty
	years of age, by my own merits and
	energy, raised myself to one of the
	highest social positions that any
	man in England could occupy, I
	determined to enjoy myself as
	becomes a man of quality for the
	remainder of my life.

INT.  STABLES - DAY

Roderick and his beautiful horses.

EXT.  A STREAM - DAY

Roderick and some companions fishing.

EXT.  FIELDS - DAY

Roderick and his friends riding.

EXT.  FIELDS - DAY

Roderick and friends shooting.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick having his portrait painted by a miniaturist.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But it was not meant for me to
	finish my life as a man of quality
	and position.  Indeed, I am one of
	those born clever enough at gaining
	a fortune, but incapable of keeping
	one; for the qualities and energy,
	which lead a man to accept the
	first, are often the very causes of
	his ruin in the latter case; indeed,
	I know of no other reason for the
	misfortunes which finally befell me.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - COUNTESS' BEDROOM - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	At the end of the year, Lady
	Cosgrove presented me with a son;
	Patrick Cosgrove, I called him, in
	compliment to my royal ancestry, but
	what more had I to leave him than a
	noble name?

EXT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - LONDON - DAY

Two coaches pull up, and the Countess and Roderick exit.
Servants remove their luggage and baby Patrick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	We spent the season in London at our
	house in Berkeley Square.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

The Countess alone and depressed.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Her ladyship and I lived, for a
	while, pretty separate when in
	London.  She preferred quiet, or, to
	say the truth, I preferred it, being
	a great friend to a modest, tranquil
	behavior in woman and a taste for
	the domestic pleasures.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - LONDON - DAY

Several cuts of the Countess, caring for the infant,
Patrick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Besides, she was a mother, and had
	great comfort in the dressing,
	educating, and dandling of our
	little Patrick for whose sake it was
	fit that she should give up the
	pleasures and frivolities of the
	world; so she left that part of the
	duty of every family of distinction
	to be performed by me.

INT.  THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT

Roderick arriving with a party of friends, escorting a
beautiful woman.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - LONDON - DAY

Live dialogue under voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Her ladyship's conversations with me
	were characterized by a stupid
	despair, or a silly blundering
	attempt at forced cheerfulness,
	still more disagreeable; hence, our
	intercourse was but trifling, and my
	temptations to carry her into the
	world or to remain in her society of
	necessity exceedingly small.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - LONDON - NIGHT

A drunken Roderick rudely demands his lady to entertain
their guests.  She rushes from the room in tears.
Dialogue starts scene, goes under for voice over, then
ends scene.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She would try my temper, at home,
	too, in a thousand ways.  When
	requested by me to entertain the
	company with conversation, wit, and
	learning, of which she was a
	mistress; or music, of which she was
	an accomplished performer, she
	would, as often as not, begin to
	cry, and leave the room.  My company
	from this, of course, fancied I was
	a tyrant over her; whereas, I was
	only a severe and careful guardian
	of a silly, bad-tempered and weak-
	minded lady.

EXT.  PARK - DAY

Roderick strolling arm-in-arm with his Countess.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Despite the utter distaste with
	which I now regarded Lady Cosgrove,
	and, although I took no particular
	pains to disguise my feelings in
	general, yet she was of such a mean
	spirit that she pursued me with her
	regard, and would kindle up at the
	smallest kind word I spoke to her.

INT.  COSGROVE STUDY - DAY

Roderick and accountant.  Her ladyship is signing various
documents, and orders for payment.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And, in these fits of love, she was
	the most easy creature in the world
	to be persuaded, and would have
	signed away her whole property, had
	it been possible.  And, I must
	confess, it was with very little
	attention on my part that I could
	bring her into good humor, and, up
	to the very last day of our being
	together, would be reconciled to me,
	and fondle me, if I addressed her a
	single kind word.  Such is female
	inconsistency.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DAY

Roderick and the Countess fighting about her refusal to
sign some papers.  Live dialogue under voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She was luckily very fond of her
	youngest son, and through him I had
	a wholesome and effectual hold on
	her; for if in any of her tantrums
	or fits of haughtiness, she
	pretended to have the upper-hand, to
	assert her authority against mine,
	to refuse to sign such papers as I
	might think necessary for the
	distribution of our large and
	complicated property.

Roderick picks up baby Patrick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I would have Master Patrick carried
	off to Chiswick for a couple of
	days; and I warrant me his lady-
	mother could hold out no longer and
	would agree to anything I proposed.

The Countess rushes to the window to see the child being
put into a carriage.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DAY

Another quarrel.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Lady Cosgrove and I did not quarrel
	more than fashionable people do, and,
	for the first three years, I never
	struck my wife but when I was in
	liquor.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DAY

Roderick throws a knife at young Brookside.  The knife
digs into an expensive antique chest, just missing the
young Brookside's head.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	When I flung the carving-knife at
	Brookside, I was drunk, as
	everybody present can testify, but
	as for having any systematic scheme
	against the poor lad, I can declare
	solemnly that, beyond merely hating
	him, I am guilty of no evil towards
	him.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DAY

The Countess discovers Roderick making love to the child's
nurse.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Do what one would to please her, my
	lady would never be happy or in good
	humor.  And soon she added a mean,
	detestable jealousy to all her other
	faults, and would weep and wring her
	hands, and threaten to commit
	suicide, and I know not what.

She screams and shouts something about suicide.

Her son, Brookside, comes running in and consoles her.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Her death would have been no comfort
	to me, as I leave any person of
	common prudence to imagine; for that
	scoundrel of a young Brookside who
	was about to become my greatest
	plague and annoyance, would have
	inherited every penny of the
	property.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - LONDON - RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY

Roderick, bored and distracted, sits before a stack of
bills and papers, with his accountant.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Humble people envy us great men, and
	fancy that our lives are all
	pleasure.  But the troubles of
	poverty, the rascality of agents,
	the quibbles of lawyers are endless.
	My life at this period seemed to
	consist of nothing but drafts of
	letters and money-brokers relative
	to the raising of money, and the
	insuring of Lady Cosgrove's life,
	and innumerable correspondence with
	upholsterers, decorators, cooks,
	horsekeepers, bailiffs, and
	stewards.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDENS - DAY

Various cuts.

Birthday fete for Patrick who is now five years old.

Gaily colored tents, ponies, a puppet show, expensive
presents.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My own dear boy, Patrick, was now
	five years old, and was the most
	polite and engaging child ever seen;
	it was a pleasure to treat him with
	kindness and distinction; the little
	fellow was the pink of fashion,
	beauty, and good breeding.  In fact,
	he could not have been otherwise,
	with the care both his parents
	bestowed upon him, and the
	attentions which were lavished upon
	him in every way.

Brookside and Roderick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Whereas, young Brookside had grown
	to be a very nasty and disrespectful
	fellow indeed.  In my company, he
	preserved the most rigid silence,
	and a haughty, scornful demeanor,
	which was so much the more
	disagreeable because there was
	nothing in his behavior I could
	actually take hold of to find fault
	with, although his whole conduct was
	insolent and supercilious to the
	highest degree.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - LIBRARY - DAY

Brookside sitting alone reading a book.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	In addition to this, the lad was
	fond of spending the chief part of
	his time occupied with the musty old
	books, which he took out of the
	library, and which I hate to see a
	young man of spirit pouring over.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Brookside and the Countess.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The insubordination of that boy was
	dreadful.  He used to quote passages
	of "Hamlet" to his mother, which
	made her very angry.

Brookside quoting "Hamlet."

The Countess begins to cry and leaves the room.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S STUDY

Roderick caning young Brookside.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	As it is best to nip vice in the
	bud, and for a master of a family to
	exercise his authority in such a
	manner as that there may be no
	question about it, I took every
	opportunity of coming to close
	quarters with Master Brookside.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Many guests around the table.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	He always chose the days when
	company, or the clergy, or gentry of
	the neighborhood were present, to
	make violent, sarcastic, and
	insolent speeches.

Brookside begins to fondle and caress Patrick.

			BROOKSIDE
	Dear child, what a pity it is I am
	not dead for your sake!  The
	Cosgroves would then have a worthy
	representative, and enjoy all the
	benefits of the illustrious blood of
	the James' of Duganstown, would they
	not, Mr. James Cosgrove?

INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - NIGHT

Roderick caning Brookside again.  The boy bears the
punishment without crying.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick's reunion with his mother.

Present are the Countess, Patrick, Lord Brookside and
others.

Mrs. James flings herself into her son's arms with a
scream, and with transports of joy, which can only be
comprehended by women who have held, in their arms, an
only child, after a twelve-year absence from him.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick and mother feeding Patrick.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDEN - DAY

Roderick and mother playing with Patrick in the garden.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Mother at dinner with the family, in a strained
atmosphere.

INT.  PATRICK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Roderick and his mother talk in whispers near the bed of
the sleeping Patrick.

			MOTHER
	Ah, Roderick, it's a blessing to see
	that my darling boy has attained a
	position I always knew was his due,
	and for which I pinched myself to
	educate him.  Little Patrick is a
	darling boy, and you live in great
	splendor, but how long will it last?
	Your lady-wife knows she has a
	treasure she couldn't have had, had
	she taken a duke to marry her, but
	if, one day, she should tire of my
	wild Roderick and his old-fashioned
	Irish ways, or if she should die,
	what future would there be for my
	son and grandson?

INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - CASTLE HACKTON - NIGHT

Roderick and his mother.

			MOTHER
	You have not a penny of your own,
	and cannot transact any business
	without the Countess' signature.
	Upon her death, the entire estate
	would go to young Brookside, who
	bears you little affection.  You
	could be penniless tomorrow, and
	darling Patrick at the mercy of his
	stepbrother.

INT.  MOTHER'S ROOM - CASTLE HACKTON - NIGHT

Roderick and his mother.

			MOTHER
	I shall tell you a secret -- I shall
	not rest until I see you Earl of
	Duganstown, and my grandson, a Lord
	Viscount.

She smooths down Roderick's hair.

			MOTHER
	This head would become a coronet.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDEN - DAY

Roderick and Mother slowly walking and talking.  Young
Patrick, ahead of them sitting in a small cart, pulled by
a lamb.

			MOTHER
	These things entail considerable
	expense, and you will need your
	lady's blessing, but the young boy
	forms the great bond of union
	between you and her ladyship, and
	there is no plan of ambition you
	could propose in which she would not
	join for the poor lad's benefit, and
	no expense she will not eagerly
	incur, if it might be any means be
	shown to tend to his advancement.
	You have important friends, and they
	can tell you how these things are
	done.

INT.  LONDON GAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Standing away from the play tables, Roderick chats with
Lord West, a fat giant of a man.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And, to be sure, I did know someone
	who knew precisely how these things
	were done, and this was the
	distinguished solicitor and former
	Government Minister, Lord West,
	whose acquaintance I made, as I had
	so many others, at the gaming table.

			LORD WEST
	Do you happen to know Gustavus
	Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of
	Crabs?

			RODERICK
	By name only.

			LORD WEST
	Well, sir, this nobleman is one of
	the gentlemen of His Majesty's
	closet, and one with whom our
	revered monarch is on terms of
	considerable intimacy.  I should say
	you would be wise to fix upon this
	nobleman your chief reliance for the
	advancement of your claim to the
	Viscounty which you propose to get.

INT.  LONDON CLUB - DAY

Roderick having lunch with Lord West and the Earl of
Crabs.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And for a five-hundred guinea fee,
	paid to his City law-firm, Lord West
	kindly arranged a meeting with that
	old scamp and swindler, Gustavus
	Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of
	Crabs.

			EARL OF CRABS
	Mr. Cosgrove, when I take up a
	person, he or she is safe.  There is
	no question about them any more.  My
	friends are the best people.  I
	don't mean the most virtuous, or,
	indeed, the least virtuous, or the
	cleverest, or the stupidest, or the
	richest, or the best born, but the
	"best" -- in a word, people about
	whom there is no question.  I cannot
	promise you how long it will take.
	You can appreciate it is not an easy
	matter.  But any gentlemen with an
	estate, and ten-thousand a-year
	should have a peerage.

INT.  DRAWING ROOM - EARL OF CRABS - DAY

Roderick being introduced to three noblemen, including the
Duke of Rutland.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The striving after this peerage, I
	consider to have been one of the
	most unlucky dealings at this
	period.  I made unheard of
	sacrifices to bring it about.  I can
	tell you bribes were administered,
	and in high places too -- so near
	the royal person of His Majesty that
	you would be astonished were I to
	mention what great personages
	condescended to receive our loans.

INT.  DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick gives a beautiful diamond to a fat princess on
her birthday.  He is applauded by the other guests.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I lavished money here, and diamonds
	there.

EXT.  FARMLAND - DAY

Roderick and the seller, riding over a prospective
property.  A broker shows them a survey map of the
property.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I bought lands at ten times there
	value.

INT.  SALON - LONDON - NIGHT

A musical evening.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I gave repeated entertainments to
	those friends to my claims who,
	being about the royal person, were
	likely to advance it.

INT.  STATELY HOME - DAY

Roderick buying pictures.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I purchased pictures and articles of
	vertu at ruinous prices.

EXT.  RACES - DAY

Roderick laughing and paying a bet.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I lost many a bet to the royal
	dukes, His Majesty's brothers.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

Reviewing the company of troops.

Roderick, the Earl of Crabs, the Countess, Patrick and
Brookside, several princes and noblemen and the Duke of
Rutland.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	One of the main causes of expense
	which this ambition of mine entailed
	upon me was the fitting out and
	arming of a company of infantry from
	the Hackton estates, which I offered
	to my gracious sovereign for the
	campaign against the American
	rebels.  These troops, superbly
	equipped and clothed, were embarked
	at Portsmouth in the year 1778.

INT.  ST. JAMES - RECEPTION ROOM - DAY

George III meeting people and stopping to talk to
Roderick.  Present also is the Duke of Rutland.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And the patriotism of the gentlemen
	who raised them was so acceptable at
	court that, on being presented by my
	Lord Crabs, His Majesty condescended
	to notice me particularly and said:

			GEORGE III
	That's right, Mr. Cosgrove, raise
	another company, and go with them,
	too!

INT.  COFFEE HOUSE - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Crabs was really one of the most
	entertaining fellows in the world,
	and I took a sincere pleasure in his
	company, besides the interest and
	desire I had in cultivating the
	society of the most important
	personages of the realm.

Roderick clumsily tries to engage in conversation with the
famed Dr. Johnson, on the subject of a book or play, of
the day, and is rebuffed for his trouble.

			JOHNSON
	If I were you, Mr. Cosgrove, I
	should mind my horses and tailors
	and not trouble myself about
	letters.

Laughter, Roderick bristles.

			RODERICK
	Dr. Johnson, I think you misbehave
	most grossly, treating my opinions
	with no more respect than those of a
	schoolboy.  You fancy, sir, you know
	a great deal more than me, because
	you quote your "Aristotle" and
	"Plato," but can you tell me which
	horse will win at Epsom Downs next
	week?  Can you shoot the ace of
	spades ten times without missing?
	If so, talk about Aristotle and
	Plato with me.

			BOSWELL
		   (roars)
	Do you know who you're speaking to?!

			JOHNSON
	Hold your tongue, Mr. Boswell, I had
	no right to brag of my Greek,
	gentlemen, and he has answered me
	very well.

			RODERICK
		   (pleased)
	Do you know ever a rhyme for
	Aristotle?

			GOLDSMITH
		   (laughing)
	Port, if you please.

			JOHNSON
	Waiter, bring on of Captain James'
	rhymes for Aristotle.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And we had six rhymes for Aristotle
	before we left the coffee house that
	evening.

INT.  LONDON CLUB - NIGHT

			EARL OF CRABS
	Henri, this is Mr. James Cosgrove,
	who wishes to arrange a dinner party
	next week for sixty guests.

			HENRI
	I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove.
	How much do you wish to spend?

			RODERICK
	As much as possible.

			HENRI
	As much as possible?

			RODERICK
	Yes, for I wish to entertain
	splendidly.

			HENRI
	All the same, you must name an
	amount.

			RODERICK
	It is entirely up to you.  I want
	the best.

			EARL OF CRABS
	May I suggest five hundred guineas?

			RODERICK
	Will that be enough?

			HENRI
	Last month, the Duke of Suffolk
	spent no more.

			RODERICK
	All right, five hundred guineas.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY

Roderick is seated at a large table, stacked high with
bills and letters; his accountant is seated next to him,
aided by a bookkeeper.  Roderick looks at each bill and
his accountant explains the charge.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The life I was leading was that of a
	happy man, but I was not happy.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - LONG GALLERY - DAY

Roderick, walking with big strides, leads Brookside by his
ear.  Little Patrick runs alongside, pleading for his
brother.

			PATRICK
	Papa, please don't flog Brookside
	today.  It wasn't his fault --
	really is wasn't.

Roderick ignores him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	By now, young Brookside was of so
	wild, savage, and insubordinate a
	nature that I never had the least
	regard for him.  As he grew up to be
	a man, his hatred for me assumed an
	intensity quite wicked to think of
	and which, I promise you, I returned
	with interest.

He drags Brookside into his study, slamming the door
behind him.

INT.  LIBRARY - DAY

Roderick alone.  Brookside enters with a pistol.

			BROOKSIDE
		   (grinding his teeth)
	Look you now, Mister Roderick James,
	from this moment on, I will submit
	to no further chastisement from you!
	Do you understand that?

			RODERICK
	Give me that pistol.

			BROOKSIDE
	Take heed, Mister James.  I will
	shoot you if you lay hands on me
	now, or ever again.  Is that
	entirely clear to you, sir?

Roderick stares hard at him, then he laughs and sits down.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I decided, at once, to give up that
	necessary part of his education.
	In truth, he then became the most
	violent, daring, disobedient,
	scapegrace, that ever caused an
	affectionate parent pain; he was
	certainly the most incorrigible.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - BROOKSIDE'S ROOM - DAY

Brookside smashing a chair over the head of his governor,
Reverend Hunt.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Twice or thrice, Reverend Hunt
	attempted to punish my Lord
	Brookside; but I promise you the
	rogue was too strong for him, and
	leveled the Oxford man to the
	ground with a chair, greatly to the
	delight of little Patrick, who cried
	out:  "Bravo, Brooksy!  Thump him,
	thump him!"

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDEN - DAY

Brookside and Patrick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	With the child, Brookside was,
	strange to say, pretty tractable.
	He took a liking to the little
	fellow -- I like him the more, he
	said, because he was "half a
	Cosgrove."

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - BALLROOM - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Another day, it was Patrick's
	birthday, we were giving a grand
	ball and gala at Hackton, and it was
	time for my Patrick to make his
	appearance among us.

There is a great crowding and tittering as the child comes
in, led by his half-brother, who walks into the dancing-
room in his stockinged feet, leading little Patrick by the
hand, paddling about in the great shoes of the older.

			BROOKSIDE
		   (very loudly)
	Don't you think he fits my shoes
	very well, Sir Richard Wargrave?

Upon which, the company begins to look at each other and
to titter, and his mother comes up to Lord Brookside with
great dignity, seizes the child to her breast, and says:

			COUNTESS
	From the manner in which I love this
	child, my lord, you ought to know
	how I would have loved his elder
	brother, had he proved worthy of any
	mother's affection.

Brookside is stunned by his mother's words.

			BROOKSIDE
	Madam, I have borne as long as
	mortal could endure the ill-
	treatment of the insolent Irish
	upstart, whom you have taken into
	your bed.  It is not only the
	lowness of his birth, and the
	general brutality of his manners
	which disgusts me, but the shameful
	nature of his conduct towards your
	ladyship, his brutal and
	ungentlemanlike behavior, his open
	infidelity, his habits of
	extravagance, intoxication, his
	shameless robberies and swindling of
	my property and yours.  It is these
	insults to you which shock and annoy
	me more than the ruffian's infamous
	conduct to myself.  I would have
	stood by your ladyship, as I
	promised, but you seem to have taken
	latterly your husband's part; and,
	as I cannot personally chastise this
	low-bred ruffian, who, to our shame
	be it spoken, is the husband of my
	mother, and as I cannot bear to
	witness his treatment of you, and
	loathe his horrible society as if it
	were the plague, I am determined to
	quit my native country, at least
	during his detested life, or during
	my own.

Bursting into tears, Lady Cosgrove leaves the room.
Roderick loses control, and rushes at Brookside, knocking
down Lords, Dukes and Generals, left and right, who try to
interfere.

The company is scandalizes by the entire incident.

INT.  LONDON CLUB - NIGHT

Action as per voice over.  Roderick is shunned.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	If I had murdered my lord, I could
	scarcely have been received with
	more shameful obloquy and slander
	than now followed me in town and
	country.  My friends fell away from
	me, and a legend arose of my cruelty
	to my stepson.

INT.  ST. JAMES - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My reception at court was scarcely
	more cordial.  On paying my respects
	to my sovereign at St. James, His
	Majesty pointedly asked me when I
	had news of Lord Brookside.  On
	which I replied, with no ordinary
	presence of mind:

			RODERICK
	Sire, my Lord Brookside has set sail
	to fight the rebels against Your
	Majesty's crown in America.  Does
	Your Majesty desire that I should
	send another company to aid him?

The King stares at Roderick, turns on his heel and quickly
leaves the presence-chamber.

Roderick is approached by the Duke of Rutland, who takes
him aside into an alcove.

			DUKE OF RUTLAND
		   (speaking very
		    quietly)
	Let me tell you, sir, that your
	conduct has been very odiously
	represented to the King, and has
	formed the subject of royal comment.
	The King has said, influenced by
	these representations, that you are
	the most disreputable man in the
	three kingdoms, and a dishonor to
	your name and country.

Roderick begins to sputter.

			DUKE OF RUTLAND
	Hear me out, please.  It has been
	intimated to His Majesty that you
	had raised the American Company for
	the sole purpose of getting the
	young Viscount to command it, and so
	get rid of him.  And, further, that
	you had paid the very man in the
	company, who was ordered to dispatch
	him in the first general action.

			RODERICK
	Thus it is that my loyalty is
	rewarded, and my sacrifices in favor
	of my country viewed!

			DUKE OF RUTLAND
	As for your ambitious hopes
	regarding the Irish peerages, His
	Majesty has also let it be known
	that you have been led astray by
	that Lord Crabs, who likes to take
	money, but who has no more influence
	to get a coronet than to procure a
	Pope's tiara.  And, if you have it
	in mind to call upon Lord Crabs, you
	will be disappointed.  He left for
	the continent on Tuesday, and may be
	away for several months.

INT.  LORD WEST'S OFFICE - DAY

Roderick and Lord West.

			RODERICK
	I insist upon being allowed to
	appear before His Majesty and clear
	myself of the imputations against
	me, to point out my services to the
	government, and to ask when the
	reward, that had been promised me,
	the title held by my ancestors, is
	again to be revived in my person.

There is a sleepy coolness in the fat Lord West.  He hears
Roderick with half-shut eyes.  When he finishes his
violent speech, which he has made striding about the room,
Lord West opens one eye, smiles, and says:   

			LORD WEST
		   (gently)
	Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?

			RODERICK
	Yes!

			LORD WEST
	Well, Mr. Cosgrove, I'll answer you
	point by point.  The King is
	exceedingly averse to make peers, as
	you know.  Your claim, as you call
	them, have been laid before him, and
	His Majesty's gracious reply was,
	that you were the most impudent man
	in his dominions, and merited a
	halter, rather than a coronet.  As
	for withdrawing your support from
	us, you are perfectly welcome to
	carry yourself whithersoever you
	please.  And, now, as I have a great
	deal of occupation, perhaps you will
	do me the favor to retire, or tell
	me if there is anything else in the
	world in which I can oblige you.

So saying, Lord West raises his hand lazily to the bell,
and bows Roderick out.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY

Roderick and his accountant going over the bills which he
has heaped on the table.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The news of His Majesty's disregard
	were not long in getting around,
	and, in a very short time, all the
	bills came down upon me together --
	all the bills I had been contracting
	for the years of my marriage.  I
	won't cite their amount; it was
	frightful.  I was bound up in an
	inextricable toil of bills and
	debts, or mortgages and insurances,
	and all the horrible evils attendant
	upon them.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GROUNDS - DAY

Roderick walking alone.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Was it my own want of style, or my
	want of a fortune?  I know not.  Now
	I was arrived at the height of my
	ambition, but both my skill and my
	luck seemed to be deserting me.
	Everything I touched, crumbled in my
	hands; every speculation I had,
	failed; every agent I trusted,
	deceived me.  My income was saddled
	with hundreds of annuities, and
	thousands of lawyers' charges, and I
	felt the net drawing closer and
	closer around me, and no means to
	extricate myself from its toils.
	All my schemes had turned out
	failures.

INT.  LONDON GAMING CLUB - NIGHT

Roderick at the gaming table.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My wife's moody despondency made my
	house and home not over-pleasant;
	hence, I was driven a good deal
	abroad, where as play was the
	fashion in every club, tavern, and
	assembly, I, of course, was obliged
	to resume my old habit, and to
	commence as an amateur those games
	at which I was once unrivaled in
	Europe.

Roderick loses a large amount of money.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had a run of ill-luck at play, and
	was forced to meet my losses by the
	most shameful sacrifices to the
	money-lenders, and was compelled to
	borrow largely upon my wife's
	annuities, ensuring her ladyship's
	life, which was the condition for
	every loan against her property.

INT.  LONDON OFFICE - INSURANCE BROKER - DAY

Roderick and the broker.

			BROKER
	Your wife's life is as well known
	among the insurance societies in
	London, as any woman in Christendom,
	and, I'm sorry to say there is not
	one of them willing to place another
	policy against her ladyship's life.
	One of them even had the impudence
	to suggest that your treatment of
	the Countess did not render her life
	worth a year's purchase.

EXT.  STUD FARM - DAY

Roderick buying a horse.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	In the midst of my difficulties, I
	promised to buy a little horse for
	my dear little Patrick, which was to
	be a present for his eighth
	birthday, that was now coming on.  I
	may have had my faults, but no man
	shall dare to say of me that I was
	not a good and tender father.

Roderick admires the horse.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	It was a beautiful little animal,
	and stood me in a good sum.  I never
	regarded money for that dear child.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

The horse kicks off one of the horse-boys who tries to
ride him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But the horse was a bit wild, and he
	kicked off one of the horse-boys who
	rode him at first, and broke the
	lad's leg.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Roderick riding the horse.  The horse-boy lies in the back
of a wagon.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But he was a beautiful animal and
	would make a fine horse for Patrick
	after he had a bit of breaking-in.

EXT.  ROAD - NEAR CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick dismounts and gives the horse to one of the
horse-boys.

			RODERICK
	Timmy, take the injured lad to see
	the doctor, and then bring the horse
	to Doolan's farm, and tell him to
	break him in thoroughly.  Tell him
	it's for little Patrick, and that
	I'll be over to see him next week.

			HORSE-BOY
	Yes, sir.

			RODERICK
	One more thing, and listen well, I
	don't want little Patrick to know
	where the horse is being kept.  It's
	going to be surprise for his
	birthday.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Patrick rushes out to greet his father.

			PATRICK
	Hello, papa!

Roderick picks him up in his arms, and kisses him.

			PATRICK
	Did you buy the horse, papa?

			RODERICK
	Now, just have a little patience, my
	boy.  Your birthday isn't until next
	week.

			PATRICK
	But I will have it on my birthday,
	won't I?

			RODERICK
	Well, we'll just have to wait and
	see, won't we?

He walks up the steps holding Patrick, who hugs and kisses
him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My son, little Patrick Cosgrove, was
	a prince; his breeding and manners,
	even at his early age, showed him to
	be worthy of the two noble families
	from whom he was descended, and I
	don't know what high hopes I had for
	the boy, and indulged in a thousand
	fond anticipations as to his future
	success and figure in the world, but
	stern Fate had determined that I
	should leave none of my race behind
	me.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick is drunk.  Patrick is brought in by his governor,
Hunt, to say good night.  His kisses his mother first,
then approaches Roderick.

			PATRICK
		   (kissing him)
	Good night, papa.

			RODERICK
	Good night, my little darling.

			PATRICK
	Papa?

			RODERICK
	Yes?

			PATRICK
	One of the boys in the stable told
	Nelly that you've already bought my
	horse, and that it's at Doolan's
	farm, where Mick the groom is
	breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?

			RODERICK
		   (angered)
	What the devil?  What kind of fools
	do we have here?  Pottle, who told
	the lad this story?

			HUNT
	I don't know, sir.

			PATRICK
	Then it's true!  It's true!  Oh,
	thank you, papa!  Thank you!

He hugs his father.

			COUNTESS
	Promise me, Patrick, that you will
	not ride the horse except in the
	company of your father.

			PATRICK
		   (unconvincingly)
	I promise, mama.

			RODERICK
	I promise your lordship a good
	flogging if you even so much as go
	to Doolan's farm to see him.

			PATRICK
	Yes, papa.

INT.  RODERICK'S BEDROOM - DAY

Roderick is awakened by his valet and Hunt, the governor.

			RODERICK
	Yes...?

			VALET
	I'm sorry to disturb you, sir, but
	Mr. Hunt has something important to
	tell you.

			RODERICK
	Yes?

			HUNT
	I think Master Patrick has disobeyed
	your orders and stolen off to
	Doolan's farm.  When I went to the
	lad's room this morning, his bed was
	empty.  One of the cooks said she
	saw him go away before daybreak.  He
	must have slipped through my room
	while I was asleep.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - STABLES - DAY

Roderick, in a rage, taking a great horse-whip, gallops
off after the child.

EXT.  ROAD - CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick comes upon a sad procession of farmers, moaning
and howling, the black horse led by the hand, and, on a
door that some of them carry, little Patrick.  He lies in
his little boots and spurs, and his little coat of scarlet
and gold.  His face is quite white, and he smiles as he
holds a hand out to Roderick and says painfully:

			PATRICK
	You won't whip me, will you, papa?

Roderick bursts out into tears in reply.

INT.  PATRICK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Some doctors around the bed, Roderick and the Countess
anxiously waiting upon them.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The doctors were called, but what
	does a doctor avail in a contest
	with the grim, invincible enemy?
	Such as came could only confirm our
	despair by their account of the poor
	child's case.  His spine was
	injured, the lower half of him was
	dead when they laid him in bed at
	home.  The rest did not last long,
	God help me!  He remained yet for
	two days with us, and a sad comfort
	it was to think he was in no pain.

INT.  PATRICK'S BEDROOM - DAY

Roderick, Countess and Patrick.

			PATRICK
		   (weakly)
	Papa, I beg you and mama to pardon
	me for any acts of disobedience I
	have been guilty of towards you.

			COUNTESS
		   (weeping)
	Oh, my little angel, you have done
	nothing for which you need pardon.

			PATRICK
	Where is Brooksy?  I would like to
	see him.

			RODERICK
	Your bother is in America fighting
	the rebels.

			PATRICK
	Is he all right, papa?

			RODERICK
	Yes, he's fine.

			PATRICK
	Brooksy was better than you, papa,
	he used not to swear so, and he
	taught me many good things while you
	were away.

Patrick takes a hand of his mother and of Roderick, in
each of his little clammy ones.

			PATRICK
	I beg you not to quarrel so, but to
	love each other, so that we might
	meet again in heaven where Brooksy
	told me quarrelsome people never go.

His mother is much affected by these admonitions, and
Roderick is too.

Patrick gives Roderick a ring from his finger, and a
locket to his mother.

He says that these gifts are so that they will not forget
him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	At last, after two days, he died.
	There he lay, the hope of my family,
	the pride of my manhood, the link
	which kept me and my Lady Cosgrove
	together.

EXT.  CHURCH - GRAVEYARD - DAY

Funeral.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I won't tell you with what splendor
	we buried him, but what avail are
	undertakers' feathers and heralds'
	trumpery.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - STABLE - DAY

Roderick enters the stable and, after a few seconds, we
hear a pistol shot.  He exits rapidly, the smoking pistol
still in his hand.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - VARIOUS - DAY AND NIGHT

The Countess:  Praying.  Waking up screaming.  Fits of
crying.  Severely depressed.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Lady Cosgrove, always vaporish and
	nervous, after our blessed boy's
	catastrophe, became more agitated
	than ever, and plunged into devotion
	with so much fervor that you would
	have fancied her almost distracted
	at times.

Countess sees visions.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She imagined she saw visions.  She
	said an angel from heaven told her
	that Patrick's death was a
	punishment to her for her neglect of
	her firstborn.  Then she would
	declare that Brookside was dead.

INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY

Roderick and his accountant.  Bills, bills, bills.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	By now, my financial affairs were
	near to ruin.  I could not get a
	guinea from any money-dealer in
	London.  Our rents were in the hands
	of receivers by this time, and it
	was as much as I could do to get
	enough money from the rascals to pay
	my wine-merchants their bills.  Our
	property was hampered, and often as
	I applied to my lawyers and agents
	for money, would come a reply
	demanding money of me for debts and
	pretended claims which the rapacious
	rascals said they had on me.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Mother arrives.  Roderick greets her.  Servants unload her
bags.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My mother was the only person who,
	in my misfortune, remained faithful
	to me -- indeed, she has always
	spoken of me in my true light, as a
	martyr to the rascality of others,
	and a victim of my own generous and
	confiding temper.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Mother supervising kitchen staff.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She was an invaluable person to me
	in my house, which would have been
	at rack and ruin before, but for her
	spirit of order and management and
	her excellent economy in the
	government of my rapidly dwindling
	household staff.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDEN - DAY

Roderick and his mother.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	If anything could have saved me from
	the consequences of villainy in
	others, it would have been the
	admirable prudence of that worthy
	creature.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT

Action as per voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She never went to bed until all the
	house was quiet and all the candles
	out; you may fancy that this was a
	matter of some difficulty with a man
	of my habits who had commonly a
	dozen of jovial fellows to drink
	with me every night, and who
	seldom, for my part, went to bed
	sober.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Actions as per voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Many and many a night, when I was
	unconscious of her attention, has
	that good soul pulled my boots off,
	and seen me laid by my servants snug
	in bed, and carried off the candle
	herself...

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S BEDROOM - DAY

Action as per voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	... and been the first in the
	morning, too, to bring me my drink
	of small beer.  It was my mother's
	pride that I could drink more than
	any man in the country.

INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - NIGHT

Roderick and his mother holding a letter before a fire,
which slowly brings out the writing in lemon juice between
the widely-spaced lines of directions to her milliner.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My mother discovered that always,
	before my lady-wife chose to write
	letters to her milliner, she had
	need of lemons to make her drink, as
	she said, and this fact, being
	mentioned to me, kind of set me
	a-thinking.

			RODERICK
		   (reading letter
		    aloud)
	"This day, three years ago, my last
	hope and pleasure in life was taken
	from me, and my dear child was
	called to Heaven.  Where is his
	neglected brother, whom I suffered
	to grow up unheeded by my side, and
	whom the tyranny of the monster to
	whom I am united drove to exile,
	and, perhaps to death?  I pray the
	child is still alive and safe.
	Charles Brookside!  Come to the aide
	of a wretched mother, who
	acknowledges her crime, her coldness
	towards you, and now bitterly pays
	for her error!  What sufferings,
	what humiliations have I had to
	endure!  I am a prisoner in my own
	halls.  I should fear poison, but
	then I know the wretch has a sordid
	interest in keeping me alive, and
	that my death would be the signal
	for his ruin.  But I dare not stir
	without my odious, hideous, vulgar
	gaoler, the horrid Irish woman, who
	purses my every step.  I am locked
	into my chamber at night, like a
	felon, and only suffered to leave it
	when ordered into the presence of my
	lord, to be present at his orgies
	with his boon-companions, and to
	hear his odious converse as he
	lapses into the disgusting madness
	of intoxication."

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick, and the Countess and mother, at a silent dinner.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	It was not possible to recover the
	name for whom the note was intended,
	but it was clear that, to add to all
	my perplexities, three years after
	my poor child's death, my wife,
	whose vagaries of temper and wayward
	follies I had borne with for twelve
	years, wanted to leave me.  I
	decided it best not to reveal to her
	ladyship our discovery, that we
	might still intercept and uncover
	further schemes with might be afoot.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - VARIOUS - DAY AND NIGHT

A few cuts showing Mother keeping an eye on the Countess.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Yet I was bound to be on my guard
	that she should not give me the
	slip.  Had she left me, I was ruined
	the next day.  I set my mother to
	keep sharp watch over the moods of
	her ladyship, and you may be sure
	that her assistance and surveillance
	were invaluable to me.  If I had
	paid twenty spies to watch her lady,
	I should not have been half so well
	served as by the disinterested care
	and watchfulness of my excellent
	mother.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDENS - DAY

Roderick walking with the Countess.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with
	me was a singular one.  Her life was
	passed in a series of crack-brained
	sort of alternation between love and
	hatred for me.  We would quarrel for
	a fortnight, then we should be
	friends for a month together
	sometimes.  One day, I was joking
	her, and asking her whether she
	would take the water again, whether
	she had found another lover, and so
	forth.  She suddenly burst out into
	tears, and, after a while, said to
	me:

			COUNTESS
	Roderick, you know well enough that
	I have never loved but you!  Was I
	ever so wretched that a kind word
	from you did not make me happy?
	Ever so angry, but the least offer
	of good-will on your part did not
	bring me to your side?  Did I not
	give a sufficient proof of my
	affection for you in bestowing one
	of the finest fortunes of England
	upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked
	you for the way you have wasted it?
	No, I loved you too much and too
	fondly; I have always loved you.
	From the first moment I saw you, I
	saw your bad qualities, and trembled
	at your violence; but I could not
	help loving you.  I married you,
	though I knew I was sealing my own
	fate in doing so, and in spite of
	reason and duty.  What sacrifice do
	you want from me?  I am ready to
	make any, so you will but love me,
	or, if not, that at least, you will
	gently us me.

Roderick kisses her.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I was in a particularly good humor
	that day, and we had a sort of
	reconciliation.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - NIGHT

Roderick and his mother.

			MOTHER
	Depend on it, artful hussy has some
	other scheme in her head now.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The old lady was right, and I
	swallowed the bait which her
	ladyship had prepared to entrap me
	as simply as any gudgeon takes a
	hook.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Arrival of Mr. Newcombe, the money-broker.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had hired a money-broker
	especially to find some means of my
	making a loan.  After several months
	without success, it was with some
	considerable interest that I
	received his visit.

INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY

Roderick and the money-broker, Mr. Newcombe.

			NEWCOMBE
	I have good news for you, Mr.
	Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle
	and Chatwick, in the city of London,
	are prepared to lend you 20,000
	pounds, pledged against your
	interest in the Edric mines.  They
	will redeem the encumbrances against
	the property, which amount to some
	10,000 pounds, and take a twenty-
	year working lease on the mines.
	They will lend you the 20,000 pounds
	against the lease income,
	which they will apply to the loan as
	it comes in, and they will make a
	charge of 18% per annum interest on
	the outstanding loan balance.

			RODERICK
	Mr. Newcombe, I have made some
	difficult loans during the past few
	years, at very onerous terms, but
	18% a year interest seems very stiff
	indeed.

			NEWCOMBE
	Considering your financial
	circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has
	been impossible to find anyone at
	all prepared to do any business with
	you.  I think you may count yourself
	lucky to have this opportunity.
	But, obviously, if you would reject
	this offer, I shall keep trying to
	find a better one.

			RODERICK
		   (after a pause)
	I am prepared to accept the terms,
	Mr. Newcombe.

			NEWCOMBE
	There are a few other points we
	should discuss.  The loan agreement
	can only be executed by her
	ladyship's signature, and provided
	that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be
	assured of her ladyship's freewill
	in giving her signature.

			RODERICK
	Provided that they can be assured of
	her ladyship's freewill?  Are you
	serious?

			NEWCOMBE
	May I be quite frank with you?

			RODERICK
	Yes, of course.

			NEWCOMBE
	Mister Bracegirdle said to me that
	he had heard her ladyship lives in
	some fear of her life, and meditated
	a separation, in which case, she
	might later repudiate any documents
	signed by herself while in durance,
	and subject them, at any rate, to a
	doubtful and expensive litigation.
	They were quite insistent on this
	point, and said they must have
	absolute assurance of her ladyship's
	perfect freewill in the transaction
	before they would advance a shilling
	of their capital.

			RODERICK
	I see.

			NEWCOMBE
	When I asked them in what form they
	would accept her ladyship's
	assurances, they said that they were
	only prepared to accept them if her
	ladyship confirms her written
	consent by word of mouth, in their
	presence, at their counting-house in
	Birchin Lane, London.  I requested
	they come here, and save her
	ladyship and yourself the
	inconvenience of the trip to London,
	but they declined, saying that they
	did not wish to incur the risk of a
	visit to Castle Hackton to
	negotiate, as they were aware of how
	other respectable parties, such as
	Messrs. Sharp and Salomon had been
	treated here.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick and his mother.

			MOTHER
	Depend on it, there is some
	artifice.  When once you get into
	that wicked town, you are not safe.
	There are scores of writs out
	against you for debt.  If you are
	taken in London, and thrown into
	prison, your case is hopeless.

			RODERICK
	Mother dear, we are now living off
	our own beef and mutton.  We have to
	watch Lady Cosgrove within and the
	bailiffs without.  There are certain
	situations in which people cannot
	dictate their own terms; and faith,
	we are so pressed now for money,
	that I would sign a bond with old
	Nick himself, if he would provide a
	good round sum.  With this money, we
	can settle our principal debts and
	make a fresh start.

			MOTHER
	Roderick, you must listen to me.  As
	soon as they have you in London,
	they will get the better of my poor
	innocent lad; and the first thing
	that I shall hear of you will be
	that you are in trouble.  You will
	be a victim of your own generous and
	confiding nature.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - COUNTESS' BEDROOM

Roderick and the Countess.

			COUNTESS
	Why go, Roderick?  I am happy here,
	as long as you are kind to me, as
	you now are.  We can't appear in
	London as we ought; the little money
	you will get will be spent, like all
	the rest has been.  Let us stay here
	and be content.

She takes his hand and kisses it.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Mother and Roderick.

			MOTHER
	Humph!  I believe she is at the
	bottom of it -- the wicked schemer.

EXT.  COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

Roderick's carriage moving along.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	We did not start in state, you may
	be sure.  We did not let the country
	know we were going, or leave notice
	of adieu with our neighbors.  The
	famous Mr. James Cosgrove and his
	noble wife traveled in a hack-
	chaise and pair.

INT.  COACH - DAY

The Countess lays her head on Roderick's shoulder and
smiles.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	When a man is going to the devil,
	how easy and pleasant a journey it
	is!  The thought of the money quite
	put me in a good humor, and my wife,
	as she lay on my shoulder in the
	post-chaise, going to London, said
	it was the happiest ride she had
	taken since our marriage.

EXT.  INN - DUSK

The carriage stops and they disembark.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	One night we stayed at Reading.

INT.  INN - NIGHT

Roderick and his wife at dinner.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My lady and I agreed that, with the
	money, we would go to France, and
	wait there for better times, and
	that night, over our supper, formed
	a score of plans both for pleasure
	and retrenchment.  You would have
	thought it was Darby and Joan
	together over their supper.

INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

Roderick and his wife making love.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	O woman!  Woman!  When I recollect
	Lady Cosgrove's smiles and
	blandishments, how happy she seemed
	to be on that night!  What an air of
	innocent confidence appeared in her
	behavior, and what affectionate
	names she called me!  I am lost in
	wonder at the depth of her
	hypocrisy.  Who can be surprised
	that an unsuspecting person like
	myself should have been a victim to
	such a consummate deceiver?

EXT.  GRAY'S INN OFFICE - DAY

The coach drives up.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	We were in London at three o'clock,
	an half-an-hour before the time
	appointed.

INT.  STAIRCASE - DAY

Roderick and the Countess looking for the office.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I easily found out Mr. Tapewell's
	apartment:  a gloomy den it was, and
	in an unlucky hour, I entered it.

They climb up dirty backstairs, lit by a feeble lamp, and
the dim sky of a dismal London afternoon.

The Countess seems agitated and faint.

When they get to the door, she stops in front of it.

			COUNTESS
	Roderick -- don't go in.  I am sure
	there is danger.  There's time yet,
	let us go back -- anywhere!

The Countess has put herself before the door in a
theatrical attitude and takes Roderick's hand.

He pushes her away to one side.

			RODERICK
	Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.

			COUNTESS
	Old fool!

She jumps at the bell, which is quickly answered by a
moldy-looking gentleman in an unpowered wig.

			COUNTESS
	Say Lady Cosgrove is here!

She stalks down the passage, muttering:  "Old Fool."

INT.  MR. TAPEWELL'S OFFICE - DAY

Tapewell is in his musty room, surrounded by his
parchments and tin boxes.

He advances and bows, begs her ladyship to be seated, and
points towards a chair for Roderick, which he takes,
rather wondering at the lawyer's insolence.

The lawyer retreats to a side-door, saying he will be back
in a moment.

In the next moment, he reenters, bringing with him another
layer, six constables in red waist-coats, with bludgeons
and pistols, and Lord Brookside.

Lady Cosgrove flings herself into the arms of her son,
crying and whimpering and calling him her savior, her
preserver, her gallant knight.

Then, turning to Roderick, she pours out a flood of
invective which quite astonishes him.

			COUNTESS
	Oh fool as I am, I have outwitted
	the most crafty and treacherous
	monster under the sun.  Yes, I was a
	fool when I married you, and gave up
	other and nobler hearts for your
	sake -- yes, I was a fool when I
	forgot my name and lineage to unite
	myself with a base-born adventurer
	-- a fool to bear, without repining,
	the most monstrous tyranny that ever
	woman suffered; to allow my property
	to be squandered; to see women as
	base and low-born as yourself...

			TAPEWELL
	For heaven's sake, be calm.

Tapewell bounds back behind the constables, seeing a
threatening look in Roderick's eye.

The Countess continues in a strain of incoherent fury,
screaming against Roderick, and against his mother, and
always beginning and ending the sentence with the word
"fool."

			RODERICK
	You didn't tell all, my lady -- I
	said "old" fool.

			BROOKSIDE
	I have no doubt that you said and
	did, sir, everything that a
	blackguard could say or do.  This
	lady is now safe under the
	protection of her relations and the
	law, and need fear your infamous
	persecutions no longer.

			RODERICK
	But you are not safe, and as sure as
	I am a man of honor, I will have
	your heart's blood.

			TAPEWELL
	Take down his words, constables;
	swear the peace against him.

			BROOKSIDE
	I would not sully my sword with the
	blood of such a ruffian.  If the
	scoundrel remains in London another
	day, he will be seized as a common
	swindler.

			RODERICK
	Where's the man who will seize me?

He draws his sword, placing his back to the door.

			RODERICK
	Let the scoundrel come!  You -- you
	cowardly braggart, come first, if
	you have the soul of a man!

The Countess and the bailiffs move away.

			TAPEWELL
	We are not going to seize you!  My
	dear sir, we don't wish to seize
	you; we will give you a handsome sum
	to leave the country, only leave her
	ladyship in peace.

			BROOKSIDE
	And the country will be rid of such
	a villain.

As Brookside says this, he backs into the next room.

The lawyer follows him, leaving Roderick alone in the
company of the constables who are all armed to the teeth.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I was no longer the man I was at
	twenty, when I should have charged
	the ruffians, sword in hand, and
	sent at least one of them to his
	account.  I was broken in spirit,
	regularly caught in the toils,
	utterly baffled and beaten by that
	woman.  Was she relenting at the
	door, when she paused and begged me
	to turn back?  Had she not a
	lingering love for me still?  Her
	conduct showed it, as I came to
	reflect on it.  It was my only
	chance now left in the world, so I
	put down my sword upon the lawyers
	desk.

Roderick puts his sword down on the lawyer's desk.

			RODERICK
	Gentlemen, I shall have no violence;
	you may tell Mr. Tapewell I am quite
	ready to speak with him when he is
	at leisure.

Roderick sits down and folds his arms quite peaceably.

EXT.  COFFEE HOUSE - NEAR GRAY'S INN - DAY

INT.  RODERICK'S ROOM IN COFFEE HOUSE - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I was instructed to take a lodging
	for the night in a coffee house near
	Gray's Inn, and anxiously expected a
	visit from Mr. Tapewell.

Tapewell talking to Roderick.

			TAPEWELL
	I have been authorized by Lady
	Cosgrove and her advisors to pay you
	an annuity of 300 pounds a year,
	specifically on the condition of you
	remaining abroad out of the three
	kingdoms, and to be stopped on the
	instant of your return.  I advise
	you to accept it without delay for
	you know, as well as I do, that your
	stay in London will infallibly
	plunge you in gaol, as there are
	innumerable writs taken out against
	you here and in the west of England,
	and that your credit is so blown
	upon that you could not hope to
	raise a shilling.  I will leave you
	the night to consider this proposal,
	but if you refuse, the family will
	proceed against you in London, and
	have you arrested.  If you accede, a
	quarter salary will be paid to you
	at any foreign port you should
	prefer.

			RODERICK
	Mr. Tapewell, I do not require a
	night to consider this proposal.
	What other choice has a poor, lonely
	and broken-hearted man?  I shall
	take the annuity, and leave the
	country.

			MR. TAPEWELL
	I am very glad to hear that you have
	come to this decision, Mr. Cosgrove.
	I think you are very wise.

There is a knock at the door and Roderick opens it.
Brookside enters with four constables armed with pistols.

The dialogue for this scene has to be written.

Brookside has gone against the bargain, and has decided to
have Roderick arrested upon one of the many writs out
against him for debt.

Mr. Tapewell is surprised and complains weakly that
Brookside is acting in bad faith.

Brookside brushes aside his objections.

Roderick is defeated, and meekly sits down in a chair.

The following lines are read over Roderick being shackled
and led out of the room.

			NARRATOR
	Mr. James Cosgrove's personal
	narrative finishes here, for the
	hand of death interrupted the
	ingenious author soon after the
	period which this memoir was
	compiled, after he had lived
	nineteen years an inmate of the
	Fleet Prison, where the prison
	records state he died of delirium
	tremens.

EXT.  FLEET PRISON - DAY

His mother, now very old and hobbled with arthritis,
enters the prison, carrying a basket on her arm.

			NARRATOR
	His faithful old mother joined him
	in his lonely exile, and had a
	bedroom in Fleet Market over the
	way.  She would come and stay the
	whole day with him in prison
	working.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - COUNTESS' STUDY

Signing a payment draft, the Countess sighs and gazes out
of the large window.

			NARRATOR
	The Countess was never out of love
	with her husband, and, as long as
	she lived, James enjoyed his income
	of 300 pounds per year and was,
	perhaps, as happy in prison, as at
	any period of his existence.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - STUDY - DAY

Brookside tearing up the payment draft presented to him by
his accountant.

			NARRATOR
	When her ladyship died, her son
	sternly cut off the annuity,
	devoting the sum to charities,
	which, he said, would make a nobler
	use of it than the scoundrel who had
	enjoyed it hitherto.

INT.  FLEET PRISON - DAY

Roderick, now grey-haired, blacking boots.

			NARRATOR
	When the famous character lost his
	income, his spirit entirely failed.
	He was removed into the pauper's
	ward, where he was known to black
	boots for wealthier prisoners, and
	where he was detected in stealing a
	tobacco box.

INT.  FLEET PRISON - DAY

Roderick and his mother.  Action as per voice over.

			NARRATOR
	His mother attained a prodigious old
	age, and the inhabitants of the
	place in her time can record, with
	accuracy, the daily disputes which
	used to take place between mother
	and son, until the latter, from
	habits of intoxication, falling into
	a state of almost imbecility, was
	tended by his tough old parent as a
	baby almost, and would cry if
	deprived of his necessary glass of
	brandy.

TITLE CARD

	It was in the reign of George III
	that the above-named personages
	lived and quarreled; good or bad,
	handsome or ugly, rich or poor, they
	are all equal now.

FADE IN:

EXT.  PARK - DAY

Brief shot of duel.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My father, who was well-known to the
	best circles in this kingdom under
	the name of roaring Harry James, was
	killed in a duel, when I was fifteen
	years old.

EXT.  GARDEN - DAY

Mrs. James, talking with a suitor; Roderick, at a
distance.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My mother, after her husband's
	death, and her retirement, lived in
	such a way as to defy slander.  She
	refused all offers of marriage,
	declaring that she lived now for her
	son only, and for the memory of her
	departed saint.

EXT.  STREET - DAY

Mother and son walking together.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My mother was the most beautiful
	women of her day.  But if she was
	proud of her beauty, to do her
	justice, she was still more proud of
	her son, and has said a thousand
	times to me that I was the
	handsomest fellow in the world.

EXT.  CHURCH - DAY

Mother and son entering church.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The good soul's pleasure was to
	dress me; and on Sundays and
	Holidays, I turned out in a velvet
	coat with a silver-hilted sword by
	my side, and a gold garter at my
	knee as fine as any lord in the
	land.  As we walked to church on
	Sundays, even the most envious souls
	would allow that there was not a
	prettier pair in the kingdom.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

A picnic.  The Dugan family.  Roderick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My uncle's family consisted of ten
	children, and one of them was the
	cause of all my early troubles; this
	was the belle of the family, my
	cousin, Miss Dorothy Dugan, by name.

EXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY

A sprawling run-down Irish manor house with large garden,
stables, barn and farm.

Idealized images of Dorothy.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Ah!  That first affair, how well one
	remembers it!  What a noble
	discovery it is that the boy makes
	when he finds himself actually and
	truly in love with some one!  A lady
	who is skilled in dancing or singing
	never can perfect herself without a
	deal of study in private.  So it is
	with the dear creatures who are
	skilled in coquetting.  Dorothy, for
	instance, was always practicing, and
	she would take poor me to rehearse
	her accomplishments upon...

Dorothy talking with the exciseman.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	... or the exciseman, when he came
	his rounds.

Dorothy talking to the steward.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	... or the steward.

Dorothy sitting under a tree with the curate, reading a
book.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	... or the poor curate.

Dorothy talking to the apothecary's lad.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	... or the young apothecary's lad
	from Dugan's Town whom I recollect
	beating once for that very reason.

Roderick, fighting with apothecary's lad.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The torments of jealousy she made me
	endure were horrible.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

Dorothy, like a greyhound released from days of
confinement, and given the freedom of the fields at last,
runs at top-speed, left and right, back and forth,
returning every moment to Roderick.

She runs and runs until she is out of breath, and then
laughs at the astonishment which keeps Roderick motionless
and staring at her.

After catching her breath, and wiping her forehead, she
challenges Roderick to a race.

			RODERICK
	I accept, but I insist on a wager.
	The loser must do whatever the
	winner pleases.

			DOROTHY
	Agreed.

			RODERICK
	Do you see the gate at the end of
	the field?  The first to touch it
	will be the winner.

They line up together and start on a count of three.
Dorothy uses all her strength, but Roderick holds back,
and Dorothy touches the gate five or six paces ahead of
him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I was certain to win, but I meant to
	lose to see what she would order me
	to do.

Dorothy catches her breath, thinking of the penalty.  Then
she goes behind the trees and, a few second later, comes
out and says:

			DOROTHY
	Your penalty is to find a cherry-
	colored ribbon which I have hidden
	somewhere on my person.  You are
	free to look for it anywhere you
	will, and I will think very little
	of you if you do not find it.

They sit down on the grass.  Roderick searches her
pockets, the fold of her short bodice and her skirt, then
her shoes; then he turns up her skirt, slowly and
circumspectly, as high as her garters, which she wears
upon the knee.  He unfastens them and finds nothing; he
draws down her skirt and gropes under her armpits.  The
tickling makes her laugh.

			RODERICK
	I feel the ribbon.

			DOROTHY
	Then you must get it.

Roderick has to unlace her bodice and touch her pretty
breasts, over which his hand must pass to reach it.

			DOROTHY
	Why are you shaking?

			RODERICK
	With pleasure at finding the ribbon.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

Military review.  One hundred English troops, a few
mounted officers, a small military band, fifty local
people.

The Dugan family, Roderick and his mother, Captains Best
and Grogan.

Roderick admires the troops in their splendid uniforms.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	About this time, the United Kingdom
	was in a state of great excitement
	from the threat generally credited
	of a French invasion.  The noblemen
	and people of condition in that and
	all other parts of the kingdom
	showed their loyalty by raising
	regiments of horse and foot to
	resist the invaders.  How I envied
	them.  The whole country was alive
	with war's alarums; the three
	kingdoms ringing with military
	music, while poor I was obliged to
	stay at home in my fustian jacket
	and sigh for fame in secret.

INT.  BALLROOM AT FENCIBLES - NIGHT

Dorothy and Roderick entering.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Once, the officers of the Kilwangen
	regiment gave a grand ball to which
	Dorothy persuaded my to take her.

Several cuts depicting the evening.

Dorothy ignores Roderick; dances, chats, laughs, drinks
punch, and finally, strolls outside with Captain Best.

Roderick makes a half-hearted try at dancing with Miss
Clancy.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I have endured torments in my life,
	but none like that.  Some of the
	prettiest girls there offered to
	console me, for I was the best
	dancer in the room, but I was too
	wretched, and so remained alone all
	night in a state of agony.  I did
	not care for drink, or know the
	dreadful comfort of it in those
	days; but I thought of killing
	myself and Dorothy, and most
	certainly of making away with
	Captain Best.

EXT.  FENCIBLES BALLROOM - DAWN

The guests leaving and saying their goodbyes.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	At last, and at morning, the ball
	was over.

EXT.  ROAD - DAWN

Dorothy and Roderick on horseback together.

			DOROTHY
	Sure it's a bitter night, Roderick
	dear, and you'll catch cold without
	a handkerchief to your neck.

To this sympathetic remark, from the pillion, the saddle
made no reply.

			DOROTHY
	Did you and Miss Clancy have a
	pleasant evening, Roderick?  You
	were together, I saw, all night.

To this, the saddle only replies by grinding his teeth,
and giving a lash to Daisy.

			DOROTHY
	Oh!  Mercy, you make Daisy rear and
	throw me, you careless creature,
	you.

The pillion had by this got her arm around the saddle's
waist, and gave it the gentlest squeeze in the world.

			RODERICK
	I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do!
	And I only danced with her because
	-- because -- the person with whom I
	intended to dance chose to be
	engaged the whole night.

			DOROTHY
	I had not been in the room five
	minutes before I was engaged for
	every single set.

			RODERICK
	Were you obliged to dance five times
	with Captain Best, and then stroll
	out with him into the garden?

			DOROTHY
	I don't care a fig for Captain Best;
	he dances prettily to be sure, and
	is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He
	looks well in his regimentals, too;
	and if he chose to ask me to dance,
	how could I refuse him?

			RODERICK
	But you refused me, Dorothy.

			DOROTHY
	Oh!  I can dance with you any day,
	and to dance with your own cousin at
	a ball as if you could find no other
	partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain
	Best's a man, and you are only a
	boy, and you haven't a guinea in the
	world.

			RODERICK
	If ever I meet him again, you shall
	see which is the best man of the
	two.  I'll fight him with sword or
	with pistol, captain as he is.

			DOROTHY
	But Captain Best is already known as
	a valiant soldier, and is famous as
	a man of fashion in London.  It is
	mighty well of you to fight farmers'
	boys, but to fight an Englishman is
	a very different matter.

Roderick falls silent.

EXT.  SMALL BRIDGE OVER A STREAM - DAWN

They come to an old, high bridge, over a stream,
sufficiently deep and rocky.

			DOROTHY
	Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are
	such a hero, was passing over the
	bridge and the enemy on the other
	side.

			RODERICK
	I'd draw my sword, and cut my way
	through them.

			DOROTHY
	What, with me on the pillion?  Would
	you kill poor me?

			RODERICK
	Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd
	do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river,
	and swim you both across, where no
	enemy could follow us.

			DOROTHY
	Jump twenty feet!  You wouldn't dare
	to do any such thing on Daisy.
	There's the captain's horse, Black
	George, I've heard say that Captain
	Bes --

She never finished the word for, maddened by the continual
recurrence of that odious monosyllable, Roderick shouts:

			RODERICK
	Hold tight to my waist!

And, giving Daisy the spur, springs with Dorothy over the
parapet, into the deeper water below.

The horse's head sinks under, the girl screams as she
sinks, and screams as she rises.

Roderick lands her, half-fainting, on the shore.

INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

Various cuts showing illness and convalescence.

Roderick feverish:  the doctor taking his pulse.

Mother brings a tray of food.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I went home, and was ill speedily of
	a fever, which kept me to my bed for
	a week.

Dorothy visiting him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Dorothy visited me only once, but I
	quitted my couch still more
	violently in love than I had been
	ever before.

EXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY

The air is fresh and bright, and the birds sing loud
amidst the green trees.  Roderick is elated, and springs
down the road, as brisk as a young fawn.

He encounters an orderly whistling "Roast Beef of Old
England," as he cleans down a cavalry horse.

			RODERICK
	Whose horse, fellow, is that?

			ORDERLY
	Feller, indeed!  The horse belongs
	to my captain, and he's a better
	fellow nor you any day.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I did not stop to break his bones,
	as I would on another occasion, for
	a horrible suspicion had come across
	me, and I made for the garden as
	quickly as I could.

Roderick see Captain Best and Dorothy pacing the path
together.  Her arm is under his, and he is fondling and
squeezing her little hand which lies closely nestling
against his arm.

Some distance beyond them is Captain Grogan, who is paying
court to Dorothy's sister, Mysie.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The fact is that, during the week of
	my illness, no other than Captain
	Best was staying at Castle Dugan,
	and making love to Miss Dorothy in
	form.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	No, Dorothy, except for you and four
	others, I vow before all the gods,
	my heart had never felt the soft
	flame.

			DOROTHY
	Ah, you men, you men, John, your
	passion is not equal to ours.  We
	are like -- like some plant I've
	read of -- we bear but one flower,
	and then we die!

			CAPTAIN BEST
	Do you mean you never felt an
	inclination for another?

			DOROTHY
	Never, my John, but for thee!  How
	can you ask me such a question?

Raising her hand to his lips.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	Darling Dorothea!

Roderick rushes into view, drawing his little sword.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I pulled out a knot of cherry-
	colored ribbons, which she had given
	me out of her breast, and which
	somehow I always wore upon me, and
	flung them in Captain Best's face,
	and rushed out with my little sword
	drawn.

			RODERICK
	She's a liar -- she's a liar,
	Captain Best!  Draw, sir, and defend
	yourself, if you are a man!

Roderick leaps at Captain Best, and collars him, while
Dorothy makes the air echo with her screams.

Captain Grogan and Mysie hasten up.

Though Roderick is a full growth of six feet, he is small
by the side of the enormous English captain.

Best turns very red at the attack upon him, and slips back
clutching at his sword.

Dorothy, in an agony of terror, flings herself round him,
screaming:

			DOROTHY
	Captain Best, for Heaven's sake,
	spare the child -- he is but an
	infant.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	And ought to be whipped for his
	impudence, but never fear, Miss
	Dugan, I shall not touch him, your
	favorite is safe from me.

So saying, he stoops down and picks up the bunch of
ribbons, which Roderick had flung at Dorothy's feet, and
handing it to her, says in a sarcastic tone:

			CAPTAIN BEST
	When ladies make presents to
	gentlemen, it is time for other
	gentlemen to retire...

			DOROTHY
	Good heavens, Best!  He is but a boy
	and don't signify any more than my
	parrot or lap-dog.  Mayn't I give a
	bit of ribbon to my own cousin?

			RODERICK
		   (roaring)
	I'm a man, and will prove it.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	You are perfectly welcome, miss, as
	many yards as you like.

			DOROTHY
	Monster!  Your father was a tailor,
	and you are always thinking of the
	shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I
	will!  Roddy, will you see me
	insulted?

			RODERICK
	Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to
	have his blood as sure as my name's
	Roderick.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	I'll send for the usher to cane you,
	little boy, but as for you, miss, I
	have the honor to wish you a good
	day.

Best takes off his hat with much ceremony, and makes a low
bow, and is just walking off, when Michael, Roderick's
cousin, comes up, whose ear has likewise been caught by
the scream.

			MICHAEL
	Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the
	matter here?

			CAPTAIN BEST
	I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan.
	I have had enough of Miss Dugan here
	and your Irish ways.  I ain't used
	to 'em, sir.

			MICHAEL
		   (good-humoredly)
	Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make
	you used to our ways, or adopt
	English ones.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	It's not the English way, for ladies
	to have two lovers, and, so, Mr.
	Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the
	sum you owe me, and I resign all
	claims to this young lady.  If she
	has a fancy for school-boys, let her
	take 'em, sir.

			MICHAEL
	Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	I never was more in earnest.

Best exits.

			MICHAEL
		   (in a towering rage)
	You -- you!  Hang you for a meddling
	brat, your hand is in everybody's
	pie.  What business had you to come
	brawling and quarreling here, with
	a gentleman who has fifteen hundred
	a-year?

Michael runs after Best.

			DOROTHY
		   (gasps)
	Oh, I shall die; I know I shall.  I
	shall never leave this spot.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
		   (whisper to Dorothy)
	The Captain is gone.

Dorothy, giving him an indignant look, jumps up and walks
towards the house.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
		   (in a soothing tone
		    to Roderick)
	This is a pretty way to recommend
	yourself to the family.

			RODERICK
		   (shouts after
		    Michael)
	The man that marries Dorothy Dugan
	must first kill me -- do you mind
	that?

			MICHAEL
		   (shouting back from
		    a distance)
	Pooh, sir.  Kill you -- flog you,
	you mean!  I'll send for Nick the
	huntsman to do it.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	You are a gallant lad, and I like
	your spirit.  But what Dugan says is
	true.  It's a hard thing to give a
	lad counsel who is in such a far-
	gone state as you; but, believe me,
	I know the world, and if you will
	but follow my advice, you won't
	regret having taken it.  Dorothy
	Dugan has not a penny; you are not a
	whit richer.  And, my poor boy,
	don't you see -- though it's a hard
	matter to see -- that she's a flirt,
	and does not care a pin for you or
	Best either?

			RODERICK
	Dorothy might love me or not, as she
	likes, but Best will have to fight
	me before he marries her!

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Faith, I think you are a lad that's
	likely to keep your word.

He looks hard at Roderick for a second to two, then he
walks away, humming a tune, looking back at Roderick as he
goes through the old gate out of the garden.

When Grogan is gone, Roderick is quite alone, and he
flings himself down on the bench where Dorothy had made
believe to faint, and had left her handkerchief and the
ribbons and, taking them up, hides his face in them, and
bursts into a passion of tears.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I must have sat for some hours
	bemoaning myself on the garden-bench,
	for the dinner-bell clanged as usual
	at three o'clock, which wakened me
	from my reverie.

EXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY

As Roderick passes the courtyard, he sees the Captain's
saddle still hanging up at the stable-door, and his odious
red-coated brute of a servant, swaggering with the
scullion-girls and kitchen people.

			MAID
	The Englishman's still there, Master
	Roderick.  He's there in the parlor.
	Go in, and don't let 'im browbeat
	you, Master Roderick.

INT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

Roderick enters and takes his place at the bottom of the
big table; the butler speedily brings him a cover.

			UNCLE
	Hello, Roddy, my boy!  Up and well?
	That's right.

			AUNT
	He'd better be home with his mother.

			UNCLE
	Don't mind her.  It's the cold goose
	she ate for breakfast -- didn't
	agree with her.  Take a glass of
	spirits, Mrs. Dugan, to Roderick's
	health.

It is evident that his uncle doesn't know of what
happened, but Michael, who is at dinner too, and Harry,
and almost all the girls, look exceedingly black and the
captain foolish; and Miss Dorothy, who is again by his
side, ready to cry.  Captain Grogan sits smiling, and
Roderick looks on as cold as stone.

His uncle is in high good-humor.

			UNCLE
	Dorothy, divide that merry thought
	with the captain!  See who'll be
	married first.  Jack Best, my dear
	boy, never mind a clean glass for
	the claret, we're short of crystal
	at Castle Dugan; take Dorothy's and
	the wine will taste none the worse.
	Mrs. Dugan and ladies, if you
	please; this is a sort of toast that
	is drunk a great deal too seldom in
	my family, and you'll please to
	receive it with all the honors.
	Here's to Captain and Mrs. John
	Best, and long life to them.  Kiss
	her, Jack, you rogue; for faith,
	you've got a treasure.

			RODERICK
		   (spring up)
	His already?!

			HARRY
	Hold your tongue, you fool -- hold
	your tongue!

			RODERICK
		   (shouting)
	He has already been slapped in the
	face this morning, Captain John
	Best; he's already been called a
	coward, Captain John Best; and this
	is the way I'll drink his health.
	Here's your health, Captain John
	Best.

Roderick flings a glass of claret into his face.  The next
moment, he is under the table, tripped up by Harry, who
hits him a violent cuff on the head; as he goes down, he
hardly has time to hear the general screaming and
scurrying that is taking place above him, being so fully
occupied with kicks, and thumps and curses, with which
Harry is belaboring him.

			HARRY
	You fool!  You great blundering
	marplot -- you silly beggarly
	brat --
		   (a thump at each)
	Hold your tongue!

When Roderick gets up from under the table, the ladies are
all gone; but he has the satisfaction of seeing the
captain's nose is bleeding, as his is -- Best is cut
across the bridge, and his beauty spoiled forever.

			UNCLE
	In Heaven's name, what does all the
	row mean?  Is the boy in fever
	again?

			HARRY
		   (turning to his
		    father)
	The fact is, sir, that the young
	monkey has fallen in love with
	Dorothy, and finding her and the
	captain mighty sweet in the garden
	today, he was for murdering Jack
	Best.

			CAPTAIN BEST
		   (bristling up)
	And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan,
	I've been insulted grossly in this
	house.  I ain't at all satisfied
	with these here ways of going on.
	I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man
	of property; and I -- I --

			HARRY
	If you're insulted, and not
	satisfied, remember there's two of
	us, Best.

On which, the captain falls to washing his nose in water,
and answering never a word.

			RODERICK
		   (in dignified tone)
	Mr. Best may also have satisfaction
	any time he pleases, by calling on
	Roderick James, Esquire, of
	Jamesville.

His uncle bursts out laughing, and in this laugh, Captain
Grogan joins.

			RODERICK
	Captain Grogan, I beg you to
	understand that, for my cousin
	Harry, who has been my best friend
	through life, I could put up with
	rough treatment from him; yet, even
	that sort of treatment I will bear
	from him no longer; and any other
	person who ventures on the like will
	not like the cost.  Mr. Best knows
	that fact very well; and, if he's
	man, he'll know where to find me.

			UNCLE
	It is getting late, and your mother
	will be anxious about you.  One of
	you had better go home with him.
		   (turning to his sons)
	Or the lad may be playing more
	pranks.

			HARRY
	Both of us ride home with Best here.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My
	man is armed, and so am I.

			HARRY
	You know the use of arms very well,
	Best, and no one can doubt your
	courage; but Michael and I will see
	you home for all that.

			UNCLE
	Why, you'll not be home till
	morning, boys.  Kilwangan's a good
	ten miles from here.

			HARRY
	We'll sleep in Best's quarters.
	We're going to stop a week there.
	And, in another week, my boy.

And here, Harry whispers something in the Captain's ear.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	I'll go home with the boy.

EXT.  ROAD - LATE DAY

Grogan walks with Roderick.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	A pretty day's work of it you have
	made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your
	uncle to be distressed for money,
	and try and break off a match which
	will bring fifteen hundred a-year
	into the family?  Best has promised
	to pay off the four thousand pounds
	which is bothering your uncle so.
	He takes a girl without a penny -- a
	girl that has been flinging herself
	at the head of every man in these
	parts these ten years past, and
	missing them all, and a boy who
	ought to be attached to your uncle
	as to your father.

			RODERICK
	And so I am.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	And this is the return you make for
	his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you
	in his house when your father died,
	and hasn't he given you and your
	mother, rent-free, your fine house
	of Jamesville yonder?

			RODERICK
	Mark this, come what will of it, I
	swear I will fight the man who
	pretends to the hand of Dorothy
	Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into
	the church, and meet him there.
	I'll have his blood, or he shall
	have mine.  Will you take my message
	to him, and arrange the meeting?

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Well, if it must be, it must.  For a
	young fellow, you are the most
	bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No
	officer, bearing His Majesty's
	commission, can receive a glass of
	wine on his nose, without resenting
	it -- fight you must, and Best is a
	huge, strong fellow.

			RODERICK
	He'll give the better mark.  I am
	not afraid of him.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	In faith, I believe you are not; for
	a lad I never saw more game in my
	life.  Give me a kiss, my dear boy.
	You're after my own soul.  As long
	as Jack Grogan lives, you shall
	never want a friend or a second.

They embrace.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Poor fellow!  He was shot six months
	afterwards, at Minden, and I lost
	thereby a kind friend.  But we don't
	know what is in store for us, and
	that's a blessing.

EXT.  HOUSE - LATE DAY

Mother greeting Roderick and Captain Grogan.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	In spite of my precautions to
	secrecy, I half-suspected that my
	mother knew all from the manner in
	which she embraced me on my arrival,
	and received our guest, Captain
	Grogan.

His mother looks a little anxious and flushed and, every
now and then, gazes very hard into the Captain's face.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But she would not say a word about
	the quarrel, for she had a noble
	spirit, and would as lief have seen
	any one of her kindred hanged as
	shirking from the field of honor.

INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - RODERICK'S BEDROOM - DAY

Roderick waking up.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I never slept sounder in my life,
	though I woke a little earlier than
	usual, and you may be sure my first
	thought was of the event of the day,
	for which I was fully prepared.

Roderick at table with paper and ink.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And now I sat down and wrote a
	couple of letters; they might be the
	last, thought I, that I should ever
	write in my life.

See him write:  "Dearest Mother."

INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Then I went down to breakfast, where
	my mother was waiting for me, you
	may be sure.  We did not say a
	single word about what was taking
	place.

Roderick eats his breakfast with a good appetite; but in
helping himself to salt, spills it, on which his mother
starts up with a scream.

			MOTHER
	Thank God, it's fallen towards me!

And then, her heart being too full, she leaves the room.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Ah!  They have their faults, those
	mothers; but are there any other
	women like them?

There is an elegant, silver-mounted sword that hangs on
the mantelpiece under the picture of Roderick's late
father.

A pair of pistols hang on each side of the picture.

Roderick takes down the sword and pistols, which are
bright and well-oiled, and collects flints, balls and
gunpowder.

EXT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY

Captain Grogan and Orderly arrive.

			RODERICK
	Have you taken my message to him?

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	The meeting is arranged.  Captain
	Best is waiting for you now.

			RODERICK
	My mare is saddled and ready; who's
	the captain's second?

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Your cousins go out with him.

Roderick and Grogan, and the Orderly ride off.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I didn't take leave of Mrs. James.
	The curtains of her bedroom-windows
	were down, and they didn't move as
	we mounted and trotted off.

EXT.  COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

They ride their horses at a leisurely pace.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	That's a very handsome sword you
	have there.

			RODERICK
	It was with this sword that my late
	father, Harry James, God rest his
	soul, met Sir Huddelstone
	Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet,
	and was fatally run through the
	neck.  He was quite in the wrong,
	having insulted Lady Fuddelstone,
	when in liquor, at the Brentford
	Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he
	scorned to apologize.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	And now you risk the same fate.  If
	you are killed, your mother is all
	alone in the world.

			RODERICK
	I am Harry James' son, and will act
	as becomes my name and quality.

EXT.  FOREST CLEARING - DAY

Harry, Michael and the Captain are already there.  Best,
flaming in red regimentals, a big a monster as ever led a
grenadier company.  The party are laughing together.

			RODERICK
		   (to Captain Grogan)
	I hope to spoil this sport, and
	trust to see this sword of mine in
	that big bully's body.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You
	are no match for Best with the
	sword.

			RODERICK
	I'll match any man with the sword.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	But swords are today impossible;
	Captain Best is -- is lame.  He
	knocked his knee against the
	swinging park gate last night, as he
	was riding home, and can scarce move
	it now.

			RODERICK
	Not against Castle Dugan gate, that
	has been off the hinges these ten
	years.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	It must have been some other gate.

They alight from their horses, and join and salute the
other gentlemen.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	I have just explained to Mister
	James that Captain Best is lame, and
	that swords are impossible.

			HARRY
	Oh, yes!  Dead lame.

Harry comes up to shake Roderick by the hand, while
Captain Best takes off his hat, and turns extremely red.

			HARRY
	And very lucky for you, Roderick, my
	boy.  You were a dead man else, for
	he is a devil of a fellow -- isn't
	he, Grogan?

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	A regular Turk.  I never yet knew
	the man who stood to Captain Best.

			HARRY
	Hang the business.  I hate it.  I'm
	ashamed of it.  Say you're sorry,
	Roderick.  You can easily say that.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	If the young feller will go to
	Dublin, as proposed...

			RODERICK
	I'm not sorry -- I'll not apologize
	-- and I'll as soon go to Dublin as
	to hell!

Grogan takes him aside.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is
	silly business.  The girl will marry
	Best, mark my words; and as sure as
	she does, you'll forget her.  You
	are but a boy.  Best is willing to
	consider you as such.  Dublin's a
	fine place, and if you have a mind
	to take a ride thither and see the
	town for a month, here are twenty
	guineas at your service.  Make Best
	an apology, and be off.

			RODERICK
	A man of honor dies, but never
	apologizes.  I'll see the captain
	hanged before I apologize.

			HARRY
		   (with a laugh to
		    Grogan)
	There's nothing else for it.  Take
	your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces,
	I suppose?

			CAPTAIN BEST
		   (in a big voice)
	Ten, sir, and make them short ones,
	do you hear, Captain Grogan?

			HARRY
	Don't bully, Mr. Best.  Here are the
	pistols.
		   (with some emotion
		    to Roderick)
	God bless you, my boy; and when I
	count three, fire.

			RODERICK
	This is not one of my pistols.

			HARRY
	They are all right, never fear.
	It's one of mine.  Yours will serve,
	if they are needed, for the next
	round.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Roderick, fire at his neck -- hit
	him there under the gorget; see how
	the fool shows himself open.

Michael, who has not spoken a word, Harry, and the Captain
retire to one side, and Harry gives the signal.

It is slowly given, and Roderick has the leisure to cover
his man well.

Captain Best changes color and trembles as the numbers are
given.

At "three" both pistols go off.  Best gives a most
horrible groan, staggers backwards and falls.

			THE SECONDS
		   (crying out)
	He's down!  He's down!

Running towards him, Harry lifts him up -- Michael takes
his head.

			MICHAEL
	He's hit here, in the neck.

Laying open his coat, blood is seen gurgling from under
his gorget.

			HARRY
	How is it with you?

The unfortunate man does not answer, but when the support
of Harry's arm is withdrawn from his back, groans once
more and falls backwards.

			MICHAEL
		   (with a scowl)
	The young fellow has begun well.
	You had better ride off, young sir,
	before the police are up.  They had
	wind of the business before we left
	Kilwangan.

			RODERICK
	Is he quite dead?

			MICHAEL
	Quite dead.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Then the world's rid of a coward.
	It's all over with him, Roddy -- he
	doesn't stir.

He gives the huge prostrate body a scornful kick with his
foot.

			HARRY
	We are not cowards, Grogan, whatever
	he was!  Let's get the boy off as
	quick as we may.  Your man shall go
	for a cart, and take away the body
	of this unhappy gentleman.  This has
	been a sad day's work for our
	family, Roderick James, and you have
	robbed us of fifteen-hundred a-year.

			RODERICK
	It was Dorothy did it.

Roderick takes the ribbons she gave him out of his
waistcoat, and the letter, and flings them down on the
body of Captain Best.

			RODERICK
	There!  Take her those ribbons.
	She'll know what they mean; that's
	all that's left of her of two lovers
	she had and ruined.

			MICHAEL
	And now, in Heaven's name, get the
	youngster out of the way.

			HARRY
	I'll go with you.

They mount up and gallop off.

EXT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY

Upon seeing Roderick and Harry ride up, his mother, who
has been waiting outside, rushes to her son with wild
screams of joy.  He dismounts, and she kisses and embraces
him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I need not tell you how great was my
	mother's pride and exultation when
	she heard from Harry's lips the
	account of my behavior at the duel.

INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - PARLOR - DAY

Still much excitement and hustle and bustle.

			HARRY
	The boy must go into hiding, for a
	short time anyway.  Dublin is the
	best place for him to go, and there
	wait until matters are blown over.

			MOTHER
	Dublin?  But the poor lad has never
	been away from home.  He will be as
	safe here as in Dublin.

			HARRY
	I wish that were true, Auntie dear,
	but I'm afraid the bailiffs may
	already be on their way from
	Kilwangan.

INT.  RODERICK'S BEDROOM - DAY

His mother is rushing about and packing a valise.  Harry
sits on the bed.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Harry persisted in the necessity of
	instant departure, in which
	argument, as I was anxious to see
	the world, I must confess, I sided
	with him; and my mother was brought
	to see that, in our small house, in
	the midst of a village, escape would
	be impossible, and capture would be
	impossible to avoid.

INT.  MOTHER'S BEDROOM - DAY

His mother takes out a stocking from her escritoire, and
gives Roderick twenty golden guineas.

			MOTHER
		   (gravely)
	Roderick, my darling, my wild boy, I
	have forebodings that our separation
	is to be a long one.  I spent most
	of all night consulting the cards
	regarding your fate in the duel, and
	all signs betoke a separation.  Here
	is twenty guineas -- all that I have
	in the world -- and I want you to
	keep your father's sword and
	pistols, which you have known to use
	so like a man.

EXT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY

Roderick's departure.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She hurried my departure now, though
	her heart, I know, was full, and
	almost in half-an-hour from my
	arrival at home, I was once more on
	the road again, with the wide world,
	as it were, before me.

Roderick waves.  His mother cries.

EXT.  HIGH ROAD TO DUBLIN - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	No lad of seventeen is very sad who
	has liberty for the first time, and
	twenty guineas in his pocket; and I
	rode away, thinking, I confess, not
	so much of the kind of mother left
	alone, and of the home behind me, as
	of tomorrow, and all the wonders it
	would bring.

Roderick happily riding down the road.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had no doubts of the future;
	thinking that a man of my person,
	parts, and courage, could make his
	way anywhere.  So I rode on, singing
	to myself, or chatting with the
	passersby; and all the girls along
	the road said, "God save me, for a
	clever gentleman."

Farm girls in the fields flirting with him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	As for thoughts of Dorothy Dugan,
	there seemed to be a gap of a half-
	a-score of years.

EXT.  ROAD TO DUBLIN - DAY

A well-armed gentleman dressed in green, and a gold cord,
with a patch on his eye, and riding a powerful mare, puts
his horse alongside.

			ARMED GENTLEMAN
	Good day to you, young sir.

			RODERICK
	Good morning.

			ARMED GENTLEMAN
	Where are you bound for?

			RODERICK
		   (after a long look at
		    his companion)
	That is none of your business.

			ARMED GENTLEMAN
	Is your mother not afraid on account
	of the highwayman to let one so
	young as you travel?

			RODERICK
		   (pulling out a
		    pistol)
	Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of
	good pistols that have already done
	execution, and are ready to do it
	again.

At this, a pock-marked man coming up, the well-armed
gentleman spurs into his bay mare, and leaves Roderick.

EXT.  ROAD TO DUBLIN - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	A little later on, as I rode towards
	Kilcullen, I saw a crowd of peasant
	people assembled round a one-horse
	chair, and my friend in green, as I
	thought, making off half-a-mile up
	the hill.

A footman howls, at the top of his voice.

			FOOTMAN
	Stop thief!

But the country fellows only laugh at his distress, and
make all sorts of jokes at the adventure which had just
befallen.

			COUNTRY FELLOW #1
	Sure, you might have kept him off
	with your blunderbush!

			COUNTRY FELLOW #2
	O the coward!  To let the Captain
	bate you, and he only one eye!

			COUNTRY FELLOW #3
	The next time my lady travels, she'd
	better leave you at home!

			RODERICK
	What is this noise, fellows?

Roderick rides up amongst them, and seeing the lady in the
carriage, very pale and frightened, gives a slash of his
whip, and bids the red-shanked ruffians keep off.

Pulling off his hat, and bringing his mare up in a prance
to the chair-window.

			RODERICK
	What has happened, madam, to annoy
	your ladyship?

			MRS. O'REILLY
	Oh, I am grateful to you, sir.  I am
	the wife of Captain O'Reilly
	hastening to join him at Dublin.  My
	chair was stopped by a highwayman;
	this great oaf of a servant-man fell
	down on his knees, armed as he was,
	and though there were thirty people
	in the next field, working, when the
	ruffian attacked, not one of them
	would help but, on the contrary,
	wished him "good luck."

			COUNTRY FELLOW #1
	Sure, he's the friend of the poor,
	and good luck to him.

			COUNTRY FELLOW #2
	Was it any business of ours?

			RODERICK
		   (shouting)
	Be off to your work, you pack of
	rascals, or you will have a good
	taste of my thong.
		   (to Mrs. O'Reilly)
	Have you lost much?

			MRS. O'REILLY
	Everything -- my purse, containing
	upwards of a hundred guineas, my
	jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches.
	And all because this blundering
	coward fell to his knees...

			FOOTMAN
	Be fair, ma'am, them wasn't so much.
	Didn't he return you the thirteen
	pence in copper, and the watch,
	saying it was only pinchbeck?

			MRS. O'REILLY
	Don't be insolent, or I'll report
	you to the Captain.

			FOOTMAN
	Sorry, ma'am.

He shuffles a few steps away and frowns in the direction
that the Captain has vanished.

			MRS. O'REILLY
	That fool didn't know what was the
	meaning of a hundred-pound bill,
	which was in the pocket-book that
	the fellow took from me.

			RODERICK
	I am riding to Dublin myself, and if
	your ladyship will allow me the
	honor of riding with you, I shall do
	my best to protect you from further
	mishap.

			MRS. O'REILLY
	But I shouldn't like to put you to
	such trouble, Mister...?

			RODERICK
	O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.

EXT.  ROADSIDE INN - DAY

They stop at the inn.

			RODERICK
		   (very gallantly)
	As you have been robbed of your
	purse, may I have permission to lend
	your ladyship a couple of pieces to
	pay any expenses which you might
	incur before reaching your home?

			MRS. O'REILLY
		   (smiling)
	That's very kind of you, Mr.
	O'Higgins.

He gives her two gold pieces.

INT.  INN - DAY

Roderick and Mrs. O'Reilly finishing their meal.

We will hear dialogue underneath Roderick's voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	How different was her lively rattle
	to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan
	assemblies.  In every sentence, she
	mentioned a lord or a person of
	quality.  To the lady's question
	about my birth and parentage, I
	replied that I was a young gentleman
	of large fortune, that I was going
	to Dublin for my studies, and that
	my mother allowed me five hundred
	per annum.

			MRS. O'REILLY
	You must be very cautious with
	regard to the company you should
	meet in Dublin, where rogues and
	adventurers of all countries abound.
	I hope you will do me the honor of
	accepting lodgings in my own house,
	where Captain O'Reilly will welcome
	with delight, my gallant young
	preserver.

Paying the bill.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Perhaps had I been a little older in
	the world's experience, I should
	have begun to see that Madame
	O'Reilly was not the person of
	fashion she pretended to be; but, as
	it was, I took all her stories for
	truth, and, when the landlord
	brought the bill for dinner, paid it
	with the air of a lord.  Indeed, she
	made no motion to produce the two
	pieces I had lent her.

EXT.  DUBLIN - STREET - NIGHT

They ride by.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And so we rode on slowly towards
	Dublin, into which city we made our
	entrance at nightfall.  The rattle
	and splendor of the coaches, the
	flare of the linkboys, the number
	and magnificence of the houses,
	struck me with the greatest wonder;
	though I was careful to disguise
	this feeling.

EXT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - DUBLIN - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	We stopped at length at a house of
	rather mean appearance, and were let
	into a passage which had a great
	smell of supper and punch.

INT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Captain O'Reilly, a stout red-faced man, without a
periwig, and in a rather tattered nightgown and cap.
Roderick and Mrs. O'Reilly.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how
	grateful I am for your timely
	assistance to my wife.

			RODERICK
	I am only sorry that I was unable to
	prevent the villain from carrying
	off all her ladyship's money and
	pearls.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt,
	and rest assured, sir, you have
	friends in this house whenever you
	are in Dublin.
		   (pours a glass)
	Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know
	your good father?

			RODERICK
	Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I
	have never heard your name mentioned
	in my family.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins
	of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins
	was a close friend of my wife's dear
	father, Colonel Granby Somerset.

			RODERICK
	Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine
	are the O'Higgins of Watertown.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	I have heard of them.

There are relics of some mutton-chops and onions on a
cracked dish before them.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	My love, I wish I had known of your
	coming, for Bob Moriaty and I just
	finished the most delicious venison
	pasty, which His Grace the Lord
	Lieutenant, sent us, with a flash of
	sillery from his own cellar.  You
	know the wine, my dear?  But as
	bygones are bygones, and no help for
	them, what say ye to a fine lobster
	and a bottle of as good claret as
	any in Ireland?  Betty, clear these
	things from the table, and make the
	mistress and our young friend
	welcome to our home.

Captain O'Reilly searches his pockets for some money to
give to Betty.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	I'm sorry, Mr. O'Higgins, but I
	don't seem to have any small change.
	May I borrow a ten-penny piece to
	give to the girl?

			MRS. O'REILLY
	I have some money, my dear.  Here,
	Betty, go to the fishmonger and
	bring back our supper, and mind you
	get the right change.

She takes out one of the golden guineas Roderick gave to
her.

INT.  DINNING ROOM - LATER

They are eating.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Our supper was seasoned, if not by
	any great elegance, at least by a
	plentiful store of anecdotes,
	concerning the highest personages of
	the city, with whom, according to
	himself, the captain lived on terms
	of the utmost intimacy.  Not to be
	behind hand with him, I spoke of my
	own estates and property as if I was
	as rich as a duke.

INT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

The couple wishing Roderick goodnight.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Had I been an English lad, the
	appearance of the chamber I occupied
	might, indeed, have aroused
	instantly my suspicion and distrust.
	But we are not particular in Ireland
	on the score of neatness, hence the
	disorder of my bed-chamber did not
	strike me so much.

Broken door.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Was there a lock to the door, or a
	hasp to fasten it to?

Dress lying over bed.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Though my counterpane was evidently
	a greased brocade dress of Mrs.
	O'Reilly.

Cracked mirror.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And my cracked toilet-glass not much
	bigger than a half-crown, yet I was
	used to these sort of ways in Irish
	houses, and still thought myself to
	be in that of a man of fashion.

Drawers, full of junk.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	There was no lock to the drawers,
	which, when they did open, were full
	of my hostess' rouge-pots, shoes,
	stays, and rags.

INT.  BEDROOM - O'REILLY HOUSE - NIGHT

In the middle of the night, Mrs. O'Reilly comes to
Roderick's room on a flimsy pretext, and in the course of
events, he has his first woman.

INT.  COACH - DAY

Roderick, Captain and Mrs. O'Reilly.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	I needn't ask whether you had a
	comfortable bed.  Young Fred
	Pimpleton slept in it for seven
	months, during which he did me the
	honor to stay with me, and if he was
	satisfied, I don't know who else
	wouldn't be.

EXT.  PROMENADE - PHOENIX PARK - DAY

Roderick, Captain and Mrs. O'Reilly, their friends.
Various cuts.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	After breakfast, we drove out to
	Phoenix Park, where numbers of the
	young gentry were known to Mrs.
	O'Reilly, to all of whom she
	presented me in such a complimentary
	way that, before half an hour, I had
	got to be considered as a gentleman
	of great expectations and large
	property.

INT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had little notion then that I had
	got amongst a set of impostors --
	that Captain O'Reilly was only an
	adventurer, and his lady a person of
	no credit.  The fact was, a young
	man could hardly have fallen into
	worse hands than those in which I
	now found myself.

An evening of gambling.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Their friends were always welcome on
	payment of a certain moderate sum
	for their dinner after which, you
	may be sure, that cards were not
	wanting, and that the company who
	played did not play for love merely.

Various cuts of the characters present.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	What could happen to a man but
	misfortune from associating with
	such company?  And in a very, very
	short time I became their prey.

Roderick loses two hundred guineas to Captain O'Reilly in
a single hand.

We see Captain O'Reilly cheat, but Roderick does not.

He pays him the 18 gold guineas, remaining from the sum
his mother gave him.

			RODERICK
	I shall have to write out a note for
	the rest of it, Captain O'Reilly.

EXT.  STREET - OUTSIDE O'REILLY HOUSE - DAWN

Roderick exits to the street.  The sound of the gambling
can still be heard in the street.  He is soon joined by
Councillor Mulligan.

			COUNCILLOR MULLIGAN
	Master Roderick, you appear a young
	fellow of birth and fortune; let me
	whisper in your ear that you have
	fallen into very bad hands -- it's a
	regular gang of swindlers; and a
	gentleman of your rank and quality
	should never be seen in such
	company.  The captain has been a
	gentleman's gentleman, and his lady
	of no higher rank.  Go home, pack
	your valise, pay the little trifle
	you owe me, mount your mare, and
	ride back again to your parents --
	it's the very best thing you can do.

Roderick does not reply, and walks slowly away from him
down the street.

INT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - RODERICK'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

Roderick enters.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Into a pretty nest of villains,
	indeed, was I plunged!  When I
	returned to my bed-chamber, a few
	hours later, it seemed as if all my
	misfortunes were to break on me at
	once.

Valise open, wardrobe lying on the ground, and Roderick's
keys in the possession of O'Reilly and his wife.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	Whom have I been harboring in my
	house?  Who are you, sirrah?

			RODERICK
	Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a
	gentleman as any in Ireland!

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	You're an impostor, young man, a
	schemer, a deceiver!

			RODERICK
	Repeat the words again, and I run
	you through the body.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	Tut, tut!  I can play at fencing as
	well as you, Mr. Roderick James.
	Ah!  You change color, do you?  Your
	secret is known, is it?  You come
	like a viper into the bosom of
	innocent families; you represent
	yourself as the heir to my friends
	the O'Higgins of Castle O'Higgins; I
	introduce you to the nobility and
	gentry of this methropolis; I take
	you to my tradesmen, who give you
	credit.  I accept your note for near
	two hundred pounds, and what do I
	find?  A fraud.

He holds up the name, Roderick James, printed on the
linen.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	Not Master O'Higgins of Watertown,
	but Roderick James of the devil only
	knows where...

Captain O'Reilly gathers up the linen clothes, silver
toilet articles, and the rest of Roderick's gear.

			RODERICK
	Hark ye, Mr. O'Reilly, I will tell
	you why I was obliged to alter my
	name, which is James and the best
	name in Ireland.  I changed it, sir,
	because, on the day before I came to
	Dublin, I killed a man in deadly
	combat -- an Englishman, sir, and a
	Captain in His Majesty's service;
	and if you offer to let or hinder me
	in the slightest way, the same arm
	which destroyed him is ready to
	punish you.

So saying, Roderick draws his sword like lightning, and
giving a "ha, ha!" and a stamp with his foot, lunges it
within an inch of O'Reilly's heart, who starts back and
turns deadly pale, while his wife, with a scream, flings
herself between them.

			MRS. O'REILLY
	Dearest Roderick -- be pacified.
	O'Reilly, you don't want the poor
	child's blood.  Let him escape -- in
	Heaven's name, let him go.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
		   (sulkily)
	He may go hang for me, and he's
	better be off quickly, for I shall
	go to the magistrate if I see him
	again.

O'Reilly exits.  His wife sits down on the bed and begins
to cry.

EXT.  DUBLIN STREET - DAY

Roderick riding down the street, with his valise.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Where was now a home for the
	descendant of the James?  I was
	expelled from Dublin by a
	persecution occasioned, I must
	confess, by my own imprudence.  I
	had no time to wait and choose.  No
	place of refuge to fly to.

INT.  ALE HOUSE - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	There was a score of recruiting
	parties in the town beating up for
	men to join our gallant armies in
	America and Germany.

Roderick approaches a Captain and a Sergeant, who quickly
make him welcome.

			RODERICK
	I will tell you frankly, sir.  I am
	a young gentleman in difficulties; I
	have killed an officer in a duel,
	and I am anxious to get out of the
	country.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But I needn't have troubled myself
	with any explanations; King George
	was in too much want of men to heed
	from whence they came -- and a
	fellow of my inches was always
	welcome.  Indeed, I could not have
	chosen my time better.  A transport
	was lying at Dunleary, waiting for a
	wind.

EXT.  BRITISH WARSHIP AT SEA - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I never had a taste for any thing
	but genteel company, and hate all
	descriptions of low life.  Hence my
	account of the society in which I at
	present found myself must of
	necessity be short.  The
	reminiscences of the horrid black-
	hole of a place in which we soldiers
	were confined, of the wretched
	creatures with whom I was now forced
	to keep company, of the plowmen,
	poachers, pickpockets, who had taken
	refuge from poverty, or the law, as,
	in truth, I had done myself, is
	enough to make me ashamed even now.

Roderick sits very disconsolately over a platter of rancid
bacon and moldy biscuit, which is served to him at mess.
When it comes to his turn to be helped to drink, he is
served, like the rest, with dirty tin noggin, containing
somewhat more than half a pint of rum and water.  The
beaker is so greasy and filthy that he cannot help turning
round to the messman and saying:

			RODERICK
	Fellow, get me a glass!

At which, all the wretches round him burst into a roar of
laughter, the very loudest among them being Mr. Toole, a
red-haired monster of a man.

			MR. TOOLE
	Get the gentleman a towel for his
	hands, and serve him a basin of
	turtle-soup.

Roars the monster, who is sitting, or rather squatting, on
the deck opposite him, and as he speaks, he suddenly
seizes Roderick's beaker of grog and empties it in midst
of another burst of applause.

			LINK-BOY
		   (whispers)
	If you want to vex him, ask him
	about his wife, the washerwoman, who
	bates him.

			RODERICK
	Is it a towel of your wife's
	washing, Mr. Toole?  I'm told she
	wiped your face often with one.

			LINK-BOY
		   (whispers)
	Ask him why he wouldn't see her
	yesterday, when she came to the
	ship.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And so I put to him some other
	foolish jokes about soapsuds, hen-
	pecking, and flat-irons, which set
	the man into a fury, and succeeded
	in raising a quarrel between us.

Roderick and Toole fight with cudgels.  Roderick gives him
a thump across his head which lays him lifeless on the
floor.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	This victory over the cock of the
	vile dunghill obtained me respect
	among the wretches among whom I
	formed part.

EXT.  MILITARY DRILL FIELD - CUXHAVEN - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Our passage was very favorable, and
	in two days we landed at Cuxhaven,
	and before I had been a month in the
	Electorate, I was transported into a
	tall and proper young soldier, and,
	having a natural aptitude for
	military exercise, was soon as
	accomplished at the drill as the
	oldest sergeant in the regiment.

Various cuts.

Roderick learning the soldierly arts, musket drill, manual
of arms, bayonet, marching.

EXT.  MILITARY COURTYARD - CUXHAVEN - DAY

The Cuxhaven troops are drawn up to receive a new
regiment, arrived from England.

Roderick sees, marching at the head of his company, his
old friend, Captain Grogan, who gives him a wink.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Six weeks after we arrived in
	Cuxhaven, we were reinforced by
	Gales regiment of foot from England,
	and I promise you the sight of
	Grogan's face was most welcome to
	me, for it assured me that a friend
	was near me.

INT.  GROGAN'S QUARTERS - DAY

Roderick and Grogan.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Grogan gave me a wink of
	recognition, but offered no public
	token of acquaintance and it was not
	until two days afterwards that he
	called me into his quarters, and
	then, shaking hands with me
	cordially, gave me news which I
	wanted, of my family.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith,
	you've begun early, like your
	father's son, but I think you could
	not do better than as you have done.
	But why did you not write home to
	your poor mother?  She has sent
	half-a-dozen letters to you in
	Dublin.

			RODERICK
	I suppose she addressed them to me
	in my real name, by which I never
	thought to ask for them at the post
	office.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	We must write to her today, and you
	can tell her that you are safe and
	married to "Brown Bess."

Roderick sighs when Grogan says the word "married," on
which Grogan says with a laugh:

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	I see you are thinking of a certain
	young lady at Duganstown.

			RODERICK
	Is Miss Dugan well?

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	There's only six Miss Dugans now...
	poor Dorothy.

			RODERICK
	Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she
	died of grief?

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	She took on so at your going away
	that she was obliged to console
	herself with a husband.  She is now
	Mrs. John Best.

			RODERICK
	Mrs. John Best!  Was there another
	Mr. John Best?!

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	No, the very same one, my boy.  He
	recovered from his wound.  The ball
	you hit him with was not likely to
	hurt him.  It was only made of tow.
	Do you think the Dugans would let
	you kill fifteen hundred a-year out
	of the family?  The plan of the duel
	was all arranged in order to get you
	out of the way, for the cowardly
	Englishman could never be brought to
	marry from fear of you.  But hit him
	you certainly did, Roderick, and
	with a fine thick plugget of tow,
	and the fellow was so frightened
	that he was an hour in coming to.
	We told your mother the story
	afterwards, and a pretty scene she
	made.

			RODERICK
	The coward!

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	He has paid off your uncle's
	mortgage.  He gave Dorothy a coach-
	and-six.  That coward of a fellow
	has been making of your uncle's
	family.  Faith, the business was
	well done.  Your cousins, Michael
	and Harry, never let him out of
	their sight, though he was for
	deserting to England, until the
	marriage was completed, and the
	happy couple off on their road to
	Dublin.  Are you in want of cash, my
	boy?  You may draw upon me, for I got
	a couple of hundred out of Master
	Best for my share and, while they
	last, you shall never want.

EXT.  VARIOUS LOCATIONS - BRITISH ON THE MARCH - DAY

Roderick on the march.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Our regiment, which was quartered
	about Stade and Luneberg, speedily
	had got orders to march southwards
	towards the Rhine, where we would
	fight the famous battle of Minden.
	It would require a greater
	philosopher and historian than I am
	to explain the causes of the famous
	Seven Years' War in which Europe was
	engaged, and, indeed, its origin has
	always appeared to me to be so
	complicated, and the books written
	about it so amazingly hard to
	understand, that I have seldom been
	much wiser at the end of a chapter
	than at the beginning, and so shall
	not trouble you with any personal
	disquisitions concerning the matter.

Various cuts featuring Roderick; marching, cooking at open
fires, gambling, resting in a farm yard, officers riding
by; shivering in his blanket.

EXT.  BATTLEFIELD OF MINDEN - BATTLE FRAGMENT - DAY

Roderick and his company.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Were these memoirs not characterized
	by truth, I might easily make myself
	the hero of some strange and popular
	adventures.

EXT.  MINDEN - BATTLE FRAGMENTS - DAY

Officers ride by in smoke.  Troops marching to the attack.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But I saw no one of the higher ranks
	that day than my colonel and a
	couple of orderly officers riding by
	in the smoke -- no one on our side,
	that is.  A poor corporal is not
	generally invited into the company
	of commanders and the great.

Roderick advancing.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But, in revenge, I saw, I promise
	you, some very good company on the
	French part, for their regiments of
	Lorraine and Royal Cravate were
	charging us all day; and in the sort
	of melee high and low are pretty
	equally received.  I hate bragging,
	but I cannot help saying that I made
	a very close acquaintance with the
	colonel of the Cravates.

Roderick firing his musket.  He bayonets a French colonel,
amidst shouts and curses.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And finished off a poor little
	ensign, so young, slender, and
	small, that a blow from my pigtail
	would have dispatched him.

Roderick kills a French ensign with a blows from the butt
of his musket.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And in the poor ensign's pocket
	found a purse of fourteen louis
	d'or, and a silver box of sugar-
	plums, of which the former present
	was very agreeable to me.

Roderick taking money and the box of sugar-plums from the
ensign.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	If people would tell their stories
	of battles in this simple way, I
	think the cause of truth would not
	suffer by it.  All I know of this
	famous fight of Minden, except from
	books, is told here above.

Captain Grogan is shot, cries out, and falls.

A brother captain turns to Lieutenant Lakenham.

			CAPTAIN
	Grogan's down; Lakenham, there's
	your company.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	That was all the epitaph my brave
	patron got.

Roderick kneels above Grogan.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	I should have left you a hundred
	guineas, Roderick, but for a cursed
	run of ill-luck last night at faro.

He gives Roderick a faint squeeze of the hand; and, as the
word is given to advance, Roderick leaves him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	When we came back to our ground,
	which we presently did, he was lying
	still, but he was dead.  Some of our
	people had already torn off his
	epaulets, and, no doubt, had rifled
	his purse.

EXT.  VARIOUS ROUGH RURAL LOCATIONS - DAY

Short cuts to voice over.

Roderick and British troops rape, pillage and burn.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	After the death of my protector,
	Captain Grogan, I am forced to
	confess that I fell into the very
	worst of courses and company.  In a
	foreign country, with the enemy
	before us, and the people
	continually under contribution from
	one side or the other, numberless
	irregularities were permitted to the
	troops.  It is well for gentlemen to
	talk of the age of chivalry; but
	remember the starving brutes whom
	they lead -- men nursed in poverty,
	entirely ignorant, made to take
	pride in deeds of blood -- men who
	can have no amusement but in
	drunkenness, debauch, and plunder.
	It is with these shocking
	instruments that your great warriors
	and kings have been doing their
	murderous work in the world.

EXT.  BATTLEFIELD - WARBURG - BATTLE FRAGMENTS - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The year in which George II died,
	our regiment had the honor to be
	present at the Battle of Warburg,
	where Prince Ferdinand once more
	completely defeated the Frenchmen.

Lieutenant Lakenham is shot, falls, and cries for help.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	During the action, my lieutenant,
	Mr. Lakenham, of Lakenham, was
	struck by a musket-ball in the side.
	He had shown no want of courage in
	this or any other occasion where he
	had been called upon to act against
	the French; but this was his first
	wound, and the young gentleman was
	exceedingly frightened by it.

			LAKENHAM
	Here, you, Roderick James.  I will
	pay you five guineas if you will
	carry me into the town which is hard
	by those woods.

Roderick and another man take him up in a cloak, and carry
him towards the nearby town of Warburg.

EXT.  A FARMHOUSE - GERMAN STREET - WARBURG - DAY

In order to get into the house, Roderick and the other man
are obliged to fire into the locks with their pieces,
which summons brings the inhabitants of the house to the
door; a very pretty and black-eyed, young woman, and her
old, half-blinded father.

They are at first unwilling to accommodate the guest, but
Mr. Lakenham, speaking to them in German, and taking a
couple of guineas out of a very full purse, speedily
convinces the people that they have only to deal with a
person of honor.

INT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

They carry Lieutenant Lakenham to bed and receive their
five guineas.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	We put the patient to bed, and he
	paid me the stipulated reward.  A
	young surgeon, who desired nothing
	better than to take himself out of
	the fire of the musketry, came
	presently to dress the wound.

In his German jargon, Roderick pays some deserved
compliments to the black-eyed beauty of Warburg, thinking,
with no small envy, how comfortable it would be to be
billeted there.

EXT.  STREET - WARBURG - OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE - DAY

He starts back to the regiment, with his comrade, when the
man interrupts his reverie by suggesting they divide the
five guineas.

			PRIVATE
	I should get half.

			RODERICK
	Your share is one guinea.

Roderick gives him one guinea.

			PRIVATE
	He gave you five guineas, and I
	bloody well expect half.

			RODERICK
	Go to the devil.

The private lifting his musket, hits Roderick a blow with
the butt-end of it, which sends him stunned to the ground,
allowing his comrade to take the other four guineas from
his pocket.

Recovering his senses, Roderick bleeding, with a large
wound in the head, has barely time to stagger back to the
house where he had just left the lieutenant, when he
falls fainting at the door, just as the surgeon exits.

INT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

Roderick is carried by the surgeon and the black-eyed
girl, into another bed in the room where the Lieutenant
has been laid.

			LAKENHAM
		   (languidly, in pain)
	Who are you putting into that bed?

			LISCHEN
	We have the Corporal, wounded, to
	you bringing.

			LAKENHAM
	A corporal?  Turn him out.  Schicken
	sie Herrn Koporal weg!

INT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT AND DAY

Lischen brings Roderick a refreshing drink; and, as he
takes it, he presses the kind hand that gave it to him;
nor does this token of his gratitude seem unwelcome.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I found Lischen the tenderest of
	nurses.  Whenever any delicacy was
	to be provided for the wounded
	lieutenant, a share was always sent
	to the bed opposite his, and to the
	avaricious man's no small annoyance.

Lischen serving food.

Various cuts, representing different days.

Lakenham behaving as rottenly as Roderick describes:

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Nor was I the only person in the
	house to whom the worthy gentleman
	was uncivil.  He ordered the fair
	Lischen hither and thither, made
	impertinent love to her, abused her
	soups, quarreled with her
	omelettes, and grudged the money
	which was laid out for his
	maintenance, so that our hostess
	detested him as much as, I think,
	without vanity, as she regarded me.

Roderick making lover to Lischen while Lieutenant Lakenham
sulks in the next bed.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	For if truth must be told, I had
	made very deep love to her during my
	stay under her roof, as is always my
	way with women, of whatever age or
	degree of beauty.  Do not think me
	very cruel and heartless, ladies;
	this heart of Lischen's was like
	many a town, which had been stormed
	and occupied several times before I
	came to invest it,

Roderick sitting up in bed.  Lischen has just served him
his supper.

Enter a British officer, an aide who carries a notebook,
and a surgeon.  In a brief scene to be written, we learn
that a sudden movement on the part of the French requires
the British army to follow them.  The town is to be
evacuated, except for some Prussian line-of-communication
troops, whose surgeons are to visit the wounded in the
place; and, when they are well, they are to be drafted to
their regiments.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I began to reflect how pleasant my
	quarters were to me, and that I was
	much better here than crawling under
	an odious tent with a parcel of
	tipsy soldiers, or going the night-
	rounds, or rising long before
	daybreak for drill.  I determined
	that I never would join mine again.

EXT.  VIEW OUT OF WARBURG FARMHOUSE WINDOW - DAY

Roderick stands by the window, watching English troops and
wagons leaving the town.

INT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

Roderick walks into Lakenham's room attired in his full
regimentals, and with his hat cocked over his left eye.

			RODERICK
	I'm promoted Lieutenant.  I've come
	to take my leave of you.  I intend
	to have your papers and purse.

			LAKENHAM
	You great scoundrel!  You mutinous
	dog!  What do you mean by dressing
	yourself in my regimentals?  As sure
	as my name's Lakenham, when we get
	back to the regiment, I'll have your
	soul cut out of your body.

With this, Roderick puts his hand under his pillow, at
which Lakenham gives a scream that might have called the
whole garrison about his ears.

Roderick threatens him with a knife at his throat.

			RODERICK
	Hark ye, sir!  No more noise, or you
	are a dead man!

Roderick, taking his handkerchief, binds it tight round
his mouth, and, pulling forward the sleeves of his shirt,
ties them in a knot together, and so leaves him, removing
the papers and the purse, and wishing him politely a good
day.

EXT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - STREET - DAY

Lischen, waiting outside the house, with a saddled horse,
throws her arms around him, and makes the tenderest adieu.

Roderick mounts his newly-purchased animal, waves his hat
gallantly, and, prances away down the street.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Roderick happily riding along a wooded country road,
rounds a blind bend and sees suddenly before him, about
two hundred yards away, a company of Prussian infantry
resting along the sides of the road, together with a dozen
mounted dragoons.

A quick calculation tells him that is is better to proceed
than to turn back, and he rides into their midst,
approaching a group of officers.

He presents himself as Lieutenant Lakenham and asks for
directions to join his regiment.  He is told that he is
riding in the wrong direction, and is shown a map.

During the explanation, Captain Galgenstein approaches
with an open, smiling countenance, introduces himself, and
says he, too, is bound for the same place, and asks if
Roderick will honor him with his company.

To avoid suspicion, Roderick readily accepts the offer,
and the two men mount up, and ride off together.

EXT.  ROAD - GERMANY - DAY

Roderick and Galgenstein riding together.

Dialogue under voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My companion treated me with great
	civility, and asked me a thousand
	questions about England, which I
	answered as best I might.  But this
	best, I am bound to say, was bad
	enough.  I knew nothing about
	England, and I invented a thousand
	stories which I told him; described
	the king and the ministers to him,
	said the British ambassador in
	Berlin was my uncle, and promised my
	acquaintance a letter of
	recommendation to him.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	What is your uncle's name?

			RODERICK
		   (slowly)
	O'Grady.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
		   (with a laugh)
	Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador
	O'Grady...

EXT.  DESOLATE GERMAN ROAD - DAY

Roderick and Captain Galgenstein.  Their horses' heads
together, jogging on.

They pass a party of recruits under the armed guard of a
red-coated Hanoverian sergeant.

He exchanges signs of recognition with Captain
Galgenstein.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	It hurts my feelings to be obliged
	to commune with such wretches, but
	the stern necessities of war demand
	men continually, and hence these
	recruiters whom you see market in
	human flesh.  They get five-and-
	twenty thaler a man from our
	government for every man they bring
	in.  For fine men -- for men like
	you.
		   (he adds laughing)
	They would go as high as hundred.

EXT.  DESOLATE GERMAN INN - LATE AFTERNOON

Roderick and Captain Galgenstein approach a very lonely-
looking place.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	This is a very good inn.  Shall we
	stop for dinner?

			RODERICK
	This may be a very good inn for
	Germany, but it would not pass in
	old Ireland.  Corbach is only a
	league off, let us push on for
	Corbach.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Do you want to see the loveliest
	woman in Europe?

Roderick smiles.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will
	influence you.

			RODERICK
	The place seems more a farm than an
	inn-yard.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	The people are great farmers, as
	well as inn-keepers.

They enter by a great gate into a court, walled round, and
at on end of which is the building, a dingy ruinous place.

A couple of covered wagons are in the courtyard; their
horses are littered under a shed hard by.

Lounging about the place are some men, and a pair of
sergeants in the Prussian uniform, who both touch their
hats to the captain.

The inn has something foreboding about it, and the men
shut the great yard-gates as soon as they enter.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
		   (explaining the gate)
	Parties of French horsemen are about
	the country, and one cannot take too
	many precautions against such
	villains.

The two sergeant take charge of the horses; the captain
orders one of them to take Roderick's valise to his
bedroom.

Roderick promises the sergeant a glass of schnapps for his
pains.

They enter into supper.

INT.  GERMAN INN - LATE AFTERNOON

A dish of fried eggs and bacon is ordered from a hideous
old wench that comes to serve them, in place of the lovely
creature which had been expected; and the captain,
laughing, says:

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Well, our meal is a frugal one, but
	a soldier has many a time a worse.

Taking off his hat, sword-belt, and gloves, with great
ceremony, Galgenstein sits down to eat.  Roderick puts his
weapons securely on the old chest of drawers where the
captain's is laid.

The hideous old woman brings in a pot of very sour wine,
at which, and at her ugliness, Roderick feels a
considerable ill-humor.

			RODERICK
		   (when she leaves)
	Where's the beauty you promised me?

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
		   (laughing and looking
		    hard at Roderick)
	It was my joke.  I was tired, and
	did not care to go farther.  There's
	not prettier woman here than that.
	If she won't suit your fancy, my
	friend, then you must wait awhile.

This increases Roderick's ill-humor.

			RODERICK
		   (sternly)
	Upon my word, sir, I think you have
	acted very coolly.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	I have acted as I think fit.

			RODERICK
	Sir, I'm a British officer.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	It's a lie!  You're a deserter!
	You're an impostor, sir; Your lies
	and folly have confirmed this to me.
	You pretend to carry dispatches to a
	general who has been dead these ten
	months; you have an uncle who is an
	ambassador and whose name you don't
	know.  Will you join and take the
	bounty, sir, or will you be given
	up?

			RODERICK
	Neither!

Springing at him like a tiger.

But, agile as he is, Galgenstein is equally on his guard.
He takes two pistols out of his pockets, fires one off,
and says, from the other end of the table where he stands
dodging Roderick, as it were.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Advance a step, and I send this
	bullet into your brains!

The door is flung open, and the two sergeants enter, armed
with musket and bayonet to aid their captain.

The game is up.  Roderick flings down a knife with which
he had armed himself, for the old hag, on bringing in the
wine, had removed his sword.

			RODERICK
	I volunteer.

EXT.  A ROAD - DAY

Prussian troops on the march.  Roderick is now one of
them.

Captain Galgenstein rides by.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	At the close of the Seven Years' War,
	the Prussian army, so renowned for
	its disciplined valor, was
	officered and under-officered by
	native Prussians, it is true, but
	was composed for the most part of
	men hired or stolen, like myself,
	from almost every nation in Europe.
	The deserting to and fro was
	prodigious.

EXT.  A FIELD - DAY

Prussian punishment gauntlet.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The life the private soldier led was
	a frightful one to any but the men
	of iron courage and endurance.  The
	punishment was incessant.

EXT.  VARIOUS RURAL LOCATIONS - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I was not near so unhappy, in spite
	of all, as I had been on my first
	enlisting in Ireland.  At least,
	there will be no one of my
	acquaintance who will witness my
	shame, and that is the point which I
	have always cared for most.

Rape, pillage and burn.

Brief thematic repeat of British army version.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I reasoned with myself thus:  "Now
	you are caught, there is no use in
	repining -- make the best of your
	situation, and get all the pleasure
	you can out of it.  There are a
	thousand opportunities of plunder,
	offered to the soldier in war time,
	out of which he can get both
	pleasure and profit; make use of
	these, and be happy."

EXT.  BATTLEFIELD - FRAGMENT

Prussians against Austrians, or French, or Saxons.

Roderick fighting.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I do not intend to make a history of
	battles in the Prussian any more
	than in the English service.  I did
	my duty in them as well as another,
	and there was not a braver,
	cleverer, handsomer, and, I must
	own, wickeder soldier in the
	Prussian army.

EXT.  BATTLEFIELD - ACTION - DAY

			RODERICK
	I had formed myself to the condition
	of the proper fighting beast; on a
	day of action, I was savage and
	happy.

Roderick saves Captain Galgenstein's life.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

Roderick is decorated by Colonel Bulow for his heroism in
saving Captain Galgenstein.

Colonel Bulow gives Roderick two Frederic d'or in front of
the regiment.

			COLONEL BULOW
	You are a gallant soldier, and have
	evidently come of good stock; but
	you are idle, dissolute, and
	unprincipled; you have done a deal
	of harm to the men; and, for all
	your talents and bravery, I am sure
	you will come to no good.

			RODERICK
	I hope Colonel Bulow is mistaken
	regarding my character.  I have
	fallen into bad company, it is true;
	but I have only done as other
	soldiers have done; and, above all,
	I have never had a kind friend and
	protector before, to whom I might
	show that I was worthy of better
	things.  The Colonel may say I am a
	ruined lad, and send me to the
	devil; but be sure of this, I would
	go to the devil to serve the
	regiment.

Captain Galgenstein looks pleased with Roderick's
performance.

BERLIN - 1763

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Soon after the war ended, our
	regiment was garrisoned in the
	capital, the least dull, perhaps, of
	all the towns of Prussia; but that
	does not say much for its gaiety.

INT.  ANTE-ROOM - CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN'S OFFICE - DAY

Roderick enters and approaches the Captain's sergeant.

			RODERICK
	Private Roderick James.  First
	Hanoverian Guards.  Captain
	Galgenstein sent for me.

			PRUSSIAN SERGEANT
	You may wait.

			RODERICK
	Thank you, sir.

Roderick stands stiffly.  We can make out the sound of
loud talking behind the closed door.

Enter a private huffing and puffing.

			PRIVATE
	Sergeant, the wagon has arrived with
	the Captain's furniture, but the
	driver says he is not supposed to
	unload it.  Is it possible for you
	to talk to him?

Exit the sergeant, muttering.  Roderick, now alone in the
office, walks closer to the door so that he can hear what
is being said.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN (O.S.)
	Give him his discharge!  Bon Dieu!
	You are a model of probity!  You'll
	never succeed to my place, my dear
	nephew, if you are no wiser than you
	are just now.  Make the fellow as
	useful to you as you please.  You
	say he has a good manner and a frank
	countenance, that he can lie with
	assurance, and fight, you say, on a
	pinch.  The scoundrel does not want
	for good qualities.  As long as you
	have the regiment in terrorem over
	him, you can do as you like with
	him.  Once let him loose, and the lad
	is likely to give you the slip.
	Keep on promising him; promise to
	make him a general, if you like.
	What the deuce do I care?  There are
	spies enough to be had in this town
	without him.

Roderick hears the sergeant returning and walks back to
the door.

Then the office door opens, Captain Galgenstein looks out,
sees Roderick, smiles and say:

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Good morning, Private James.  Please
	come in.  I should like you to meet
	my uncle, Herr Minister of Police
	Galgenstein.

			RODERICK
	How do you do, sir?

The Minister nods.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The captain was the nephew and heir
	of the Minister of Police, Herr
	Galgenstein, a relationship which,
	no doubt, aided in the younger
	gentlemen's promotion.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Your loyalty to me and your service
	to the regiment has pleased me very
	well -- and now there is another
	occasion on which you may make
	yourself useful to us; if you
	succeed, depend on it, your reward
	will be your discharge from the
	army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.

			RODERICK
	What is the service, sir?

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	There is lately come to Berlin a
	gentleman in the service of the
	Empress Queen, who calls himself the
	Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears
	the red riband and star of the
	pope's order of the Spur.  He is
	made for good society, polished,
	obliging, a libertine, without
	prejudices, fond of women, of good
	food, of high play, prudent and
	discreet.

The Captain smiles at Roderick.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	He speaks Italian and French
	indifferently; but we have some
	reason to fancy this Monsieur de
	Belle Fast is a native of your
	country of Ireland, and that he has
	come here as a spy.

The Captain rises and begins to pace back and forth.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Naturally, your knowledge of English
	makes you an ideal choice to go into
	his service.  Of course, you will
	not know a word of English; and if
	the Chevalier asks as to the
	particularity of your accent, say
	you are Hungarian.  The servant who
	came with him will be turned away
	today, and the person to whom he has
	applied for a faithful fellow will
	recommend you.

Roderick nods.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	You are a Hungarian; you served in
	the army, and left on account of
	weakness in the loins.  He gambles a
	great deal, and wins.  Do you know
	the cards well?

			RODERICK
	Only a very little, as soldiers do.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	I had thought you more expert.  You
	must find out if the Chevalier
	cheats.  He sees the English and
	Austrian envoys continually, and the
	young men of either ministry sup
	repeatedly at his house.  Find out
	what they talk of, for how much each
	plays, especially if any of them
	play on parole.  If you are able to,
	read his private letters, though
	about those which go to the post,
	you need not trouble yourself -- we
	look at them there.  But never see
	him write a note without finding out
	to whom it goes, and by what channel
	or messenger.  He sleeps with the
	keys of his dispatch-box with a
	string around his neck -- twenty
	frederics, if you get an impression
	of the keys.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	Does this assignment interest you?

			RODERICK
	Yes, Minister, I am interested in
	any work in which I can be of
	service to Captain Galgenstein.

The Minister studies Roderick, coldly.

EXT.  CHEVALIER DE BELLE FAST'S HOUSE - BERLIN - DAY

Roderick, now dressed in civilian clothes, admires a
beautiful carriage, waiting at the door.  Then he enters.

INT.  CHEVALIER DE BELLE FAST'S APARTMENT - DAY

			CHEVALIER
	You are the young man who M. de
	Seebach recommended?

			RODERICK
	Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.

Roderick bows, and hands him a letter from that gentleman,
with which the Captain had taken care to provide him.

As the Chevalier reads the letter, Roderick has the
leisure to examine him.

He is a man of sixty years of age, dressed superbly,
wearing rings, diamonds and laces.

One of his eyes is closed with a black patch, and he wears
a little white and red paint, and a pair of moustachios,
which fall over his lip.

The Chevalier is seated at a table near the window to read
the letter.

			CHEVALIER
	Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?

			RODERICK
	Yes, sir.

			CHEVALIER
	You come highly recommended by Herr
	Seebach.

			RODERICK
	Herr Seebach was a very kind
	employer.

			CHEVALIER
	For whom else have you worked?

			RODERICK
	No one, sir.  Before that I served
	in the army but had to leave due to
	weakness of the loins.

			CHEVALIER
	Who else can give me information
	about you?

			RODERICK
	Only the agency of servants.

The Chevalier puts the letter down, looks at Roderick for
a few seconds, and then smiles.

			CHEVALIER
	You will do.  I will give you 30...
	a day.  I do not provide your
	clothing; you will sleep at home,
	and you will be at my orders every
	morning at seven o'clock.

He notices Roderick begin to tremble and look peculiar.

			CHEVALIER
	Is there something wrong?

He goes up to Roderick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	It was very imprudent of me; but
	when I saw the splendor of his
	appearance, the nobleness of his
	manner, I felt it impossible to keep
	disguise with him.  You, who have
	never been out of your country know
	little what it is to hear a friendly
	voice in captivity; and there's a
	many a man that will understand the
	cause of the burst of feeling which
	was about to take place.

The Chevalier takes Roderick by the shoulder.

			RODERICK
		   (as he speaks,
		    bursting into tears)
	Sir, I have a confession to make.  I
	am an Irishman, and my name is
	Roderick James.  I was abducted into
	the Prussian army two years ago, and
	now I have been put into your
	service by my Captain and his uncle,
	the Minister of Police, to serve as
	a watch upon your actions, of which
	I am to give information to the same
	quarter.  For this odious service, I
	have been promised my discharge, and
	a hundred guineas.

Sobbing, Roderick falls into his arms.

			CHEVALIER
	The rascals!  They think to catch
	me, do they?  Why, young man, my
	chief conspiracy is a faro-bank.
	But the king is so jealous, that he
	will see a spy in every person who
	comes to his miserable capital, in
	the great sandy desert here.

EXT.  BERLIN - PARK - DAY

Roderick and the Chevalier walking.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And I think he was as much affected
	as I was at thus finding one of his
	kindred; for he, too, was an exile
	from home, and a friendly voice, a
	look, brought the old country back
	to his memory again, and the old
	days of his boyhood.

			CHEVALIER
	I'd give five years of my life to
	see the old country again, the
	greenfields, and the river, and the
	old round tower, and the burying
	place.

EXT.  BERLIN - STREET - DAY

Roderick and the Chevalier walking.

			CHEVALIER
	My lad, I have been in every
	service; and, between ourselves, owe
	money in every capital in Europe.  I
	have been a rolling stone.  Play --
	play has been my ruin!  That and
	beauty.  The women have made a fool
	of me, my dear boy.  I am a soft-
	hearted creature, and this minute,
	at sixty-two, have no more command
	of myself than when Peggy O'Dwyer
	made a fool of me at sixteen.

EXT.  BERLIN - LAKE WANNSEE - DAY

Roderick and the Chevalier walking along the bank.

			CHEVALIER
	The cards are now my only
	livelihood.  Sometimes I am in luck,
	and then I lay out my money in these
	trinkets you see.  It's property,
	look you, and the only way I have
	found of keeping a little about me.
	When the luck goes against me, why,
	my dear, my diamonds go to the
	pawnbrokers and I wear paste.  Do
	you understand the cards?

			RODERICK
	I can play as soldiers do, but have
	no great skill.

			CHEVALIER
	We will practice in the mornings, my
	boy, and I'll put you up to a thing
	or two worth knowing.

INT.  CHEVALIER'S ROOMS - BERLIN - DAY

Quick cuts -- Roderick being taught the profession of
cards and the dice-box.

EXT.  GARDEN HOUSE - BERLIN - DAY

Roderick, Minister Galgenstein, and Captain Galgenstein.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I carried my little reports to
	Captain Galgenstein at the Garden
	house outside the town where he gave
	me rendezvous.  These reports, of
	course, were arranged between me and
	the Chevalier beforehand.  I was
	instructed, and it is always the
	best way, to tell as much truth as
	my story would possible bear.

Dialogue comes up from under voice over.

			RODERICK
	He goes to church regularly -- he is
	very religious, and after hearing
	mass comes home to breakfast.  Then
	he takes an airing in his chariot
	till dinner, which is served at
	noon.  After dinner, he writes his
	letters, if he has any letters to
	write; but he has very little to do
	in this way.  His letters are to the
	Austrian envoy, with whom he
	corresponds, but who does not
	acknowledge him; and being written
	in English, or course, I look over
	his shoulder.  He generally writes
	for money.  He makes his party with
	Calsabigi, the lottery contractor,
	the Russian attaches, two from the
	English embassy, my lords Deuceace
	and Punter, who play a jeu d'enfer,
	and a few more.  He wins often, but
	not always.  Lord Deuceace is a very
	fine player.  The Chevalier Elliott,
	the English Minister, sometimes
	comes, on which occasion the
	secretaries do not play.

INT.  CHEVALIER'S APARTMENTS - NIGHT

The Chevalier is at play against several gentlemen,
including the Prince of Turbingen, while Roderick signals
the cards.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	It was agreed that I should keep my
	character of valet, that in the
	presence of strangers I should not
	know a word of English, that I
	should keep good lookout on the
	trumps when I was serving the
	champagne and punch about; and,
	having a remarkably fine eyesight,
	and a great natural aptitude, I was
	speedily able to give my dear
	benefactor much assistance against
	his opponents at the green table.

Several cuts of playing and cheating to illustrate voice
over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Simplicity was our secret.
	Everything successful is simple.
	If, for instance, I wiped the dust
	off a chair with my napkin, it was
	to show that the enemy was strong in
	diamonds; if I pushed it, he had an
	ace, king; if I said, "Punch or
	wine, my lord?" hearts was meant.
	If "Wine or punch?" clubs.  If I
	blew my nose, it was to indicate
	that there was another confederate
	employed by the adversary; and then,
	I warrant you, some pretty trials of
	skill would take place.  The Prince
	of Turbingen, although so young, had
	a very great skill and cleverness
	with the cards in every way; and it
	was only from hearing Ritter von
	Brandenburg, who came with him, yawn
	three times when the Chevalier had
	the ace of trumps, that I knew we
	were Greek to Greek, as it were.

The Prince loses a big hand, and, in a fury, throws down
his cards.  He stares at the table, then at the Chevalier.

			PRINCE
	Chevalier, though I cannot say how,
	I believe you have cheated me.

			CHEVALIER
	I deny your Grace's accusations, and
	beg you to say how you have been
	cheated?

			PRINCE
		   (glaring at Roderick)
	I don't know.

			CHEVALIER
	Your Grace owes me seventy thousand
	frederics, which I have honorably
	won.

			PRINCE
	Chevalier, if you will have your
	money now, you must fight for it.
	If you will be patient, maybe I will
	pay you something another time.

			CHEVALIER
	Your Grace, if I am so tame as to
	take this, then I must give up an
	honorable and lucrative occupation.

			PRINCE
	I have said all there is to be said.
	I am at your disposal for whatever
	purposes you wish.  Good night.

He exits.

EXT.  GARDEN HOUSE - DAY

Roderick, Captain Galgenstein and Minister Galgenstein.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	Was he cheated?

			RODERICK
	In so far as I can tell these things
	-- no.  I believe the Chevalier won
	the money fairly.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	Hmm-mmmm.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	What are the Chevalier's intentions?

			RODERICK
	I am not sure.  The Prince told him
	quite clearly that if he wished to
	have the money, he would have to
	fight for it.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	A meeting with the Prince of
	Turbingen is impossible.

			RODERICK
	The Prince left him only that
	choice.

The Captain and the Minister walk a few steps away and
speak in whispers.

Then they return to Roderick.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	Will you be able to return here
	tomorrow without arousing suspicion?

INT.  CHEVALIER'S APARTMENTS - DAY

			CHEVALIER
	Tell them I intend to demand
	satisfaction from the Prince.

			RODERICK
	But they will prevent a meeting at
	whatever the cost.

			CHEVALIER
	Have no fear.  It will come out well
	for me.

			RODERICK
	I believe they will deport you.

			CHEVALIER
	I have faced that problem before.

			RODERICK
	But, if they send you away, then
	what is to become of me?

			CHEVALIER
		   (with a smile)
	Make your mind easy, you shall not
	be left behind, I warrant you.  Do
	take a last look at your barracks,
	make your mind easy, say a farewell
	to your friends in Berlin.  The dear
	souls, how they will weep when they
	hear you are out of the country,
	and, out of it, you shall go.

			RODERICK
	But how, sir?

EXT.  GARDEN HOUSE - BERLIN - DAY

Roderick, Captain Galgenstein and Minister Galgenstein.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	The King has determined to send the
	Chevalier out of the country.

			RODERICK
	When is he to go?

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Has he sent the challenge yet?

			RODERICK
	Not yet, but I believe he intends
	to.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	Then this must be done tomorrow.

			RODERICK
	What is to be done?

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	You say he drives after breakfast
	and before dinner.  When he comes
	out to his carriage a couple of
	gendarmes will mount the box, and
	the coachman will get his orders to
	move on.

			RODERICK
	And his baggage?

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Oh!  That will be sent after him.  I
	have a fancy to look into that red
	box which contains his papers, you
	say; and at noon, after parade,
	shall be at the inn.  You will not
	say a word to any one there
	regarding the affair, and will wait
	for me at the Chevalier's rooms
	until my arrival.  We must force
	that box.  You are a clumsy hound,
	or you would have got the key long
	ago.

EXT.  CHEVALIER'S APARTMENTS - DAY

Action as per voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	At ten o'clock the next morning, the
	carriage of the Chevalier de Belle
	Fast drew up as usual at the door of
	his hotel, and the Chevalier came
	down the stairs in his usual stately
	manner.

Looking around and not finding his servant to open the
door.

			CHEVALIER
	Where is my rascal, Lazlo?

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
		   (standing by the
		    carriage)
	I will let down the steps for your
	honor.

No sooner does the Chevalier enter than the officer jumps
in after him, another mounts the box by the coachman, and
the latter begins to drive.

			CHEVALIER
	Good gracious!  What is this?

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
		   (touching his hat)
	You are going to drive to the
	frontier.

			CHEVALIER
	It is shameful -- infamous!  I
	insist upon being put down at the
	Austrian ambassador's house.

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
	I have orders to gag your honor if
	you cry out, and to give you this
	purse containing ten thousand
	frederics if you do not.

			CHEVALIER
	Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel
	owes me seventy thousand.

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
	Your honor must lower his voice.

			CHEVALIER
		   (whispering)
	All Europe shall hear of this!

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
	As you please.

Both lapse into silence.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

The coach drives by.  Suddenly -- "boom," the alarm cannon
begins to roar.

INT.  COACH - DAY

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
	Do not be alarmed.  The alarm cannon
	only signals a deserter.

Chevalier nods.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

The coach drives by and action as described.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Hearing the sound of the alarm
	cannon, the common people came out
	along the road, with fowling-pieces
	and pitch-forks, in hopes to catch
	the truant.  The gendarmes looked
	very anxious to be on the lookout
	for him too.  The price of a
	deserter was fifty crowns to those
	who brought him in.

EXT.  SAXON CUSTOM-HOUSE - DAY

The black and white barriers came in view at last hard by
Bruck, and opposite them the green and yellow of Saxony.
The Saxon custom-house officers came out.

			CHEVALIER
	I have no luggage.

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
	The gentleman has nothing
	contraband.

The Prussian officers, grinning, hand the Chevalier the
purse and take their leave of their prisoner with much
respect.

The Chevalier de Belle Fast gives them three frederic a-
piece.

			CHEVALIER
	Gentlemen, I wish you a good day.
	Will you please go to the house from
	whence we set out this morning, and
	tell my man there to send my baggage
	on to Three Kings at Dresden?

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Then ordering fresh horses, the
	Chevalier set off on his journey for
	that capital.  I need not tell you
	that I was the Chevalier.

INT.  ROOM - HOTEL DES TROIS COURONNES - DAY

Roderick reading a letter over his breakfast in bed.

			CHEVALIER (V.O.)
	From the Chevalier de Belle Fast to
	Roderick James, Esquire, Gentilhomme
	Anglais.  At the Hotel des trois
	Couronnes, Dresden, Saxe.  My dear
	Roderick -- This comes to you by a
	sure hand, no other than Mr. Lumpit,
	of the English mission, who is
	acquainted, as all Berlin will be
	directly, with our wonderful story.
	They only know half as yet; they
	only know that a deserter went off
	in my clothes, and all are in
	admiration of your cleverness and
	valor.

INT.  CHEVALIER'S ROOM - DAY

Action as per description in letter.

			CHEVALIER (V.O.)
	As I lay in my bed two and a half
	hours after your departure, in comes
	your ex-captain, Galgenstein.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
		   (in his imperious
		    Dutch manner)
	Roderick!  Are you there?

No answer.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	The rogue is gone out.

Action as per voice over.

			CHEVALIER (V.O.)
	Straightaway he makes for the red
	box where I keep my love letters, my
	glass eye which I used to wear, my
	two sets of Paris teeth, and my
	other private matters that you know
	of.  He first tries a bunch of keys,
	but none of them fit the English
	lock.  Then he takes out of his
	pocket a chisel and hammer, and
	falls to work like a professional
	burglar, actually bursting open the
	little box!  Now was my time to act!
	I advance towards him armed with an
	immense water-jug.  I come
	noiselessly up to him just as he has
	broken the box, and, with all my
	might, I deal him such a blow over
	the head as smashes the water-jug to
	bits, and sends the captain with a
	snort lifeless to the ground.  Then
	I ring all the bells in the house;
	and shout, and swear, and scream,
	"Thieves! -- Thieves! -- Landlord!
	-- Murder! -- Fire!" until the whole
	household comes tumbling up the
	stairs.

			CHEVALIER
	Where is my servant?  Who dares to
	rob me in open day?  Look at the
	villain whom I find in the act of
	breaking my chest open!  Send for
	the police, send for his Excellency
	the Austrian Minister!  All Europe
	shall know of this insult!

			LANDLORD
	Dear heaven!  We saw you go away
	three hours ago.

			CHEVALIER
	Me!  Why, man, I have been in bed
	all morning.  I am ill -- I have
	taken physic -- I have not left the
	house this morning!  Where is that
	scoundrel, Lazlo?  But, stop!  Where
	are my clothes and wig?

			CHAMBERMAID
	I have it -- I have it!  Lazlo is
	off in your honor's dress.

			CHEVALIER
	And my money -- my money!  Where is
	my purse with forty-eight frederics
	in it?  But we have one of the
	villains left, Officers, seize him.

			LANDLORD
		   (more and more
		    astonished)
	It's the young Herr Galgenstein.

			CHEVALIER
	What!  A gentleman breaking open my
	trunk with hammer and chisel --
	impossible!

			CHEVALIER (V.O.)
	Herr Galgenstein was returning to
	life by this time, with a swelling
	on his skull as big as a saucepan;
	and the officers carried him off,
	and, to make a long story short,
	poor Galgenstein is now on his way
	to Spandau; and his uncle, the
	Minister of Police Galgenstein, has
	brought me five hundred louis, with
	a humble request that I would leave
	Berlin forthwith, and hush up this
	painful matter.

INT.  GERMAN PALACE - BALLROOM - NIGHT

Roderick, the Chevalier and the Duke of Wurttemberg.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The Chevalier de Belle Fast was in
	particularly good order with the
	Duke of Wurttemberg, whose court
	was, at this period, the most
	brilliant in all Europe.

The Duke of Wurttemberg chatting with ballet dancers, who
will perform at the party.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	He spent fabulous sums on the
	ballets and operas.  All the
	ballerinas were pretty, and they all
	boasted that they had all at least
	once made their amorous sovereign
	happy.

Roderick and the Chevalier kissing hands, hobnobbing with
the nobility, and dancing minuets.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	There was not a party of the
	nobility to which the two Irish
	gentlemen were not invited, and
	admired, nor where we did not make
	the brave, the high-born and the
	beautiful talk to us.  There was no
	man in Europe more gay in spirits,
	more splendid in personal
	accomplishment, than young Roderick
	James.

EXT.  GERMAN STREET - DAWN

Roderick and the Chevalier in a comfortable coach, on
their way home to bed, pass troops marching out on early
parade.

INT.  COACH - DAWN

Roderick sinks back into the comfortable cushion and
yawns.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	What a delightful life did we now
	lead!  I knew I was born a
	gentleman, from the kindly way in
	which I took to the business, as
	business certainly it is.

INT.  BEDROOM - GERMANY - DAY

Roderick in a tub, being washed by a servant.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	For though it seems all pleasure,
	yet I assure any low-bred persons
	who may chance to read this, that
	we, their betters, have to work as
	well as they; though I did not rise
	until noon, yet had I not been up at
	play until long past midnight?

INT.  ANOTHER BEDROOM - GERMANY - DAY

His hair being done.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I came into it at once, and as if I
	had never done anything else all my
	life.  I had a gentleman to wait
	upon me, a French friseur to dress
	my hair of a morning.

INT.  DINING ROOM - NIGHT

A candle-lit supper.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I knew the taste of chocolate as by
	intuition almost, and could
	distinguish between the right
	Spanish and the French before I had
	been a week in my new position.

INSERTS - JEWELRY

Action and cuts as voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had rings on my fingers, watches
	in both my fobs, trinkets, and
	snuff-boxes, of all sorts, and each
	outvying the other in elegance.

INT.  RECEPTION ROOM - GERMANY - DAY

As described.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had the finest natural taste for
	lace and china of any man I ever
	knew.

EXT.  STABLES - GERMANY - DAY

Buying horses.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I could judge a horse as well as any
	dealer in Germany.  I could not
	spell, but I could speak German and
	French cleverly.

INT.  DRESSING ROOM - GERMANY - DAY

Roderick being fitted for clothes.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had at least twelve suits of
	clothes; three richly embroidered
	with gold, two laced with silver;
	one of French grey, silver-laced and
	lined with chinchilla.  I had damask
	morning robes, to which a peacock's
	tail is as sober as a Quaker's drab
	skirt.

INT.  ORANGERY - DAY

Action as voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I took lessons on the guitar, and
	sang French catches exquisitely.
	Where, in fact, was there a more
	accomplished gentleman than Roderick
	James?

INT.  GAMING ROOM - GERMANY - NIGHT

Action as per voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	How have we had the best blood, and
	the brightest eyes, too, of Europe
	throbbing round the table as I and
	the Chevalier have held the cards
	and the bank against some terrible
	player, who was matching some
	thousands out of his millions
	against our all which was there on
	the baize!

INT.  GAMING ROOM - GERMANY - NIGHT

Roderick dealing a faro bank.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Our principles were:  play grandly,
	honorably.  Be not, of course, cast
	down at losing; but, above all, be
	not eager at winning, as mean souls
	are.

INT.  GAMING ROOM - GERMANY - NIGHT

Action as voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	When the Duke of Courland brought
	fourteen lackeys each with bags of
	florins, and challenged our bank to
	play against the sealed bags, what
	did we ask?

			CHEVALIER
	Sir, we have but eighty thousand
	florins in bank, or two hundred
	thousand at three months; if your
	highness' bags do not contain more
	than eight thousand, we will meet
	you.

Playing.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And we did, and after eleven hours
	play, in which our bank was at one
	time reduced to two hundred and
	three ducats, we won seventeen
	thousand florins off him.

Four crowned heads look on at the game, and an imperial
princess, when Roderick turns up the ace of hearts, bursts
into tears.

INT.  MASQUERADE BALL - NIGHT

Roderick and a girl.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Nor need I mention my successes
	among the fairer portion of the
	creation.  One of the most
	accomplished, the tallest, the most
	athletic, and the handsomest
	gentleman in Europe, as I was then,
	a young fellow of my figure could
	not fail of having advantages, which
	a person of my spirit knew very well
	how to us.

INT.  BOUDOIR - NIGHT

Making love to a masked lady.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Charming Schuvaloff.

INT.  COACH - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Black-eyed Sczortarska.

INT.  BOUDOIR - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Dark Valdez.

			RODERICK
	Do you expect me to believe that
	your lover brought you here tonight?

			VALDEZ
	Yes.  He brought me in his carriage,
	and he will call for me at midnight.

			RODERICK
	And he doesn't care about me?

			VALDEZ
	He is only curious to know who you
	are.

			RODERICK
	If his love were like mine, he would
	not permit you to come here.

			VALDEZ
	He loves me, as I love you.

			RODERICK
	Will he wish to know the details of
	this night?

			VALDEZ
	He will believe that it will please
	me if he asks about it, and I shall
	tell him everything except some
	circumstances which might humiliate
	him.

EXT.  GARDEN - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Tender Hegenheim.

INT.  BOUDOIR - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Brilliant Langeac.

Roderick takes from his portfolio a little jacket of very
fine transparent skin, eight inches long and closed at one
end, and which by way of a pouch string at its open end,
has a narrow pink ribbon.

He displays it to her, she looks at it, and laughs.

			LANGEAC
	I will put in on you myself.

She puts it on, out of shot.

			LANGEAC
	There you are, dressed by my hand.
	It is nearly the same thing; but
	despite the fineness and
	transparency of the skin, the little
	fellow pleases me less well in
	costume.  It seems that this
	covering degrades him, or degrades
	me -- one of the other.

			RODERICK
	Both, my angel.  It was Love who
	invented these little jackets:  for
	he had to ally himself with
	Precaution.

INT.  ROOM OFF A BALLROOM - NIGHT

Roderick making love to the Countess von Trotha.  Enter
the Count, in the uniform of a Colonel.

			COUNT
	I entered here, monsieur, at a bad
	moment for you; it seems that you
	love this lady.

			RODERICK
	Certainly, monseigneur, does not
	Your Excellency consider her worthy
	of love?

			COUNT
	Perfectly so; and what is more, I
	will tell you that I love her, and
	that I am not of a humor to put up
	with rivals.

			RODERICK
	Very well!  Now that I know it, I
	will no longer love her.

			COUNT
	Then you yield to me.

			RODERICK
	On the instant.  Everyone must yield
	to such a nobleman as you.

			COUNT
	Very well; but a man who yields
	takes to his legs.

			RODERICK
	That is a trifle strong.

			COUNT
	Take to your legs, low Irish dog.

Roderick smiles at him.

			RODERICK
	Your Excellency has wantonly
	insulted me.  That being so, I
	conclude that you hate me,
	Monseigneur, and that hence you
	would be glad to remove me from the
	number of the living.  In this wish,
	I can and will satisfy Your
	Excellency.

EXT.  BEAUTIFUL GARDEN - EARLY MORNING

Roderick's sword duel with the Count.

Details to be worked out.

INT.  BILLIARD ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick watches the Chevalier play with a Prussian
officer, Lieutenant Dascher.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	It was my unrivaled skill with
	sword and pistol, and readiness to
	use them, that maintained the
	reputation of the firm.

Towards the end of the game, Dascher, seeing that he is
losing, makes an unfair stroke, so obvious that the marker
tells him so to his face.

Lieutenant Dascher, for whom the stroke wins the game,
takes the money which is in the stake bag, and puts it in
his pocket, paying no attention to the marker's
adjurations, or to Roderick's.

Roderick, who is without his sword, reaches for a billiard
cue and swings it at Dascher's face.

He wards off the blow with his arm, drawing his sword and
runs at Roderick, who is unarmed.

The marker, a sturdy young man, catches Dascher around the
waist and prevents murder.

			DASCHER
	I see that you are without your
	sword, but I believe you are a man
	of mettle.  Will you give me
	satisfaction?

			RODERICK
	I shall be delighted; but you have
	lost and you must pay me the money
	before we meet, for, after all, you
	cannot pay me when you are dead.

			ANOTHER OFFICER
	I will undertake to pay you the 20
	louis, but only tomorrow morning at
	the meeting.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

On the field, there are six people waiting with Dascher,
and his seconds.  Dascher takes 20 louis from his pocket
and hands them to Roderick, saying:

			DASCHER
	I may have been mistaken, but I mean
	to make you pay deadly for your
	brutality.

Roderick takes the money and puts it in his purse with the
utmost calm, making no reply to the other's boasting.

			RODERICK
		   (privately)
	It is distasteful to kill a
	scoundrel -- that should be work for
	a hangman.

			CHEVALIER
	To risk one's life against such
	people is an imposition.

			RODERICK
		   (laughs)
	I risk nothing, for I am certain to
	kill him.

			CHEVALIER
	Certain?

			RODERICK
	Perfectly certain, because I shall
	make him tremble.

He takes his station between two trees, about four paces
apart, and draws a pair of dueling pistols.

			RODERICK
	You have only to pace yourself at
	ten paces difference, and fire
	first.  The space between these two
	trees is the place where I choose to
	walk back and forth.  You may walk
	too, if you wish, when it is my turn
	to fire.

No one could have explained his intentions more clearly or
spoken more calmly.

			DASCHER
	But we must decide who is to have
	the first shot.

			RODERICK
	There is no need of that.  I never
	fire first; and, in any case, you
	have that right.

Dascher places himself at the specified distance.

Roderick walks slowly back and forth between the two trees
without looking at him.

Dascher takes aim and fires, missing.

			RODERICK
		   (with the greatest
		    composure)
	You missed me, sir.  I was sure you
	would.  Try again.

The others think he is mad, and had expected some kind of
discussion between the parties, but not a bit of it.

Dascher takes careful aim and fires a second shot, again
missing Roderick.

Without a word, but in a firm and confident manner,
Roderick fires his first shot into the air.

Dascher looks amazed.  Then, aiming at Dascher with his
second pistol, he hits him in the center of the forehead
and stretches him out dead on the ground.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Roderick and Chevalier traveling in their coach.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Thus is will be seen that our life,
	for all its splendor was one of
	extreme difficulty and danger,
	requiring high talents and courage
	for success, and sudden and
	unexpected departures.

They meet a four-wheel carriage, drawn by two horses,
carrying a master and a servant.

The driver of the four-wheel carriage wants Roderick's
driver to make way for him.

Roderick's driver protests that if he does, he will upset
his master in the ditch, but the other insists.

Roderick addresses the master, a handsome young man, and
asks him to order his driver to make way for him.

			RODERICK
	I am posting, monsieur, and
	furthermore I am a foreigner.

			STRANGER
	Monsieur, here in Saxony, the post
	has no special right, and if you are
	a foreigner, you must admit that you
	have no greater claim than mine,
	since I am in my own country.

At that, Roderick gets out and holding his drawn-sword
tells the stranger to get out, or to make way for him.

The stranger replies, with a smile, that he has no sword
and that, in any case, he will not fight for such a silly
reason.

He tells Roderick to get back in his chaise, and he makes
way for him.

INT.  GAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick and the Chevalier running a faro bank when an
important lady suffers a huge loss.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The ladies were passionately fond of
	play, and hence would often arise no
	small trouble to us; for the truth
	most be told, that the ladies loved
	to play, but not to pay.  The point
	of honor is not understood by the
	charming sex; and it was with the
	greatest difficulty that we could
	keep them from the table, could get
	their money if they lost or, if they
	paid, prevent them from using the
	most furious and extraordinary means
	of revenge.

EXT.  ROAD - DAWN

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	On this evening, the lady of high
	rank, after I had won a considerable
	sum in diamonds and pearls from her,
	sent her lover with a band of cut-
	throats to waylay me.

Roderick and the Chevalier are sound asleep in their
carriage when they are awakened by a violent jolt, upon
which the carriage overturns in the middle of the road.

The Chevalier is underneath, and screams from the pain in
his right arm, which he thinks is broken.

Their servant forces the door open to help them out,
telling them that the two postilions have fled.

Roderick easily gets out of the carriage through the door,
which is above him, but the Chevalier, unable to move
because of his disabled arm, has to be pulled out.

His piercing shrieks make Roderick laugh, because of the
strange oaths with which he interlards his prayers.

From the carriage, Roderick takes his dueling pistols,
and sword.

Roderick tells his servant to mount and to looking for
armed peasants in the vicinity; money in hand, he leaves.

The Chevalier has lain down on the hard ground, groaning
and in no condition to resist robbers.

Roderick makes his own preparations to sell his fortune
and his life at the highest price.

His carriage is close to the ditch, and he unhitches the
horses, tieing them to the wheels and the pole in a
circle, and stations himself behind them with weapons.

In this predicament, Roderick cannot help laughing at the
poor Chevalier, who is writhing like a dying dolphin on a
seashore, and uttering the most pitiful execrations, when
a mare, whose back was turned to him, take it into her
empty head to empty her bladder on him.  There is nothing
to be done; he has to put up with the whole stinking rain,
and to forgive Roderick's laughter, which he has not the
strength to hold in.

The chill wind and the silence are suddenly broken by an
attack, which is half-hearted and uncertain, by the lady's
lover, and his hesitant band of six cut-throats.

Some falter and run away as soon as Roderick fires his
pistol.

The leader and two heartier followers engage Roderick.
During the fight, they mortally wound the helpless
Chevalier and two of them are killed.

After they flee, Roderick kneels by the Chevalier, who
utters some appropriate last words, then dies.

His servant finally arrives at full gallop, shouting at
the top of his voice, and followed by a band of peasants,
each with his lantern, come to his rescue.  There are ten
or twelve of them, all armed with muskets, and all ready
to obey his orders.

EXT.  SPA - HOTEL - DAY

Roderick's carriage arrives.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	After making suitable arrangements
	for the Chevalier's burial, in
	proper accord with his church, I
	traveled to Spa, which was now in
	season, alone, to continue my
	profession which formerly had the
	support of my friend and mentor.

INT.  GAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Crowds surround Roderick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I was by this time one of the best-
	known characters in Europe; and the
	fame of my exploits, my duels, my
	courage at play, would bring crowds
	round me in any public society where
	I appeared.

INT.  CASINO - NIGHT

Attractive women alone, while men are at the gaming table.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The passion for play is stronger
	than the passion for gallantry; the
	gamester at Spa has neither time to
	stop to consider the merits of a
	woman, nor the courage to make
	sacrifices for her.

EXT.  GARDEN IN SPA - DAY

The Countess of Cosgrove walks beside her husband, Sir
William Cosgrove, who is in a wheelchair.  They are
accompanied by their young son, Lord Brookside, and two
servants.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	In evoking the recollections of
	these days, I have nothing but
	pleasure.  I would if I could say as
	much of a lady who will henceforth
	play a considerable part in the
	drama of my life -- I mean the
	Countess of Cosgrove, whose fatal
	acquaintance I made at Spa, very
	soon after the tragic events which
	caused me to quit Germany.

Closer shot of the Countess.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Victoria, Countess of Cosgrove.  A
	Countess and a Viscountess in her
	own right.

Closer shot of Sir William Cosgrove.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She was the wife of her cousin, the
	Right Honorable Sir William Reginald
	Cosgrove, Knight of the Bath, and
	Minister to George II and George III
	of several of the smaller courts of
	Europe.

Closer shot of young Lord Brookside, walking behind them
in the care of his governor.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She was the mother to Viscount
	Brookside -- a melancholy, deserted,
	little boy, about whom his father
	was more than indifferent, and whom
	his mother never saw.

INT.  GAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Shots of Sir William Cosgrove being wheeled in, and at
play with Roderick, and some other gentlemen.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I made Sir William Cosgrove's
	acquaintance as usual at the play-
	table.  One could not but admire the
	spirit and gallantry with which he
	pursued his favorite pastime; for,
	though worn out with gout and a
	myriad of diseases, a cripple
	wheeled about in a chair, and
	suffering pangs of agony, yet you
	would see him every morning, and
	every evening at his post behind the
	delightful green cloth.

			SIR WILLIAM
	Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you
	have no more manners than a barber,
	and I think my black footman has
	been better educated than you; but
	you are a young fellow of
	originality and pluck, and I like
	you, sir.  because you seem
	determined to go to the devil by a
	way of your own.

Laughter at the table.

			RODERICK
	I am obliged to observe, Sir William
	Cosgrove, that since you are bound
	for the next world much sooner than
	I am, I will depend on you to get
	comfortable quarters arranged for
	me.

Laughter.

			SIR WILLIAM
	Indeed, you are right, sir.  Look at
	me.  Marriage has added forty years
	to my life.  I am dying, a worn-out
	cripple, at the age of fifty.  When
	I took off Lady Cosgrove, there was
	no man of my years who looked so
	young as myself.  Fool that I was!
	I had enough with my pensions,
	perfect freedom, the best society in
	Europe -- and I gave up all these,
	and married and was miserable.  Take
	a warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and
	stick to the trumps.  Do anything,
	but marry.

			RODERICK
	Would you have me spend my life all
	alone?

			SIR WILLIAM
	In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must
	marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.

			RODERICK
		   (laughing)
	The milkmaid's daughter?

			SIR WILLIAM
	Well, why not a milkmaid's daughter?
	No man of sense need restrict
	himself or deny himself a single
	amusement for his wife's sake; on
	the contrary, if he selects the
	animal properly, he will choose such
	a one as shall be no bar to his
	pleasure, but a comfort in his hours
	of annoyance.  For instance, I have
	got the gout; who tends me?  A hired
	valet who robs me whenever he has
	the power.  My wife never comes near
	me.  What friend have I?  None in
	the wide world.  Men of the world,
	as you and I are, don't make
	friends, and we are fools for our
	pains.

Polite laughter at the table.

			SIR WILLIAM
	My lady is a weak woman, but she is
	my mistress.  She is a fool, but she
	has got the better of one of the
	best heads in Christendom.  She is
	enormously rich, but somehow I have
	never been so poor, as since I
	married her.  I thought to better
	myself, and she has made me
	miserable and killed me, and she
	will do as much for my successor
	when I'm gone.

There is a reflective silence at the table.

			RODERICK
	Has her ladyship a very large
	income?

This question causes Sir William to burst out into a
yelling laugh, joined by the rest of the table, and makes
Roderick blush not a little at his gaucherie.

EXT.  ORNAMENTAL GARDEN - SPA - NIGHT

A beautiful scene, lit by the flambeaux, held by a dozen
footmen.  A small orchestra, playing in a Temple of Love,
some dancers, people gambling and lounging along a line of
trees.

Roderick approaches the Countess.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Despite my friend's strong warning.
	I resolves to become acquainted with
	his lady.  Sir William Cosgrove was
	dying.  His widow would be a rich
	prize.  Why should I not win her,
	and, with her, the means of making
	in the world that figure which my
	genius and inclination desired?
	When I determine, I look upon the
	thing as done.

			RODERICK
	Charming lady, tell me the truth and
	earn my gratitude.  Have you a
	lover?

The countess laughs.

			COUNTESS
	No.

			RODERICK
	Have you had one?

			COUNTESS
	Never.

			RODERICK
	But, for a time... a passing fancy?

			COUNTESS
	Not even that.

			RODERICK
	How can I believe that there is not
	a man who has inspired desires in
	you?

			COUNTESS
	Not one.

			RODERICK
	Have you not a man whom you value?

			COUNTESS
	That man has, perhaps, not yet been
	born.

			RODERICK
	What!  You have not met a man worthy
	of your attention?

			COUNTESS
	Many worthy of attention; but
	valuing is something more.  I could
	value only someone whom I loved.

			RODERICK
	Then you have never loved?  Your
	heart is empty.

			COUNTESS
	Your word "empty" makes me laugh.
	Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If
	it is fortunate, I congratulate
	myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do
	not care, for I am not aware of it.

			RODERICK
	It is nonetheless a misfortune, and
	you will know it when you love.

			COUNTESS
	But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I
	will know that my empty heart was my
	good fortune.

			RODERICK
	That is true, but it seems to me
	impossible that you should be
	unhappy in love.

			COUNTESS
	It is only too possible.  Love
	requires a mutual harmony which is
	difficult, and it is even more
	difficult to make it last.

			RODERICK
	I agree; but God put us on earth to
	take that risk.

			COUNTESS
	A man may need to do that, and find
	it amusing; but a girl is bound by
	other laws.

			RODERICK
	I believe you, and I see I must
	hasten to leave, for otherwise I
	shall become the unhappiest of men.

			COUNTESS
	How so?

			RODERICK
	By loving you, with no hope of
	possessing you.

She laughs.

			COUNTESS
	You want my heart?

			RODERICK
	It is my only object.

			COUNTESS
	To make me wretched in two weeks.

			RODERICK
	To love you until death.  To
	subscribe to all your commands.

			COUNTESS
	The amusing thing is that you
	deceive me without knowing, if it is
	true that you love me.

			RODERICK
	Deceiving someone without knowing it
	is something new for me.  If I do
	not know it, I am innocent.

			COUNTESS
	But you deceive me nonetheless if I
	believe you, for it will not be in
	your power to love me when you love
	me no longer.

Roderick laughs and kisses her.

			COUNTESS
	Be so good as to tell me with whom
	you think you are?

			RODERICK
	With a woman who is completely
	charming, be she a princess or a
	woman of the lowest condition, and
	who, regardless of her rank, will
	show me some kindness, tonight.

She laughs.

			COUNTESS
	And if she does not choose to show
	you some kindness?

			RODERICK
	Then I will respectfully take leave
	of her.

			COUNTESS
	You will do as you please.  It seems
	to me that such a matter can hardly
	be discussed until after people know
	each other.  Do you not agree?

			RODERICK
	Yes -- but I am afraid of being
	deceived.

			COUNTESS
	Poor man.  And, for that reason, you
	want to begin where people end?

			RODERICK
	I ask only a payment on account
	today -- after that, you will find
	me undemanding, obedient and
	discreet.

She laughs.  He kisses her again.  They exit.

EXT.  ROAD - SPA - NIGHT

Coach and four moves slowly along.

INT.  COACH - NIGHT

They kiss.  She gently struggles as he tries to undo her
dress.  He stops.

			RODERICK
	Will we always leave it at this?

			COUNTESS
	Always, my dear one, never any
	further.  Love is a child to be
	pacified with trifles.  A full diet
	can only kill it.

			RODERICK
	I know better than you do.  Love
	wants a more substantial fare, and
	if it is stubbornly withheld, it
	withers away.

			COUNTESS
	Our abstinence makes our love
	immortal.  If I loved you a quarter
	of an hour ago, now I should love
	you even more.  But I should love
	you less if you exhausted my joy by
	satisfying all my desires.

			RODERICK
	Let us give each other complete
	happiness, and let us be sure that
	as many times as we satisfy our
	desires, they will each time be born
	anew.

			COUNTESS
	My husband has convinced me of the
	contrary.

			RODERICK
	Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is
	dying, and yet I envy him more than
	any man in Christendom.  He enjoys a
	privilege of which I am deprived.
	He may take you in his arms whenever
	he pleases, and no veil keeps his
	senses, his eyes, his soul from
	enjoying your beauty.

She silences him with her fingertips.

			COUNTESS
	Shall I tell you something -- I
	believed what was called love came
	after the union -- and I was
	surprised when my husband, making me
	a woman, made me know it only by
	pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure.
	I saw that my imaginings had stood
	me in better stead.  And so we
	became only friends, seldom sleeping
	together and arousing no curiosity
	in each other, yet on good terms for
	a while, as whenever he wanted me, I
	was at his service, but since the
	offering was not seasoned with love,
	he found it tasteless, and seldom
	demanded it.

			RODERICK
	O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg
	you.  Stop believing in your
	experience.  You have never known
	love.  My very soul is leaving me!
	Catch it on your lips, and give me
	yours!

They kiss ardently.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	To make a long story short, her
	ladyship and I were in love six
	hours after we met; and after I once
	got into her ladyship's good graces,
	I found innumerable occasions to
	improve my intimacy, and was
	scarcely ever out of her company.

EXT.  COUNTESS' HOUSE - SPA - DUSK

Action as per voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I shall never forget the
	astonishment of Sir William Cosgrove
	when, on one summer evening, as he
	was issuing out to the play-table,
	in his sedan-chair, her ladyship's
	barouche and four came driving into
	the courtyard of the house which
	they inhabited and, in that
	carriage, by her ladyship's side,
	sat no other than "the vulgar Irish
	adventurer," as she was pleased to
	call me.

Sir William makes the most courtly of bows and grins, and
waves his hat in as graceful a manner as his multiplicity
of illness permits, and her ladyship and Roderick reply to
the salutation with the utmost politeness and elegance on
their part.

INT.  RODERICK'S APARTMENT - SPA - NIGHT

Making ardent love.

			COUNTESS
	Without you, my dearest, I might
	have died without ever knowing love.
	Inexpressible love!  God of nature!
	Bitterness than which nothing is
	sweeter, sweetness than which
	nothing is more bitter.  Divine
	monster which can only be defined by
	paradoxes.

			RODERICK
	Let me give a thousand kisses to
	that heavenly mouth which has told
	me that I am happy.

			COUNTESS
	As soon as I saw you loved me, I was
	pleased, and I gave you every
	opportunity to fall more in love
	with me, being certain that, for my
	part, I would never love you.  But
	after our first kiss, I found that I
	had no power over myself.  I did not
	know that one kiss could matter so
	much.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	We then spent an hour in the most
	eloquent silence except that, from
	time to time, her ladyship cried
	out:  "Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I
	am not dreaming?"

INT.  GAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick enters and approaches a table at which Sir
William Cosgrove, who is drunk, is at play with several
other jovial fellows.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Sir William Cosgrove, with his
	complication of ills, was dying
	before us by inches.  He was
	continually tinkered up by doctors,
	and, what with my usual luck, he
	might be restored to health and live
	I don't know how many years.  If
	Cosgrove would not die, where was
	the use of my pursing his lady?  But
	my fears were to prove groundless,
	for on that very night, patient
	nature would claim her account.

			SIR WILLIAM
	Good evening, Mr. James, have you
	done with my lady?

			RODERICK
	I beg your pardon?

			SIR WILLIAM
	Come, come, sir.  I am a man who
	would rather be known as a cuckold
	than a fool.

			RODERICK
	I think, Sir William Cosgrove, you
	have had too much drink.  Your
	chaplin, Mr. Hunt, has introduced me
	into the company of your lady to
	advise me on a religious matter, of
	which she is a considerable expert.

Sir William Cosgrove greets this line with a yell of
laughter.  His laugh is not jovial or agreeable, but
rather painful and sardonic, and ends in a violent fit of
coughing.

			SIR WILLIAM
	Gentlemen, see this amiable youth!
	He has been troubled by religious
	scruples, and has flown for refuge
	to my chaplin, Mr. Hunt, who has
	asked for advise from my wife, Lady
	Cosgrove, and between them both,
	they are confirming my ingenious
	young friend in his faith.  Did you
	ever hear of such doctors and such a
	disciple?

			RODERICK
	Faith, sir, if I want to learn good
	principles, it's surely better I
	should apply for them to your lady,
	and your chaplin than to you?

			SIR WILLIAM
		   (laughing, but pretty
		    red)
	He wants to step into my shoes!  He
	wants to step into my shoes!

Roderick stares at him coldly.

			RODERICK
	Well, if my intentions are what you
	think they are -- if I do wish to
	step into your shoes, what then?  I
	have no other intentions than you
	had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's
	wealth may be great, but am I not of
	a generous nature enough to use it
	worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but
	not so lofty as my ambition.  I will
	be sworn to muster just as much
	regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you
	ever showed her; and if I win her,
	and wear her when you are dead and
	gone, corbleu, knight, do you think
	that it will be the fear of your
	ghost will deter me?

			SIR WILLIAM
	Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for
	me, as I am drawing near the goal,
	to find my home such a happy one; my
	wife so fond of me, that she is even
	now thinking of appointing a
	successor?  Isn't it a comfort to
	see her; like a prudent housewife,
	getting everything ready for her
	husband's departure?

			RODERICK
	I hope that you are not thinking of
	leaving us soon, knight?

			SIR WILLIAM
	Not so soon, my dear, as you may
	fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have
	been given over many times these
	four years, and there was always a
	candidate or two waiting to apply
	for the situation.  Who knows how
	long I may keep you waiting.

			RODERICK
	Sir, let those laugh that win.

			SIR WILLIAM
	I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm
	grieved to keep you or any gentleman
	waiting.  Had you not better to
	arrange with my doctor or get the
	cook to flavor my omelette with
	arsenic?  What are the odds,
	gentlemen, that I don't live to see
	Mr. James hang yet?

There is laughter around the table, and Sir William starts
dealing the cards.

			VOICE
	Dies at Spa, in the Kingdom of
	Belgium, the Right Honorable Sir
	William Cosgrove, Knight of the
	Bath, Member of Parliament for
	Cosgrove and Devonshire and many
	years His Majesty's representative
	at various European courts.  He hath
	left behind him a name which is
	endeared to all his friends for his
	manifold virtues and talents, a
	reputation justly acquired in the
	service of His Majesty, and an
	inconsolable widow to deplore his
	loss.

Sir Williams keels over dead.

INT.  CHURCH - DAY

The wedding of Roderick and the Countess.  The service is
preformed by Reverend Hunt, her ladyship's chaplain.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	A year from that day, on the
	fifteenth of May, in the year 1773,
	I had the honor and happiness to
	lead to the altar Victoria, Countess
	of Cosgrove, widow of the late Right
	Honorable Sir William Cosgrove, K.B.
	I had procured His Majesty's
	gracious permission to add the name
	of my lovely lady to my own, and,
	henceforward, assumed the title of
	James Cosgrove.

EXT.  A GARDEN - LONDON - DAY

The Wedding reception.

Roderick and the Countess are approached by young Lord
Brookside, aged 12.

			COUNTESS
	My Lord Brookside, come and embrace
	your papa!

Brookside walks slowly towards them, and shakes his fist
in Roderick's face.

			BROOKSIDE
	He, my father!  I would as soon call
	one of your ladyship's footmen,
	papa!

Roderick laughs, as the Countess unsuccessfully tries to
get the boy to shake hands.

			COUNTESS
	Lord Brookside, you have offended
	your father.

			BROOKSIDE
	Mother, you have offended my father.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	It was a declaration of war to me,
	as I saw at once; though I declare I
	was willing enough to have lived
	with him on terms of friendliness.
	But as men serve me, I serve them.
	Who can blame me for my after-
	quarrels with this young reprobate,
	or lay upon my shoulders the evils
	which afterwards befell?

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Three carriages, each with four horses, proceed along the
picturesque track.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	After we had received the
	congratulations of our friends in
	London -- I and Victoria set off to
	visit our country estate, Castle
	Hackton, where I had never as yet
	set foot.

INT.  CARRIAGE - DAY

Roderick and his Lady.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The first days of a marriage are
	commonly very trying; and I have
	known couples, who lived together
	like turtle-doves for the rest of
	their lives, peck each other's eyes
	out almost during the honeymoon.  I
	did not escape the common lot.  In
	our journey westwards, my Lady
	Cosgrove chose to quarrel with me
	because I had pulled out a pipe of
	tobacco.  Lady Cosgrove was a
	haughty woman, and I hate pride, and
	I promise you that, in this instant,
	I overcame this vice in her.

Roderick blows smoke into the Countess' face.  She is
shocked into an apprehensive silence.

INT.  COACH - DAY

Young Lord Brookside with his governor, glowering and
petulant.  A parrot, in a cage, on his lap.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

As the carriages drive past, there is a band, floral
arches, flags, church bells ringing.  The parson and the
farmers assemble in their best by the roadside, and the
school-children and the laboring people are loud in their
"hurrahs" for her ladyship.

Roderick flings pennies among the cheering tenants, from
two bags of coppers, stored in the carriage for the
occasion.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Fifty, or so, servants have turned out to greet their
mistress, and their new master.  The land steward, who is
the senior servant, introduces the others -- the clerk of
the kitchen, clerk of the stables, head gardener, ladies
in waiting, butler, valet, chef, cook.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had not arrived at the pitch of
	prosperity, and having, at thirty
	years of age, by my own merits and
	energy, raised myself to one of the
	highest social positions that any
	man in England could occupy, I
	determined to enjoy myself as
	becomes a man of quality for the
	remainder of my life.

INT.  STABLES - DAY

Roderick and his beautiful horses.

EXT.  A STREAM - DAY

Roderick and some companions fishing.

EXT.  FIELDS - DAY

Roderick and his friends riding.

EXT.  FIELDS - DAY

Roderick and friends shooting.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick having his portrait painted by a miniaturist.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But it was not meant for me to
	finish my life as a man of quality
	and position.  Indeed, I am one of
	those born clever enough at gaining
	a fortune, but incapable of keeping
	one; for the qualities and energy,
	which lead a man to accept the
	first, are often the very causes of
	his ruin in the latter case; indeed,
	I know of no other reason for the
	misfortunes which finally befell me.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - COUNTESS' BEDROOM - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	At the end of the year, Lady
	Cosgrove presented me with a son;
	Patrick Cosgrove, I called him, in
	compliment to my royal ancestry, but
	what more had I to leave him than a
	noble name?

EXT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - LONDON - DAY

Two coaches pull up, and the Countess and Roderick exit.
Servants remove their luggage and baby Patrick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	We spent the season in London at our
	house in Berkeley Square.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

The Countess alone and depressed.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Her ladyship and I lived, for a
	while, pretty separate when in
	London.  She preferred quiet, or, to
	say the truth, I preferred it, being
	a great friend to a modest, tranquil
	behavior in woman and a taste for
	the domestic pleasures.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - LONDON - DAY

Several cuts of the Countess, caring for the infant,
Patrick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Besides, she was a mother, and had
	great comfort in the dressing,
	educating, and dandling of our
	little Patrick for whose sake it was
	fit that she should give up the
	pleasures and frivolities of the
	world; so she left that part of the
	duty of every family of distinction
	to be performed by me.

INT.  THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT

Roderick arriving with a party of friends, escorting a
beautiful woman.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - LONDON - DAY

Countess crying and having an argument with Roderick.
Live dialogue under voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Her ladyship's conversations with me
	were characterized by a stupid
	despair, or a silly blundering
	attempt at forced cheerfulness,
	still more disagreeable; hence, our
	intercourse was but trifling, and my
	temptations to carry her into the
	world or to remain in her society of
	necessity exceedingly small.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - LONDON - NIGHT

A drunken Roderick rudely demands his lady to entertain
their guests.  She rushes from the room in tears.
Dialogue starts scene, goes under for voice over, then
ends scene.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She would try my temper, at home,
	too, in a thousand ways.  When
	requested by me to entertain the
	company with conversation, wit, and
	learning, of which she was a
	mistress; or music, of which she was
	an accomplished performer, she
	would, as often as not, begin to
	cry, and leave the room.  My company
	from this, of course, fancied I was
	a tyrant over her; whereas, I was
	only a severe and careful guardian
	of a silly, bad-tempered and weak-
	minded lady.

EXT.  PARK - DAY

Roderick strolling arm-in-arm with his Countess.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Despite the utter distaste with
	which I now regarded Lady Cosgrove,
	and, although I took no particular
	pains to disguise my feelings in
	general, yet she was of such a mean
	spirit that she pursued me with her
	regard, and would kindle up at the
	smallest kind word I spoke to her.

INT.  COSGROVE STUDY - DAY

Roderick and accountant.  Her ladyship is signing various
documents, and orders for payment.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And, in these fits of love, she was
	the most easy creature in the world
	to be persuaded, and would have
	signed away her whole property, had
	it been possible.  And, I must
	confess, it was with very little
	attention on my part that I could
	bring her into good humor, and, up
	to the very last day of our being
	together, would be reconciled to me,
	and fondle me, if I addressed her a
	single kind word.  Such is female
	inconsistency.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DAY

Roderick and the Countess fighting about her refusal to
sign some papers.  Live dialogue under voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She was luckily very fond of her
	youngest son, and through him I had
	a wholesome and effectual hold on
	her; for if in any of her tantrums
	or fits of haughtiness, she
	pretended to have the upper-hand, to
	assert her authority against mine,
	to refuse to sign such papers as I
	might think necessary for the
	distribution of our large and
	complicated property.

Roderick picks up baby Patrick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I would have Master Patrick carried
	off to Chiswick for a couple of
	days; and I warrant me his lady-
	mother could hold out no longer and
	would agree to anything I proposed.

The Countess rushes to the window to see the child being
put into a carriage.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DAY

Another quarrel.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Lady Cosgrove and I did not quarrel
	more than fashionable people do, and,
	for the first three years, I never
	struck my wife but when I was in
	liquor.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DAY

Roderick throws a knife at young Brookside.  The knife
digs into an expensive antique chest, just missing the
young Brookside's head.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	When I flung the carving-knife at
	Brookside, I was drunk, as
	everybody present can testify, but
	as for having any systematic scheme
	against the poor lad, I can declare
	solemnly that, beyond merely hating
	him, I am guilty of no evil towards
	him.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DAY

The Countess discovers Roderick making love to the child's
nurse.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Do what one would to please her, my
	lady would never be happy or in good
	humor.  And soon she added a mean,
	detestable jealousy to all her other
	faults, and would weep and wring her
	hands, and threaten to commit
	suicide, and I know not what.

She screams and shouts something about suicide.

Her son, Brookside, comes running in and consoles her.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Her death would have been no comfort
	to me, as I leave any person of
	common prudence to imagine; for that
	scoundrel of a young Brookside who
	was about to become my greatest
	plague and annoyance, would have
	inherited every penny of the
	property.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - LONDON - RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY

Roderick, bored and distracted, sits before a stack of
bills and papers, with his accountant.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Humble people envy us great men, and
	fancy that our lives are all
	pleasure.  But the troubles of
	poverty, the rascality of agents,
	the quibbles of lawyers are endless.
	My life at this period seemed to
	consist of nothing but drafts of
	letters and money-brokers relative
	to the raising of money, and the
	insuring of Lady Cosgrove's life,
	and innumerable correspondence with
	upholsterers, decorators, cooks,
	horsekeepers, bailiffs, and
	stewards.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDENS - DAY

Various cuts.

Birthday fete for Patrick who is now five years old.

Gaily colored tents, ponies, a puppet show, expensive
presents.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My own dear boy, Patrick, was now
	five years old, and was the most
	polite and engaging child ever seen;
	it was a pleasure to treat him with
	kindness and distinction; the little
	fellow was the pink of fashion,
	beauty, and good breeding.  In fact,
	he could not have been otherwise,
	with the care both his parents
	bestowed upon him, and the
	attentions which were lavished upon
	him in every way.

Brookside and Roderick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Whereas, young Brookside had grown
	to be a very nasty and disrespectful
	fellow indeed.  In my company, he
	preserved the most rigid silence,
	and a haughty, scornful demeanor,
	which was so much the more
	disagreeable because there was
	nothing in his behavior I could
	actually take hold of to find fault
	with, although his whole conduct was
	insolent and supercilious to the
	highest degree.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - LIBRARY - DAY

Brookside sitting alone reading a book.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	In addition to this, the lad was
	fond of spending the chief part of
	his time occupied with the musty old
	books, which he took out of the
	library, and which I hate to see a
	young man of spirit pouring over.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Brookside and the Countess.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The insubordination of that boy was
	dreadful.  He used to quote passages
	of "Hamlet" to his mother, which
	made her very angry.

Brookside quoting "Hamlet."

The Countess begins to cry and leaves the room.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S STUDY

Roderick caning young Brookside.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	As it is best to nip vice in the
	bud, and for a master of a family to
	exercise his authority in such a
	manner as that there may be no
	question about it, I took every
	opportunity of coming to close
	quarters with Master Brookside.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Many guests around the table.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	He always chose the days when
	company, or the clergy, or gentry of
	the neighborhood were present, to
	make violent, sarcastic, and
	insolent speeches.

Brookside begins to fondle and caress Patrick.

			BROOKSIDE
	Dear child, what a pity it is I am
	not dead for your sake!  The
	Cosgroves would then have a worthy
	representative, and enjoy all the
	benefits of the illustrious blood of
	the James' of Duganstown, would they
	not, Mr. James Cosgrove?

INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - NIGHT

Roderick caning Brookside again.  The boy bears the
punishment without crying.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick's reunion with his mother.

Present are the Countess, Patrick, Lord Brookside and
others.

Mrs. James flings herself into her son's arms with a
scream, and with transports of joy, which can only be
comprehended by women who have held, in their arms, an
only child, after a twelve-year absence from him.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick and mother feeding Patrick.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDEN - DAY

Roderick and mother playing with Patrick in the garden.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Mother at dinner with the family, in a strained
atmosphere.

INT.  PATRICK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Roderick and his mother talk in whispers near the bed of
the sleeping Patrick.

			MOTHER
	Ah, Roderick, it's a blessing to see
	that my darling boy has attained a
	position I always knew was his due,
	and for which I pinched myself to
	educate him.  Little Patrick is a
	darling boy, and you live in great
	splendor, but how long will it last?
	Your lady-wife knows she has a
	treasure she couldn't have had, had
	she taken a duke to marry her, but
	if, one day, she should tire of my
	wild Roderick and his old-fashioned
	Irish ways, or if she should die,
	what future would there be for my
	son and grandson?

INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - CASTLE HACKTON - NIGHT

Roderick and his mother.

			MOTHER
	You have not a penny of your own,
	and cannot transact any business
	without the Countess' signature.
	Upon her death, the entire estate
	would go to young Brookside, who
	bears you little affection.  You
	could be penniless tomorrow, and
	darling Patrick at the mercy of his
	stepbrother.

INT.  MOTHER'S ROOM - CASTLE HACKTON - NIGHT

Roderick and his mother.

			MOTHER
	I shall tell you a secret -- I shall
	not rest until I see you Earl of
	Duganstown, and my grandson, a Lord
	Viscount.

She smooths down Roderick's hair.

			MOTHER
	This head would become a coronet.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDEN - DAY

Roderick and Mother slowly walking and talking.  Young
Patrick, ahead of them sitting in a small cart, pulled by
a lamb.

			MOTHER
	These things entail considerable
	expense, and you will need your
	lady's blessing, but the young boy
	forms the great bond of union
	between you and her ladyship, and
	there is no plan of ambition you
	could propose in which she would not
	join for the poor lad's benefit, and
	no expense she will not eagerly
	incur, if it might be any means be
	shown to tend to his advancement.
	You have important friends, and they
	can tell you how these things are
	done.

INT.  LONDON GAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Standing away from the play tables, Roderick chats with
Lord West, a fat giant of a man.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And, to be sure, I did know someone
	who knew precisely how these things
	were done, and this was the
	distinguished solicitor and former
	Government Minister, Lord West,
	whose acquaintance I made, as I had
	so many others, at the gaming table.

			LORD WEST
	Do you happen to know Gustavus
	Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of
	Crabs?

			RODERICK
	By name only.

			LORD WEST
	Well, sir, this nobleman is one of
	the gentlemen of His Majesty's
	closet, and one with whom our
	revered monarch is on terms of
	considerable intimacy.  I should say
	you would be wise to fix upon this
	nobleman your chief reliance for the
	advancement of your claim to the
	Viscounty which you propose to get.

INT.  LONDON CLUB - DAY

Roderick having lunch with Lord West and the Earl of
Crabs.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And for a five-hundred guinea fee,
	paid to his City law-firm, Lord West
	kindly arranged a meeting with that
	old scamp and swindler, Gustavus
	Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of
	Crabs.

			EARL OF CRABS
	Mr. Cosgrove, when I take up a
	person, he or she is safe.  There is
	no question about them any more.  My
	friends are the best people.  I
	don't mean the most virtuous, or,
	indeed, the least virtuous, or the
	cleverest, or the stupidest, or the
	richest, or the best born, but the
	"best" -- in a word, people about
	whom there is no question.  I cannot
	promise you how long it will take.
	You can appreciate it is not an easy
	matter.  But any gentlemen with an
	estate, and ten-thousand a-year
	should have a peerage.

INT.  DRAWING ROOM - EARL OF CRABS - DAY

Roderick being introduced to three noblemen, including the
Duke of Rutland.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The striving after this peerage, I
	consider to have been one of the
	most unlucky dealings at this
	period.  I made unheard of
	sacrifices to bring it about.  I can
	tell you bribes were administered,
	and in high places too -- so near
	the royal person of His Majesty that
	you would be astonished were I to
	mention what great personages
	condescended to receive our loans.

INT.  DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick gives a beautiful diamond to a fat princess on
her birthday.  He is applauded by the other guests.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I lavished money here, and diamonds
	there.

EXT.  FARMLAND - DAY

Roderick and the seller, riding over a prospective
property.  A broker shows them a survey map of the
property.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I bought lands at ten times there
	value.

INT.  SALON - LONDON - NIGHT

A musical evening.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I gave repeated entertainments to
	those friends to my claims who,
	being about the royal person, were
	likely to advance it.

INT.  STATELY HOME - DAY

Roderick buying pictures.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I purchased pictures and articles of
	vertu at ruinous prices.

EXT.  RACES - DAY

Roderick laughing and paying a bet.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I lost many a bet to the royal
	dukes, His Majesty's brothers.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

Reviewing the company of troops.

Roderick, the Earl of Crabs, the Countess, Patrick and
Brookside, several princes and noblemen and the Duke of
Rutland.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	One of the main causes of expense
	which this ambition of mine entailed
	upon me was the fitting out and
	arming of a company of infantry from
	the Hackton estates, which I offered
	to my gracious sovereign for the
	campaign against the American
	rebels.  These troops, superbly
	equipped and clothed, were embarked
	at Portsmouth in the year 1778.

INT.  ST. JAMES - RECEPTION ROOM - DAY

George III meeting people and stopping to talk to
Roderick.  Present also is the Duke of Rutland.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And the patriotism of the gentlemen
	who raised them was so acceptable at
	court that, on being presented by my
	Lord Crabs, His Majesty condescended
	to notice me particularly and said:

			GEORGE III
	That's right, Mr. Cosgrove, raise
	another company, and go with them,
	too!

INT.  COFFEE HOUSE - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Crabs was really one of the most
	entertaining fellows in the world,
	and I took a sincere pleasure in his
	company, besides the interest and
	desire I had in cultivating the
	society of the most important
	personages of the realm.

Roderick clumsily tries to engage in conversation with the
famed Dr. Johnson, on the subject of a book or play, of
the day, and is rebuffed for his trouble.

			JOHNSON
	If I were you, Mr. Cosgrove, I
	should mind my horses and tailors
	and not trouble myself about
	letters.

Laughter, Roderick bristles.

			RODERICK
	Dr. Johnson, I think you misbehave
	most grossly, treating my opinions
	with no more respect than those of a
	schoolboy.  You fancy, sir, you know
	a great deal more than me, because
	you quote your "Aristotle" and
	"Plato," but can you tell me which
	horse will win at Epsom Downs next
	week?  Can you shoot the ace of
	spades ten times without missing?
	If so, talk about Aristotle and
	Plato with me.

			BOSWELL
		   (roars)
	Do you know who you're speaking to?!

			JOHNSON
	Hold your tongue, Mr. Boswell, I had
	no right to brag of my Greek,
	gentlemen, and he has answered me
	very well.

			RODERICK
		   (pleased)
	Do you know ever a rhyme for
	Aristotle?

			GOLDSMITH
		   (laughing)
	Port, if you please.

			JOHNSON
	Waiter, bring on of Captain James'
	rhymes for Aristotle.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And we had six rhymes for Aristotle
	before we left the coffee house that
	evening.

INT.  LONDON CLUB - NIGHT

			EARL OF CRABS
	Henri, this is Mr. James Cosgrove,
	who wishes to arrange a dinner party
	next week for sixty guests.

			HENRI
	I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove.
	How much do you wish to spend?

			RODERICK
	As much as possible.

			HENRI
	As much as possible?

			RODERICK
	Yes, for I wish to entertain
	splendidly.

			HENRI
	All the same, you must name an
	amount.

			RODERICK
	It is entirely up to you.  I want
	the best.

			EARL OF CRABS
	May I suggest five hundred guineas?

			RODERICK
	Will that be enough?

			HENRI
	Last month, the Duke of Suffolk
	spent no more.

			RODERICK
	All right, five hundred guineas.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY

Roderick is seated at a large table, stacked high with
bills and letters; his accountant is seated next to him,
aided by a bookkeeper.  Roderick looks at each bill and
his accountant explains the charge.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The life I was leading was that of a
	happy man, but I was not happy.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - LONG GALLERY - DAY

Roderick, walking with big strides, leads Brookside by his
ear.  Little Patrick runs alongside, pleading for his
brother.

			PATRICK
	Papa, please don't flog Brookside
	today.  It wasn't his fault --
	really is wasn't.

Roderick ignores him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	By now, young Brookside was of so
	wild, savage, and insubordinate a
	nature that I never had the least
	regard for him.  As he grew up to be
	a man, his hatred for me assumed an
	intensity quite wicked to think of
	and which, I promise you, I returned
	with interest.

He drags Brookside into his study, slamming the door
behind him.

INT.  LIBRARY - DAY

Roderick alone.  Brookside enters with a pistol.

			BROOKSIDE
		   (grinding his teeth)
	Look you now, Mister Roderick James,
	from this moment on, I will submit
	to no further chastisement from you!
	Do you understand that?

			RODERICK
	Give me that pistol.

			BROOKSIDE
	Take heed, Mister James.  I will
	shoot you if you lay hands on me
	now, or ever again.  Is that
	entirely clear to you, sir?

Roderick stares hard at him, then he laughs and sits down.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I decided, at once, to give up that
	necessary part of his education.
	In truth, he then became the most
	violent, daring, disobedient,
	scapegrace, that ever caused an
	affectionate parent pain; he was
	certainly the most incorrigible.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - BROOKSIDE'S ROOM - DAY

Brookside smashing a chair over the head of his governor,
Reverend Hunt.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Twice or thrice, Reverend Hunt
	attempted to punish my Lord
	Brookside; but I promise you the
	rogue was too strong for him, and
	leveled the Oxford man to the
	ground with a chair, greatly to the
	delight of little Patrick, who cried
	out:  "Bravo, Brooksy!  Thump him,
	thump him!"

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDEN - DAY

Brookside and Patrick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	With the child, Brookside was,
	strange to say, pretty tractable.
	He took a liking to the little
	fellow -- I like him the more, he
	said, because he was "half a
	Cosgrove."

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - BALLROOM - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Another day, it was Patrick's
	birthday, we were giving a grand
	ball and gala at Hackton, and it was
	time for my Patrick to make his
	appearance among us.

There is a great crowding and tittering as the child comes
in, led by his half-brother, who walks into the dancing-
room in his stockinged feet, leading little Patrick by the
hand, paddling about in the great shoes of the older.

			BROOKSIDE
		   (very loudly)
	Don't you think he fits my shoes
	very well, Sir Richard Wargrave?

Upon which, the company begins to look at each other and
to titter, and his mother comes up to Lord Brookside with
great dignity, seizes the child to her breast, and says:

			COUNTESS
	From the manner in which I love this
	child, my lord, you ought to know
	how I would have loved his elder
	brother, had he proved worthy of any
	mother's affection.

Brookside is stunned by his mother's words.

			BROOKSIDE
	Madam, I have borne as long as
	mortal could endure the ill-
	treatment of the insolent Irish
	upstart, whom you have taken into
	your bed.  It is not only the
	lowness of his birth, and the
	general brutality of his manners
	which disgusts me, but the shameful
	nature of his conduct towards your
	ladyship, his brutal and
	ungentlemanlike behavior, his open
	infidelity, his habits of
	extravagance, intoxication, his
	shameless robberies and swindling of
	my property and yours.  It is these
	insults to you which shock and annoy
	me more than the ruffian's infamous
	conduct to myself.  I would have
	stood by your ladyship, as I
	promised, but you seem to have taken
	latterly your husband's part; and,
	as I cannot personally chastise this
	low-bred ruffian, who, to our shame
	be it spoken, is the husband of my
	mother, and as I cannot bear to
	witness his treatment of you, and
	loathe his horrible society as if it
	were the plague, I am determined to
	quit my native country, at least
	during his detested life, or during
	my own.

Bursting into tears, Lady Cosgrove leaves the room.
Roderick loses control, and rushes at Brookside, knocking
down Lords, Dukes and Generals, left and right, who try to
interfere.

The company is scandalizes by the entire incident.

INT.  LONDON CLUB - NIGHT

Action as per voice over.  Roderick is shunned.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	If I had murdered my lord, I could
	scarcely have been received with
	more shameful obloquy and slander
	than now followed me in town and
	country.  My friends fell away from
	me, and a legend arose of my cruelty
	to my stepson.

INT.  ST. JAMES - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My reception at court was scarcely
	more cordial.  On paying my respects
	to my sovereign at St. James, His
	Majesty pointedly asked me when I
	had news of Lord Brookside.  On
	which I replied, with no ordinary
	presence of mind:

			RODERICK
	Sire, my Lord Brookside has set sail
	to fight the rebels against Your
	Majesty's crown in America.  Does
	Your Majesty desire that I should
	send another company to aid him?

The King stares at Roderick, turns on his heel and quickly
leaves the presence-chamber.

Roderick is approached by the Duke of Rutland, who takes
him aside into an alcove.

			DUKE OF RUTLAND
		   (speaking very
		    quietly)
	Let me tell you, sir, that your
	conduct has been very odiously
	represented to the King, and has
	formed the subject of royal comment.
	The King has said, influenced by
	these representations, that you are
	the most disreputable man in the
	three kingdoms, and a dishonor to
	your name and country.

Roderick begins to sputter.

			DUKE OF RUTLAND
	Hear me out, please.  It has been
	intimated to His Majesty that you
	had raised the American Company for
	the sole purpose of getting the
	young Viscount to command it, and so
	get rid of him.  And, further, that
	you had paid the very man in the
	company, who was ordered to dispatch
	him in the first general action.

			RODERICK
	Thus it is that my loyalty is
	rewarded, and my sacrifices in favor
	of my country viewed!

			DUKE OF RUTLAND
	As for your ambitious hopes
	regarding the Irish peerages, His
	Majesty has also let it be known
	that you have been led astray by
	that Lord Crabs, who likes to take
	money, but who has no more influence
	to get a coronet than to procure a
	Pope's tiara.  And, if you have it
	in mind to call upon Lord Crabs, you
	will be disappointed.  He left for
	the continent on Tuesday, and may be
	away for several months.

INT.  LORD WEST'S OFFICE - DAY

Roderick and Lord West.

			RODERICK
	I insist upon being allowed to
	appear before His Majesty and clear
	myself of the imputations against
	me, to point out my services to the
	government, and to ask when the
	reward, that had been promised me,
	the title held by my ancestors, is
	again to be revived in my person.

There is a sleepy coolness in the fat Lord West.  He hears
Roderick with half-shut eyes.  When he finishes his
violent speech, which he has made striding about the room,
Lord West opens one eye, smiles, and says:   

			LORD WEST
		   (gently)
	Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?

			RODERICK
	Yes!

			LORD WEST
	Well, Mr. Cosgrove, I'll answer you
	point by point.  The King is
	exceedingly averse to make peers, as
	you know.  Your claim, as you call
	them, have been laid before him, and
	His Majesty's gracious reply was,
	that you were the most impudent man
	in his dominions, and merited a
	halter, rather than a coronet.  As
	for withdrawing your support from
	us, you are perfectly welcome to
	carry yourself whithersoever you
	please.  And, now, as I have a great
	deal of occupation, perhaps you will
	do me the favor to retire, or tell
	me if there is anything else in the
	world in which I can oblige you.

So saying, Lord West raises his hand lazily to the bell,
and bows Roderick out.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY

Roderick and his accountant going over the bills which he
has heaped on the table.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The news of His Majesty's disregard
	were not long in getting around,
	and, in a very short time, all the
	bills came down upon me together --
	all the bills I had been contracting
	for the years of my marriage.  I
	won't cite their amount; it was
	frightful.  I was bound up in an
	inextricable toil of bills and
	debts, or mortgages and insurances,
	and all the horrible evils attendant
	upon them.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GROUNDS - DAY

Roderick walking alone.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Was it my own want of style, or my
	want of a fortune?  I know not.  Now
	I was arrived at the height of my
	ambition, but both my skill and my
	luck seemed to be deserting me.
	Everything I touched, crumbled in my
	hands; every speculation I had,
	failed; every agent I trusted,
	deceived me.  My income was saddled
	with hundreds of annuities, and
	thousands of lawyers' charges, and I
	felt the net drawing closer and
	closer around me, and no means to
	extricate myself from its toils.
	All my schemes had turned out
	failures.

INT.  LONDON GAMING CLUB - NIGHT

Roderick at the gaming table.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My wife's moody despondency made my
	house and home not over-pleasant;
	hence, I was driven a good deal
	abroad, where as play was the
	fashion in every club, tavern, and
	assembly, I, of course, was obliged
	to resume my old habit, and to
	commence as an amateur those games
	at which I was once unrivaled in
	Europe.

Roderick loses a large amount of money.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had a run of ill-luck at play, and
	was forced to meet my losses by the
	most shameful sacrifices to the
	money-lenders, and was compelled to
	borrow largely upon my wife's
	annuities, ensuring her ladyship's
	life, which was the condition for
	every loan against her property.

INT.  LONDON OFFICE - INSURANCE BROKER - DAY

Roderick and the broker.

			BROKER
	Your wife's life is as well known
	among the insurance societies in
	London, as any woman in Christendom,
	and, I'm sorry to say there is not
	one of them willing to place another
	policy against her ladyship's life.
	One of them even had the impudence
	to suggest that your treatment of
	the Countess did not render her life
	worth a year's purchase.

EXT.  STUD FARM - DAY

Roderick buying a horse.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	In the midst of my difficulties, I
	promised to buy a little horse for
	my dear little Patrick, which was to
	be a present for his eighth
	birthday, that was now coming on.  I
	may have had my faults, but no man
	shall dare to say of me that I was
	not a good and tender father.

Roderick admires the horse.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	It was a beautiful little animal,
	and stood me in a good sum.  I never
	regarded money for that dear child.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

The horse kicks off one of the horse-boys who tries to
ride him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But the horse was a bit wild, and he
	kicked off one of the horse-boys who
	rode him at first, and broke the
	lad's leg.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Roderick riding the horse.  The horse-boy lies in the back
of a wagon.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But he was a beautiful animal and
	would make a fine horse for Patrick
	after he had a bit of breaking-in.

EXT.  ROAD - NEAR CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick dismounts and gives the horse to one of the
horse-boys.

			RODERICK
	Timmy, take the injured lad to see
	the doctor, and then bring the horse
	to Doolan's farm, and tell him to
	break him in thoroughly.  Tell him
	it's for little Patrick, and that
	I'll be over to see him next week.

			HORSE-BOY
	Yes, sir.

			RODERICK
	One more thing, and listen well, I
	don't want little Patrick to know
	where the horse is being kept.  It's
	going to be surprise for his
	birthday.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Patrick rushes out to greet his father.

			PATRICK
	Hello, papa!

Roderick picks him up in his arms, and kisses him.

			PATRICK
	Did you buy the horse, papa?

			RODERICK
	Now, just have a little patience, my
	boy.  Your birthday isn't until next
	week.

			PATRICK
	But I will have it on my birthday,
	won't I?

			RODERICK
	Well, we'll just have to wait and
	see, won't we?

He walks up the steps holding Patrick, who hugs and kisses
him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My son, little Patrick Cosgrove, was
	a prince; his breeding and manners,
	even at his early age, showed him to
	be worthy of the two noble families
	from whom he was descended, and I
	don't know what high hopes I had for
	the boy, and indulged in a thousand
	fond anticipations as to his future
	success and figure in the world, but
	stern Fate had determined that I
	should leave none of my race behind
	me.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick is drunk.  Patrick is brought in by his governor,
Hunt, to say good night.  His kisses his mother first,
then approaches Roderick.

			PATRICK
		   (kissing him)
	Good night, papa.

			RODERICK
	Good night, my little darling.

			PATRICK
	Papa?

			RODERICK
	Yes?

			PATRICK
	One of the boys in the stable told
	Nelly that you've already bought my
	horse, and that it's at Doolan's
	farm, where Mick the groom is
	breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?

			RODERICK
		   (angered)
	What the devil?  What kind of fools
	do we have here?  Pottle, who told
	the lad this story?

			HUNT
	I don't know, sir.

			PATRICK
	Then it's true!  It's true!  Oh,
	thank you, papa!  Thank you!

He hugs his father.

			COUNTESS
	Promise me, Patrick, that you will
	not ride the horse except in the
	company of your father.

			PATRICK
		   (unconvincingly)
	I promise, mama.

			RODERICK
	I promise your lordship a good
	flogging if you even so much as go
	to Doolan's farm to see him.

			PATRICK
	Yes, papa.

INT.  RODERICK'S BEDROOM - DAY

Roderick is awakened by his valet and Hunt, the governor.

			RODERICK
	Yes...?

			VALET
	I'm sorry to disturb you, sir, but
	Mr. Hunt has something important to
	tell you.

			RODERICK
	Yes?

			HUNT
	I think Master Patrick has disobeyed
	your orders and stolen off to
	Doolan's farm.  When I went to the
	lad's room this morning, his bed was
	empty.  One of the cooks said she
	saw him go away before daybreak.  He
	must have slipped through my room
	while I was asleep.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - STABLES - DAY

Roderick, in a rage, taking a great horse-whip, gallops
off after the child.

EXT.  ROAD - CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick comes upon a sad procession of farmers, moaning
and howling, the black horse led by the hand, and, on a
door that some of them carry, little Patrick.  He lies in
his little boots and spurs, and his little coat of scarlet
and gold.  His face is quite white, and he smiles as he
holds a hand out to Roderick and says painfully:

			PATRICK
	You won't whip me, will you, papa?

Roderick bursts out into tears in reply.

INT.  PATRICK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Some doctors around the bed, Roderick and the Countess
anxiously waiting upon them.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The doctors were called, but what
	does a doctor avail in a contest
	with the grim, invincible enemy?
	Such as came could only confirm our
	despair by their account of the poor
	child's case.  His spine was
	injured, the lower half of him was
	dead when they laid him in bed at
	home.  The rest did not last long,
	God help me!  He remained yet for
	two days with us, and a sad comfort
	it was to think he was in no pain.

INT.  PATRICK'S BEDROOM - DAY

Roderick, Countess and Patrick.

			PATRICK
		   (weakly)
	Papa, I beg you and mama to pardon
	me for any acts of disobedience I
	have been guilty of towards you.

			COUNTESS
		   (weeping)
	Oh, my little angel, you have done
	nothing for which you need pardon.

			PATRICK
	Where is Brooksy?  I would like to
	see him.

			RODERICK
	Your bother is in America fighting
	the rebels.

			PATRICK
	Is he all right, papa?

			RODERICK
	Yes, he's fine.

			PATRICK
	Brooksy was better than you, papa,
	he used not to swear so, and he
	taught me many good things while you
	were away.

Patrick takes a hand of his mother and of Roderick, in
each of his little clammy ones.

			PATRICK
	I beg you not to quarrel so, but to
	love each other, so that we might
	meet again in heaven where Brooksy
	told me quarrelsome people never go.

His mother is much affected by these admonitions, and
Roderick is too.

Patrick gives Roderick a ring from his finger, and a
locket to his mother.

He says that these gifts are so that they will not forget
him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	At last, after two days, he died.
	There he lay, the hope of my family,
	the pride of my manhood, the link
	which kept me and my Lady Cosgrove
	together.

EXT.  CHURCH - GRAVEYARD - DAY

Funeral.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I won't tell you with what splendor
	we buried him, but what avail are
	undertakers' feathers and heralds'
	trumpery.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - STABLE - DAY

Roderick enters the stable and, after a few seconds, we
hear a pistol shot.  He exits rapidly, the smoking pistol
still in his hand.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - VARIOUS - DAY AND NIGHT

The Countess:  Praying.  Waking up screaming.  Fits of
crying.  Severely depressed.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Lady Cosgrove, always vaporish and
	nervous, after our blessed boy's
	catastrophe, became more agitated
	than ever, and plunged into devotion
	with so much fervor that you would
	have fancied her almost distracted
	at times.

Countess sees visions.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She imagined she saw visions.  She
	said an angel from heaven told her
	that Patrick's death was a
	punishment to her for her neglect of
	her firstborn.  Then she would
	declare that Brookside was dead.

INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY

Roderick and his accountant.  Bills, bills, bills.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	By now, my financial affairs were
	near to ruin.  I could not get a
	guinea from any money-dealer in
	London.  Our rents were in the hands
	of receivers by this time, and it
	was as much as I could do to get
	enough money from the rascals to pay
	my wine-merchants their bills.  Our
	property was hampered, and often as
	I applied to my lawyers and agents
	for money, would come a reply
	demanding money of me for debts and
	pretended claims which the rapacious
	rascals said they had on me.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Mother arrives.  Roderick greets her.  Servants unload her
bags.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My mother was the only person who,
	in my misfortune, remained faithful
	to me -- indeed, she has always
	spoken of me in my true light, as a
	martyr to the rascality of others,
	and a victim of my own generous and
	confiding temper.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Mother supervising kitchen staff.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She was an invaluable person to me
	in my house, which would have been
	at rack and ruin before, but for her
	spirit of order and management and
	her excellent economy in the
	government of my rapidly dwindling
	household staff.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDEN - DAY

Roderick and his mother.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	If anything could have saved me from
	the consequences of villainy in
	others, it would have been the
	admirable prudence of that worthy
	creature.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT

Action as per voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She never went to bed until all the
	house was quiet and all the candles
	out; you may fancy that this was a
	matter of some difficulty with a man
	of my habits who had commonly a
	dozen of jovial fellows to drink
	with me every night, and who
	seldom, for my part, went to bed
	sober.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Actions as per voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Many and many a night, when I was
	unconscious of her attention, has
	that good soul pulled my boots off,
	and seen me laid by my servants snug
	in bed, and carried off the candle
	herself...

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S BEDROOM - DAY

Action as per voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	... and been the first in the
	morning, too, to bring me my drink
	of small beer.  It was my mother's
	pride that I could drink more than
	any man in the country.

INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - NIGHT

Roderick and his mother holding a letter before a fire,
which slowly brings out the writing in lemon juice between
the widely-spaced lines of directions to her milliner.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My mother discovered that always,
	before my lady-wife chose to write
	letters to her milliner, she had
	need of lemons to make her drink, as
	she said, and this fact, being
	mentioned to me, kind of set me
	a-thinking.

			RODERICK
		   (reading letter
		    aloud)
	"This day, three years ago, my last
	hope and pleasure in life was taken
	from me, and my dear child was
	called to Heaven.  Where is his
	neglected brother, whom I suffered
	to grow up unheeded by my side, and
	whom the tyranny of the monster to
	whom I am united drove to exile,
	and, perhaps to death?  I pray the
	child is still alive and safe.
	Charles Brookside!  Come to the aide
	of a wretched mother, who
	acknowledges her crime, her coldness
	towards you, and now bitterly pays
	for her error!  What sufferings,
	what humiliations have I had to
	endure!  I am a prisoner in my own
	halls.  I should fear poison, but
	then I know the wretch has a sordid
	interest in keeping me alive, and
	that my death would be the signal
	for his ruin.  But I dare not stir
	without my odious, hideous, vulgar
	gaoler, the horrid Irish woman, who
	purses my every step.  I am locked
	into my chamber at night, like a
	felon, and only suffered to leave it
	when ordered into the presence of my
	lord, to be present at his orgies
	with his boon-companions, and to
	hear his odious converse as he
	lapses into the disgusting madness
	of intoxication."

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick, and the Countess and mother, at a silent dinner.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	It was not possible to recover the
	name for whom the note was intended,
	but it was clear that, to add to all
	my perplexities, three years after
	my poor child's death, my wife,
	whose vagaries of temper and wayward
	follies I had borne with for twelve
	years, wanted to leave me.  I
	decided it best not to reveal to her
	ladyship our discovery, that we
	might still intercept and uncover
	further schemes with might be afoot.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - VARIOUS - DAY AND NIGHT

A few cuts showing Mother keeping an eye on the Countess.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Yet I was bound to be on my guard
	that she should not give me the
	slip.  Had she left me, I was ruined
	the next day.  I set my mother to
	keep sharp watch over the moods of
	her ladyship, and you may be sure
	that her assistance and surveillance
	were invaluable to me.  If I had
	paid twenty spies to watch her lady,
	I should not have been half so well
	served as by the disinterested care
	and watchfulness of my excellent
	mother.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDENS - DAY

Roderick walking with the Countess.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with
	me was a singular one.  Her life was
	passed in a series of crack-brained
	sort of alternation between love and
	hatred for me.  We would quarrel for
	a fortnight, then we should be
	friends for a month together
	sometimes.  One day, I was joking
	her, and asking her whether she
	would take the water again, whether
	she had found another lover, and so
	forth.  She suddenly burst out into
	tears, and, after a while, said to
	me:

			COUNTESS
	Roderick, you know well enough that
	I have never loved but you!  Was I
	ever so wretched that a kind word
	from you did not make me happy?
	Ever so angry, but the least offer
	of good-will on your part did not
	bring me to your side?  Did I not
	give a sufficient proof of my
	affection for you in bestowing one
	of the finest fortunes of England
	upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked
	you for the way you have wasted it?
	No, I loved you too much and too
	fondly; I have always loved you.
	From the first moment I saw you, I
	saw your bad qualities, and trembled
	at your violence; but I could not
	help loving you.  I married you,
	though I knew I was sealing my own
	fate in doing so, and in spite of
	reason and duty.  What sacrifice do
	you want from me?  I am ready to
	make any, so you will but love me,
	or, if not, that at least, you will
	gently us me.

Roderick kisses her.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I was in a particularly good humor
	that day, and we had a sort of
	reconciliation.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - NIGHT

Roderick and his mother.

			MOTHER
	Depend on it, artful hussy has some
	other scheme in her head now.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The old lady was right, and I
	swallowed the bait which her
	ladyship had prepared to entrap me
	as simply as any gudgeon takes a
	hook.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Arrival of Mr. Newcombe, the money-broker.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had hired a money-broker
	especially to find some means of my
	making a loan.  After several months
	without success, it was with some
	considerable interest that I
	received his visit.

INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY

Roderick and the money-broker, Mr. Newcombe.

			NEWCOMBE
	I have good news for you, Mr.
	Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle
	and Chatwick, in the city of London,
	are prepared to lend you 20,000
	pounds, pledged against your
	interest in the Edric mines.  They
	will redeem the encumbrances against
	the property, which amount to some
	10,000 pounds, and take a twenty-
	year working lease on the mines.
	They will lend you the 20,000 pounds
	against the lease income,
	which they will apply to the loan as
	it comes in, and they will make a
	charge of 18% per annum interest on
	the outstanding loan balance.

			RODERICK
	Mr. Newcombe, I have made some
	difficult loans during the past few
	years, at very onerous terms, but
	18% a year interest seems very stiff
	indeed.

			NEWCOMBE
	Considering your financial
	circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has
	been impossible to find anyone at
	all prepared to do any business with
	you.  I think you may count yourself
	lucky to have this opportunity.
	But, obviously, if you would reject
	this offer, I shall keep trying to
	find a better one.

			RODERICK
		   (after a pause)
	I am prepared to accept the terms,
	Mr. Newcombe.

			NEWCOMBE
	There are a few other points we
	should discuss.  The loan agreement
	can only be executed by her
	ladyship's signature, and provided
	that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be
	assured of her ladyship's freewill
	in giving her signature.

			RODERICK
	Provided that they can be assured of
	her ladyship's freewill?  Are you
	serious?

			NEWCOMBE
	May I be quite frank with you?

			RODERICK
	Yes, of course.

			NEWCOMBE
	Mister Bracegirdle said to me that
	he had heard her ladyship lives in
	some fear of her life, and meditated
	a separation, in which case, she
	might later repudiate any documents
	signed by herself while in durance,
	and subject them, at any rate, to a
	doubtful and expensive litigation.
	They were quite insistent on this
	point, and said they must have
	absolute assurance of her ladyship's
	perfect freewill in the transaction
	before they would advance a shilling
	of their capital.

			RODERICK
	I see.

			NEWCOMBE
	When I asked them in what form they
	would accept her ladyship's
	assurances, they said that they were
	only prepared to accept them if her
	ladyship confirms her written
	consent by word of mouth, in their
	presence, at their counting-house in
	Birchin Lane, London.  I requested
	they come here, and save her
	ladyship and yourself the
	inconvenience of the trip to London,
	but they declined, saying that they
	did not wish to incur the risk of a
	visit to Castle Hackton to
	negotiate, as they were aware of how
	other respectable parties, such as
	Messrs. Sharp and Salomon had been
	treated here.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick and his mother.

			MOTHER
	Depend on it, there is some
	artifice.  When once you get into
	that wicked town, you are not safe.
	There are scores of writs out
	against you for debt.  If you are
	taken in London, and thrown into
	prison, your case is hopeless.

			RODERICK
	Mother dear, we are now living off
	our own beef and mutton.  We have to
	watch Lady Cosgrove within and the
	bailiffs without.  There are certain
	situations in which people cannot
	dictate their own terms; and faith,
	we are so pressed now for money,
	that I would sign a bond with old
	Nick himself, if he would provide a
	good round sum.  With this money, we
	can settle our principal debts and
	make a fresh start.

			MOTHER
	Roderick, you must listen to me.  As
	soon as they have you in London,
	they will get the better of my poor
	innocent lad; and the first thing
	that I shall hear of you will be
	that you are in trouble.  You will
	be a victim of your own generous and
	confiding nature.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - COUNTESS' BEDROOM

Roderick and the Countess.

			COUNTESS
	Why go, Roderick?  I am happy here,
	as long as you are kind to me, as
	you now are.  We can't appear in
	London as we ought; the little money
	you will get will be spent, like all
	the rest has been.  Let us stay here
	and be content.

She takes his hand and kisses it.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Mother and Roderick.

			MOTHER
	Humph!  I believe she is at the
	bottom of it -- the wicked schemer.

EXT.  COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

Roderick's carriage moving along.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	We did not start in state, you may
	be sure.  We did not let the country
	know we were going, or leave notice
	of adieu with our neighbors.  The
	famous Mr. James Cosgrove and his
	noble wife traveled in a hack-
	chaise and pair.

INT.  COACH - DAY

The Countess lays her head on Roderick's shoulder and
smiles.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	When a man is going to the devil,
	how easy and pleasant a journey it
	is!  The thought of the money quite
	put me in a good humor, and my wife,
	as she lay on my shoulder in the
	post-chaise, going to London, said
	it was the happiest ride she had
	taken since our marriage.

EXT.  INN - DUSK

The carriage stops and they disembark.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	One night we stayed at Reading.

INT.  INN - NIGHT

Roderick and his wife at dinner.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My lady and I agreed that, with the
	money, we would go to France, and
	wait there for better times, and
	that night, over our supper, formed
	a score of plans both for pleasure
	and retrenchment.  You would have
	thought it was Darby and Joan
	together over their supper.

INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

Roderick and his wife making love.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	O woman!  Woman!  When I recollect
	Lady Cosgrove's smiles and
	blandishments, how happy she seemed
	to be on that night!  What an air of
	innocent confidence appeared in her
	behavior, and what affectionate
	names she called me!  I am lost in
	wonder at the depth of her
	hypocrisy.  Who can be surprised
	that an unsuspecting person like
	myself should have been a victim to
	such a consummate deceiver?

EXT.  GRAY'S INN OFFICE - DAY

The coach drives up.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	We were in London at three o'clock,
	an half-an-hour before the time
	appointed.

INT.  STAIRCASE - DAY

Roderick and the Countess looking for the office.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I easily found out Mr. Tapewell's
	apartment:  a gloomy den it was, and
	in an unlucky hour, I entered it.

They climb up dirty backstairs, lit by a feeble lamp, and
the dim sky of a dismal London afternoon.

The Countess seems agitated and faint.

When they get to the door, she stops in front of it.

			COUNTESS
	Roderick -- don't go in.  I am sure
	there is danger.  There's time yet,
	let us go back -- anywhere!

The Countess has put herself before the door in a
theatrical attitude and takes Roderick's hand.

He pushes her away to one side.

			RODERICK
	Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.

			COUNTESS
	Old fool!

She jumps at the bell, which is quickly answered by a
moldy-looking gentleman in an unpowered wig.

			COUNTESS
	Say Lady Cosgrove is here!

She stalks down the passage, muttering:  "Old Fool."

INT.  MR. TAPEWELL'S OFFICE - DAY

Tapewell is in his musty room, surrounded by his
parchments and tin boxes.

He advances and bows, begs her ladyship to be seated, and
points towards a chair for Roderick, which he takes,
rather wondering at the lawyer's insolence.

The lawyer retreats to a side-door, saying he will be back
in a moment.

In the next moment, he reenters, bringing with him another
layer, six constables in red waist-coats, with bludgeons
and pistols, and Lord Brookside.

Lady Cosgrove flings herself into the arms of her son,
crying and whimpering and calling him her savior, her
preserver, her gallant knight.

Then, turning to Roderick, she pours out a flood of
invective which quite astonishes him.

			COUNTESS
	Oh fool as I am, I have outwitted
	the most crafty and treacherous
	monster under the sun.  Yes, I was a
	fool when I married you, and gave up
	other and nobler hearts for your
	sake -- yes, I was a fool when I
	forgot my name and lineage to unite
	myself with a base-born adventurer
	-- a fool to bear, without repining,
	the most monstrous tyranny that ever
	woman suffered; to allow my property
	to be squandered; to see women as
	base and low-born as yourself...

			TAPEWELL
	For heaven's sake, be calm.

Tapewell bounds back behind the constables, seeing a
threatening look in Roderick's eye.

The Countess continues in a strain of incoherent fury,
screaming against Roderick, and against his mother, and
always beginning and ending the sentence with the word
"fool."

			RODERICK
	You didn't tell all, my lady -- I
	said "old" fool.

			BROOKSIDE
	I have no doubt that you said and
	did, sir, everything that a
	blackguard could say or do.  This
	lady is now safe under the
	protection of her relations and the
	law, and need fear your infamous
	persecutions no longer.

			RODERICK
	But you are not safe, and as sure as
	I am a man of honor, I will have
	your heart's blood.

			TAPEWELL
	Take down his words, constables;
	swear the peace against him.

			BROOKSIDE
	I would not sully my sword with the
	blood of such a ruffian.  If the
	scoundrel remains in London another
	day, he will be seized as a common
	swindler.

			RODERICK
	Where's the man who will seize me?

He draws his sword, placing his back to the door.

			RODERICK
	Let the scoundrel come!  You -- you
	cowardly braggart, come first, if
	you have the soul of a man!

The Countess and the bailiffs move away.

			TAPEWELL
	We are not going to seize you!  My
	dear sir, we don't wish to seize
	you; we will give you a handsome sum
	to leave the country, only leave her
	ladyship in peace.

			BROOKSIDE
	And the country will be rid of such
	a villain.

As Brookside says this, he backs into the next room.

The lawyer follows him, leaving Roderick alone in the
company of the constables who are all armed to the teeth.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I was no longer the man I was at
	twenty, when I should have charged
	the ruffians, sword in hand, and
	sent at least one of them to his
	account.  I was broken in spirit,
	regularly caught in the toils,
	utterly baffled and beaten by that
	woman.  Was she relenting at the
	door, when she paused and begged me
	to turn back?  Had she not a
	lingering love for me still?  Her
	conduct showed it, as I came to
	reflect on it.  It was my only
	chance now left in the world, so I
	put down my sword upon the lawyers
	desk.

Roderick puts his sword down on the lawyer's desk.

			RODERICK
	Gentlemen, I shall have no violence;
	you may tell Mr. Tapewell I am quite
	ready to speak with him when he is
	at leisure.

Roderick sits down and folds his arms quite peaceably.

EXT.  COFFEE HOUSE - NEAR GRAY'S INN - DAY

INT.  RODERICK'S ROOM IN COFFEE HOUSE - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I was instructed to take a lodging
	for the night in a coffee house near
	Gray's Inn, and anxiously expected a
	visit from Mr. Tapewell.

Tapewell talking to Roderick.

			TAPEWELL
	I have been authorized by Lady
	Cosgrove and her advisors to pay you
	an annuity of 300 pounds a year,
	specifically on the condition of you
	remaining abroad out of the three
	kingdoms, and to be stopped on the
	instant of your return.  I advise
	you to accept it without delay for
	you know, as well as I do, that your
	stay in London will infallibly
	plunge you in gaol, as there are
	innumerable writs taken out against
	you here and in the west of England,
	and that your credit is so blown
	upon that you could not hope to
	raise a shilling.  I will leave you
	the night to consider this proposal,
	but if you refuse, the family will
	proceed against you in London, and
	have you arrested.  If you accede, a
	quarter salary will be paid to you
	at any foreign port you should
	prefer.

			RODERICK
	Mr. Tapewell, I do not require a
	night to consider this proposal.
	What other choice has a poor, lonely
	and broken-hearted man?  I shall
	take the annuity, and leave the
	country.

			MR. TAPEWELL
	I am very glad to hear that you have
	come to this decision, Mr. Cosgrove.
	I think you are very wise.

There is a knock at the door and Roderick opens it.
Brookside enters with four constables armed with pistols.

The dialogue for this scene has to be written.

Brookside has gone against the bargain, and has decided to
have Roderick arrested upon one of the many writs out
against him for debt.

Mr. Tapewell is surprised and complains weakly that
Brookside is acting in bad faith.

Brookside brushes aside his objections.

Roderick is defeated, and meekly sits down in a chair.

The following lines are read over Roderick being shackled
and led out of the room.

			NARRATOR
	Mr. James Cosgrove's personal
	narrative finishes here, for the
	hand of death interrupted the
	ingenious author soon after the
	period which this memoir was
	compiled, after he had lived
	nineteen years an inmate of the
	Fleet Prison, where the prison
	records state he died of delirium
	tremens.

EXT.  FLEET PRISON - DAY

His mother, now very old and hobbled with arthritis,
enters the prison, carrying a basket on her arm.

			NARRATOR
	His faithful old mother joined him
	in his lonely exile, and had a
	bedroom in Fleet Market over the
	way.  She would come and stay the
	whole day with him in prison
	working.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - COUNTESS' STUDY

Signing a payment draft, the Countess sighs and gazes out
of the large window.

			NARRATOR
	The Countess was never out of love
	with her husband, and, as long as
	she lived, James enjoyed his income
	of 300 pounds per year and was,
	perhaps, as happy in prison, as at
	any period of his existence.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - STUDY - DAY

Brookside tearing up the payment draft presented to him by
his accountant.

			NARRATOR
	When her ladyship died, her son
	sternly cut off the annuity,
	devoting the sum to charities,
	which, he said, would make a nobler
	use of it than the scoundrel who had
	enjoyed it hitherto.

INT.  FLEET PRISON - DAY

Roderick, now grey-haired, blacking boots.

			NARRATOR
	When the famous character lost his
	income, his spirit entirely failed.
	He was removed into the pauper's
	ward, where he was known to black
	boots for wealthier prisoners, and
	where he was detected in stealing a
	tobacco box.

INT.  FLEET PRISON - DAY

Roderick and his mother.  Action as per voice over.

			NARRATOR
	His mother attained a prodigious old
	age, and the inhabitants of the
	place in her time can record, with
	accuracy, the daily disputes which
	used to take place between mother
	and son, until the latter, from
	habits of intoxication, falling into
	a state of almost imbecility, was
	tended by his tough old parent as a
	baby almost, and would cry if
	deprived of his necessary glass of
	brandy.

TITLE CARD

	It was in the reign of George III
	that the above-named personages
	lived and quarreled; good or bad,
	handsome or ugly, rich or poor, they
	are all equal now.

               FADE IN:

               EXT. FOREST - DAY

               DISTANT GUN AND MORTAR FIRE

               Muffled by the wet green forest.

               The very earth seems to tremble.

               A RABBIT

               Darts out of a log, lifts itself on its hind legs and sniffs 
               the air.

               LOBBED GRENADE EXPLODES

               VOICES and SHOUTS, closer now, mix with the rumbling WAR 
               SOUNDS in a veritable symphony of violence and confusion.

               A DEAD AMERICAN GI lays splayed out, careless in death.

               A pair of SOLDIERS flash among the trees, running hunched 
               over and low, and disappear into the gray blooms of SMOKE.

               For a moment the forest takes a breath.

               Nothing but trembling leaves. Then - The RATTLE of a Jeep 
               Coming closer in fits and starts, GRINDING through low gears.

               A Willys MB appears, CRASHING through the undergrowth.

               It's driven by Private First Class KELLY ERNSWILER.

               Eighteen, if that. Not much meat on him. His insignias 
               indicate he's in the 29th Infantry.

               His face might be attractive, under other conditions.

               He pauses and pulls a map from the pocket of his M41 standard-
               issue field jacket.

                                     KELLY
                         Where the hell are those Krauts?

               To give himself courage, he SINGS Tommy Dorsey's "I'll Be 
               Seeing You [in all the old familiar places]" while maneuvering 
               the Jeep through the bushes and rocks.

               He drives straight for a fallen LOG, GUNS the engine and 
               tries to go over it.

               The Jeep's FRONT WHEELS catch on the log.

               The BACK TIRES spin.

               Kelly gets out. Takes off his M1 combat helmet and wipes his 
               face. Assesses the situation.

               He grabs a BRANCH. Jams it under the wheel, trying to lever

               the Jeep free. When --

               The STUTTER of a nearby MACHINE GUN startles him.

               The branch SNAPS against Kelly's weight. He slips and falls 
               in the mud.

                                     KELLY
                         Shit.

               Determined, he grabs his pack and carbine and sets off on 
               foot through the forest.

               EXT. CLEARING

               Kelly strides purposefully out of the woods. Pauses against 
               a split-rail fence beneath the innocent sun.

               Across the clearing stands a seemingly abandoned BARN.

               But not for long, as TWO GERMAN INFANTRYMEN appear around 
               the corner of it.

               Kelly moves behind a tree to assess the situation.

               Unaware, the Germans smoke and talk. Kelly's too far away to 
               hear them but he watches their every move.

               They're relaxed, not as on guard as they should be. Their 
               Karabiners rest slung across their backs.

                                     KELLY
                         Bingo.

               AGAINST THE TREE

               Kelly focuses himself.

               Then he shoulders his carbine.

               Pulls out his dog tags and kisses them grimly.

                                     KELLY
                         "And so they buried Hector, breaker 
                         of horses."

               He takes his Smith & Wesson 1917 PISTOL from his pistol belt 
               and steps out into the SUNLIGHT FIELD in plain sight of the 
               guards.

               Surely he knows they can see him. He must want them to see 
               him.

               But they don't. Too busy passing nudie wallet photos.

               Halfway across the open grass, Kelly raises the pistol but 
               does not aim it.

               Just strides steadily closer, arms spread out, making himself 
               an easy target.

               Crazy as it seems, Private Kelly Ernswiler is trying to get 
               himself killed.

               EXT. BARN

               Kelly pauses not twenty feet from the Germans, FIRES into 
               the air and waves --

               -- when from behind him comes a voice.

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                              (O.S.)
                         Eine maus findet den kase.

               Kelly whips around to face a third German, the OFFICER.

               His pistol points right into the Officer's shocked pink young 
               face. Point blank range.

               Only - Kelly doesn't fire.

               He just lowers the pistol.

               The German smiles.

                                     KELLY
                         Kill me Adolf.

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                         Mien Prisoner!

               The Infantrymen have recovered from their idle and come 
               running.

               One of them yanks Kelly's hands behind his back and pushes 
               him into the barn roughly.

               Kelly doesn't struggle.

                                     KELLY
                         Hey, Siegfreid and Roy. What are you 
                         waiting for? Kill me.

               INT. BARN

               Kelly sits slumped in a chair, legs tied up. One of the 
               Germans shines a flashlight in his face. Kelly squints.

                                     KELLY
                         Come on you pussies. Let's get this 
                         over with.

               The German Officer produces a piece of paper and a fountain 
               pen.

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                              (German accent)
                         You will write your mother. Tell her 
                         how you will die now.

               Kelly takes the pen and examines it.

                                     KELLY
                         Genuine Third Reich issue, no less. 
                         Nice work.

               The Officer pokes the paper.

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                         You will write. How you die alone.

                                     KELLY
                         My mother and I don't have that kind 
                         of relationship.

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                              (hisses)
                         Write.

               Kelly thinks about it for a minute - should he or shouldn't 
               he - but sighs and begins writing. After a few lines, the 
               Officer snatches the paper away and passes it to an 
               Infantryman.

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                         Enough. Now you will beg for your 
                         life.

                                     KELLY
                         What don't you understand?

                                     INFANTRYMAN
                              (interrupts sheepishly 
                              in German accent)
                         The protocol says we should -

               The Officer wheels around and scowls at the speaker. He seems 
               to be getting a bit hysterical.

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                         I am the fucking protocol.
                              (to Kelly)
                         Beg!

               He and Kelly glare at each other.

               The Officer FIRES his Luger into the rafters.

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                         Beg - for - your - life!

                                     KELLY
                         You got to be kidding me.

               The Officer grabs his throat.

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                         Silence. Now I have a little fun.

               Kelly laughs. The officer slaps him. Kelly jerks away.

                                     KELLY
                         Now that's against the rules.

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                              (sneers)
                         There are no rules in war.

               Suddenly another AMERICAN GI appears behind the German in 
               the shadows.

               Only Kelly can see him. The GI motions to Kelly "keep talking" 
               while he gets into a better position with his M-1 rifle.

                                     KELLY
                              (to Officer)
                         You've never killed anyone before, 
                         have you?

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                         I shower in the blood of my victims --

               The GI shoots the two infantrymen who fall in exaggerated 
               pain and commence death throes.

               Quick as a flash, the GI's Colt 1911 PISTOL is at the German 
               Officer's neck, his M-1 in his other hand.

                                     GI
                         No wonder you smell so bad.

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                         Don't shoot, please.

               The GI's eyes widen. He looks at Kelly.

                                     GI
                         Will you look at the manners on this 
                         guy?
                              (to German)
                         Remember to thank me when I kill 
                         you.

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                         No, really, not in the neck -

               But the GI does anyway.

               The Officer SHRIEKS, grabs at his neck, and falls.

                                     GI
                              (to Kelly)
                         You all right?

                                     KELLY
                         Yeah. My elaborate death scene wasn't 
                         going anywhere anyway.

                                     GI
                         You want me to give you a minute?

                                     KELLY
                         That's okay. They'll get me 
                         eventually. If you can't get killed 
                         in a war, when can you?

                                     GI
                         That's right. Look on the bright 
                         side.

               The GI holds out his hand.

                                     GI
                         Bart. Bart Bowland.

               Kelly takes the hand of the grinning all-American type guy.

               About his own age, but BART takes up more space.

                                     KELLY
                         Kelly. Kelly Ernswiler.

                                     BART
                         Kelly?

                                     KELLY
                              (mimics)
                         Bart?

                                     BART
                         I mean - that's Irish, right?

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                              (from the floor, now 
                              with a decidedly 
                              American accent)
                         Wow man, this is a really beautiful 
                         scene and all, but I have to 
                         interrupt.
                              (to Bart)
                         Why the fuck did you have to shoot 
                         that cap so close to my neck? You 
                         gave me a powder burn.

                                     KELLY
                         Listen you wienerschnitzel. You should 
                         talk. You slapped me. I'm not your 
                         bitch.

               The Officer gets up and dusts off his uniform.

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                         Well, what was that whole creepy 
                         death wish thing about?

                                     KELLY
                         Well it didn't work, now did it?

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                              (shrugs)
                         Sometimes I get so caught up in the 
                         moment.

                                     KELLY
                         And what was that ridiculous shit 
                         about making me write to my mother?

               The Officer grins.

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                         Inspired, wasn't it?

                                     BART
                         Dude, you made him write to his 
                         mother? Who are you, Dr. Phil?

                                     INFANTRYMAN
                              (also with American 
                              accent)
                         Can we get up now?

               Bart helps him up and checks his regulation-issue Timex.

                                     BART
                         Might as well. There's only an hour 
                         left anyway.

               The German Officer crosses his arms.

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                              (to Kelly)
                         Admit it. You were scared.

                                     KELLY
                              (snorts)
                         Right.

               Kelly gets up from the chair and falls over. His legs are 
               still tied.

               EXT. FOREST

               The DEAD GI gets up and walks off with the GERMANS and some 
               other SOLDIERS, done for the day.

               Bart and Kelly walk back to the stranded Jeep.

                                     BART
                         That Willys yours?

                                     KELLY
                         Yup. Just got her. Three summers 
                         packing out at Shop Rite.

               Bart unfolds an entrenching tool from his belt and digs under 
               the back wheels, building up dirt.

               Then he goes around to the front and puts his shoulder against 
               the hood. Bart rocks the Jeep while Kelly pumps the gas.

               The Jeep finally pulls free and SPRAYS Bart with mud.

                                     KELLY
                         My bad. Thanks though.

               Kelly looks over his shoulder and starts backing away.

                                     KELLY
                         See you.

               Bart stands there, dripping with mud, shocked.

               About a hundred feet away Kelly stops.

                                     KELLY
                         Well, come on.

               Bart walks towards the Jeep. Kelly backs it up again.

                                     KELLY
                         I couldn't resist.

               Bart climbs in.

                                     BART
                         Real funny, Ernswiler. You might 
                         still get your chance to die today.

               INT. DINER - DAY

               The customers are all REENACTORS. Some Yanks, some Germans, 
               a few Scottish and North African irregulars. "Boogie-Woogie 
               Bugle Boy" plays on the jukebox.

               Bart and Kelly sit in a booth together. Bart has an easy, 
               confident manner and expansive gestures. Kelly eats hunched 
               over, like someone might try and steal his food.

                                     BART
                         Character building? Those crazy guys 
                         from Ann Arbor tied them to a dock.

                                     KELLY
                              (shrugs)
                         That's what you get for invading 
                         Wisconsin.

                                     BART
                         D-Day at Kenosha was nothing. At 
                         Guadalcanal Chillicothe there was a 
                         guy who actually injected himself 
                         with malaria.

                                     KELLY
                         That's crazy.

               They both eat for a minute.

                                     BART
                         Where do you live, anyway?

                                     KELLY
                         Shaker Heights.

                                     BART
                         That explains the death wish. Me 
                         too. What street?

                                     KELLY
                         Penn Place.

                                     BART
                              (chewing)
                         Hmm, don't know it.

                                     KELLY
                         It's not technically in Shaker Heights 
                         - but I go to Shaker Heights High.

               Pause. Kelly looks at Bart.

                                     BART
                         Langely Prep.

                                     KELLY
                         Sorry to hear that.

                                     BART
                         Well, I got kicked out of Shaker 
                         Heights High because my birdhouse 
                         came unglued in honors woodshop.

                                     KELLY
                         Of course. I would have gone to 
                         Langely myself only my polo pony had 
                         the fits.

               Bart throws his napkin on his plate.

                                     BART
                         No matter.
                              (raises his voice to 
                              address the room)
                         We're all soldiers here.

                                     CROWD
                         That's right./Here, here./ Whooping, 
                         cheers, etc.

               EXT. BOWLAND HOUSE - DAY

               Kelly pulls up into the circular gravel drive. Bart's house 
               is fancy. A nice yard and a pool. Bart hops out.

                                     BART
                         You should come over some time.
                         Service our lawnmower.

                                     KELLY
                         I would, but then I might soil my 
                         croquet whites. You understand.

                                     BART
                         How bourgeois. Cheerio then.

               Kelly watches Bart go into his house and smiles in spite of 
               himself.

               EXT. ERNSWILER HOUSE - DUSK

               Kelly's house is a also pretty nice, nothing to be ashamed 
               of. It is smaller and weirder. The flowers and bushes are 
               overgrown and strange sculptures dot the yard, some leaning 
               at precarious angles.

               Kelly washes his Jeep in the driveway.

               EXT. ERNSWILER HOUSE - NIGHT

               Kelly buffs the headlamps with a chamois. The Jeep looks 
               good as new. He pulls a canvas cover over it.

                                     KELLY
                         Sleep tight Hot Lips.

               INT. ERNSWILER HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Kelly walks in on his dad ABE making sandwiches. A great big 
               pile of cheese and PB&J.

                                     ABE
                         Sergeant Keller! How was the war? 
                         Did we win?

               Kelly doesn't smile at this. He looks at the sandwiches and 
               puts his finger to his chin in a gesture so facetious it's 
               downright angry.

                                     KELLY
                         Let me guess. Happy Meals for the 
                         wavy gravy wellness center?

               Abe grabs two pieces of bread from a loaf. He looks kind. A 
               bit ill-used by life. The phrase "rode hard and put away 
               wet" comes to mind.

                                     ABE
                         As usual, your cynicism is refreshing.

               He finishes that sandwich and adds it to the pile.

               Kelly pauses while opening the refrigerator. His back 
               tightens. He slams the door with his foot.

                                     KELLY
                         As usual, your cheerful optimism 
                         makes me ill.

               Abe pauses over a slice of bread only briefly. The hostility 
               is nothing new.

                                     ABE
                              (lightly)
                         You should get that checked.

               Kelly walks through the kitchen and out the back door.

                                     KELLY
                              (O.S.)
                         Sure thing, doc. Say hello to Leif 
                         Garrett for me.

               INT. ERNSWILER GARAGE - NIGHT

               Kelly opens the screen door and pokes his head in.

               A family of Chinese immigrants, the Lings, paints canvases 
               at long worktables. There's a MOTHER, father MAO, grandmother 
               XIOU-XIOU, SON and DAUGHTER.

               Finished canvases hang from the walls and lean in piles 
               against it. All of them are portraits of animals. Some have 
               on hats or clothes.

               Kelly's mom EVE shows grandmother XIOU-XIOU a few strokes 
               with a paintbrush.

               Eve wears jeans. She's one of those young-looking mothers 
               Kelly's friends would have crushes on. If he had any friends.

                                     MAO
                              (to Kelly)
                         Son of Eve. You are very dirty.

                                     KELLY
                              (awkward)
                         A rough charge. You know.

                                     EVE
                              (to Kelly)
                         Don't touch anything. We have to get 
                         ready for the Starving Artist show.
                              (to Xiou-Xiou)
                         Now Nana, the gold has to be feathery, 
                         not gloppy - see?

               Eve demonstrates on the painting - a pair of monkeys in French 
               court dress. Kelly looks over his mom's shoulder.

                                     EVE
                         Now you try.

               Grandmother Xiou-Xiou dabs at the painting.

                                     EVE
                              (to Kelly)
                         She loves the gold. Always overuses 
                         it. And usually her touch is so light.

                                     XIOU-XIOU
                         Gold is the color of the sun.

               Eve moves along the row, stopping to look at the paintings 
               in progress.

                                     KELLY
                         You know why we never have anything 
                         to eat in this house?

               But Eve has stopped behind Mao's painting. She's not paying 
               attention to Kelly.

                                     EVE
                         Mao, what did we say about the eyes?

               She gestures at the image of a horse done Santa Fe style, 
               lots of pastels, very abstract.

               Mao looks at her quizzically.

                                     MAO
                         More - empathy?

                                     EVE
                         That's right. And didn't I tell you 
                         to put in more cacti?

                                     MAO
                              (shakes head)
                         No, no more cacti. Too busy. 
                         Simplicity is best.

               His family nods in support of this rash aesthetic statement.

               Eve rolls her eyes.

                                     EVE
                         Oh boy. I'm not having this battle 
                         with you again.

               Kelly breaks in.

                                     KELLY
                         Because your husband takes food from 
                         his own family to feed every loser 
                         druggie in Cleveland.

               Eve moves down the line.

                                     EVE
                         Well, you can always chip in here. 
                         We're ordering pizza later.

               At this the family nods and smiles to each other, pleased 
               with the news.

                                     KELLY
                         No. Some people have to work later.
                              (casual)
                         Will you drop something off at the 
                         dry cleaners for me tomorrow?

               Eve looks up at him for the first time. Takes in his filthy 
               uniform.

                                     EVE
                         Sweetie, you know what we said about 
                         paying for the war things. Nothing's 
                         changed.

                                     KELLY
                         It's the only thing I ever ask you 
                         for --

                                     EVE
                         Don't be dramatic.

                                     KELLY
                         But it's important to me.

               Eve stops at Mother Ling's painting.

                                     EVE
                         You're just going to have to find a 
                         way to pay for it yourself then, I 
                         guess.
                              (to Mother Ling)
                         No - not that way - the sky should 
                         be stormier. Angry clouds.

               Mother Ling looks up at Kelly, who's scowling. She smiles 
               and nods, understanding.

                                     KELLY
                         Why do I bother?

               Kelly leaves. Eve's busy talking.

                                     EVE
                         More brown, less blue.

               INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Kelly comes back in a grabs a sandwich off the pile.

                                     ABE
                         Now Keller, who needs that sandwich 
                         more - you or the daughter of a crack 
                         addict trying to make a new life?

               Kelly looks at him and bites into the sandwich.

                                     KELLY
                         How about the son of a heroin addict 
                         trying to get ready for work?

               Kelly leaves with the sandwich. Abe sighs and picks up more 
               bread.

                                     ABE
                         That went well.

               INT. KELLY'S ROOM - NIGHT

               On the walls a poster for the Civil War miniseries next to 
               one of Led Zeppelin. Some maps. A globe. Models of fighter 
               planes and a set of old tin soldiers.

               Oh yeah, and his mom's ORIGINAL PAINTING, the one that started 
               it all, this one signed by her - a very intense looking pink 
               rabbit glaring out of the canvas with huge eyes.

               He sits on the edge of the bed for a minute staring into 
               space before he peels off his muddy uniform piece by piece.

               INT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT

               Ah, the graveyard shift. Musak Steely Dan.

               Kelly unpacks cat food.

               Thousands and thousands of little cans of it. It's hard to 
               keep the rows straight on the shelves.

               SARAH, the night cashier, stands at her register. She's plain-
               looking now but she'll be beautiful later when she figures 
               out who she is.

               Not another soul in the store. Sarah wanders over to Kelly's 
               aisle as if pulled by a magnet.

                                     SARAH
                         So how'd your battle go today? I 
                         still don't understand how you could 
                         reenact the Battle of the Bulge in 
                         seventy-two degree weather.
                              (plays with hair)
                         Didn't all those guys freeze to death?

               Kelly doesn't stop working. He's got a system.

                                     KELLY
                         Well, a Port-a-John fell over on a 
                         couple of guys.

                                     SARAH
                         That's gross.

                                     KELLY
                         War is hell.

               Kelly grabs another handful of cans.

                                     SARAH
                         Then why do you do it?

               Kelly pauses. He puts two cans on the shelf very deliberately.

                                     KELLY
                         You're never more alive then when 
                         facing simulated death.

                                     SARAH
                         Really? Maybe I should try it.

               Kelly looks at her, thinks about this, and stands up.

                                     KELLY
                         You are William J. Stone of the 1st 
                         Airborne, pinned down in Noville. 
                         The Germans have the high ground and 
                         they're shelling your position 
                         heavily.
                              (starts throwing cans)
                         You're holed up in a stone barn. 
                         Sustaining heavy casualties. Running 
                         low on ammo. The cries of wounded 
                         men fill the air like the cries of 
                         hungry babies.

               Sarah covers her head, huddled behind the boxes of cat food, 
               dodging cans.

                                     KELLY
                         Your commanding officer gets hit in 
                         the face, dies. At 1 p.m. you lose 
                         radio contact with headquarters. If 
                         you withdraw, the Germans will flank 
                         the entire Allied forces arrayed 
                         along Bastogne and break the front. 
                         What do you do? What do you do?

                                     SARAH
                         Stop it!

               Kelly goes back to stocking, satisfied.

                                     KELLY
                         Battle of Bulge, the Southern 
                         Shoulder, December '44.

                                     SARAH
                         Sorry I asked.

               Sarah stands up and starts to wander away but Kelly makes a 
               peace offering.

                                     KELLY
                         Hey. Want a snack? We got a whole 
                         shipment in of busted Oreo's.

               Sarah looks at her feet, considering whether or not to accept 
               it.

                                     SARAH
                         I'll accidentally drop a couple pints 
                         of milk and meet you over there.

               INT. DAIRY BACKROOM

               Sarah and Kelly sit on milk crates, pass the cookies back 
               and forth and get philosophical.

                                     SARAH
                         The frozen food woman came in with 
                         her kids. They must eat out of those 
                         little cardboard trays every night. 
                         One of the kids looked like cardboard.

                                     KELLY
                         Do you know we stock more flavors of 
                         cat food than we do baby food?

                                     SARAH
                         No.

                                     KELLY
                         Sixteen flavors of baby food including 
                         the toddler meals-in-ajar, thirty-
                         one flavors of cat food.

               He fishes for a cookie.

                                     KELLY
                         Next time you should tell that woman 
                         to buy her kid some cat food.

               An ANGRY WOMAN pushes open the swinging door of the backroom 
               with her loaded shopping cart.

                                     WOMAN
                         Is this store open? I've been waiting 
                         up front. If the store's closed, it 
                         shouldn't have a sign that says twenty-
                         four hours.

               Sarah gets up. Kelly stays right where he is, finishing a 
               cookie.

                                     SARAH
                         Sorry about that.

                                     WOMAN
                         I have a lot of coupons and I don't 
                         want to be here when they expire.

                                     KELLY
                              (to Sarah)
                         Charge her double for everything.

               Sarah smiles and hurries away.

               INT. SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH - DAY

               Kelly walks down the hall with his army-issue BACKPACK slung 
               over one shoulder. Besides a serious case of bedhead, he 
               looks normal.

               No one says hi to him as he makes his way to his locker.

               As he twirls the combination and opens it, he notices LANCE -- 
               short and wide, built like a tank, prematurely balding, and 
               his girlfriend BRIDGET embracing a few lockers down.

               They kiss raunchily, their tongues darting in and out of 
               each other's mouths.

               Lance sees Kelly looking and stops kissing.

                                     LANCE
                         What the fuck are you looking at, GI 
                         Jane?

               Kelly shakes his head and gets a book out of his locker.

                                     LANCE
                         No really, what makes you think you 
                         can look at me?

                                     KELLY
                         I honestly didn't know it was you. I 
                         thought it was a free preview of the 
                         Spice Channel.

                                     LANCE
                         That's pretty funny. You got dental 
                         insurance?

               Kelly closes his locker and walks away.

               Bridget wipes her mouth guiltily.

               Lance shakes his head and pulls Bridget to him, grinding his 
               pelvis against hers.

                                     BRIDGET
                         Stop it.

               She walks away.

                                     LANCE
                         What? What?

               INT. CLASSROOM -- DAY

               The lights are off in history class.

               The teacher MR. NORMAN shows slides on the Civil War. The 
               more we see the clearer it becomes that they are his own 
               photos from a vacation spent visiting the memorials.

               Mr. Norman smiles out at his class in shot after shot.

               He clicks the remote and a photo of his WIFE, crouched over 
               and wearing shorts, drinking from a garden hose appears on 
               screen.

                                     MR. NORMAN
                         Whoops!

               He hurries through to the next slide.

               It doesn't matter anyway. Everyone is almost asleep.

               Except Kelly, who becomes increasingly irritated the more 
               Mr. Norman talks.

                                     MR. NORMAN
                         And here, at Gettysburg, the ranks 
                         of Union soldiers fought bravely on. 
                         They were willing to give their lives 
                         so that others might be free.

               Kelly shifts in his seat.

                                     MR. NORMAN
                         Is there a problem Mr. Ernswiler?

                                     KELLY
                         No.

               But Mr. Norman doesn't start talking again.

               He waits, looking at Kelly, smiling blandly. Until the silence 
               becomes uncomfortable. And Kelly gets mad.

                                     KELLY
                         Come on. Isn't this analysis a tad 
                         simplistic? I mean, maybe for a second 
                         grade history class, sure - but to 
                         insist on still characterizing the 
                         Civil War as some moral struggle? 
                         The soldiers were drafted - the only 
                         ones who had to fight were the ones 
                         who couldn't afford to pay their way 
                         out.
                              (losing it)
                         Why don't you talk about the Draft 
                         Riots? Where are your slides for 
                         that?

               INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

               Fresh flowers and a crocheted tissue box hoodie make the 
               place cozy.

               Kelly sits across the desk from PRINCIPAL HOLMSTEAD, a well-
               groomed woman with a gentle talk show host demeanor.

                                     HOLMSTEAD
                         What gives you the idea that you can 
                         or ought to question the curriculum?

               Kelly doesn't move. He's not into this.

                                     HOLMSTEAD
                         Or question your teacher?

                                     KELLY
                         I know. I mean, who ever heard of a 
                         classroom dialog? Not Socrates.

               Ms. Holmstead is exasperated, but she likes him in spite of 
               herself. He's a smart cookie. She's got to change her 
               strategy.

               She leans back in her chair.

                                     HOLMSTEAD
                         Kelly, you're a very bright boy. But 
                         you're making some serious mistakes.

                                     KELLY
                         I don't need to. Everyone else makes 
                         them for me.

               Her chair SQUEAKS as she leans forward and looks at Kelly 
               intently.

                                     HOLMSTEAD
                         This anger must be masking a lot of 
                         hurt.

                                     KELLY
                         I was wondering what the tissues 
                         were for.

               Holmstead tries again. She looks down at his file.

                                     HOLMSTEAD
                         I see you're not going to college 
                         next year. What are your plans?

               Kelly shrugs. Holmstead searches his face for any clues.

                                     HOLMSTEAD
                         How do I get through to you?

                                     KELLY
                         Advertisers use status and sex to 
                         appeal to my demographic.

               She shakes her head and swings her chair towards the window 
               and gazes out at the front walkway of the school. Her face 
               clears. Something's clicked.

                                     HOLMSTEAD
                         I think we can come up with a 
                         punishment which might actually be 
                         more of an opportunity for you to 
                         realize your true potential.

               EXT. SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH - DAY

               School's been out for a while. The first rush had already 
               left.

               Kelly comes down the front steps and starts across the parking 
               lot to his Jeep.

               Lance steps out from behind an SUV and intercepts him.

                                     LANCE
                         You upset Bridget.

               Kelly hardly stops walking.

                                     KELLY
                         Give me a break.

                                     LANCE
                         You need to apologize.

                                     KELLY
                         What are you going to do, make out 
                         with me?

               Lance runs and grabs Kelly's backpack.

                                     LANCE
                         Why are you fucking with me? You 
                         little fucker. Want to play, fuckface?

                                     KELLY
                         You just used fuck as a verb, noun, 
                         and adjective. Impressive.

               Kelly tries to start walking again but Lance has hold of 
               him.

                                     LANCE
                         Let's see what Beetle Bailey's got 
                         in his knapsack.

               Lance grabs Kelly's arm and yanks it back. Kelly still seems 
               unconcerned.

               Suddenly he pulls away, but Lance keeps hold of his backpack.

               Lance holds the backpack up next to his head and points at 
               it, gleeful.

               Lance walks away towards his car. Kelly runs after him.

               Lance holds Kelly off easily with one hand and throws the 
               backpack into his SUV. They STRUGGLE for a minute, until 
               Lance pushes Kelly away, gets in the car.

               Kelly runs next to the car and pounds on the window as Lance 
               drives off.

               Finally, Kelly gives up. Lance turns out of the parking lot 
               and HONKS the horn.

               Kelly shakes his head.

                                     KELLY
                         Rim job.

               INT. ARMY NAVY STORE - DAY

               Kelly sifts through a pile of backpacks looking for a 
               replacement. From his post behind the counter, Bart sees him 
               and comes over.

                                     BART
                         Kelly. Hey.

                                     KELLY
                         You work here?

                                     BART
                         Just a couple days a month, to get a 
                         heads-up on the latest stuff. What 
                         are you doing?

                                     KELLY
                         Looking for a backpack.

                                     BART
                         Is that all? Don't bother. I have a 
                         couple extras at home. I could give 
                         you one if you want.

                                     KELLY
                              (beat)
                         Sure, I guess.

               INT. BOWLAND HOUSE, DAD'S LIBRARY - DAY

               Kelly stands a bit awkwardly waiting for Bart to get the key 
               from the desk to open the door in the corner. The door finally 
               swings open.

               INT. STOREROOM

               Bart and Kelly stand between shelves piled high with war 
               memorabilia. Uniforms in vacu-pac sealed bags, weapons in 
               shoeboxes, cannonballs and tattered and gunsmoke-darkened 
               flags.

                                     KELLY
                         Very impressive.

                                     BART
                         My dad's real into hoarding.

               Kelly holds up a flask in a leather case.

                                     KELLY
                         What's this?

                                     BART
                         Grant's field flask.

                                     KELLY
                         Wow. Your dad should meet my history 
                         teacher. He sent me to the principal's 
                         office today for questioning his G-
                         rated interpretation of the Civil 
                         War.

                                     BART
                         Forget him.

                                     KELLY
                         I would, but now the principal's 
                         making me give a speech on the Civil 
                         War at an assembly.

                                     BART
                              (laughing in sympathy 
                              and amusement)
                         What is he, some kind of sadist?

                                     KELLY
                         She thinks she's doing me a favor.

                                     BART
                         Jesus, she must think you're really 
                         screwed up. Are you?

                                     KELLY
                         Depends on who you ask. Everyone's 
                         got an opinion.

                                     BART
                              (grabs box)
                         Take this. That'll shut them up.

               Bart opens the long box. Nestled inside is a leg bone with a 
               foot attached to it.

                                     BART
                         Stonewall Jackson's.

                                     KELLY
                         Yeah right.

                                     BART
                         Can you imagine that? Losing your 
                         leg and getting back up on your horse? 
                         Unbelievable. What balls.

               Kelly nods. That is balls.

                                     BART
                         He's got so much crap crammed in 
                         here he doesn't even notice when 
                         it's missing. I saw a backpack in 
                         here somewhere.

               Bart puts down the box carelessly and paws through the piles.

               INT. BOWLAND KITCHEN

               Bart and Kelly sit at the kitchen table drinking sodas, 
               waiting for MINNIE, the housekeeper, to finish making them 
               dinner.

                                     BART
                         I thought he had a couple.

                                     KELLY
                         I'd feel weird taking one out of the 
                         tomb of Tutenkamen anyway.

                                     BART
                         Trust me, you shouldn't.
                              (burps)
                         Where'd your old one go?

                                     KELLY
                         I lost it.

                                     BART
                         How?

               A pause. Kelly decides to tell him.

                                     KELLY
                         Someone took it.

                                     BART
                         You let someone take it?

                                     KELLY
                         I didn't let him. I told off some 
                         idiot --

                                     BART
                         Sounds like your mouth gets you into 
                         trouble a lot.

                                     KELLY
                         I'm telling you, it's not me, it's 
                         the world.

               TABBY, Bart's older sister comes in.

               She's older. Definitely in college, if not out. And totally 
               shockingly beautiful. Otherworldly.

                                     BART
                         Tabby, this is Kelly.

                                     TABBY
                              (to Kelly)
                         Don't give him any money, whatever 
                         you do.

                                     BART
                         Shut up.

                                     TABBY
                         All these little old ladies are 
                         looking for him in Arizona. He took 
                         their retirement money and bought 
                         defective bazookas with it.

               Kelly laughs. And looks at Tabby more closely.

                                     BART
                         Very funny. We're paying attention 
                         to you, are you happy now?

                                     TABBY
                         Finally, my life is complete. Fait 
                         accompli.

                                     BART
                              (to Tabby)
                         Minnie's making sloppy joes. Want 
                         one?

                                     TABBY
                         Sloppy joe? Sloppy no.

               She opens the fridge and gets a yogurt.

                                     TABBY
                         I have to go take a shower. Will you 
                         call me when Miner gets here?

               Tabby leaves. Kelly's distracted.

                                     KELLY
                         Who's Miner?

                                     BART
                         The fiancé.

               Bart rolls his eyes, indicating what he thinks of good old 
               Miner.

               Kelly nods, doesn't say anything.

                                     BART
                         Listen, I'm going to the flea market 
                         on Saturday. I have a line on a couple 
                         dealers. You could get a backpack 
                         there.

               Kelly glances at the door Tabby left from.

                                     KELLY
                         Oh yeah? Flea market, land of 
                         bargains.

                                     BART
                         Especially if you know who to talk 
                         to.

               Kelly looks at Bart with suspicion -- and respect.

               EXT. SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH - MORNING

               Kelly hops out of his Jeep and walks towards the front of 
               the school.

               Lance is there, hanging out with Bridget and some of his Cro-
               Magnon FRIENDS.

               He wears a WW II CAP, overseas airborne style, obviously 
               Kelly's.

                                     LANCE
                         Hey fuckface. Like my new hat? I 
                         just joined the Boy Scouts.

               The Cro-Magnons grunt approvingly at this witty repartee.

                                     KELLY
                         If you stay in it long enough, maybe 
                         you'll get your fudgepacker badge.

               Ooh. The Cro-Magnons laugh at Lance and EGG him on - "You 
               gonna take that?"/"He just called you a fag", etc.

               Lance frowns and grabs Kelly.

                                     LANCE
                         You're a regular Howie Mandel.

               Still holding on to him with one arm, he SLAPS Kelly hard 
               across the face with the other.

               Kelly's knees give a bit. Lance holds him up.

                                     BRIDGET
                         Lance!

               Lance looks over at her and releases Kelly.

                                     LANCE
                         Okay babe.
                              (to Kelly)
                         One day you and me will be alone. 
                         And won't that be nice?

               Kelly is hurt but covering.

                                     KELLY
                         Too bad my mom won't let me date 
                         yet.

               Kelly frowns and adjusts his clothes. Tries to re-wet the 
               dry inside of his mouth with his tongue.

               He turns slowly and trudges up the stairs.

               Sarah has been watching the whole thing from the door.

                                     SARAH
                         Why do you mess with him?

                                     KELLY
                         You're right. I should give him a 
                         break.

               INT. ERNSWILER HOUSE - DAY

               Kelly watches TV in the living room. His cheek has a nice 
               bruise on it. Eve enters.

                                     EVE
                         Oh, Kelly, you're home. Good. I need 
                         you to go to the art supply store 
                         for me.

               Kelly looks at the TV.

                                     KELLY
                         Get Abe to do it.

               Eve goes to her purse and rifles through it to find her 
               wallet.

                                     EVE
                         He was going to but he had to go 
                         lead a meeting at Care House.

                                     KELLY
                         What a surprise.

                                     EVE
                         I'll make it up to you.

                                     KELLY
                         Where have I heard that before?

               Eve sighs.

                                     EVE
                         When are you going to give me a break?

               Kelly jabs at the remote.

                                     KELLY
                         Let me think - maybe when I finally 
                         forget every single word of The Little 
                         Mermaid soundtrack I'd listen to in 
                         the car waiting for him to score. 
                         No, probably when I don't prepare 
                         myself before I go into the bathroom, 
                         expecting to find him passed out on 
                         the floor.

               Eve waits through this.

                                     KELLY
                         Actually, you know what? I know I'll 
                         be able to put it all behind me when 
                         I go away to college.
                              (slaps his forehead, 
                              pretend remembering)
                         Only, I can't go because someone 
                         spent my college fund on Mexican 
                         Black Tar. So looks like I'll have 
                         to try to forget at Shop Rite, where 
                         I'll be working for the rest of my 
                         life.

                                     EVE
                         You're right. You have every reason 
                         to crawl into the corner and give 
                         up. But please just get me some paints 
                         first.

               Eve comes over to Kelly. He sighs and puts his hand out.

                                     KELLY
                         What do you need?

               She gives him the money.

                                     EVE
                         We need burnt sienna, cadmium red, 
                         and midnight blue. Two tubes of blue.
                              (looks at him)
                         What happened to your face?

               She puts her hand up but he moves away from it.

                                     KELLY
                         Forget it.

               INT. ART SUPPLY STORE - DAY

               Kelly looks through the paints, picking out tubes. He looks 
               up and sees Tabby browsing the paintbrushes.

               He's suddenly nervous. He knocks over a few cans of thinner. 
               Almost leaves.

               Instead, he gathers his courage, goes to the display opposite 
               hers and waits to catch her eye.

                                     KELLY
                         They're having a sale on glitter.

               It takes Tabby a second to recognize him.

                                     TABBY
                         Oh, hello. What happened to you?

                                     KELLY
                              (shrugs)
                         Tennis injury.

               Tabby looks at him suspiciously like she's not sure whether 
               to believe him.

               Tabby finishes with the mediums and moves onto the paints.

               Kelly follows her, staying in the opposite aisle.

                                     TABBY
                         You paint?

                                     KELLY
                         Well, you see... That's a difficult 
                         question.

                                     TABBY
                         How so?

                                     KELLY
                         I don't really feel comfortable 
                         calling anything done since the 
                         Renaissance "painting." We might 
                         have a more experimental interaction 
                         with the picture plane, but our skills 
                         have suffered from it.

               In spite of herself, Tabby laughs at this. This gives Kelly 
               more confidence. He leans over the aisle to see what she's 
               looking at.

                                     KELLY
                         You're working with acrylic. Why? 
                         Oil's much - richer.

                                     TABBY
                         Oh you're not one of those oil snobs 
                         are you?

                                     KELLY
                         Of course not.

               Kelly comes around and leans nonchalantly against the shelves, 
               knocks more things over and fumbles to replace them.

                                     KELLY
                         It's just - isn't acrylic a bit - 
                         jejune?

                                     TABBY
                         Jejune? You're jejune. How old are 
                         you anyway?

                                     KELLY
                         Older than my years.

               Tabby walks to the counter with her brushes.

                                     TABBY
                         And you paint?

               Kelly looks down and partially confesses.

                                     KELLY
                         Well, you know, my mother's kind of 
                         an artist, so -

                                     TABBY
                         That explains it.

               Tabby signs the slip and takes the bag. She walks out, Kelly 
               with her, matches her pace, talking.

                                     KELLY
                         That explains nothing. Doesn't anyone 
                         believe in innate knowledge anymore? 
                         Michelangelo was fifteen when he 
                         painted the Infanta.

                                     TABBY
                         Infantas are Spanish. Michelangelo 
                         was Italian.

               Tabby gets into her car. Kelly leans into her window.

                                     KELLY
                         Exactly. One world, one people. Just 
                         like Jesse Jackson envisioned.

               Tabby tries to conceal her smile and starts her car.

                                     TABBY
                         Well - Kelly. Nice talking to you.

               She drives away. Kelly stands there watching. Then he winces.

                                     KELLY
                         What the hell did you just say?

               EXT. ERNSWILER HOUSE - DAY

               Kelly pulls up in his Jeep. He turns off the engine but 
               doesn't get out. Just sits there. He doesn't want to go in.

               EXT. FLEA MARKET - DAY

               Colored plastic flags droop in the sun.

               MILITARY STALL

               Bart sweeps his eye over everything. A SKINNY GUY wearing a 
               wife beater has some not half-bad stuff.

               Kelly, bruise faded to yellow and green, examines a glass 
               mason jar of what seems to be dirt.

                                     SKINNY GUY
                              (to Kelly)
                         That there's actual sand from Iwo 
                         Jima.

                                     BART
                         Or your sister's sandbox.

               The guy shrugs.

                                     SKINNY GUY
                         Well, it don't come with no 
                         certificate of authenticity.
                              (considers)
                         I could write one up for you, I 
                         suppose. Get it notarized.

                                     BART
                         No, that's quite all right. Actually, 
                         I'm in the market for medals.

                                     SKINNY GUY
                         Sure. I got a couple purple hearts. 
                         A Silver Star. DSC. Can't sell them 
                         to you though. They were gramp's.
                              (wink)

               Bart acts casual, hands clasped behind his back.

                                     BART
                         Are you sure?

                                     SKINNY
                         They have a lot of sentimental value 
                         -

                                     BART
                         Yeah. How much?

                                     SKINNY GUY
                         A lot.

               Bart pulls out a paper bag and offers it to the skinny guy, 
               who looks inside.

                                     SKINNY GUY
                         What's this?

                                     BART
                         General Ulysses S. Grant's field 
                         flask, my friend.

               Kelly is shocked. The skinny guy looks at his suspiciously.

                                     BART
                         Throw in one of those backpacks and 
                         we'll call it even.

               The skinny guy looks at Bart, and in the bag again. He goes 
               to get the backpack. Kelly's impressed by this smooth 
               exchange.

               FLEA MARKET - BETWEEN ROWS

               Kelly and Bart weave through the maze of stands. Kelly now 
               holds the backpack.

                                     KELLY
                         Buying and selling US service medals 
                         is illegal.

                                     BART
                         Exactly. That's why the resale value 
                         is so high.

                                     KELLY
                         Is that what they teach you at 
                         Langely?

                                     BART
                         Don't be so naïve. We all have our 
                         skeletons. Some of them just pay 
                         more than others.

                                     KELLY
                         And I'm not even going to ask about 
                         the flask.

                                     BART
                         Don't ask, don't tell. The army gets 
                         everything right, don't they?

               CAMPAIGN PIN STALL

               A frowsy WOMAN in a muumuu sits fanning herself in front of 
               an extensive display of pins and buttons.

                                     WOMAN
                         You boys look like Goldwater fans.

                                     KELLY
                         I've never been accused of that 
                         before.

                                     WOMAN
                         Well jeez, you don't have to be 
                         insulted.

                                     BART
                         Anything military?

               The woman considers this, her fan working back and forth 
               lazily.

                                     WOMAN
                         Fish around in that cigar box.

               Bart paws through the box. Acts casual.

                                     BART
                         What do you want for the box?

                                     WOMAN
                         Twenty dollars.

                                     BART
                         Fifteen.

                                     WOMAN
                         Don't be so hasty.
                              (fanning)
                         I got a few Geraldine Ferraro pins 
                         I'm looking to unload.

               FLEA MARKET FOOD COURT

               Kelly and Bart, now wearing the smiling black & white face 
               of Geraldine Ferraro, eat disgusting yet delicious flea market 
               food and watch a slow-motion bingo game.

                                     KELLY
                         Goldwater fan. I think that's some 
                         kind of insult.

                                     BART
                         Not at Dartmouth. Where are you going 
                         to go to school?

                                     KELLY
                         I'm not.

                                     BART
                         Ah, you have that luxury.

                                     KELLY
                         You don't?

                                     BART
                              (shrugs)
                         I didn't have much say in the matter. 
                         Everything has been decided for me 
                         since birth. I'm not whining about 
                         it. Play the hand you're dealt, right?

                                     KELLY
                         Easy for you to say. You got a royal 
                         flush.

                                     BART
                         Are you crazy? My life sucks. 
                         Everyone's always telling me what to 
                         do. You can't fight it. Go with the 
                         flow.

               They eat for a minute to the soothing sounds of the BINGO 
               CALLER: TWENTY-ONE, THIRTEEN, FOUR, SEVENTY-EIGHT.

                                     KELLY
                         What about Tabby?

                                     BART
                         She got to go where she wanted. Sarah 
                         Lawrence. Six years. She's almost 
                         done with grad school. Yale.

                                     KELLY
                         I didn't think people actually went 
                         to Yale.

                                     BART
                              (thinking)
                         I don't know. I mean, she drives off 
                         in her car in September. For all we 
                         know, she could just pull her car 
                         over in Albany and sleep there until 
                         May.

                                     KELLY
                         What do you mean?

                                     BART
                         It was a joke. Joke?

               Bart does some fake sign language to help Kelly out.

                                     KELLY
                         Oh. Is that what one of those sounds 
                         like? Somehow, I always imagined 
                         they would be funnier.

               Bart pushes Kelly, who grabs his arm like it got hurt.

                                     KELLY
                         Sarah Lawrence? Isn't that for 
                         lesbians?

               Bart shrugs.

                                     BART
                         What happened to your face?

                                     KELLY
                         Remember the backpack incident?

                                     BART
                         Same guy?

                                     KELLY
                         The one with mad cow-diseased 
                         hamburger meat for brains? That would 
                         be the one.

               Interested, Bart leans forward.

                                     BART
                         What are you going to do about it?

                                     KELLY
                         I'm not going to lower myself to his 
                         level.

                                     BART
                         Of course not. But there are 
                         alternatives

                                     KELLY
                         Alternatives?

                                     BART
                         Haven't you ever heard of the 193rd 
                         Special Operations Wing?

               Kelly shakes his head.

                                     BART
                         Well do you want to get this guy or 
                         what?

                                     KELLY
                         Yes.

                                     BART
                         All right. Let's get the fuck out of 
                         here, then.

               Bart tosses his wrapper at the trashcan. Kelly watches it 
               hit the rim and go in.

                                     BART
                              (on the move)
                         I have some things to show you.

               INT. BOWLAND HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Bart and Kelly sit amidst a spread of books, papers, and 
               electronic equipment.

                                     BART
                         Once we've gathered the intelligence, 
                         the plan will reveal itself.

                                     KELLY
                         We don't plan first?

               Bart opens a pad.

                                     BART
                         No, it limits our scope - what's the 
                         objective?

                                     KELLY
                         Humiliation. Rage. Despair.

                                     BART
                         Easy enough. 'Nam's probably our go-
                         to war for that sort of thing. I 
                         have the declassified briefs from 
                         the Phoenix Project around here 
                         somewhere.

               Bart grabs a book and starts flipping through pages.

               Tabby enters with an armful of art supplies.

                                     TABBY
                         Hey. I have some stretcher bars out 
                         in the car. Can somebody help me 
                         bring them in?

                                     BART
                         Of course we'll drop what we're doing 
                         because what you're doing must be 
                         more important.

               Bart doesn't look up. He grabs another book.

                                     KELLY
                         Sure. I mean, I'll help.

               Bart raises his eyebrow. Kelly shrugs off the look.

                                     BART
                         I'll find those reports.

               INT. TABBY'S STUDIO - NIGHT

               Tabby drops the canvas and points at the table. Kelly dumps 
               the bars and stands there looking around.

               At the wood floors and skylights. Couch covered with a sheet.

               Painting, serious ones, with layers of paint and mysterious 
               objects stuck to them lay against the walls. They all seem 
               faded, like a vacation photo that's been through the wash.

               Kelly moves to the PAINTING on the easel.

               Very yellow and pink. Kind of looks like castles.

                                     KELLY
                         Gold. The color of the sun.

               Tabby wrestles with the bolt of canvas.

                                     TABBY
                         That's the Cleveland waterfront.

                                     KELLY
                         As the viewer, I get to decide what 
                         it is, I'm afraid. And it doesn't 
                         look a thing like it.

                                     TABBY
                         It's the light. I was playing with 
                         diffusion.

                                     KELLY
                         Well make sure you put it away when 
                         you're done with it.

                                     TABBY
                         Very funny, wiseass.

               Kelly resumes his tour of the room.

                                     KELLY
                         It must be nice to have a place like 
                         this to get away to.

                                     TABBY
                         It is.

                                     KELLY
                         What about Farmer?

                                     TABBY
                         Farmer?

               Tabby unrolls the canvas and measures lengths.

                                     KELLY
                         The boyfriend.

                                     TABBY
                              (laughs)
                         Miner? What about him?

                                     KELLY
                         Is he an artist, too?

                                     TABBY
                         No. Definitely not. Thank god.

               Kelly is silent for a while, fiddling with a clamp light.

                                     TABBY
                         You said your mom was a painter?

                                     KELLY
                         She was, well - is I guess.

               Tabby cuts the canvas.

                                     TABBY
                         What do you mean?

                                     KELLY
                         She used to be. But then my dad - 
                         wasn't working anymore so she turned 
                         it into a business. She has a family 
                         of Chinese immigrants in the garage 
                         making them for her.

                                     TABBY
                         Like Andy Warhol's Factory.

                                     KELLY
                         More like Andy Warhol's tool shed. 
                         It was nice before, though. My playpen 
                         used to be in her studio.

                                     TABBY
                         Wow. So you really grew up with it. 
                         What does, did, your dad do?

                                     KELLY
                         He's a VH-1 documentary without the 
                         music.

                                     TABBY
                         "Tragedy struck?"

               Kelly nods.

                                     KELLY
                         "And then, things took a turn for 
                         the worse."

                                     TABBY
                         Well, just wait. Those burnout types 
                         always have a triumphant comeback 
                         tour.

                                     KELLY
                         I already changed the channel.

               Tabby sits back on her heels and looks at him.

               Bart's head appears in the open door.

                                     BART
                         Christ Kelly, I let you go out on a 
                         little supply line assist and you're 
                         gone for days. Come on.

                                     TABBY
                         Have fun, boys.

                                     KELLY
                         If only it were fun. War's deadly 
                         serious, ma'am.

                                     TABBY
                              (to Bart)
                         And I used to think you were the 
                         only crazy one.

                                     BART
                         Enough with the mind pollution, Hanoi 
                         Hannah.

               Bart leaves. Kelly stands by the door. This is his only 
               chance.

                                     KELLY
                         I'm worried about you playing with 
                         diffusion unsupervised.

                                     TABBY
                         Are you?

                                     KELLY
                         Yes. I might have to come by and 
                         show you the proper safety procedures. 
                         Some time in the presence of an art 
                         prodigy would do you good.

                                     TABBY
                         I don't think I have room for a 
                         playpen in here.

                                     KELLY
                         Ouch.

               Tabby smiles. Kelly leaves.

               EXT. BOWLAND YARD - NIGHT

               Bart and Kelly walk across the yard.

                                     BART
                         So, you have a thing for my sister?

                                     KELLY
                         What? No, no.

                                     BART
                         Everybody does.

               They skirt around the pool.

                                     KELLY
                         We just have a few things in common.

                                     BART
                         Oh really, like what?

                                     KELLY
                         I can't tell you. It's my feminine 
                         side.

                                     BART
                         You don't wear women's clothes when 
                         you're alone, do you?

               INT. ERNSWILER HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Kelly comes out of the kitchen with a glass of water in pajama 
               bottoms and a T-shirt. The TV's on static. He sees a FIGURE 
               sleeping on the couch and starts to walk through the room.

               Then he stops, sighs, and backtracks. He turns off the TV.

               Then he sees the empty bottle of wine next to the couch.

                                     KELLY
                         Dad.

               The figure doesn't move. Kelly doesn't know what to do.

                                     KELLY
                              (louder)
                         Dad?

               Kelly looks around, worried. In this house an unresponsive 
               dad isn't necessarily sleeping. Should he wake up his mom?

               He shakes the figure slightly. It rolls over, only it's not 
               his dad. It's some scabby ADDICT. Kelly yanks his hand away.

                                     ADDICT
                         Wha?

               A moment.

                                     KELLY
                         Sorry.

               EXT. ERNSWILER HOUSE, BACK YARD - NIGHT

               Abe sits on a lawn chair.

               Kelly comes out, unfolds another chair and sits next to his 
               dad - a good distance away.

               They both look up at the sky.

                                     ABE
                         Keller. There's a meteor shower.

               Kelly frowns.

                                     KELLY
                         A funny thing just happened. A little 
                         trip down memory lane. I thought you 
                         were on our couch, dead.

               Abe laughs.

                                     ABE
                         Oh, you mean Emmett? They didn't 
                         have an empty bed for him at Care 
                         House.

               Kelly nods, considering this.

                                     KELLY
                         Well that's one of your more brilliant 
                         ideas.
                              (anger rising)
                         Have you thought about the fact that 
                         it might be dangerous? That he might 
                         steal something, or go into cardiac 
                         arrest? Drink all our cooking wine? 
                         Which he seems to have done.

                                     ABE
                         He just needs a place to sleep for 
                         the night.

                                     KELLY
                         You're right. Besides, having him 
                         here makes it feel like home.

               Abe slams his hands down on the arms of his chair.

                                     ABE
                         I've been straight for four years, 
                         almost five. A third of your life.

               Kelly claps slowly.

                                     KELLY
                         Big whoop. I've been straight the 
                         whole time.

               Abe closes his eyes.

                                     ABE
                         I hate to tell you this, but I'm not 
                         your problem anymore.

               Kelly gets up.

                                     KELLY
                         No. That's the one thing I get to 
                         decide.

               Abe looks at Kelly.

                                     ABE
                         Let me know. I can wait.

               They look at each other. Kelly shakes his head and goes 
               inside. Abe looks up at the sky.

                                     ABE
                              (to himself)
                         Keller, there's a meteor shower.

               EXT. LANCE'S HOUSE - DAY

               In a backyard tree house next door sit Kelly and Bart, Kelly 
               looking through a pair of M3 field glasses.

                                     KELLY
                         I have the target in sight.

               BINOCULAR MATTE

               Through the twin circles Lance gets into his car in front of 
               his house.

                                     KELLY
                         I think he's leaving.

                                     BART
                         Let me see. Don't be a farb, give 
                         them up.

               Kelly hands the glasses over. Bart looks through them. Then 
               he puts them down.

                                     BART
                         The coast is clear.

               The boys looks at each other.

                                     BART
                         Let me prepare to deploy.

               Bart opens up a duffel bag and pulls out a yellow jumpsuit 
               which he puts on. Kelly looks through the binoculars.

                                     KELLY
                         Is this going to work?

                                     BART
                         We've planned for every contingency 
                         using the tried and true techniques 
                         of the last great world power.

                                     KELLY
                         Save it for the press conference.

               THE LAWN

               The boys climb down out of the tree house.

               Bart is dressed in an official-looking yellow jumpsuit with 
               telephone repairmen's tool hanging from his belt and a hard 
               hat on. Kelly carries a toolbox.

                                     BART
                         Stay low. On my signal.

               He looks at Kelly. Then he holds up one finger and gestures 
               "go." They sneak hunched over towards the fence. A LITTLE 
               GIRL comes out of the house and stops when she sees them.

               Bart and Kelly look at each other. Bart takes the toolbox 
               and gestures to Kelly by pointing at the girl and covering 
               his mouth.

               Kelly peels off towards the girl while Bart continues across 
               the lawn.

               The girl starts to SCREAM. Kelly swoops up and covers her 
               mouth with his hand. He tucks her under his arm and runs 
               towards the opposite side of the house.

               He puts the girl down, still covering her mouth.

                                     KELLY
                         We're the good guys. If you scream, 
                         the bad guys are going to come and 
                         burn down your house. Okay? So stay 
                         here and be quiet.

               The girl nods. Kelly takes his hand off her mouth and starts 
               to sneak away.

                                     GIRL
                         My dad has a gun.

               Kelly runs across the street to get a view of the front door.

               IN FRONT OF LANCE'S HOUSE

               Bart turns up the driveway and RINGS the doorbell.

               LANCE'S MOTHER opens the door. Bart confers with her briefly 
               and steps inside. The door closes behind him.

               Kelly stares so hard at the door he doesn't see the NEIGHBOR 
               come up behind him.

                                     NEIGHBOR
                         Can I help you, young man?

               Kelly starts and turns.

                                     KELLY
                         I was just inspecting your lawn.

               Kelly grabs a few blades of grass.

                                     KELLY
                         Have you thought about Astroturf? It 
                         takes a lot less water to keep green. 
                         I mean, no water, technically.

                                     NEIGHBOR
                         I'm not interested.

                                     KELLY
                         Oh. I see. Okay then.

               Kelly gets up and starts to walk down the street, only - 
               Lance PULLS UP in his SUV.

               Kelly darts behind a parked car and watches Lance go into 
               the house.

                                     KELLY
                         Oh, shit.

               Lance comes right back out. He forgot something in his car.

                                     KELLY
                         Oh, shit.

               Kelly moves around the car, trying to keep it between him 
               and Lance.

               Bart comes down the front walk whistling and eating a cookie. 
               He smiles at Lance, now coming back up the walk.

                                     LANCE
                         Smile worker bee. I'll be your boss 
                         some day.

               Bart nods and tips his HARD HAT.

               Kelly follows him on the other side of the row of cars until 
               Lance's house is out of sight.

               Then he gets in step beside Bart.

                                     BART
                         What an asshole. His mom gave me 
                         cookies, though.

                                     KELLY
                         Did you get it done?

                                     BART
                         Don't ask stupid questions. Let's go 
                         home and listen.

               INT. BOWLAND HOUSE, BART'S ROOM - DAY

               The boys sit around an FM receiver/recorder.

                                     BART
                         It was a five-watt FM bug, so we 
                         should be in range -

               Bart FLIPS the ON switch and Lance's Mom's voice fills the 
               room.

               The boys smile with delight.

                                     LANCE'S MOM
                              (O.S.)
                         So then I told her, "Harriet, with 
                         potato salad like that it's no wonder 
                         Ray-Ray's cheating on you."

                                     WOMAN
                              (O.S.)
                         You didn't.

                                     LANCE'S MOM
                         You're right. But I was thinking it. 
                         Instead I just told her to add more 
                         vinegar next time, and -

               Kelly shakes his head as the women natter away.

                                     KELLY
                         I don't think we can use any of this.

                                     BART
                         Be patient. It's voice activated, so 
                         we'll get everything. Trust me. It's 
                         going to be great.

                                     KELLY
                         All right, then.

               Kelly gets up to leave while Bart fiddles with the knobs.

                                     BART
                         We reconnoiter tomorrow at nineteen 
                         hundred hours.

               INT. ERNSWILER HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Abe and Eve have dinner together.

                                     EVE
                         -- And if we don't sell them there, 
                         we'll set up on the corner of Stevens 
                         and Lane, by the gas station. That's 
                         a good location.

               Eve looks at her husband and sees he's not paying attention. 
               He seems a little out of it. He's pushing his food around on 
               his plate.

                                     EVE
                         Are you listening to me?

                                     ABE
                         Did you make this with more chili 
                         pepper than usual?

                                     EVE
                         The same as always.

               Kelly comes in, walks through the kitchen and up the stairs.

                                     EVE
                         Kelly. Want dinner?

                                     KELLY
                              (O.S.)
                         I ate.

               His parents eat for a minute in silence. Abe winces and puts 
               down his fork. Eve smiles tenderly at him.

                                     EVE
                         One day, we're all going to be happy.

               Abe puts his hand over hers.

                                     ABE
                         That sounds nice.

               INT. BOWLAND HOUSE, BART'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Bart moves around the room excitedly.

                                     BART
                         It's really too perfect, actually.

                                     KELLY
                         What? What?

                                     BART
                         I can't describe. Just hit play. 
                         It's all cued up.

               Kelly hits a button. The tape clicks ON. From the speakers 
               comes:

                                     BRIDGET
                              (recorded)
                         I told you, that makes me nervous. 
                         Me no likey.

                                     LANCE
                         But baby, my birthday's coming up.

                                     BRIDGET
                         Still. That's not a good enough 
                         reason.

                                     LANCE
                         Come on. A little action. A little 
                         prime time action.

                                     BRIDGET
                         But people might see us.

                                     LANCE
                         That's the point. That's what makes 
                         it sexxxy. Dangerous.

               Kelly stops the tape.

                                     KELLY
                         Dangerous.

                                     BART
                         Exactly.

               Bart and Kelly share a look. Kelly grins.

                                     KELLY
                         Let's draw up the plans.

                                     BART
                         I have a few notes jotted down.

               All we have to do is fill in the details and let Operation 
               Deadmeat begin.

               INT. SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH - DAY

               Bridget primps at her locker while Kelly watches nervously 
               from his.

               When she starts to close the locker door, Kelly rushes towards 
               her and BUMPS into her. Her books and papers spill to the 
               floor.

                                     KELLY
                         Oh Jesus, I'm so sorry -

               He starts picking them up.

                                     BRIDGET
                         Oh, it's okay -

               She looks around. If Lance showed up it wouldn't be good for 
               either of them.

               Kelly hands her the rest of her stuff. They part ways.

               Kelly shoves a piece of paper into his pocket.

               Principal Holmstead CLICKS down the hall in her heels and 
               Kelly DUCKS into a doorway just in time. He turns and pretends 
               to look at a posted announcement as she passes.

               INT. BOWLAND HOUSE, BART'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Bart inspects Bridget's book report with a jeweler's loop.

               He swings over to a piece of stationary Kelly's working on.

                                     BART
                         She dots her I's with hearts. And 
                         her L's are loopier. The L is very 
                         important.

                                     KELLY
                         I'm working on it.

               They both crouch over the paper.

                                     KELLY
                         I feel kind of bad for her. She's a 
                         nice girl.

                                     BART
                         Sometimes collateral damage can't be 
                         avoided.

                                     KELLY
                         Stop it.

               He pushes back from the table.

                                     KELLY
                         How does that look?

                                     BART
                              (inspecting)
                         Pretty good. I think we're ready to 
                         manufacture a document.

               Kelly takes out a fresh sheet of paper.

                                     BART
                              (clears his throat)
                         Begin. "Hey Daddy. It's your birthday 
                         and you've been a very bad boy. But 
                         so has the baby. Both baby and Daddy 
                         have to get punished, only this time 
                         -

               INT. LANCE'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Lance, shirtless, reads aloud from the letter.

                                     LANCE
                              (Cont.)
                         - baby makes the rules. Await further 
                         instructions at school tomorrow --

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               Bart wears his school uniform and sits in the passenger seat 
               next to Kelly.

                                     LANCE
                              (V.O. cont'd)
                         -- Baby will be waiting where Daddy 
                         least expects her. Love, Bridgie." 
                         Yes!

                                     BART
                         Do you have everything?

               Kelly just looks at him. Bart's already asked this question.

                                     BART
                         We can't afford any errors.

                                     KELLY
                         You don't need to tell me. It's my 
                         ass on the line.

               Kelly pulls up in front of Bart's school.

               Bart turns to him and puts a hand on his shoulder.

                                     BART
                         I wish I could be there to see it.

                         It's a day that will live in infamy.

                                     KELLY
                         You couldn't do any better than that?

                                     BART
                         I don't hear you coming up with 
                         anything.

               Bart hops out and salutes Kelly, who give him the thumbs up 
               in response and pulls away.

               INT. SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH - DAY

               Lance can't keep his hands off Bridget.

                                     BRIDGET
                         What's gotten into you?

                         Nothing, you bad girl.

               Lance cackles.

                                     BRIDGET
                         Did you drink a bottle of Robitussin 
                         before school again?

               The bell RINGS.

                         See you soon, my naughty baby.

               Bridget looks a little scared.

               INT. HISTORY CLASS

               Lance slouches into a seat next to Kelly, who drops another 
               STATIONARY NOTE into Lance's open backpack.

               Kelly watches as Lance grabs his book, sees the note, opens 
               it, and leers.

                                     LANCE
                         It's my birthday! I'm going to get a 
                         present.

               Kelly looks down at his desk and smiles.

                                     LANCE
                         Damn it, fuckface. What're you smiling 
                         about? You wish you were me.

               Lance raises his hand.

                                     LANCE
                         Mr. Palmer? May I be excused?

               Lance leaves like a house afire.

                                     KELLY

               INT. HALL

               Lance sneaks down the hall towards the STORAGE CLOSET and 
               whispers into the door.

                                     LANCE
                         Daddy's here for the Easter egg hunt.

               He pulls open the door. Nothing.

               INT. STORAGE CLOSET

               Lance turns on the light. No one there.

               But propped up on the shelf next to a vase with a rose in it 
               is another note.

                                     LANCE
                         Ooh, push my buttons.

               He snatches the note. His eyes widen as he reads.

                                     LANCE
                         Oh yeah. Oh yeah. You little minx.

               INT. LANGELY PREP, BATHROOM - DAY

               Bart crouches in the stall, looking at his watch.

               When the second hand sweeps past the twelve, he opens his 
               cell phone and punches in a number.

                                     BART
                              (serious grownup voice)
                         Yes, I need to get a message to 
                         Bridget Shumann. This is MENSA.

               INT. SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH, CAFETERIA/GYM - DAY

               Lunchtime. Typical bedlam. KIDS mill around.

               At one end of the cafeteria/gym is a small stage, the kind 
               pep rallies are held on.

               Lance edges his way through the crowd, making a beeline for 
               the STAGE DOOR.

               INT. SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH, MAIN OFFICE

               A confused Bridget stands at the SECRETARY'S desk.

                                     BRIDGET
                         But I just got this note last period.

                                     SECRETARY
                         Well I don't have anything here for 
                         you - let me look again. Oh yes, the 
                         MENSA called.

               The secretary hands Bridget the message. She looks at it.

                                     BRIDGET
                         Cool. They want me to be an honorary 
                         member.
                              (pause)
                         Is that like a sorority or something?

               INT. BACKSTAGE

               Lance looks around eagerly.

               He peeks through the curtains at all the kids and can barely 
               contain his excitement.

               He spots a WOMAN in the shadows.

               It must be Bridget.

               He unbuckles his pants and lets them drop to him knees.

                                     LANCE
                         I brought our friend along. He's

               He rips off his shirt and shuffles across the dark stage 
               toward her.

               INT. LIGHTING BOOTH

               Kelly looks at his watch.

               INT. LANGELY PREP CLASSROOM

               Bart looks at his watch in anticipation.

               INT. LIGHTING BOOTH

               Kelly flicks a switch and presses a button.

               INT. CAFETERIA

               The crowd falls silent and turns towards the mechanical sound 
               of the STAGE CURTAIN OPENING.

               They squint from the BRIGHT STAGE LIGHTS.

               SHOCK ripples through the crowd as they take in the tableau 
               revealed to them:

               A frozen half-naked Lance on his knees before a BLOW-UP DOLL 
               tied to a chair.

                         at?

               Bridget, standing in the doorway, covers her mouth in horror.

                                     STUDENT 1
                         Look, he's got a hard on.

                                     STUDENT 2
                         Eeeeew.

               Lance stumbles off stage to HOOTS and CATCALLS, but mostly 
               hysterical LAUGHTER.

               INT. LIGHTING BOOTH

               Kelly smiles, laughs and claps his hands with delight. Then 
               he returns to military precision. He turns all the switches 
               back to how they were and uses his shirtsleeve to cover the 
               doorknob so as not to leave fingerprints.

               INT. BOWLAND HOUSE, DAD'S LIBRARY - NIGHT

               Bart pours them two glasses of his dad's scotch. He's 
               overjoyed.

                                     BART
                         You're kidding me.

                                     KELLY
                         Yup. There it was. The whole school 
                         saw it. Wasn't too impressive either.

               They raise their glasses to each other.

                         To Operation Mincemeat.

                         To the 193rd.

               They both take swallows of scotch. Kelly retches.

                                     BART
                         How does it feel to give better than 
                         you get?

               Kelly finishes his scotch.

                                     KELLY
                         Good. Real good.

                                     BART
                         You want some more?

                         That's my boy.

               The drink again. Kelly's feet are up. For the first time, he 
               looks comfortable.

               INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT

               Sarah stands at her register, flipping through a magazine.

               Kelly pulls up on the ELECTRO-SHOPPER with field goggles on.

                                     KELLY
                         You know what this is?

               He puts his foot down like a kickstand.

                                     KELLY
                         Eighteen volts of pure freedom.

                                     SARAH
                         Sounds dangerous.

                                     KELLY
                         Oh, it is. Unless you know how to 
                         handle it.

               Kelly runs his hand lovingly along the frame. Then he looks 
               up at Sarah.

                                     KELLY
                         You ever seen the freshly waxed floor 
                         in the produce section glistening 
                         under full florescence? It's 
                         breathtaking.

               Sarah gets on behind him.

                         Hold on tight.

               He puts his foot up and kicks it into gear.

               The Electro-shopper takes off - barely. Kelly takes the corner 
               too sharp and clips the edge of an END CAP DISPLAY of cereal 
               boxes -- they fall to the floor.

               The Electro-shopper inches forward.

                                     KELLY
                         Close call.

                         Have you been drinking?

               INT. PARENT'S BEDROOM - MORNING

               Kelly looks in at his parents, checking to make sure they're 
               still asleep.

               When he leaves ABE opens his eyes and listens to the door 
               CLOSE downstairs.

               INT. EVE'S STUDIO

               Kelly throws some paints and brushes into his backpack.

               Kelly stands awkwardly on the front stoop with his backpack. 
               Minnie opens the door.

                         Oh, that's all right. Actually, I'm 
                         here to see Tabby. Just to do a little 
                         painting with her.

                                     MINNIE
                         She's out back in her studio.

                         Thanks.

               INT. TABBY'S STUDIO

               Tabby stands barefoot in the sunlight, a palette knife in 
               her hand.

               Music's playing. Jeff Buckley. She looks over as the door 
               opens, surprised.

                                     TABBY

                         Hey. I warned you I'd come.

                                     TABBY
                         You did.

               She goes back to painting. Kelly stands there for a minute, 
               waiting for her to say something else, give him an invitation.

               She doesn't. Until she looks up and sees him standing in the 
               same place.

                                     KELLY
                         Maybe I should go --

                                     TABBY
                         Well you're here now. Go ahead. Set 
                         your canvas up. Use one of the ones 
                         in the corner.

               Kelly looks through them and picks one.

                                     TABBY
                         Brushes are in the jar. Paint's in 
                         the drawer.

                                     KELLY
                         I brought my own.

               He takes off his backpack and opens it.

                                     TABBY
                         Well then.

               Kelly busies himself pulling out paints and other supplies.

               He can't help but look at her. The light hits her hair and 
               she glows. She catches him looking.

                                     KELLY
                         Does it mess up your concentration? 
                         Me being here?

                                     TABBY
                         No.

               She turns back to her painting.

                                     KELLY
                         Oh. That's good.

               Kelly sets up his canvas.

                                     TABBY
                         Just don't talk.

                         Right. Irony. I like that.

               Kelly feels the tubes of paint. Nervous. Squirts some color 
               out. Looks over his shoulder at her.

               He's trying to get his act together, to be cool about being 
               there, in the studio, alone with her. Trying to figure out 
               how to play it.

                                     MINER
                              (O.S.)
                         Hey! Hey babe.

               Miner opens the door. See Kelly. Smiles like the stockbroker 
               he is and crosses to him.

                                     MINER
                         Miner Webber.

               Miner holds out his hand for a good old-fashioned shake.

               Kelly takes it.

                                     KELLY
                         Webber Miner.

               Miner looks confused.

                                     TABBY
                         Kelly. This is Kelly -

                                     KELLY
                         Kelly Ernswiler. Sorry. I -

                                     MINER
                         Quite all right.
                              (smiles as an 
                              afterthought)
                         So, what do we have here, a little 
                         painting class?

                                     TABBY
                         Kelly's a friend of Bart's. He paints.

                                     MINER
                         Oh? What's your real job?

               Kelly smiles eagerly at Miner over the edge of his canvas.

                                     KELLY
                         That would be stock boy at the Shop 
                         Rite. But, as President Don Kaminsky 
                         says, every employee is part owner. 
                         So you could say I'm a captain-of-
                         industry in training. Kind of 
                         capitalist larva.

                                     MINER
                         That's quite an image.

                                     KELLY
                         Only if you see the most magical 
                         part. Do you see?

                                     MINER
                         What?

               Kelly spreads his arms out and flaps them a little.

                                     KELLY
                         One day I'll be a beautiful butterfly. 
                         First I'll have to be a pupa though. 
                         I figure I won't be going out much 
                         then. Pupa: the awkward adolescence 
                         of the insect world.

               Miner stares at Kelly. He can't tell what he might be making 
               fun of, or if it might be him.

                                     MINER
                         Whatever it takes to get you through 
                         the day.

               Kelly rolls his eyes at this uninspired response, though 
               Miner doesn't see it. He grabs Tabby's paintbrush and pulls 
               her to him.

                                     MINER
                         I have the afternoon off. Come away 
                         with me.

                                     TABBY
                         I'm not at a good stopping point.

                                     MINER
                         Oh, come on. They'll still be here.
                              (to Kelly)
                         I know you'll still be here.

               Kelly smiles his most idiotic energetic smile and slaps paint 
               on his canvas in exaggerated strokes.

                                     TABBY
                         I really shouldn't.

                                     MINER
                         But everyone will be coming soon. 
                         And it will get all crazy, and we 
                         won't have any time to ourselves.

                                     TABBY
                         We will. I promise.

               Tabby kisses Miner. He realizes there's no convincing her 
               and sighs.

                                     MINER
                         Like tonight? We can practice 
                         honeymoon suite.

                                     TABBY
                         Maybe. Probably.

               Miner looks at Kelly, who looks away.

               Then he puts his hands in his pockets and leaves.

               Tabby and Kelly paint in silence for a while. Kelly moves 
               around to look at his canvas from different angles, like 
               he's copying what he thinks a painter would do.

                                     KELLY
                         Is he always like that?

                                     TABBY
                         Like what?

                                     KELLY
                         Overbearing.

               Tabby stops and puts down her brush.

                                     TABBY
                         Just because he didn't want to picture 
                         you as a pupa?

                                     KELLY
                         Oh, he will - later. When he's alone. 
                         Whether he wants to or not.

               Kelly paints.

                                     KELLY
                         Not that though. How he wanted you 
                         to stop.

                                     TABBY
                         He wants to be with me. What's so 
                         bad about that?

                                     KELLY
                         Just because some one wants to be 
                         with you doesn't mean they're good 
                         for you.

               Kelly is suddenly very involved with his painting. He has a 
               hard time making eye contact with Tabby.

                                     KELLY
                         No one should ever ask you to stop. 
                         If you stop, you might not be able 
                         to start again. Or you might start 
                         again, only things will be different.

                                     TABBY
                         Well, that's sweet -

                                     KELLY
                         It's not sweet, actually. It's just 
                         the truth.

                                     TABBY
                         Hey, I can take care of myself.

               She picks up her brush.

                                     KELLY
                         When's the wedding?

                                     TABBY
                         At the end of the month. But don't 
                         ask me about it. It makes me nervous.

               Kelly looks at her seriously.

                                     KELLY
                         Why? Is something wrong?

                                     TABBY
                         No.

               Awkward silence.

                                     TABBY
                         What are you painting?

               Kelly stops and sighs, now back in serious artist mode.

                                     KELLY
                         Really, there are so many layers of 
                         - imagistic symbolism - that I really 
                         don't feel comfortable summing it 
                         up, but, well - it's a recurring 
                         dream image. A mermaid riding a rocket 
                         ship.

               Tabby stops painting.

                                     TABBY
                         How?

                                     KELLY
                         What do you mean, "how?" Sidesaddle. 
                         She's riding it sidesaddle. She's 
                         got a fish tail, for chrissake. I 
                         haven't decided yet if she's got 
                         scuba gear on or not.

                                     TABBY
                         Do you have any idea what you're 
                         talking about?

               Kelly puts up his thumb in an approximation of an artist's 
               gesture.

                                     KELLY
                         Does that matter?

                                     TABBY
                         Well, some people actually say what 
                         they really think.

                                     KELLY
                         What if they don't know what they 
                         really think?

                                     TABBY
                         It doesn't matter. It's called being 
                         yourself.

                                     KELLY
                         Sounds boring.

                                     TABBY
                         Not boring. Scary and wonderful and 
                         exciting.

               Kelly stops squeezing paint onto his palette. His gestures 
               slow down. He's taking this in. Then he shakes it off.

                                     KELLY
                         Hey. I'm trying to create here. Stop 
                         distracting me.

               INT. EVE'S STUDIO - NIGHT

               Kelly comes in to return the art supplies.

               Xiou-Xiou's alone working. She looks up and smiles at Kelly.

                                     KELLY
                         Mom's got you working late?

                                     XIOU-XIOU
                         No.

               Kelly walks over and sees what she's working on. A beautiful 
               spare Chinese landscape.

                                     KELLY
                         Wow. You're really good. Why do you 
                         make those stupid animals for mom?

                                     XIOU-XIOU
                         Each painting is a lesson. Here -

               She gets out a piece of paper for him.

                                     KELLY
                         I'm making a lot of art these days. 
                         I guess that means a lot of lessons.

                                     XIOU-XIOU
                         Each line has a whole drawing 
                         contained in it. Each drawing has a 
                         whole life contained in it.

                                     KELLY
                         Oh, that's all?

               Kelly watches her for a minute, the delicate whoop and swirl 
               of her strokes.

               He dips a brush into the ink and watches Xiou-Xiou's 
               restrained and confident movements.

               Eve leans against the doorframe.

                                     EVE
                         Hey you two. I'll try not to act 
                         surprised. It might spoil the moment.

               Kelly puts down the paintbrush.

                                     KELLY
                         I can't do this. I have to go.

                                     EVE
                         Keller, I think I'm missing some art 
                         supplies. Have you seen them around 
                         the house?

               Kelly avoids her eyes as he leaves.

                                     KELLY
                         No, I haven't.

                                     EVE
                         I don't know what to do with him.

                                     XIOU-XIOU
                         You son is not yet cooked. Give him 
                         time.

               Eve looks over Xiou-Xiou's shoulder.

                                     EVE
                         When are you going to let me give 
                         you your own show? We could do it 
                         for real.

                                     XIOU-XIOU
                         No problem. When you offer me an 
                         eighty-twenty split.

               INT. BOWLAND HOUSE, DINING ROOM - NIGHT

               Kelly eats with the Bowlands - Bart's mom, MATHILDA, his dad 
               HARRISON, and Tabby and Bart.

               The Bowlands dress up a bit for dinner, like any good Wasp 
               family.

                                     BART
                              (to Harrison)
                         -- But I told you I want to take 
                         German --

                                     HARRISON
                         German's a Cold War language. You 
                         can't get any kind of State Department 
                         position without more diverse 
                         linguistic training than that. You'll 
                         take Chinese.

               Bart frowns.

                                     HARRISON
                         Are we on the same page?

                                     BART
                              (mutters)
                         Same page.

               Everyone eats in silence.

                                     MATHILDA
                              (to Tabby)
                         So darling, when are you going to 
                         bite the bullet and do the seating 
                         arrangement?

               Tabby puts down her fork.

                                     TABBY
                         I can't deal with that stuff, ma. I 
                         don't care who sits next to whom. I 
                         should have eloped.

                                     KELLY
                         After all, Mrs. Bowland, sometimes 
                         when you bite the bullet, it explodes 
                         in your mouth.

               Mathilda looks surprised. This could go either way.

                                     MATHILDA
                              (tentatively)
                         Why, I've never thought about it 
                         before but that is a rather strange 
                         expression, isn't it? You wouldn't 
                         say, "Sooner or later you've got to 
                         put the grenade in your pants," would 
                         you?

                                     HARRISON
                         But have you ever noticed how in 
                         movies they always bite the grenade 
                         before they throw it?

                                     KELLY
                         Yeah, but they never take a bite out 
                         of their pants.

               Everyone but Bart LAUGHS.

               Tabby throws Kelly a grateful glance, for getting her out of 
               a conversation she didn't want to have.

                                     MATHILDA
                         What an unusual conversation! Do you 
                         have similar discussions at the dinner 
                         table with your family, Kelly?

                                     KELLY
                         Basically. I ask why all the furniture 
                         is missing and my Dad reminisces 
                         about dropping acid and watching 
                         Neil Armstrong walk on the moon.

               All but Bart LAUGHS again.

                                     TABBY
                         He talks about art.

                                     BART/MATHILDA
                         You do?

               Kelly looks down at his plate.

                                     KELLY
                         My mother's kind of an artist, so -

                                     HARRISON
                         You come from a creative family, do 
                         you?

               Mathilda salts her food.

                                     MATHILDA
                         I wish my boys would talk to me about 
                         my passions. I can't get them anywhere 
                         near the subject of my garden.

                                     KELLY
                         I noticed your magnolias. Very fine 
                         specimens.

                                     MATHILDA
                         They are fine, aren't they?

               Mathilda beams.

                                     BART
                              (ironic)
                         Is there nothing you can't discuss?

               If anyone notices the slight edge to Bart's voice, they ignore 
               it.

                                     HARRISON
                         Here, Kelly, try a bit of these leeks. 
                         Minnie has a way with the white sauce.

               INT. BART'S ROOM

               Kelly and Bart play PlayStation II "Medal of Honor" in Bart's 
               bedroom. Bart is sulking, almost imperceptibly.

                                     BART
                         My dad has this friend who's a 
                         director. He's shooting a documentary 
                         for the History Channel.

                                     KELLY
                         Cool.

                                     BART
                         He needs some guys to do a reenactment 
                         of some European theater battles for 
                         him.

               Kelly stops playing and looks at Bart.

                                     KELLY
                         We're going to be on the History 
                         Channel?

               Bart's eyes stay on the screen.

                                     BART
                         I haven't asked you yet.

                                     KELLY
                         Oh, come on.

               Kelly jabs at his controller.

                                     BART
                         Well, if you want to. Next weekend. 
                         But you have to take it seriously.

               Kelly gives Bart a derisive glance.

                                     KELLY
                         What do you mean? Of course I will.

               The flickering TV light illuminates Bart's pinched look.

                                     BART
                         From what I've seen, you play fast 
                         and loose with your characterizations. 
                         This has got to be straight up.

               This annoys Kelly.

                                     KELLY
                         I'm not "fast and loose." I play the 
                         emotional truth. I make it real.

               Bart glances at him.

                                     BART
                         Like back in the dining room?

                                     KELLY
                         What does that have to do with it?

               Bart shakes his head.

                                     BART
                              (mimics)
                         "I noticed your magnolias. Very fine 
                         specimens." That was real?

               Kelly's video game character dies. He drops the controller.

                                     KELLY
                         What is this about?

                                     BART
                              (shrugs)
                         You just seem to have your own agenda, 
                         that's all.

               Bart plays on. He's keeping a lid on everything while Kelly 
               gets more and more agitated.

                                     KELLY
                         My own agenda? What other reason is 
                         there to do anything?

                                     BART
                         I'm just saying. I know the difference 
                         between fantasy and reality.

               Kelly looks at Bart in disbelief.

                                     KELLY
                         Are you saying I don't?

               Bart won't meet his eyes.

                                     BART
                         I don't know.

               Bart pauses the game.

                                     BART
                         Why didn't you tell me your dad was 
                         a burn-out?

               Kelly gets up and grabs his jacket.

                                     KELLY
                         Why do you steal from yours?

               He leaves. Bart un-pauses the game and continues playing.

               INT. SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH - DAY

               Kelly drinks from the fountain and wipes his mouth on his 
               sleeve.

               Principal Holmstead's smiling face greets him when he 
               straightens up.

                                     PRINCIPAL
                         Kelly! I told some of your teachers 
                         about your presentation. We're all 
                         really looking forward to it.

               Kelly frowns at the Principal's back as she CLICKS away.

               Sarah appears. They walk down the hall together.

                                     SARAH
                         What presentation?

                                     KELLY
                         I don't want to talk about it. As a 
                         matter of fact, do me a favor and 
                         pretend you never heard anything 
                         about it.

                                     SARAH
                         Okay. Um.

                                     KELLY
                         What, Sarah?

                                     SARAH
                         It's nothing. I -

               Kelly starts to pull ahead.

                                     SARAH
                         I have an extra ticket to Aerosmith 
                         this weekend.

                                     KELLY
                         Aw Sarah, that's really great, I 
                         mean. It's just that - I'm busy.

                                     SARAH
                         Oh. Yeah, I figured. Okay. I'll see 
                         you in the dairy section, though.

                                     KELLY
                         Right.

               She stands there looking lost.

               EXT. BOWLAND HOUSE - DAY

               Kelly smoothes the cover over his Jeep. Bart pulls up to the 
               curb in his BMW.

                                     KELLY
                         What are you doing here?

                                     BART
                         I tracked you down. There's someone 
                         I'd like you to meet.

               INT. OLD SOLDIERS' HOME - DAY

               A few OLD SOLDIERS sit sunning in chairs in the industrial 
               feeling living-room.

               Bart and Kelly sit across from CHARLIE HAYES, an old black 
               guy, playing dominos.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (to Kelly)
                         Are you one too?

                                     KELLY
                         Yup.

                                     CHARLIE
                         And what do you see in that?

                                     KELLY
                         Living, dying, camaraderie, bravery 
                         - the big stuff. Things we don't 
                         have anymore.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I see.

               Charlie sorts his tiles and scowls. He leans in to Kelly's 
               face, giving him the eye.

                                     CHARLIE
                         And do you think it's brave getting 
                         trench foot and syphilis, eating 
                         another ration of spoiled frank and 
                         beans out of a dented can?

               Kelly is taken aback by this.

                                     KELLY
                         Well, no -

               Charlie leans back and nods, thinking about Kelly's response. 
               He no longer seems angry.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Yeah, that wouldn't be much fun, 
                         would it?

                                     KELLY
                         No, sir.

               Charlie sets down a tile and pulls at his chin.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Parts of it were kind of fun though. 
                         I got separated from my platoon and 
                         lived for two weeks in the forest of 
                         the Ardennes living off what I could 
                         kill.
                              (pause)
                         I felt very close to the land.

               Bart gives Kelly a significant look. Kelly doesn't notice.

               He's looking closely at Charlie.

               EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

               Kelly sits in the car. Bart pumps gas. They talk through the 
               window.

                                     BART
                         I met him when my mom made me go 
                         around caroling with the Youth Group.

                                     KELLY
                         You don't really believe that stuff 
                         about Berlin? And Hitler's compound?

                                     BART
                         Does it matter?

                                     KELLY
                         Of course it matters. Doesn't the 
                         truth matter?

               Bart grins.

                                     BART
                         I don't know. You tell me.

               Kelly avoids this by getting out of the car.

                                     KELLY
                         I want a drink. Let me borrow a couple 
                         bucks.

                                     BART
                         I told you not to play him for money.

                                     KELLY
                         I was trying to be nice. He's your 
                         friend.

               Bart returns the pump and screws in the gas cap.

                                     BART
                         Exactly. You should know better. 
                         What do you want.

                                     KELLY
                         Mountain Dew -

               Just then he glances towards the gas station and sees EVE, 
               set up in the adjacent abandoned lot. She's got the van parked 
               there with the sliding door open and paintings propped around 
               on display.

                                     KELLY
                         -- Oh shit.

               But Eve has seen him. She shields her eyes with her hand and 
               calls to him.

                                     EVE
                         Kelly!

               Kelly backtracks towards the car.

                                     BART
                         That woman's calling you.

               Eve walks over to them. Kelly can't get out of it.

                                     KELLY
                              (low)
                         Bart. Meet my mom.

               Eve smiles brightly.

                                     EVE
                         What a nice surprise. It's so nice 
                         to finally meet you.

               Bart is surprised but recovers his manners quickly, just 
               like he's been taught to.

                                     BART
                         Likewise. So, doing a little business?

                                     EVE
                         A little is right. But I work it as 
                         much as I can.

               Eve laughs.

               Kelly shifts his weight from foot to foot. Eve looks at both 
               of them.

                                     EVE
                         So, what have you boys been up to?

                                     KELLY
                         Bart took me to meet his friend 
                         Charlie at the Old Soldiers' Home.

                                     EVE
                         Charlie at the Old Soldiers' Home?

                                     KELLY
                         You don't know him.

                                     EVE
                         You boys should swing by Care House. 
                         There are some Vets there.

                                     KELLY
                         We can't.

                                     EVE
                         Oh. Well - okay.

               Eve watches a car pull into the lot next to the van.

                                     EVE
                         I should go. But you boys should 
                         come over to our house some time.
                              (to Bart)
                         I know your family must get tired of 
                         him.

               Kelly visibly bristles at the thought of his parents 
               entertaining Bart.

                                     BART
                         Not at all. But I'd love to, anyway.

               Eve looks at Kelly. Then she runs back over to the van.

                                     KELLY
                         There you go. Now you know everything.

                                     BART
                         What's your problem? She's pretty 
                         cute.

               Kelly rolls his eyes and gets back in the car.

                                     BART
                         Don't you want your soda?

                                     KELLY
                         Forget it.

               INT. BOWLAND HOUSE, BART'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Kelly watches Bart pick through parts of his uniform.

               After the encounter with mom, he's retreated into himself.

                                     BART
                         So filming's on Saturday. Can you 
                         make it?

                                     KELLY
                         Are you kidding?

                                     BART
                         Good. It's gonna be really cool. 
                         He's got an explosives expert coming.

               Kelly doesn't say anything.

                                     BART
                         What's up?

               Kelly runs his hand through his hair. He can't bring himself 
               to say what's really on his mind.

                                     KELLY
                         Remember that stupid speech?

               Kelly picks up Bart's Colt and sights with it. Bart frowns.

               He knows Kelly's avoiding the real stuff.

                                     KELLY
                         I'm supposed to give it next week.

               Bart polishes his combat boots.

                                     BART
                         Maybe you should talk to my dad about 
                         it.

                                     KELLY
                         You think he'd go for that?

               Bart keeps his head down, polishes intently.

                                     BART
                         Of course. He loves you. He was 
                         talking the other day about helping 
                         you out.
                              (ironic)
                         Want to go to Dartmouth?

                                     KELLY
                         Are you serious?

                                     BART
                         He was. If you applied for Spring 
                         Semester, he could "pull some 
                         strings."

                                     KELLY
                              (shakes his head slowly)
                         I don't think that would work for 
                         me. Considering -- my background.

                                     BART
                         Yeah, probably not.

                                     KELLY
                         I'm not properly socialized. I 
                         wouldn't fit in.

               Bart checks his bandoleer and cartridges.

                                     BART
                         That's bullshit.

                                     KELLY
                         No, it's not.

                                     BART
                         Tell that to my family. They're like 
                         your fucking fan club.

               Bart pauses, darts his eyes at Kelly.

                                     BART
                         Even Tabby likes you.

                                     KELLY
                         So much she ratted me out to you.

                                     BART
                         Well, she's inviting you to the 
                         wedding.

                                     KELLY
                         Oh.

               Bart watches Kelly's face.

                                     BART
                         But you probably won't enjoy that 
                         much, will you?

                                     KELLY
                         I don't know what you're talking 
                         about. Weddings? I love weddings. I 
                         always get drunk and make out with 
                         someone's cousin.

               Bart throws his olive drab socks at Kelly's head.

                                     BART
                         Good, I'll call mom's nephew Fletcher 
                         and tell him to expect a little 
                         action.

                                     KELLY
                         Fletcher, eh?

                                     BART
                         He's twelve. Let me give some advice. 
                         He's very into sharks at the moment.

               EXT. BOWLAND HOUSE - NIGHT

               Kelly waves to Minnie and goes out the front door.

               There he pauses, trying to decide what to do. Then he scowls.

               He goes around the corner. Towards Tabby's studio.

               INT. TABBY'S STUDIO

               Tabby sits on the couch facing away from the door. Kelly 
               enters.

                                     KELLY
                         Why did you tell --

               Tabby turns toward him. She's crying.

                                     KELLY
                         What? Oh, I'm sorry.

               He knows he should leave, but Kelly just stands there.

               Kelly runs his hand along his pants in a nervous gesture.

               Tabby dabs at her face.

                                     TABBY
                         Miner and I broke up.

               Beat.

                                     KELLY
                         I'm sorry.

                                     TABBY
                         Yeah.

                                     KELLY
                         Honestly? I didn't think you two 
                         were right for each other.

                                     TABBY
                         You did, huh?

               Kelly walks over to her painting.

                                     KELLY
                         Like this painting. Stare at it too 
                         long and you can't see it anymore. 
                         But if someone else sees it for the 
                         first time, they can tell exactly 
                         what it is.

                                     TABBY
                         I don't need any more bullshit right 
                         now.

               Kelly stops, taken aback. He walks away from the painting.

                                     KELLY
                         He could never understand you.

                                     TABBY
                         I'm not as complicated as you think.

               Kelly walks to the window and looks out.

                                     KELLY
                         I never said you were complicated.

               Tabby laughs/cries at this.

                                     TABBY
                         Oh.

                                     KELLY
                         He just wasn't the right one.

               Tabby nods. She's starting to calm down a little.

                                     TABBY
                         There's more to it than that.

               Tabby looks at her shredded tissue. Kelly sits down on the 
               couch next to her.

                                     KELLY
                         I'm really sorry. I really am.

                                     TABBY
                         Thanks.

               Kelly pats her knee awkwardly.

                                     KELLY
                         Don't cry.

               Tabby turns her face to Kelly's.

                                     TABBY
                         You like me, don't you?

                                     KELLY
                         Of course.

               Tabby closes her eyes.

                                     TABBY
                         No, I mean -- you like me.

               Kelly looks scared. He wants to retreat. But he calms himself 
               down.

                                     KELLY
                         Yeah. I think you're amazing.

                                     TABBY
                         Well, do something.

               Long pause. Then -- Kelly kisses her. She kisses back and 
               they fall against the couch together.

               EXT. BOWLAND HOUSE - NIGHT

                                     BART
                              (O.S.)
                         All right, all right. I'm going.

               Bart comes out in his pajamas to turn off the sprinkler. He 
               looks up and freezes.

               Kelly comes out of Tabby's studio. He shuts the door carefully 
               and walks around the pool.

               Kelly doesn't see Bart.

               Bart doesn't say anything. He just watches Kelly go.

               INT. ERNSWILER HOUSE - DAY

               Kelly throws parts of his soldier's kit onto his bed from 
               corners of the room. The canteen underhand. The Jeep cap as 
               a free throw. This is the best day of his life.

               Until he finds his uniform crumpled up behind the door, still 
               crusted with mud.

                                     KELLY
                         Damn it. Damn it.

               He flops on his bed. But he can't help it. Soon he's smiling 
               again. He gets up, gathers up the uniform, and tears out of 
               the room.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Kelly comes down the stairs two at a time, singing.

               Eve and Abe watch surprised from the table. Abe looks pale.

                                     KELLY
                         What?

               INT. BOWLAND HOUSE, BART'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Bart sits in his desk chair, frowning.

               Mathilda knocks and opens the door.

                                     MATHILDA
                         Minnie's starting dinner. Is Kelly 
                         coming over?

                                     BART
                         Not tonight, ma.

               Mathilda pauses and looks at her son.

                                     MATHILDA
                         Okay, then.

               EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

               An ASSISTANT DIRECTOR and CAMERAMAN unload equipment from a 
               van.

               The DIRECTOR looks off into the distance, trying to visualize.

               Kelly pulls up next to the van. He wears a spotlessly clean 
               uniform.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Are you with the 101st or the 82nd?

                                     KELLY
                         Well, 82nd today. It's not my usual 
                         division. Technically, my patches 
                         indicate -

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Whatever. Make yourself comfortable. 
                         We'll be a while setting up. Some of 
                         the other boys are over by craft 
                         service.

                                     KELLY
                         Oh?

               Kelly doesn't go anywhere.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         The snack table. It's over there. 
                         Someone will come get you when we're 
                         ready.

                                     KELLY
                         Right. Is Bart Bowland here yet?

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Bart? Oh, Harrison's son. I don't 
                         know.

                                     KELLY
                         Ok. Thanks.

               CRAFT SERVICE

               Kelly and a half dozen other SOLDIERS stand or sit in the 
               grass around the table. They talk and rest on their backpacks.

               A MAKEUP ARTIST makes the rounds.

                                     MAKEUP ARTIST
                              (to Kelly)
                         And you are?

                                     KELLY
                         Kelly Ernswiler, private first class.

                                     MAKEUP ARTIST
                         All right, Kelly. Let's take a look 
                         at you.

               She gets out some pomade and runs a comb through his hair, 
               slicking it back.

                                     MAKEUP ARTIST
                         That's it, handsome.

               Kelly grins. When she walks away he messes up his hair again.

               He scans the crowd. No Bart.

               The A.D. walks over.

                                     A.D.
                         Okay, everyone. We're going to start 
                         positioning. Then we'll go through a 
                         few rehearsals.
                              (points at soldiers)
                         You, you and you - go over there by 
                         that tree. You and you guys, behind 
                         the hill.
                              (looks at clipboard)
                         Okay, who's got the Jeep?

                                     KELLY
                         That MG? She's mine.

                                     A.D.
                         Great. We'd like to use it. Can you 
                         drive it beyond the hill over there?

               Kelly tries to act casual.

                                     KELLY
                         Sure. I don't think that would be a 
                         problem.

               He walks towards his Jeep and pauses.

                                     KELLY
                         Have you seen Bart Bowland? Has he 
                         checked in?

                                     A.D.
                         Don't know. We've got enough people. 
                         It doesn't matter.

               Kelly nods, wondering a bit. But it's soon forgotten.

                                     KELLY
                              (to Jeep)
                         Hot Lips, old girl, you're going to 
                         be famous.

                                     A.D.
                              (yells)
                         Okay people. Listen to my voice. 
                         From now on, you do whatever this 
                         voice says. Take your place.

               BEHIND THE HILL

               Kelly waits with his rifle next to his Jeep, bored.

               He sees a FIGURE in the shadows of the trees.

               He raises his rifle and points it at the figure.

                                     KELLY
                         Password.

               Bart steps out of the barn.

                                     KELLY
                         Hey! Where the hell have you been?

                                     BART
                         No where.

                                     KELLY
                         They put you over here with me? That's 
                         great. I think we'll get some close-
                         ups. They want me to drive old Lippy. 
                         Isn't that awesome?

               Bart doesn't say anything.

                                     KELLY
                         What the hell's your problem?

                                     BART
                         I ought to fucking kill you.

                                     KELLY
                         What?

                                     BART
                         You had to do it.

               Kelly shakes his head, avoiding Bart's eyes, trying to keep 
               it normal.

                                     KELLY
                         What are you talking about?

                                     BART
                         You just do whatever the fuck you 
                         want. And consequences don't matter, 
                         do they?

                                     KELLY
                         Are you out of your mind?

               Bart looks at Kelly. Sees nothing but a kid in an old Army 
               uniform.

                                     BART
                         What the fuck do you think she's 
                         going to do, run off with you?

               The blood rises to Kelly's face.

               But he still won't look at Bart.

                                     BART
                         You're a seventeen-year-old bag boy. 
                         She's a Yale grad student. Talk about 
                         living in a fucking fantasy world.

               Kelly's hands turn white around the rifle.

                                     KELLY
                         No. You'd rather have me be miserable 
                         like you are.

               Bart comes closer. Uncomfortably close.

                                     BART
                              (biting sarcasm)
                         Once again, you've displayed your 
                         uncanny ability to nail the truth of 
                         a character.

               Kelly finally raises his head.

               And looks Bart right in the eyes.

                                     KELLY
                         Stop talking out your dad's mouth 
                         and use your own for once.

               Bart lunges at Kelly.

               EXT. FILM SHOOT

               The camera's set up.

               The groups are in position.

               The A.D. stands by the cameraman.

                                     A.D.
                         Standby for rehearsal. Cue the 
                         explosion.

               GRAY CLOUD EXPLODES

               In the field. Soldiers leap out of trenches.

                                     A.D.
                         Cue the Jeep.

               Nothing happens.

                                     A.D.
                         Cue the Jeep. Cue the fucking Jeep!

               The A.D. shakes his head.

               BEHIND THE BARN

               The A.D. comes around the corner followed by the cameraman.

               Bart and Kelly roll around on the ground.

                                     A.D.
                         What the H. Christ is going on over 
                         here?

               Bart and Kelly continue to fight.

                                     A.D.
                              (to cameraman)
                         Hey, roll this. Get this. Are you 
                         getting this?

               The cameraman puts his camera up to his eye and films.

               Kelly finally pushes Bart off him, gets in his Jeep and drives 
               away.

                                     A.D.
                              (to cameraman)
                         Follow him. Are you getting it?

               Bart sits on the ground, out of breath.

                                     A.D.
                         We can use this. We'll cut it 
                         together.

               The A.D. directs the camera at Bart.

                                     A.D.
                         Get close on him.

               Bart pushes the camera away.

               INT. ERNSWILER HOUSE, KELLY'S ROOM - DAY

               Kelly lays in bed staring at the ceiling. There's a cut across 
               his eyebrow.

               Eve comes in carrying her car keys and sits on the bed.

                                     KELLY
                         I don't want to talk about it.

                                     EVE
                         Well, you're going to have to. Your 
                         father's at the hospital.

                                     KELLY
                         Which one of his loser friends ended 
                         up there?

               Eve plays with her keys. Then she stops.

                                     EVE
                         They think he has stomach cancer.

               Kelly feels the sensation of falling, like a dream.

               Then he snorts and rolls over, away from his mom.

                                     KELLY
                         Oh this is just perfect.

               Eve looks at the back of Kelly's head. She's tired but still 
               trying to deal.

                                     EVE
                         Why would you say something like 
                         that?

                                     KELLY
                         Because it seems to fit.

                                     EVE
                         "Seems to fit." Do you understand 
                         what I just said?

               Kelly gets up. Puts his feet on the floor. His shoulders are 
               slumped.

                                     KELLY
                         Why, do you want to say it again?

                                     EVE
                         Kelly -

                                     KELLY
                         I have to go to work.

               He gets up and holds the door open for her. Eve looks at 
               him, heart heavy. She leaves.

               Kelly sits on the bed. Then he looks at the rabbit painting.

               He grabs it off the wall and SLAMS it backwards against the 
               floor so he doesn't have to look at it.

               The painting falls back against the bayonet fixed to Kelly's 
               rifle and TEARS.

               He KICKS it.

               INT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT

               Kelly angrily wrestles with giant boxes of paper towels.

               He RIPS open the box and they roll everywhere.

               Sarah watches from checkout. She comes over to help him pick 
               them up.

                                     SARAH
                         I forgot to tell you this box was 
                         booby-trapped.

               Kelly doesn't say anything.

                                     SARAH
                         The concert was lame. The opening 
                         act singer ripped his leather pants 
                         during a stupid dance routine and 
                         stormed off stage.
                              (pause, looks at his 
                              cut)
                         Are you okay?

                                     KELLY
                         No.

                                     SARAH
                         Lance?

                                     KELLY
                         No.

               Kelly gathers an armful of paper towels.

                                     KELLY
                         Listen, I'm busy.

                                     SARAH
                         Sure. I understand.

                                     KELLY
                         I doubt it.

               Sarah puts a couple of rolls on the shelf.

                                     SARAH
                         Um, I don't have a perfect life, if 
                         that's what you're asking.

               Kelly stops what he's doing.

                                     KELLY
                         No, Sarah, actually, I'm not asking. 
                         I never ask you anything but you 
                         just talk anyway. Have you ever 
                         noticed that?

               Sarah drops the rolls she had in her hands.

                                     SARAH
                         Fuck you.

               She leaves. Kelly shakes his head.

               INT. TABBY'S STUDIO - MORNING

               Kelly, still in his work clothes, comes in without knocking.

                                     KELLY
                         Hey, I hoped you were up -

               He stops when he sees Tabby and Miner sleeping together on 
               the couch.

               Tabby opens her eyes.

                                     TABBY
                         Kelly?

               Kelly goes and takes his painting off the easel.

                                     KELLY
                         I just came to get this.

               Kelly leaves.

               EXT. BOWLAND YARD

               Tabby follows Kelly across the yard.

                                     TABBY
                         Hey.

               Kelly stops and turns around.

                                     KELLY
                         I guess the wedding's back on.

                                     TABBY
                         We talked.

               Tabby smiles sadly.

                                     TABBY
                         I'm really sorry.

                                     KELLY
                         Don't be.

               They stand there in the yard. Tabby wraps her arms around 
               herself.

                                     KELLY
                         My dad's got cancer.

               Tabby looks at Kelly, pained.

                                     TABBY
                         Oh, Kelly.

               She takes a step towards him. He backs up.

                                     KELLY
                         I guess we all get what we deserve.

               Kelly looks at Tabby for a second, then turns and walks away.

               EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY

               Kelly drives along an open stretch of road. He throws the 
               painting out of the Jeep.

               He comes to a turn and takes it much too fast.

               The Jeep SKIDS, teeters on two wheels, and goes over the 
               embankment.

               BOTTOM OF DITCH

               Steam trails up from the Jeep's radiator. The front end is 
               completely smashed.

               Kelly bangs his fist against the steering wheel.

                                     KELLY
                         Stupid bitch.

               Then he calm himself, gets out, and starts walking.

               EXT. SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH - DAY

               Kelly rides an old bike up to the bike rack and locks it.

               INT. HISTORY CLASS

               Kelly comes in late.

                                     MR. NORMAN
                         Kelly! There you are. I was just 
                         telling the class about our special 
                         treat today. Mr. Ernswiler is going 
                         to be giving the three first-period 
                         history classes a little talk about 
                         the Civil War.

               Kelly closes his eyes. He had forgotten - or tried to forget.

                                     MR. NORMAN
                         Let's all make our way in an orderly 
                         fashion down to the auditorium, shall 
                         we?

               The class bolts for the door.

                                     MR. NORMAN
                         Orderly, I said orderly.

               Mr. Norman looks at Kelly pleasantly.

                                     MR. NORMAN
                         Well, what are we waiting for? I'm 
                         so looking forward to hearing your 
                         views.

               INT. AUDITORIUM

               Kelly sits in a chair on the stage next to Mr. Norman.

               A scattering of KIDS sit out in the auditorium.

               Principal Holmstead stands at the podium.

                                     HOLMSTEAD
                         For those of you who haven't had the 
                         chance to get to know Kelly, you 
                         should know he has a very interesting 
                         hobby. He takes part in reenactments 
                         of World War II battles right here 
                         in Ohio.

                                     AUDIENCE KID
                         I did that too. When I was seven.

               Scattered LAUGHTER. Kelly frowns.

                                     HOLMSTEAD
                         He has an unusual first-hand knowledge 
                         of history. We recently discovered 
                         that this extends beyond World War 
                         II to the Civil War, which he is 
                         going to discuss with you today. 
                         Kelly?

               Kelly rises to scant applause. He stands at the podium, 
               looking out at the crowd.

               He looks down and thinks. He looks back up. The silence 
               stretches. Kids start giggling.

               Finally he leans into the microphone.

                                     KELLY
                         I'm sorry.

               He walks off stage.

                                     HOLMSTEAD
                              (to Mr. Norman)
                         Well, go after him.

               EXT. SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH - DAY

               On his knees Kelly fumbles with his bike lock, getting madder 
               and madder. Just as he's about to get it undone --

               Lance appears.

                                     LANCE
                         What, they re-assign you to the 
                         bicycle brigade?

               Kelly frowns at the lock.

                                     KELLY
                         I'm busy.

                         Too bad, cause I'm not. Remember 
                         that little show I put on for the 
                         school?

                                     KELLY
                         I don't know what you're talking 
                         about.

                                     LANCE
                         Oh, come on. Pants down? Doll? Hard 
                         on?

               Kelly looks up at Lance.

                                     KELLY
                         Oh that. I heard about it.

                                     LANCE
                         And did you hear me and Bridget aren't 
                         going out anymore because of it?

                                     KELLY
                         I haven't been following the story.

                                     LANCE
                         Yeah well, let's get this over with.

                                     KELLY
                         It is over.

               Lance pushes Kelly away from his bike. Kelly falls back on 
               his hands.

               He squints up at Lance and moves back towards his bike.

               Lance KICKS him back with his foot and looks at him.

                                     KELLY
                         Just let me go home.

                                     LANCE
                         Did you call me a homo?

               Lance KICKS him again. Kelly breathes hard.

                                     KELLY
                         This isn't a good time for me. Let's 
                         re-schedule.

                                     LANCE
                         No time like the present.

               Lance picks Kelly up and SLAPS him hard on the face.

                                     KELLY
                         First you should probably get me to 
                         write home to my mother.

               Lance PUNCHES Kelly and he reels. Then Kelly lunges for him 
               and they fall to the ground. Kelly swings wildly but Lance 
               pins him down and gives him a few good ones.

               Then Mr. Norman comes out.

                                     MR. NORMAN
                         Stop it!

               Mr. Norman rushes over to them.

               Kelly scrambles up and rips at his bike lock, gets on his 
               bike and rides away.

               Mr. Norman tries to take a panting Lance by the arm but Lance 
               shakes him off.

                                     LANCE
                         Get off me.

               EXT. ERNSWILER HOUSE - DAY

               Kelly rides by his house and keeps going.

               EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

               Kelly stops and looks up at the hospital but can't bring 
               himself to go in. He pedals on.

               EXT. CLEVELAND WATERFRONT - DAY

               Kelly sits on the loading dock of an abandoned factory.

               He watches the rusty barges glitter on the water. The wind 
               ruffles his sweaty hair.

               EXT. BOWLAND HOUSE - DAY

               Kelly's at the front door.

                                     MINNIE
                         Bart's not here. Sorry.

               She closes the door. Kelly wheels his bike down the driveway.

               He sees Bart sitting out by the pool with a couple of LANGELY 
               BOYS.

               Bart sees Kelly and ignores him, laughs at something one of 
               the guys says.

               INT. ERNSWILER HOUSE, BATHROOM - DAY

               Kelly sits on the toilet, putting a bandage on a red scrape 
               down his arm.

               Eve appears in the doorway.

                                     EVE
                         Oh Kelly. What happened?

               Kelly looks up at her. He's still got the cut eyebrow, which 
               has split back open, and some dried blood under his nose.

                                     KELLY
                         Nothing.

                                     EVE
                         Jesus. Let me see that.

               Eve comes over and tilts Kelly's head back to look at the 
               cut. This is the first time she's touched him.

               She gets some antiseptic and ointment from under the sink 
               along with Band-Aids and goes to work.

                                     KELLY
                         Ow.

               Kelly lets her dab at his face. He closes his eyes.

                                     EVE
                         I'm going over to see dad.

               Kelly opens his eyes and pulls away.

                                     KELLY
                         Oh.

               Eve puts a butterfly bandage across Kelly's eyebrow.

                                     EVE
                         And you need to come.

               Kelly pulls his head away.

                                     KELLY
                         I don't want to.

                                     EVE
                         At this point that's not an option.

                                     KELLY
                         Now's not a good time, ma.

               Eve looks at Kelly sadly.

                                     EVE
                         It's never a good time.

                                     KELLY
                         You can't make me.

               Eve shakes her head.

                                     EVE
                              (voice rising)
                         It's not about you anymore --

                                     KELLY
                         Don't you get it? It was never about 
                         me.

               Eve rises to her feet. He's just sent her over the edge.

                                     EVE
                              (yelling)
                         What is wrong with you? When are you 
                         going to stop blaming us, blaming 
                         him? I'm sick of you being angry. I 
                         want to be angry! They just took out 
                         half of your father's stomach -

                                     KELLY
                         Enough.

                                     EVE
                              (screaming and crying)
                         You will not tell me what's enough. 
                         You don't know about anything. All 
                         you do is fight fake battles, in the 
                         woods, on the playground. But this, 
                         right here, us - this is the real 
                         one, the only one worth anything.

               She stops and breaks down.

                                     EVE
                         The man I love is dying.

                                     KELLY
                         That's between you and him.

               Eve looks at her son. Her face looks older.

                                     EVE
                         If I made a mistake, if you felt 
                         left out, I'm sorry. But I can only 
                         deal with one thing at a time.

               Eve leaves. Kelly sits on the toilet, lost.

               INT. KELLY'S ROOM - MORNING

               The sun shines in through Kelly's window.

               He's laying in bed awake - has been for a while.

               He gets up and starts dressing slowly and deliberately. He 
               puts on his best shirt and tie, sensing trouble when the 
               tie's too short.

               He pulls the suit out of his closet.

               The jacket doesn't fit. The sleeves don't even go down to 
               his wrists.

               And he can hardly button the pants. He rips off the jacket.

               He pulls everything out of his closet. Nothing there.

               He sits on the edge of his bed with his head in his hands.

               He looks at his DRESS UNIFORM, hanging on the back of the 
               closet in its dry-cleaning bag, right where his mom left it.

               He shakes his head. No, he couldn't do that.

               Then he sighs.

               EXT. EPISCOPAL CHURCH - DAY

               It's decorated for a wedding. Flower garlands trail up the 
               banisters.

               GUESTS trickle in.

               Harrison, dressed in a suit with a boutonniere on his lapel, 
               talks to an USHER.

                                     HARRISON
                         Don't sit any of Mathilda's sisters 
                         next to me if you can help it.
                              (to guest)
                         Oh, hello. So nice to see you. Thank 
                         you for coming.

               Bart comes outside, also dressed as an usher.

                                     HARRISON
                              (to Bart)
                         Where's the priest?

                                     BART
                         He should be here any minute. Calm 
                         down.

               Bart walks down the steps and looks down the street.

               Kelly's walking towards him. IN HIS DRESS UNIFORM.

               Bart walks down the street to meet him.

                                     BART
                         What the fuck are you doing?

               Kelly looks down. He can't meet Bart's eyes.

                                     KELLY
                         I was invited.

                                     BART
                         I uninvited you.

                                     KELLY
                         It's not your wedding.

               Bart looks at Kelly and shakes his head.

                                     BART
                         Why are you wearing that?

               Kelly doesn't answer.

                                     BART
                              (softening)
                         I can't let you come in.

                                     KELLY
                         Why?

                                     BART
                         Because you know why. Just go home.

               Kelly finally looks up at Bart and nods.

               A Town Car pulls up.

               Tabby gets out in her wedding dress. Has there even been a 
               more glorious woman? Will there ever be again?

               Her MAID OF HONOR leads her around to the side of the church.

               Kelly watches every step.

                                     KELLY
                         She looks beautiful. Tell her - give 
                         her my congratulations.

               Kelly walks off.

               Bart watches him go.

               INT. BOWLAND HOUSE, KELLY'S ROOM - DAY

               Kelly sits on the edge of the bed, head in hands.

               He sees the torn rabbit painting. After a minute, he picks 
               it up and looks at it.

               INT. EVE'S STUDIO

               Xiou-Xiou sits painting. Kelly enters with the rabbit.

                                     XIOU-XIOU
                         Oh! Son of Eve. You startled me.

                                     KELLY
                         Grandma Ling. Can you fix this?

               She examines it and takes out a wet sponge. She wipes it 
               across the back of the canvas.

                                     XIOU-XIOU
                         Your mom made it for you. I can fix 
                         it.

               She works silently for a minute. Kelly watches her. She cuts 
               a small piece of canvas to repair the hole.

                                     KELLY
                         Did you come here to work on your 
                         own stuff? Don't waste your time on 
                         this.

                                     XIOU-XIOU
                         I never waste time.

               She turns the painting over and gets out some paints to touch 
               it up.

                                     XIOU-XIOU
                         See. Everything can be mended.

                                     KELLY
                         You're trying to tell me something, 
                         aren't you?

                                     XIOU-XIOU
                         Oh no. I could not tell you anything.

               INT. HOSPITAL, ABE'S ROOM - DAY

               Eve sleeps in a chair next to Abe, in bed sleeping. He looks 
               pale but otherwise fine.

               Kelly stands in the doorway, still in his uniform.

               Abe comes to and sees him standing there.

                                     ABE
                         Hey. Kelly.

                                     KELLY
                         Hey dad. How you feeling?

                                     ABE
                         Not bad.

                                     KELLY
                         They gave me some stitches downstairs.
                              (points to eyebrow)
                         Three.

                                     ABE
                         Did you get punched?

                                     KELLY
                         A couple times, actually.

                                     ABE
                         I know the feeling. Come on in and 
                         watch some television. Don't worry, 
                         this one's bolted to the wall. As 
                         you can see, my reputation precedes 
                         me.

               Kelly comes into the room and sits in a chair.

                                     ABE
                         Any battles this weekend?

                                     KELLY
                         A few.

                                     ABE
                         Busy, busy.

               Abe and Kelly look up at the television in the corner.

                                     ABE
                         Answer me this: how come no one ever 
                         reenacts the Vietnam War?

                                     KELLY
                         It'd be pretty depressing, wouldn't 
                         it?

                                     ABE
                         I guess it would.

               Both continue to look up at the television.

                                     KELLY
                         Plus that, you'd have to have 
                         protesters and stuff.

                                     ABE
                         Folks dressed up like your mom and 
                         me. People reenacting fleeing to 
                         Canada, burning draft cards. I guess 
                         that would ruin the spirit of the 
                         thing, now wouldn't it?

                                     KELLY
                         I could make it work.

               Abe looks at Kelly.

                                     ABE
                         I bet you could.

               Kelly nods. Eve wakes up.

                                     EVE
                         Kelly, is that you?

                                     KELLY
                         You were expecting some one else?

               HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

               Kelly and Eve get snacks from the vending machine.

                                     KELLY
                         He looks good.

               Eve looks at Kelly, her face full of love and sadness.

                                     EVE
                         He looks just like you.

               Kelly nods slowly, taking this in. And it is finally too 
               much.

               He breaks down and cries. For the fear and the misplaced 
               rage, the fights and the stubbornness.

               But finally, relief.

               They walk back down the hall together. Eve reaches out and 
               puts her hand on Kelly's neck.

               EXT. BOWLAND HOUSE - DAY

               Kelly rides his bike past the house and stops when he sees 
               the car packed up in front.

               Bart comes out with a box of stuff.

                                     BART
                         Hey.

                                     KELLY
                         Hey. You going away already?

                                     BART
                         Yeah. The have this intensive summer 
                         orientation thing.

                                     KELLY
                         Is that good?

               Bart puts the box in the car.

                                     BART
                         Well, it's optional, but dad thinks 
                         it would be "a good way to meet 
                         people."

                                     KELLY
                         He's probably right.

                                     BART
                         He usually is.

               They stand there.

                                     KELLY
                         Well, go Big Green.

               Kelly gives him a little ra-ra with one hand. Bart smiles.

               Kelly's been doing his research.

                                     BART
                         Thanks.

               Kelly lifts his foot up to the pedal of his bike.

                                     KELLY
                         Have fun. And get laid, will ya?

               Bart laughs a little and shakes his head. Kelly is gone.

               Harrison comes out.

                                     HARRISON
                         Is that everything?

                                     BART
                         Everything you'd let me bring.

               Harrison checks the ties on the roof.

                                     HARRISON
                         Give me a break.

               INT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT

               Kelly stocks shelves.

               There's a NEW GIRL working the register.

               Kelly sees SARAH come in. He follows her to the bakery.

                                     KELLY
                         Hey.

                                     SARAH
                         Hey.

               Sarah picks some bagels.

                                     KELLY
                         How come you don't work here anymore? 
                         The Electro-shopper's getting rusty.

                                     SARAH
                         I've got a summer internship at an 
                         ad agency.

                                     KELLY
                         Fancy.

                                     SARAH
                         It's all right, I guess.

                                     KELLY
                         No, it's great.

               Kelly moves around to her other side, closer.

                                     KELLY
                         Hey -

               Sarah moves away. Once bitten twice shy and all that.

                                     SARAH
                         When are you going to get a real 
                         job?

                                     KELLY
                         I don't know. Probably when I figure 
                         out something better to do.

                                     SARAH
                         You can't be a stock boy your whole 
                         life.

               Sarah walks to the front of the store. Kelly walks with her.

                                     KELLY
                         Yeah I can. I mean, I probably won't, 
                         but I could.

               Sarah turns to him at the checkout aisle.

                                     SARAH
                         Well, it was good seeing you.

                                     KELLY
                         Um.

                                     SARAH
                         What?

                                     KELLY
                         Remember that presentation I told 
                         you never to ask me about again?

               INT. OLD SOLDIERS' HOME - DAY

               Kelly stands in the front of the room, pointing to a battle 
               plan with large arrows drawn on it.

               Charlie, Mr. Norman, Principal Holmstead, Eve and Sarah sit 
               among other OLD SOLDIERS.

                                     KELLY
                         Lee arrayed his defenses over here. 
                         Only this time, Grant was ready for 
                         him.

               Kelly keeps talking. Many of the OLD SOLDIERS sleep.

                                     OLD SOLDIER 1
                              (to old soldier 2)
                         This is boring.

                                     OLD SOLDIER 2
                         Yeah. Let's see that slide of the 
                         wife again.

               DOMINO TABLE

               Sarah, Kelly, and Eve play dominos with Charlie and Mr. 
               Norman.

                                     MR. NORMAN
                              (to Charlie)
                         Remarkable, remarkable. And they 
                         never knew?

                                     CHARLIE
                         The real kicker was moving those 
                         cutouts of tanks around. The thought 
                         we had a whole regiment over there, 
                         but it was just a couple of us and 
                         those Hollywood props.

                                     EVE
                         That's amazing. Art playing a part 
                         in war.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You're damned right. We practically 
                         won the thing right there.
                              (eyeing Sarah and Eve 
                              with approval)
                         Now this is more like it. Anyone 
                         care to place a wager on the table?

               Kelly tries to gesture to Sarah "no."

                                     SARAH
                         If you think it would be more fun.

                                     MR. NORMAN
                         I can't imagine having more fun that 
                         I am now.

               Mr. Norman smiles at the group.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You're never been to a French 
                         whorehouse, I take it.

                                     EVE
                         I have.

                                     MR. NORMAN
                         Oh, my.

               EXT. OLD SOLDIERS' HOME - DAY

               Eve waits while Kelly and Sarah walk out to Sarah's car.

               Kelly helps Sarah into it and closes the door for her.

                                     KELLY
                         I still don't understand how you did 
                         that.

                                     SARAH
                         I spent my summers with my grandma 
                         in the Catskills. She didn't give me 
                         any spending money.
                              (shrugs)
                         So I played the bones for ice cream.

               She pulls away. He watches her go.

                                     KELLY
                         Hot damn.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

          INT. HAL FIELDS HOME.

          A single daisy stands in a vase in an empty kitchen.

                         

          INT. HAL'S BEDROOM

          OLIVER FIELDS clicks on the light to the closet. He looks at
          the rack of his parents' clothes.
          He begins to put some in a box marked "home", some in a box
          marked "thrift".

                         

          INT. HAL'S BATHROOM

          Oliver enters the bathroom and flushes bottle after bottle of
          pills and liquids down the toilet. Next he struggles as he
          looks over the old toothbrush, hairbrush, all the bottles and
          tubes besides the sink. He stares for a beat, then throws
          them all away.

                         

          INT/EXT. HAL'S TRASH AREA

          Oliver hauls trash outside, adding it to a very large pile of
          bags. An older Jack Russell Terrier, ARTHUR, follows him.

                         

          INT. HAL'S OFFICE

          Oliver and Arthur sit on the office floor surrounded by
          papers, boxes, books and trash bags. He finds a photo of HAL
          FIELDS in an open Jean jacket, no shirt, it's attached to a
          personal ad application which he begins to read.

                         

                         

          CUT TO PAST

                         

          EXT. LARGE EMPTY PARKING LOT NIGHT

          In the dark, OLIVER FIELDS has a tape recorder and
          microphone, he follows ANDY as he excitedly prepares, a group
          of friends looks on.

                          ANDY
           Okay. Is it on? (recorder)

                          OLIVER
           Yeah yeah.

                          ANDY
           This is for our friend Hal Fields.
           Hal. We love you.

          Andy quickly lights a rack of large fireworks, they shoot up
          into the night and explode - smoke - more explosions -
          everyone's laughing. Oliver looks up at the fireworks,
          recording the sounds, happy.

          BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.

          Oliver has packed his car, he leans down to Arthur.

                          OLIVER
           You're coming to live with me now.
          Arthur looks at him.

                          OLIVER
           This is my car.
          Arthur hops in.

                         

          EXT. STREET - NIGHT

          Oliver's car drives down Sunset boulevard.

                         

          INT. OLIVER'S HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Oliver and Arthur enter, he's carrying a box, his house is
          dark and lonely.

                         

          INT. HAL'S DINNING ROOM

          Oliver enters his dining room, Arthur in tow.

                          OLIVER
           This is the dining room where
           people come and eat sometimes.
          The dog listens intently. Oliver moves on, the dog follows.

                         

          INT. HAL'S LIVING ROOM

          Hal and friends laugh warmly at Andy. We cut to live action
          "portraits" of a priest, a therapist, the Primetimers, his
          movie-night club, and the large L.A. Pride group, all looking
          into camera.

           OLIVER V.O.
           He found an out gay priest to guide

          Oliver sits, looking down at Arthur.

           Look, its lonely out here, so you'd
           better learn how to talk with me.
          Arthur's face looks up at him filled with a dog's love and no
          words.

          Oliver sits as HAL lays in a coma on a ventilator. The room
          is dark, Oliver uses a flashlight to quietly read to his
          father.

          INT. ICU ROOM - DAY

          QUICK CUTS. A nurse opens the shades. A DOCTOR and two nurses
          stand over Hal, everyone's nervous. Hal is struggling with
          all the tubes down his throat. Oliver is trying to help him
          breathe, talking into his ear.
          Oliver is ushered out of the room. The nurse draws the
          curtain.
          MOMENTS LATER: Oliver sits with Hal, now off the ventilator
          but still very weak and disoriented. Oliver coaches his
          breathing.

                          OLIVER
           Calm. Calm, calm breaths.
          Hal coughs.

          It's the middle of the night, Hal is connected to many I.V.s
          in both arms, still disoriented, he's tangled up in the
          tubes, trying to pull them out of his arms. He wakes up
          Oliver.

           Oliver! Please help me with all
           these ropes.
          Oliver rushes and helps him.

           you're very high on drugs.

          IN THE KITCHEN: We see 10-year-old Oliver watching his mother

                          HAL
           Yeah, alright. Give me the
           flashlight.
          Oliver opens it, they look at a few pages together, photos of
          serene gardens.

                          OLIVER
           Nice.

                          HAL
           Oh, that's nice.

          Hal keeps peeking at a bouquet of flowers in the corner of
          the room. Hal takes the flashlight from Oliver and guides it
          to the flowers.

                          OLIVER
           Oh, Andy brought those for you.

                          HAL
           Oh, yeah?
          Hal continues to direct the light across the room, we follow
          the circle of light as it moves a cross a wall landing on a
          painting.

                          HAL
           Oh, who did that painting?

                          OLIVER
           Well, I don't know. Its just a
           painting on the wall.
          Hal continues exploring, Oliver's enjoying his father's
          curiosity, he lands on some photos displayed on the table.

                          HAL
           A--, and these?

                          OLIVER
           They're just photos, Pop.

                          HAL
           But how do they relate to the
           exhibit?

                          OLIVER
           They're just personal photos.
           They're not art.
          Hal slowly moves the flashlight up the wall, across the
          ceiling to a strange assortment of fire detectors,
          sprinklers, sensors, all laid out against the acoustic tile
          ceiling. Hal points up. Oliver looks for a beat, then...

                          OLIVER
           Uh, well that's the water sprinkler
           thing.

                          HAL
           Well, its beautiful.

                          OLIVER
           What is?

                          HAL
           Putting the Japanese gardens there.
           It's just beautiful.

          Oliver looks from the ceiling to the rock garden book. The
          ceiling and the gardens look the same. Oliver is moved by
          Hal's confusion. ANDY, 45-years-old, physical, boyish, storms
          into the room.

                          ANDY
           Hal.

                          HAL
           Andy!
          Andy gets on the bed opposite Oliver. He gives Hal a big kiss
          on the lips. Hal glows. Oliver backs away slowly. Andy picks
          up Hal's hand, turns it palm up and presses his face into it.

                          ANDY
           I brought something for you.
          Oliver watches from outside the room as Andy excitedly pulls
          a portable tape player out of his bag.

                          ANDY
           We made a recording for
           you.

                          HAL
           Oh, God.
          Andy pushes play, on the recording we hear Andy's voice:

           ANDY ON TAPE
           This is for our friend Hal Fields.
           Hal. We love you.
          We hear voices HOOTING, and then large FIREWORKS, LAUGHTER
          and CLAPPING.
          Oliver watches his father's happiness from a distance.

          CUT TO PRESENT

          INT. OLIVER'S OFFICE

          CU on Oliver's hands drawing bright streaming colors of the
          fireworks.
          LATER: Oliver get's to his real work, pulling out a few 8X10
          photos of a band "The Sads". There are some instructions on
          record company letterhead - he is to do an album design for
          their new record - they want him to draw portraits of the
          three members.
          Oliver begins to do quick portraits of them based on the
          photo.

           Jesus, Liz. Another band that
           wants portraits.

                          LIZ
           Well, at least it pays the rent.

                          OLIVER
           You do something decent once, and
           that's all people ever want.
          JUMP CUT through the different portraits developing. It's not
          what Oliver want's to do.

                         

          INT. OLIVER'S OFFICE - LATER

          Elliott and Shauna let themselves in. Elliot grabs a stool
          and sits down.

                          ELLIOTT
           Hi Liz.
          Oliver continues to draw, as Shauna and Elliott try to get
          his attention.

                          ELLIOTT
           Oliver?

                          OLIVER
           Yeah?

                          ELLIOTT
           The pen is not your friend. The
           paper is not your friend. The
           party is your friend. We're your
           friends. Your friends are your
           friends.

                         

          INT. OLIVER'S LIVING ROOM

          Elliot is now dressed as a cop and Shauna as a large chicken,
          they are dancing with no music as Oliver sits on a couch
          depressed dressed as Sigmund Freud, complete with wig-beard-
          glasses-pipe.

                          SHAUNA
           I got the skills... he's got the
           moves...

                          ELLIOTT

          INT. OLIVER'S FRONT DOOR

          Oliver, Elliott, and Shauna are leaving. Arthur can't believe
          he's being left behind. It's actually the first time they
          will separate.

                          OLIVER
           Arthur, you haven't been invited to
           this party. You're gonna stay and
           look after the house.
          Oliver tentatively shuts the door, takes three steps, Arthur
          begins to howl. Oliver tries to ignore it, but stops again.
          He looks back at the house and the howling.

                          CUT TO:

                         

          INT. OLIVER'S CAR - DRIVING

          Arthur, victorious, sits in Elliot's lap in the front seat,
          while Oliver drives and Shauna is squeezed in back in her
          chicken outfit.

                          ELLIOTT
           You remember when Oliver was funny?
           And he could actually, like, talk,
           in complete sentences?

                          SHAUNA
           Funny? Funny? I don't think so Fun
           maybe, but not funny unless, like,
           serious is funny. Then he's'
           fucking hilarious.
          Elliot and Oliver laugh.

                          SHAUNA
           But, lovable. You are very
           lovable.

                          ELLIOTT
           Yeah, very lovable.

                         

          INT. HOUSE PARTY - NIGHT

          Oliver carries Arthur, they all enter a costume party, making
          their way through the crowd of people in all kinds of
          disguises, music blaring, Oliver slides into the less
          populated kitchen. A woman rushes up to Oliver, surprised to
          see he has a dog.

                          FEMALE PARTIER
           So cute, does he do tricks?

           His name's Arthur - he doesn't do
           tricks.
          In the background are a couple dressed as JULIAN and ETHEL
          ROSENBERG, we see them observe Oliver and Arthur.

                          PARTIER
           No? Arthur, SIT!
          Arthur promptly sits down. Oliver's totally surprised.

                          PARTIER
           He's so cute. Shake!
          Arthur sticks out his paw. Oliver doesn't like seeing Arthur
          blindly perform.

                          PARTIER
           Oh my god, he's so cute, I want
           him.

                          OLIVER
           (in Freud accent)
           Does it make you feel powerful to
           order my dog around? Maybe give
           you a sense of power?

                          PARTIER
           Oh, you're being a therapist!
           Freud!

                          OLIVER
           Thanks, yeah. Very good.
          Oliver picks up Arthur and escapes the kitchen. The
          Rosenberg's are still watching.

          LATER...
          Oliver and Arthur sit in a chair next to a couch where a man
          dressed as a witch, complete with green face and long black
          hair, is lying back as if in a traditional analysis session.

                          LONG-HAIRED MAN
           Well, I didn't ask for this. Who
           would ask for this? This color.
           This nose. This cheek, this chin.
           You know, this is my life. This
           isn't a story. This isn't a
           joke...
          Oliver is playing along, but he's really not emotionally
          ready for this party. He feels very far away.

                          OLIVER
           Yeah.

           really good to get this stuff off
           my chest.

                          OLIVER
           (in Freud accent)
           I'm sorry. Our time is up, uh...
           for this week. Thank you for
           coming in.
          The witch moves on.
          Oliver sits with Arthur in his lap, alone, lost in all this
          joviality.
          We see that the woman dressed as Julius Rosenberg is watching
          him.
          Just as Oliver is about to get up, she plops herself down
          onto the couch, ready for her session.

           OLIVER V.O.
           Oh, I was just- I was gonna take a
           break, actually.
          She pulls out a writing pad, oblivious. Oliver can tell she's
          not going to give it up.

                          OLIVER
           (back in accent)
           Well, I guess we should start with
           your mother.
          The woman writes on her notepad and shows it to Oliver:
          "Never had one."

                          OLIVER
           Well then your father.
          She mimes shooting herself in the head and dying.

                          OLIVER
           I don't understand. You can't
           talk? Is it a mental problem? Do
           you need analysis?
          She writes on her pad: "I have laryngitis"

                          OLIVER
           That's a physical problem.
          She smiles at him, looks at him a little too long, Oliver is
          more and more pulled in by her playfulness - she writes:
          "Why are you at a party if you're sad?"
          CU on Oliver, surprised and impressed by her observation.

           hiding it. How could you tell?
          Ethel holds up her notebook. She has drawn TWO EYES.
          Oliver's taken by her.

                          OLIVER
           Clearly, I'm gonna need a drink.
           You?
          She smiles and nods.

                          OLIVER
           You, stay here, yeah?
          Oliver moves to--

                         INT KITCHEN
          Elliot and Shauna are deeply engaged in conversation with
          someone dressed as a pickle and someone dressed as much less
          colorful chicken.

                          ELLIOTT
           No, its just not a natural color
           for a chicken.

                          SHAUNA
           No.

                          ELLIOTT
           (motioning to Shauna's

                          COSTUME)
           And look, you see what happens when
           you free yourself from the cage,
           walk away from the factory.

                          SHAUNA
           You just have no real color.

                          YOU'RE LIKE--
          Oliver slips past, hands Arthur to Elliot. He scoops ice
          from the bucket and starts filling two cups.

                          ELLIOTT
           Hey, hey.

           Uh-oh, one. Uh-oh, two.

                          ELLIOTT
           Two drinks.

                          SHAUNA
           Yeah, wow, making moves.
          Oliver leaves Arthur in Elliott's arms.

          Oliver begins to leave his drinks. We see his POV of the
          woman dressed as Julius Rosenberg waiting on the couch.
          Oliver slips into one of his memories...

                          OLIVER
           Yeah.

                          HAL
           I'm not sorry I woke you!
           I went to Akbar tonight.

                          OLIVER
           You did?

                         

          INT. AKBAR - NIGHT

          Hal and his friends, BRIAN and ROBERT, make their way through
          a crowded gay club. Hal is by far the oldest, and most
          excited, man there.

           HAL (V.O.)
           They had wonderfully loud music. In-
           sit, in-sit, in-sit. What kind of
           music is that?

           OLIVER (V.O.)
           Probably house music?

                         

          INT. HAL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Hal gets a pad and pen to write this down.

                          HAL
           "House music."

                         

          INT. AKBAR - NIGHT

          A bunch of Young Gay guys dance. Hal is on the side, dancing
          by himself, hands in the air twinkling his fingers.

           OLIVER (V.O.)
           So did you meet anyone?
          At the packed bar, Hal drinks alone.

           HAL (V.O.)
           Young gay men don't go for older
           gay men.

                         

          INT. OLIVER'S HOUSE CONTINUOUS

          Back to Oliver in bed, on the phone.

           HAL (V.O.)
           You have it easy.

          INT. HOUSE PARTY - NIGHT

          Oliver snaps out of his memory. He makes his way through the
          crowd and delivers the drink to her. He looks at her a little
          too intensely, then blurts out.

                          OLIVER
           Would you like to dance?
          She happily nods yes. They walk to the dance floor, we think
          Oliver's going to be shy, but he breaks into a kinetic,
          angular, dance. She's surprised with us - she laughs, they
          have a good time.

          JUMP CUT THROUGH THE NIGHT: Oliver, "Julius", Elliott and
          Shauna are talking to a magician. "Julius" picks a card, the
          magician mixes it into the full deck, pops a card into the
          air, it is hers. Shauna and Elliott can see that Oliver's
          coming alive.
          LATER. They dance again, now they're sweaty, the dance
          floor's packed - it's the pinnacle of the party.

                         

          INT. PARTY BATHROOM - NIGHT

          The party's winnowing down in the background - "Julius" and
          Oliver look at each other in the mirror for a beat, and then
          simultaneously take their wigs off, revealing their true
          selves.

                          OLIVER
           Hello...
          Shes mouths a silent "hi"...

                          OLIVER
           Can I give you my number?
          She pulls out her pad and pen and hands them to him.

                          OLIVER
           Thanks.
          As he writes, Oliver spies Arthur sitting in the corner of
          the bathroom, staring directly at him.

                          ARTHUR SUBTITLE
           Tell her the darkness is about to
           drown us unless something drastic
           happens right now.
          Oliver looks to her.

                          OLIVER
           I feel bad dragging Arthur to the
           party. I should get home. It was
           really nice meeting you.
          She writes on her pad: "Au Revoir"

                          OLIVER

                          (CHUCKLES)
           Au revoir. Yeah.
          He leaves.

          Oliver and Arthur walk up the empty street - Oliver kicking
          himself for missing his chance with her. His phone rings.

                          OLIVER
           Hello?
          ON THE OTHER END: Silence. A little breathing, the party in
          background.

                          OLIVER (CONT'D)
           Is that you?

          BEEP.

                          OLIVER (CONT'D)
           One beep means yes?

          BEEP.

                          OLIVER (CONT'D)
           I've always wanted to have a phone
           call with someone who doesn't
           talk...

          BEEEEEEEEEEEEP.

                          OLIVER (CONT'D)
           You want to do something?

                         BEEP

                          OLIVER (CONT'D)
           Now?

          BEEP.

                          OLIVER (CONT'D)
           Okay, I'm parked just right up the
           street.
          BEEP. They hang up. Oliver is filled with hope.
          CUT TO: "Julius" walking out into a pool of street light.
          They smile at each other, but don't say anything. They get
          into his car.

                          OLIVER
           Okay. You point - I'll drive.
          Oliver starts the engine. She points forward and they head
          off. At the light she points left, he follows. Down the
          street she points right...

                          OLIVER
           This way?

          She nods. Oliver drives up on the sidewalk before the
          street, heads down it for half a block, then takes her right.
          We can hear them laughing.

                         

          EXT./INT. HOTEL ROOM LOBBY - NIGHT

          Oliver, Arthur and the woman enter a very fancy hotel lobby.
          Oliver is impressed. She mime's giving him a tour but still
          doesn't talk.

                         

          INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

          Oliver and the woman open the door and enter her suite. They
          look at each other nervously.

                          OLIVER
           Nice place.
          They sit on her bed. She steals his pipe, put's it in her
          mouth -- writes on her pad and shows it to him.

                          OLIVER (CONT'D)
           Oh, my mother. My mother died five
           years ago.

                          ANNA
           (in a hoarse whisper)
           Oh merd.

                          OLIVER
           Oh, you spoke.

                          ANNA

                          (A WHISPER)
           I'm not supposed to.
          She writes and present him with a new question.

                          OLIVER
           My father died two months ago,
           almost three.
          She looks at him with sincere empathy and surprise. Oliver's
          opened up, an now everything gushes out, he barely knows what
          he's saying.

                          OLIVER (CONT'D)
           He, he was gay.
          She's very surprised.

                          OLIVER (CONT'D)
           He was gay the whole time they were
           married.

           and, uh... he was 75 years old.
          There's a quiet moment of deep connection.

                          OLIVER (CONT'D)
           Sorry.
          She mouths "No" (don't say sorry). She reaches out and gently
          runs a finger across Oliver's brow and the outline of his
          face, he's so vulnerable, she lovingly/mischievously squishes
          his face together and messes up his hair. Then she leans in,
          and they kiss for the first time - delicately.

                          ANNA

                          (WHISPER)
           Can we just sleep?

                          OLIVER (CONT'D)
           Sure, sure.
          They lay down, she takes his arm and pulls him into spooning
          her. He pulls the covers over them.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. HOTEL ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

          Oliver wakes, still in his clothes. ANNA is already up. She
          waves and Oliver smiles.
          Anna holds up her notebook: "Who are you?"

                          OLIVER
           Oliver.
          She writes again: "Go to NY. Audition. Back Thursday."

                          OLIVER
           How long are you here when you get
           back?
          Anna holds up one finger.

                          OLIVER
           A year?
          Anna shakes her head and smiles. She gestures smaller.

                          OLIVER
           A month? Right. And then?...
          She pantomimes a camera rolling, and herself acting.

                          OLIVER
           You're filming here. Acting.

                          OLIVER
           And after?...
          She makes a casual tossing motion with her hand.

                          OLIVER
           Just somewhere else. Where?
          Anna only shrugs. She writes more, and tosses the notepad on
          his lap. Oliver reads: "Can I see you again?"
          He's very happy.

                          OLIVER
           Yes.

          They walk down the long hallway, Oliver carries her bags,

          her hand. They stop and kiss - gentle and comfortable with
          each other.

          Oliver makes two piles of mail, one says Oliver Fields, one
          has a yellow forwarding sticker that says Hal Fields. The Hal
          Fields pile is much bigger.

                          OLIVER
           Jesus, Pop, you get so much mail.
          Oliver slows and stares at his father's magazine - The
          Advocate. Two attractive, shirtless men on the cover under
          the title: America's Sweethearts. Oliver's lost in memory...

           DOCTOR LONG (O.S.)
           Hal, its remarkable how well you've
           recovered from being on the
           ventilator.

                         

          INT. HAL'S HOSPITAL ROOM

          Hal sit's on top of his hospital bed, wearing one of his all
          black outfits, looking much healthier. A doctor sits on his
          bed, Oliver listens from the side.

           But...?

                          DOCTOR LONG
           The bronchoscopy revealed a mass
           about the size of a quarter. It is
           located in your lower right lung.
          CU on Hal taking this in.

           DOCTOR LONG (CONT'D)
           I'm afraid the biopsy showed it's
           cancerous.

                          HAL
           Uh-huh. I see.

                          DOCTOR LONG
           It appears to have spread... to the
           large hilar lymph nodes in your
           chest and liver.

          As Dr. Long talks about treatments, Oliver drifts back from
          the conversation, slowly retreating to a window in the far
          corner, as we continue to hear Dr. Long speak, we see
          Oliver's thoughts, fixating on "a mass about the size of a

                         QUARTER"

                         WE HEAR:

           DR. LONG (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           ... Surgery isn't possible given
           its location. We can start
           radiation treatments and see if
           you're strong enough for Chemo. You
           will be able to go home.

                         WE SEE:

          SHOT OF A QUARTER ON BLACK

          SHOT OF TWO DIMES AND A NICKEL

          SHOT OF 5 NICKELS.

          SHOT OF 25 PENNIES.
          We cut back to Hal's face, stoically digesting the news.

                          DOCTOR LONG
           Do you have any questions?

                          HAL
           No. Thank you.
          As the doctor leaves. Oliver takes his father's hand.

                          OLIVER
           I'm sorry.

                          HAL
           Well, let's not rush out and tell
           everyone.

           Andy?

                          HAL
           No need to get him up a tree.
          Hal takes a moment and composes himself. In his eyes we can
          see that he knows there is an end to his life.

          As Andy enters, his hands mysteriously cupped together.

           You know, I have the right to be
           here as much as anyone else.
          Hal lovingly cuts him off, trying to ease the tension.

                          HAL
           Go take a walk. Calm yourself.
          Andy walks out, feeling embarrassed and rejected.

          To everyone's surprise, Andy storms back in with a bouquet of
          flowers, dumps them on Hal's chest, kisses him triumphantly
          and leaves again.

           Oh, it's not?
          She shakes her head no, the party stops, she leaves. Oliver
          instinctively polite, starts packing up their cups.

           I'm sorry.
          Moans and complaints from the group.

           No, no, no. She's a wonderful
           nurse. (he pauses a beat, then
           raises his cup again) Here's to

          Hal swigs back his wine. They all laugh, grab their cups and
          toast.

          She stops. Gets up, nervous, and walks past Oliver into the
          next room. Oliver follows her in. They pause uncomfortably,
          Anna suddenly leans in and kisses him. Before it goes to
          far...

           Right.
          They awkwardly break apart. Anna goes to a chair, Oliver
          follows. While nothing has really been expressed between the
          two, Anna seems to understand the problem.

                          ANNA
           Well, my name is Anna. You're
           worried you can't trust me because
           you don't know who I am. I get it.
           That makes sense to me.
          She falters, looks at him vulnerably. Oliver abruptly kisses
          her. She pushes back. They pause. She traces his brow slowly
          with her index finger, the way she did their first night.

          The music carries us, they lie in bed, naked. Anna innocently
          leans over and takes Oliver's arm and bites down hard. He
          grimaces. She stops and kisses it, admiring her teeth marks.
          She gets up, sits at a side table and finds her cigarettes.
          Oliver watches her.
          The music seems to bend and slow down, this continues as we
          fall into memory...

          INT. GEORGIA'S BEDROOM

          CU on young Oliver's hand pushing on a record making the
          bending, slowing sounds.

                          GEORGIA
           Oliver, stop it.

                         
          Oliver stands up bored, Georgia's in the connecting bathroom
          getting ready to go out.

                          OLIVER
           This music's old.

                          GEORGIA
           It's black, black music is the
           deepest cause they suffered the
           most, them and the Jews.
          Oliver plops down on the bed, listening to her.

                          GEORGIA
           In my next life I'm gonna marry a
           good hot blooded Jew - someone full
           of emotion.

                          OLIVER
           I'm Jewish right?
          Georgia comes and sits with him, caresses his hair as she
          talks with him.

                          GEORGIA AT 50
           You're a quarter, I'm a half, your
           father's none. He has the least
           emotions, You'll have more emotions
           than him, but I'll have the most
           emotions.
          She likes that she has the most emotions. They head out.

          EXT. OLIVER'S CHILDHOOD CAR

          10 year old Oliver's in the driving sear, Georgia smokes and
          admires his handling of the car.

                          GEORGIA
           You're turning into a wonderful
           driver.
          Oliver's proud.

                         

          INT. LACMA ART MUSEUM STEPS DAY

          Oliver escorts Georgia up the large steps of the museum. The
          crowd from an opening gathers at the top.

                         

          INT. DAVID SMITH GALLERY LACMA DAY

          Georgia and Oliver approach a David Smith sculpture. After
          staring at it's angels for a beat, Georgia begins to do an
          angular modern-dance-pantomime of the sculpture, imitating
          it's shapes with her body. Oliver locks up with
          embarrassment. A confused and concerned museum guard
          approaches.

                          SECURITY GUARD
           Excuse me Mrs. Fields....

                          GEORGIA
           What? You're not allowed to
           interact with the art?

                          SECURITY GUARD
           It's just that...

                          OLIVER
           C'mon.
          Still embarrassed, Oliver takes Georgia's hand and walks her
          away from the guard.

                          GEORGIA
           You too? You like being a good
           citizen?

                          OLIVER
           No.

          INT. ANNA'S HOTEL ROOM - LATER

          Anna's sits in her kimono. Oliver's buttoning his shirt.

                          ANNA
           Can you toss me my camisole.
          Oliver throws a sweater.

                          ANNA (CONT'D)
           No, my camisole.
          She throws the sweater back at him. Oliver looks around
          helplessly. He grabs a flower out of a vase and hands it to
          her.

                          OLIVER
           Camisole?
          Anna laughs.

                          ANNA
           You don't know what a camisole is?

                          OLIVER
           I was brought up by these animals
           and they didn't like questions.
          They're both smiling now.

                          OLIVER
           They were very frowned upon. So I
           had to guess.
          Anna takes this in.

                          ANNA
           You can ask me anything.

                          OLIVER
           Anything?
          CUT TO: Oliver and Anna at the window.

                          OLIVER
           What's out there?
          She points.

                          ANNA
           That's a tree.

           Another building like this one.

                          OLIVER
           Right.

                          ANNA
           People in the building like us.
           Half of them think things will
           never work out. The other half
           believe in magic. It's like a war
           between them.
          Oliver smiles. He moves away from the window.

                          OLIVER
           How do you know so much about
           people?

                          ANNA
           Oh. Well, you have to learn how to
           read their faces.
          She climbs onto his lap, straddles him.

                          ANNA
           For example... here is mad.
          Anna passes her hand across her face, and she's "mad".

                          ANNA
           Happy...
          Her hand passes again and she's "happy".

                          ANNA
           Sometimes its just nothing.

                          OLIVER
           Oh yeah?
          She points at her blank face.

                          ANNA
           This is nothing... And they are
           good at looking one way and being
           another way.
          Her playfulness is very meaningful to Oliver, he's in love.

          EXT. FREEWAY PEDESTRIAN OVERPASS

          They walk through a caged-in freeway overpass - Oliver is
          carrying Arthur while blindfolding Anna with his hands. Over
          this we hear the sounds of the quiet hotel room and an
          intimate conversation between them.

           ANNA (V.O.)
           You don't know me. I like that.

           OLIVER (V.O.)
           No, that's not true.

           ANNA (V.O.)
           Oh yeah?

           OLIVER (V.O.)
           Yeah, you have blonde hair that
           goes down to about here. You smoke
           in non-smoking rooms.
          Oliver is still covering her eyes, leading her to a certain
          point, the busy sound of the freeway fading up...

                          OLIVER
           Okay, open your eyes...
          HIGH ANGLE on huge trucks and traffic racing just beneath
          Oliver and Anna's feet under the overpass. The trucks lay on
          their horns as they pass, scaring and thrilling them.
          MOMENTS LATER: they walk alongside the LA river together, arm
          in arm, happy. The intimate conversation continues in voice
          over.

           ANNA (V.O.)
           Oh yeah? You drive on the sidewalk.
           You were raised by animals.
           Sometimes you look very alone, like
           you just got here.
          They meet up with friends on the banks of the river.

           OLIVER (V.O.)
           Yeah, you see, you don't know me at
           all.

                         

          INT. ANNA'S HOTEL HALLWAY

          Oliver and Arthur are leaving, walking down the long hallway
          together. Arthur seems to stop and look up at Oliver.

                          ARTHUR SUBTITLE
           She's unlike any girl I've ever
           met.

           Are we married yet?

                          OLIVER
           No, uh, it doesn't work like that.
           There are other steps, it's
           complicated.
          They look at each other a beat and then walk on together.

                          ARTHUR SUBTITLE
           I hope this feeling lasts.

          Andy holds Arthur. Hal and Arthur kiss. They've clearly
          missed each other.
          JUMP CUTS: Oliver takes bottles of pills and syrups and
          inhalers out of a Sav-On bag. He makes a chart of the
          medicine, the dosage, and puts the pills in a dish. It's

           You can be alone or you can be with
           the giraffe.

                          OLIVER
           I'd wait for the lion.
          Oliver grabs the oxygen tubes and puts them on Hal's face.

                          HAL
           That's why I worry about you.
          Hal looks at Oliver with love and concern.

          CUT TO him drawing an explosion with the caption: "EARTH
          BEGINS (SADNESS NOT YET INVENTED)". He draws a man and a
          woman with the caption: "FIRST COUPLE TO MARRY FOR WRONG
          REASONS." He draws a spilled glass - "INVENTION OF ALCOHOL,
          ANCIENT EGYPT." He draws a man's face and torso: "FIRST GAY
          MAN ACCUSED OF BEING MENTALLY ILL." He draws a man labelled
          "PRESENT" having been crushed by a giant boulder labelled

          "PAST."
          Oliver stops drawing, thinking of a conversation with his
          father. CUT TO: Hal on his couch (previous scene) talking to
          Oliver.

                          HAL
           You want me to be with someone like
           me. I like Andy cause he's not like

          INT. MELROSE BOOK STORE NIGHT

          Oliver and Anna are in the overcrowded used book store we saw
          earlier. Oliver sees her down the aisle.

                          OLIVER
           Hey, what did you get?
          She puts the cover of Liv Ullman's "Changing" over her face -
          Ullman's face on the cover becomes Anna's.

                          OLIVER (CONT'D)
           Liv Ullman. Very serious.

                          ANNA
           And I found this crazy book.
          She holds an old copy of THE JOY OF SEX in front of her face.

                          OLIVER
           That's kind of a classic American
           thing.
          Anna opens the book to a large drawing of a couple having
          sex.

                          ANNA
           Maybe we can figure out some
           classic American things to do.
          Oliver takes the book and flips through the pages.

                          OLIVER
           Yeah, Like page 75?

                          ANNA
           Uh-huh.

                          OLIVER
           Or 75 all the way through, through

           80.

          LATER...
          Oliver, Anna and Arthur sit at the end of an aisle looking at
          a book on "Old Hollywood". The book has a photo of Louise
          Brooks from the Twenties.

                          OLIVER

                          (READING)
           Louise Brooks, star of silent
           screen... effectively banned from
           Hollywood in early Thirties, ended
           up working as a salesgirl at Saks
           Fifth Avenue.

                          OLIVER
           Veronica Lake.

                          ANNA
           Oh I love her.

                          OLIVER
           She was a pin-up model and a film
           star... Success was short-lived...
           series of broken marriages... She
           struggled with mental illness and
           alcoholism. She died of hepatitis
           at the age of 53.

                          ANNA
           All these actor stories end sad. I
           can tell you that already. It's
           not a good life.
          Oliver closes the book, they share a look, and something
          vulnerable. Anna changes the mood, pulls out The Joy Of Sex,
          skips through the pages as she talks.

                          ANNA (CONT'D)
           So. Now I want real Mexican food.
          She stops on an illustration she likes.

                          ANNA (CONT'D)
           And I want to try page... 46.

                         

          EXT. STREET TACO TRUCK - NIGHT

          Oliver, Anna and Arthur walk up to a typical L.A. Taco truck
          on the side of the street. There is nothing fancy looking
          about it.

                          ANNA
           No.

                          OLIVER
           Yeah.

                          ANNA
           Really?

                          OLIVER
           It's really good.
          JUMP CUT: They're sitting on milk crates by the truck, ready
          to take their first bite, Anna dives in un-selfconsciously,
          we're not sure what she thinks.

           It's so good.
          Oliver's so relieved.

                          OLIVER
           It's good? Oh, I wasn't sure you'd
           like it.

                          ANNA
           Why?

                          OLIVER
           You're an actress and staying in
           that fancy hotel.
          Anna can barely swallow her huge bite...

                          ANNA
           I like this place.

                         

          INT. ANNA'S HOTEL ROOM

          They lie on the bed, continuing their conversation, side by
          side, looking up at the ceiling together.

                          ANNA
           I used to love hotels. But now I'm
           always in a new apartment or... in
           another hotel somewhere.

                          OLIVER
           How do you keep hold of friends...
           or boyfriends?

                          ANNA
           It makes it very easy to end up
           alone - to leave people.

                          OLIVER
           You can stay in the same place and
           still find ways to leave people.
          She reaches up with her hand, their fingers intertwine.

                          ANNA
           You are like that? Its what you do?
          Oliver nods yes. They know each other much better than either
          one knew.

                          ANNA
           So we are the same?

          Thumps and loud 1920's music wakes Oliver in the middle of
          the night. He turns the lights on, discombobulated.
          He gets up, works his way through the dark house. Turning on
          lights.

                          OLIVER

                          HAL
           Oh, did I wake you? Yeah. (Handing
           Maria some books) Thank you Maria.
           (to Oliver) And now that you're
           here, uh, would you please put

           Yeah.

                          ANNA
           Jewish girls are not pretty. They
           can be "interesting", or cute, but
           not pretty.

                          OLIVER
           You're kidding right?

                          ANNA
           That's what my mom told me.

                          OLIVER
           She did not.
          Anna laughs. As Anna continues to explain, the sound begins
          to fade down...

                          ANNA
           No, you're right, this girl at
           school told me that. And I went

           OLIVER (V.O.)
           While they were reciting their
           vows, here in this church...

          AND THEN A STILL FROM ALLEN GINSBERG'S 1955 APARTMENT.

           OLIVER (V.O.)
           Allen Ginsburg was writing his
           famous poem, Howl, blocks away in
           this room.

          AS WE SLOWLY ZOOM INTO GINSBERG'S APARTMENT, HISTORICAL

          RECORDING OF HIM READING HOWL FADES UP AND OVER THE NEXT

          SCENE.

           ALLEN GINSBERG (V.O.)
           Who let themselves be fucked in the
           ass by saintly motorcyclists and
           screamed with joy. Who blew and
           were blown...

          CUT TO PRESENT

                         

          INT. OLIVER'S OFFICE - DAY

          GINSBERG'S READING CONTINUES OVER: Oliver flips through a
          mock-up he made for "The Sads" - it's all the happy faces
          from 1950's advertising that we saw in the last scene. One
          face per-panel.
          LATER: the three members of "The Sads" and a RECORD COMPANY
          REP arrive. Jelly Roll Morton piano plays, we see but do not
          hear the meeting take place. The Sads look at the designs,
          which include many of the "History Of Sadness" drawings we
          have seen now in CD cover format - and no portraits of the
          band. It's clear that The Sads are not into Oliver's work.
          CUT TO: After the meeting, the RECORD COMPANY REP talks to
          Oliver alone.

           RECORD COMPANY LADY
           Just do the portrait of them, it's
           an album cover, right? That's what
           they want. Yeah?
          Oliver's very disappointed but polite.

          INT. HAL'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Oliver walks into Hal's living room, carrying his full tray
          of medication.

                          OLIVER
           Here, Pop.

                          HAL
           Oh, God.

                          OLIVER
           I know, I know. Come on.
          Hal begins taking his many pills, with each one he pings his
          glass with a teaspoon as he swallows. The room is cluttered
          with books. Oliver picks up a toppling pile of files from a
          paper-filled side table.

                          HAL
           Hey, no, no, no. That's the Gay
           Pride Day stuff. Just leave those.

                          OLIVER
           Alright.
          Oliver begins to neaten a messy pile of books on top of a
          chair.

                          HAL
           And that's for gay book club. You
           better leave those too.

                          OLIVER
           But what about this chair? Is it
           gay?

                          HAL
           The chair's not gay. Obviously.
          Hal gets up and walks to the kitchen, his oxygen cannon cord
          is attached to the pump behind him, stopping him short.

                          OLIVER
           Pop, Pop, the cord won't go that
           far.

                          HAL
           Oh, to hell with it.
          Hal pulls off the oxygen and keeps walking, frail but
          determined. Andy enters with a large pilates ball.

                          HAL
           Oh, hey what's that?

                          ANDY
           Now that you're out of the
           hospital, you'll have to exercise,
           get you back into shape.
          Oliver can't believe it.

                          HAL
           That's a great idea.

                          ANDY
           Okay, let's try it. I'll, I'll show
           you how.
          Hal's still heading to the sink.

                          HAL
           Yeah, later on, I'm gonna make
           myself some tea.

                          ANDY
           Okay, I'll clean it up. It's a
           little - yech.
          Andy walks out, Hal pours water into a kettle, in front of
          him on the window sill is the same vase from the first scene
          of the film, with some dead daisies in it.

                          HAL
           Your mother's vase needs some
           flowers.
          Oliver looks at them frustrated and uneasy...

                         

          INT. STAPLES - DAY

          Oliver and Hal walk amongst all the products. Hal wears his
          portable oxygen and grabs different kinds of papers, dumping
          them in the basket Oliver holds.

                          OLIVER
           Pop, you just got out of the
           hospital, you should take it easy.

          They're in a new isle, Hal continues his march.

                          OLIVER
           You need to tell Andy that
           you're... not well.
          Hal, continues on, avoiding looking at Oliver.

                         

                          HAL
           You'll tell him, won't you?
          Oliver's flabbergasted, but his dad's vulnerability is clear
          to him.

                          OLIVER
           Me?

                          HAL
           Please?

                         

          INT. HAL'S GUEST HOUSE - DAY

          Andy's on an elliptical trainer, through a window we can see
          Oliver approaching with the weight of the world on his
          shoulders. Andy see's him, can immediately sense that
          something is wrong.

                          OLIVER
           Hey.
          Oliver approaches seriously, this makes Andy nervous, he
          stops his workout. Oliver tries to find his words.

                          ANDY
           You know that I tried to have sex
           with women?

                          OLIVER
           Yeah?

                          ANDY
           Yeah. I wanted you to know I
           tried, it just, it didn't work.

                          OLIVER
           Hey, I don't have a problem with
           gay guys.

                          ANDY
           Have you ever had sex with a man?

                          OLIVER
           No.

                          ANDY
           I heard that if a man hasn't had
           sex with another man, he's always
           afraid of gay men. You know,
           they're a threat.
          Oliver's blown away by the logic.

                          OLIVER
           I don't know Andy.

                          ANDY
           I didn't want you to feel
           threatened, I don't want to have
           sex with you. What I do, most
           people wouldn't even call it sex.
          Andy's relieved he got this off his chest, all tension is
          relieved for him, Oliver is just confused.

                          OLIVER
           Okay, okay.

                          ANDY
           Hey...
          Andy gives Oliver a big sweaty hug. Oliver leaves.

                         

          INT. HAL'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

          Oliver enters as Hal's finishing the dishes.

                          OLIVER
           I couldn't tell him.

                          HAL
           That's okay.

                          OLIVER
           No it's not. You can't hide this
           from him. He loves you.

                          HAL
           For someone with so much
           relationship advice, you seem
           awfully alone.
          Oliver, angry but at a loss for words, takes the flower vase
          and leaves, Arthur follows.

                         

          EXT. HAL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

          Oliver and Arthur exit a side door, go to a planter full of
          daisies and cuts some for his mother's vase. He looks back
          Arthur.

           looking, we'll make a run for it,
           okay?

          EXT. GRIFFITH PARK

          We cut to Arthur sprinting up a trail in Elysian park. Oliver
          and Anna chase after him. In contrast to the previous scene
          there is lightness and laughter here.

                         

          INT. ANNA'S HOTEL ROOM NIGHT

          The three enter, the phone is ringing, Anna is staring at it
          with dread. Oliver looks at her, he finally moves to pick it
          up.

                          ANNA
           Don't, don't.
          It keeps ringing.

                          ANNA
           It's my dad.
          They both watch the phone as it rings and stops.

                          OLIVER
           He's that bad?
          She picks up the phone, and gestures for Oliver to pick up
          the line next to him.

                          ANNA (CONT'D)
           I'll be my dad, you be me.

                          OLIVER

           OK.

                          ANNA
           (In a deep man's voice) Honey?
          She gestures again, Oliver picks up the phone on his side of
          the bed. Anna turns away, he can only see her back across the
          bed. He turns away too.

                          OLIVER
           Oui?
          Anna continues to talk in a different voice.

                          ANNA
           C'est toi, cheri?

           You never call me back.

                         

                          ANNA
           You know, I can't stop thinking
           about, you know, about it. Doing
           it.

                          OLIVER
           Doing what?

                          ANNA
           Killing myself. You are the only
           one I can tell that to.
          Oliver breaks role, turns around looks at her.

                          OLIVER
           You should tell mom about that, not
           me.
          She just looks at him. Back into phone.

                          ANNA
           You are my girl.
          They hang up. She's embarrassed, she lightens the mood to get
          out of this intimacy.

                          ANNA
           Now I have to kill you.

                          OLIVER
           Just as it was going so well.

                          ANNA
           I know. I'm sorry.
          She tosses a pillow over his face and pretends to shoot him
          twice. She pulls the pillow back tentatively, he's smiling.

                          OLIVER
           Hey Anna?

                          ANNA
           Hey Oliver?

                          OLIVER
           How do you feel about vandalism?
          It's the last question she thought he'd ask. She's amused.

          EXT. LOS ANGELES STREETS/INT. CAR - NIGHT

          Anna, Oliver, Elliott, Shauna and Arthur drive up Sunset
          Blvd. They arrive at Alvarado, park and get out. Above them a
          well lit large blank/white billboard. As Oliver and Elliott
          get spray paint cans from the back of the car...

                          ELLIOTT
           Oliver, don't write any of that
           serious stuff, okay? Just write
           something funny. Girls like funny.

                         

          EXT. ROOFTOP

          The gang get to the top of the stairs, on to the roof where
          they can see the large blank billboard towering in front of
          them.

                          SHAUNA
           You know what? Here, give me
           Arthur. We'll just stay here and
           get arrested. You know, that's
           good.
          Oliver leaves Arthur with her, and Anna and Elliott and him
          head off to the billboard. They climb it's structure, it's
          high and a bit scary. On the top is a gang plank looking over
          the city. Anna is happy she came. Elliott goes to paint the
          back side of the billboard. Oliver meets up with Anna, over
          looking the city.

                          OLIVER
           You okay?

                          ANNA
           Yeah. I'm gonna stay here with my
           new friend (the handrail she
           holds).

                          OLIVER
           Okay.
          Oliver walks out and writes big letters across the billboard.

          YOU MAKE ME LAUGH BUT IT'S NOT FUNNY.
          He makes his way back. Anna's not where she was, he looks and
          finds her in the gangways between the two billboards with a
          view to downtown below her.

                          ANNA
           C'est beau ici.

          He comes to her, wanting to get beyond the romance somehow.

                          OLIVER
           I'm trying to impress you.

                          ANNA
           (Gasps ironically) Really?
          She walks to him and puts her hands around his head, somehow
          it's more intimate and vulnerable now.

                          ANNA
           It's working.
          They kiss.
          MOMENTS LATER. They're at the bottom of the ladder. They all
          run back to their car.

                         

          INT. ANNA'S HOTEL - NIGHT

          Oliver, Anna and Arthur walk down the hallway. Arthur bolts
          ahead suddenly, getting free of Oliver, he runs to and OLD
          MAN - wearing all black and looking just like Hal. Oliver
          runs up to stop Arthur.

                          OLIVER
           Arthur, Arthur. I'm sorry.
          We see the old man's face, it's not Hal, but it the
          resemblance hits Oliver too. The man is struggling with his
          hotel key card.

                          OLD MAN
           Oh. No problem. No problem. What's
           with this card?

                          OLIVER (CONT'D)
           Uh, do you mind?
          Oliver swipes the man's key, the door opens.

                          OLD MAN
           Thank you.
          He disappears. Oliver looks overwhelmed by this ghost. Anna
          senses what's happened. She leads Oliver to their room.

           Yeah.
          She wants to take care of him, she lays him back on the bed,
          helps him take his coat off, she's sitting on him, caressing
          him - Oliver is overwhelmed by memory.

                          OLIVER
           Somewhere along the line, he
           stopped admitting to himself that
           he was sick.

           It's not as bad as it sounds.

                          OLIVER
           Pop. There is no stage 5.

                          HAL
           That's not what it means.

           What does it mean?

                          HAL
           It just means it's been through 3

          all of Hal's friends -- happy, laughing, partying. He looks
          back at Hal, ready to fight him more, but for the first time
          we can see fear and doubt in Hal's face.

                          HAL
           Eventually Jesus grew old. He could
           no longer walk far and he could no
           longer preach in a loud voice. One
           day he announced to his apostles
           that he was departing. The three
           disciples prayed with him, gave him
           water, bathed and fed him. After
           gasping for breath for several
           days, one morning, just as dawn
           came, Jesus passed away.

                          OLIVER
           You re-wrote Jesus' death?
          They all laugh.

           It was so violent, we need new
           stories.

          wanting to follow.

           I couldn't sleep, I wanted to walk

          Oliver's petting Arthur. He's confused and hurt.

                          ANNA
           You've lost so much. What if I
           can't make up for that?

           If this is too much, then we should
           just stop.
          Oliver gets up and starts to leave, Anna's surprised. She
          catches up with him puts her arms around him from behind.

                          ANNA
           Wait, wait.
          She forces him to stay there.

                          ANNA
           I don't want to stop.
          They hold this pose in silence for a beat, then,

          Oliver's laughing now - the noise, the absurdity. Hal and
          Oliver make eye contact. Hal yells less strongly than the
          others but trying...

                          HAL

           FFFFFFUUUUUCCCCKKKKK!!!!!
          They keep eye contact. They are bonded, happy, out of their
          normal confines. Oliver comes to Hal, yelling again.

                          OLIVER

           FFFFFUUUUUCCCCCCKKKKKK!!!!!

          INT. ANNA'S HOTEL ROOM MORNING

          Arthur runs towards camera chasing a tennis ball that Anna
          threw for him. He runs back and jumps onto the bed, waking
          Oliver. He's sleepy, she's happy, wants him to wake up.

                          ANNA
           Ah, you're awake! Arthur says it's
           time to get up, he says he has the
           day off.

                          OLIVER
           He talks to you too?

                          ANNA
           Yeah.

                          OLIVER
           Your English is not so perfect. And
           he said ten minutes.

                         

          INT. MOONLIGHT ROLLER RINK - NIGHT

          Hard cut Oliver and Anna roller-skating to carousel music.
          They're having a great time being terrible at it.
          Oliver and Anna join Elliott and Shauna on the side of the
          rink. Arthur is half hidden in a duffle bag at their feet.

                          OLIVER
           You okay? (to Anna) You did really
           well.

                          ELLIOTT
           Yeah, I can't believe that was your
           first time.

                          OLIVER
           (To Arthur) You watching all the
           humans going around and around.
          The manager of the rink suddenly arrives, upset.

                          MANAGER
           Excuse me. There's no dogs allowed
           in the building. You need to remove
           him from the premises please.

           If I leave him on his own, he loses
           all control.

                          MANAGER
           I'm sorry. There's no dogs allowed
           in the building.

                          OLIVER
           Yeah, but if I leave him in the
           car, he cries, he howls. I can't
           leave him in the car.

           ELLIOTT AND SHAUNA
           C'mon, it's her first time!

           I don't know what she's saying but
           I don't like it.

                          OLIVER
           She is just talking in French.
           She's saying it's OK, it is such a
           small dog.

                          MANAGER
           You need to remove the dog from the
           premises or I'm going to have to
           call the authorities.

                          OLIVER
           You're gonna call the authorities?

           ELLIOTT AND SHAUNA
           Fuck it, steal the skates, just
           leave.

                          ANNA
           Dans ce pays! On ne peut pas
           amener un chien. On peut rien
           faire. Mais c'est con...

                         

          EXT. MOONLIGHT ROLLERINK BACK DOOR - CONTINUOUS

          Oliver, Anna and Arthur make their way out the door and down
          the street in their skates.

                         

          INT. MAIN HOTEL HALLWAY

          They roll down the main lobby hallway, Arthur running behind,
          dodging people as they go.

          They struggle to skate down the hotel hallway, past a maid.

                          OLIVER
           Sorry, excuse us, sorry.
          They enter Anna's door.

                         

          INT. ANNA'S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Oliver, Anna, Arthur enter on their skates. Still very
          playful, they skate around the big room. The phone rings.
          Anna's face falls, they both know it must be her father. She
          muster's on trying to have a good time. Oliver goes and
          unplugs the phone.

                          OLIVER
           He shouldn't do this to you.
          The phone in the next room keeps ringing. He awkwardly skates
          to it and unplugs it. He returns.

                         

                         
          Oliver skates to her concerned.

                          ANNA
           Even if we don't answer, he's still
           in here (points to her head).I go
           somewhere else, he's still here.
          Oliver can relate.

                          OLIVER
           Your leaving soon?

                          ANNA
           Yeah.

                          OLIVER
           I think you should come to my house
           and move in with me.

                          ANNA
           Would you want a strange girl like
           me?

                          OLIVER
           Yeah, a lot.
          She's very moved.

                          ANNA
           Do you cook?

           Yes (not so sure).
          She laughs. She almost cries as she thinks this over. She
          skates to him, puts her arms around him.

                          ANNA
           I would love that.
          They kiss.

                          OLIVER
           But now I'm going to have to kill
           you for sure now.

                          ANNA
           Why?

                          OLIVER
           Cause I'm falling in love with you.
          The sound in the room fades down, Oliver's narration fades in
          over the shot of them embracing in their skates.

           We didn't go to this war. We didn't

           fortune allowed us to feel a
           sadness that our parents didn't
           have time for and a happiness that
           I never saw with them.

           they stop running and I can really
           see Anna's eyes in 2003. Her ears.
           Her feet. This is what it looks

           cries. When she tells me there's
           always a new empty room waiting for
           her. They used to make her feel
           free. Now they make her feel the
           opposite of free.

          Oliver's at his desk, looking at photos of himself and his
          mother at a museum exhibit from the 70's. We see young Oliver
          and Georgia, an exhibit of stuffed animals, a quote on a
          wall. Oliver goes to his notebooks, looks through them till
          he finds a small rainbow sticker. He puts it on the table and

          With each swallow he pings a glass with a fork. Hal opens a
          letter from a gay rights organization, he hands Oliver the
          rainbow sticker we just saw.

                          HAL (CONT'D)
           Here, that means gay pride.

                          OLIVER
           Yeah, everyone knows that, here.
          He gives Hal another pill, another reluctant difficult
          swallow, another ping.

           Don't be ridiculous.
          Hal's hiding something, he doesn't look Oliver in the eyes
          when he asks...

                          HAL
           Did you know, about me?
          Oliver shakes his head no.

           No, I just thought you and mom
           weren't in love.

                          HAL
           We loved each other.

                          OLIVER
           But you were gay that whole time.

                          HAL
           I learned how not to be.

                          OLIVER
           For 44 years?

                          HAL
           I knew I was gay, though, at dinner

           What about sex? You guys had sex?

                          HAL
           She didn't think I was the greatest
           lover, but we made do. Look, I
           liked my life, the museum, our
           house, that's what I wanted.

                          OLIVER
           And mom? You wanted mom too right?
          Frustrated and angry, Oliver takes the pill tray into the
          kitchen, leaving Hal behind.

           I said - look I love you and we're
           great buddies but you know what I

           matter. I'll fix that.

          life.

           OLIVER (V.O.)
           ...Generally by the time you are
           real, most of your hair has been
           loved off, and your eyes drop out
           and you get loose in the joints.
           But these things don't matter at
           all because you are real and you
           can't be ugly, except to people who
           don't understand.'"

          The rest of the band looks at Oliver's wall of designs -
          there are no portraits of them. We cut into the meeting mid

          Oliver pulls her away before she starts any more trouble.

                         

          EXT. STREET/INT. GEORGIA'S CAR

          Georgia's in drivers seat, they're at a stoplight.

                          GEORGIA
           Aha. The infamous left.
          Up a new street, they arrive at the next stop.

                          GEORGIA
           And?
          Oliver points left.

                          GEORGIA
           Left again. Going in circles. I
           like it.
          Irreverent but heavy, they drive on.

                         

          INT. OLIVER'S CHILDHOOD HOME

          Oliver and Georgia enter. She heads down the hallway to her

          INT. ANNA'S HOTEL

          Oliver remembers Anna on her hotel bed the night they met,
          messing up his hair, kissing for the first time.

          BACK TO PRESENT

                         

          INT. OLIVER'S BEDROOM

          Oliver feeling the most lost, can't help but look at Arthur
          who's staring him down.

                          ARTHUR SUBTITLE
           We knew it wouldn't work even
           before we met her.
          Oliver get's this more than ever. Something changes inside of
          him, he picks up his cel phone and dials.

          EXT. ELLIOTT'S HOUSE - DAY

          Oliver arrives with Arthur in a hurry.

                         

          EXT. ELLIOTT'S DOOR - DAY

          Oliver hands Arthur, a dog bed, and a bag of dog food to
          Elliott.

                          OLIVER
           Hey.

                          ELLIOTT
           Hey.

                          OLIVER

                          (TO ARTHUR)
           You're going to take care of
           Elliott. I'll be back in a couple
           of days.

                          (TO ELLIOT)
           Good luck.

                          ELLIOTT
           Alright.

                          OLIVER
           Okay? Thanks.
          Elliott closes the door. Oliver heads back to his car and
          Arthur's howling begins. It's an incredibly sad and desperate
          howl. Oliver gets to his car, the howling doesn't stop,
          Oliver can't ignore it. Oliver get's out of the car, heads
          back to house to get Arthur.

                         

          EXT. OLIVER'S CAR - DAY

          Oliver and Arthur drive up to a new house. Oliver looks at

          EXT. ANDY'S BACKYARD - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

          Oliver watches Andy cry as Arthur licks him all over.

                          ANDY
           He remembers me.
          It's true, Oliver's surprised.

           10/29/07 86.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

          Andy closes the door, Oliver walks the first ten feet, to his
          surprise, silence. He walks to the edge of the yard, silence.
          He tentatively gets into his car, silence. He drives away.

                         

          INT. TAXI CAB - NEW YORK - DAWN

          Oliver sees the Manhattan skyline as they cross the bridge
          into Manhattan.

                         

          EXT. 2ND AVENUE - CONTINUOUS

          Oliver passes a bodega with flowers - he pauses.

                         

          EXT. ANNA'S STREET - CONTINUOUS

          Oliver now with a bouquet of flowers in his hand, looking for
          the right number, finds her building. On his way to the door,
          he has doubts about the flowers, he decides to throw them
          away.
          Oliver rings her buzzer, no answers, a stranger leaves the
          building and he catches the door before it close, he enters.

                         

          INT. ANNA'S DOOR

          Oliver makes it to her door, he knocks, there's no answer. He
          pulls out his phone and calls her.

          INTERCUT BETWEEN THEM:

           ANNA (V.O.)
           Hey.

                          OLIVER
           Hey. Look I'm so sorry... But I'm,
           I'm at your front door. I'm in New
           York.
          Anna, still in bed, sits up and feels something.

           ANNA (V.O.)
           I'm in Los Angeles.
          Oliver's flabbergasted she's not behind the door.

           You, you're in LA?
          Anna laughs, but is touched.

                          OLIVER (CONT'D)
           You said you were coming here?!

                          ANNA
           Yeah, but I didn't leave.

                          OLIVER
           Fuck. I'm in your building.
          Anna laughs.

           ANNA (V.O.)
           Okay. See the window? Near the
           radiator?
          Oliver looks around and sees the radiator - goes to look.

                          ANNA
           There is a hide-a-key behind it.

                         

          INT. ANNA'S APARTMENT.

          The door opens, Oliver tentatively enters the empty room.
          The apartment is very spare, barely lived in. A lone couch,
          clothes on a rack, a few personal photos taped to the wall.

                          OLIVER
           Okay, I'm inside. Wow, there's like
           nothing here.

                          ANNA
           No.
          Oliver moves forward into the kitchen.

           ANNA (V.O.)
           This is my kitchen. It's where I
           eat.
          Oliver follows her tour, while she's not there, it's
          strangely intimate.

           ANNA (V.O.)
           This is my bathroom. It's very
           fancy.
          The bare, poor bathroom is not fancy.

           ANNA (V.O.)
           Outside my window...

          Oliver walks and looks out her window.

           ANNA (V.O.)
           ... That's my neighbor's roof. The
           room at the end is my bedroom...

                         

          INT. ANNA'S BEDROOM

          Oliver enters her bedroom.

           ANNA (V.O.)
           That's my closet. Those are my
           clothes and my pictures.
          There is a single rack holding up some clothes. Her pictures
          are taped to the wall. Oliver sits on her bed.

                          ANNA
           Why do you leave everyone? Why did
           you let me go?
          Oliver thinks for a moment.

          REPEAT MEMORY: Oliver watches his mother walk down the
          hallway, very alone, and enter her bedroom - it feels like
          some gesture of hopelessness.

          WE HEAR OLIVER'S ANSWER OVER THIS IMAGE:

           OLIVER (V.O.)
           Maybe because I, I don't really
           believe that it's gonna work. And
           then I make sure it doesn't work.

          Hal lies in the hospital bed set up in his living room.
          JUAN, a young handsome and probably gay hospice nurse is
          gently helping him take his morphine. Hal looks at Juan with
          love and affection. Oliver watches from the kitchen door.

                          HAL
           Isn't Juan's hair wonderful.

                          JUAN
           Thanks. I use this great mousse.

                          JUAN
           Do you wanna try some?
          Hal turns shy and young.

                          HAL
           Oh, no.

                          JUAN
           Just a little bit?

                          HAL
           I don't think so.

                          JUAN
           Come on. Just try a little bit.
           It'll be fun.

                          HAL

                          (LAUGHS)
           Yeah?

                          JUAN
           Yeah.

                          HAL
           How do you do it?

                          JUAN
           Okay, I'm going to show you how.
          Juan steps away and grabs his mousse, puts a little in his
          hand and sits back down on Hal's bed. He begins to spread
          it gently through wisps of Hal's white hair. Oliver watches
          Hal close his eyes, and deeply enjoy this simple affection
          and camaraderie with another gay man.

                          JUAN
           There.

                          HAL
           Is that it?
          Hal looks into camera which is Oliver's POV.

                          HAL
           How do I look?
          Oliver's filled with love, happiness, regret.

                          OLIVER
           What?

                          ANDY
           You never called or came to see me?
          Oliver falters, not know how to say it, then...

                          OLIVER
           No. No, it's because my father
           loved you so much.
          This hits Andy hard. Oliver turns to leave but can't. He
          turns back, goes to Andy and they hug.

                         

          INT. OLIVER'S BEDROOM

          Oliver and Arthur arrive, happy and relieved, Oliver jumps on
          his bed and Arthur follows.

                          OLIVER
           Arthur... hey. Hey, how've you
           been?

                         

          INT. OLIVER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

          Oliver opens the front door to Anna.

                          OLIVER
           Hey.
          She's a bit tentative, but she's here and happy.

                          ANNA
           Hey.

                          OLIVER
           Come in, come in.
          Arthur runs up and Anna bends down to greet him. They missed
          each other.
          Anna walks in and Oliver follows.

                          ANNA
           The living room.
          She heads to the dinning room.

                          ANNA
           Dining room...
          Oliver laughs nervously. In the dining room, Hal's old boxes
          are still stacked along the walls. Oliver leans forward and
          pulls something out of a box.
          She looks at a personal ad application, with the picture of
          Hal in the open jean jacket we saw at the beginning of the
          film.

                          ANNA
           Oh. Crazy picture...

                          OLIVER
           Yeah.

                          ANNA
           Can I read it?

                          OLIVER
           Sure.

                          ANNA
           I'm looking for sex with the hope
           it turns into friendship or a
           relationship. But I don't insist
           on monogamy.

          CUT TO PAST

                         

                         VARIOUS LOCATIONS
          We see REPEAT SHOTS of Hal, and in every shot he's looking at
          camera. Hal telling Oliver he's gay, Hal napping with Andy
          and waving at Oliver, Hal after Juan put in his hair mousse
          looking at Oliver, Hal showing Oliver his radiation tatoo...

           ANNA (V.O.)
           I'm an old senior guy, 78, but I'm
           attractive and horny. I'm an art
           historian, now retired.
          MORE REPEAT SHOTS: Hal with Andy at the L.A. Pride picnic,
          Hal playing with Arthur on his couch.

           ANNA (V.O.)
           And in addition to art, I like
           houses, gardens, parties, and
           walking with my Jack Russell.
           I'm 5'11", 160 pounds. I'm trim,
           gray hair, blue eyes, hairy cheest.

          CUT BACK TO THE PRESENT

                          ANNA

                          (LAUGHS)
           Chest? I like giving and, and
           what?
          Oliver finishes reading for her.

                          OLIVER
           I like giving and getting rubdowns
           and then going into mutual soft
           stuff.
          They both smile.

                          ANNA
           I have a nice house with food,
           drinks, friends and me. If you
           are willing to try an older guy,
           let's meet and see what happens.
          She looks at the photo again.

                          ANNA
           He didn't give up.
          They look at each other, more vulnerable and willing than
          we've seen them.

                         

          INT. OLIVER'S HALLWAY

          Anna walks down the hallway, Oliver follows her.

                         

          INT. OLIVER'S BEDROOM

          Anna and Oliver sit side by side on his bed.

                          OLIVER
           What happens now?

                          ANNA
           I don't know.

                          OLIVER
           How does that work?
          They look at each other, they smile.

		  "God is at the bottom of the sea and
		   I dive to find him."

						   Enzo Maiorca






FADE IN:

EXT.  GREEK ISLAND - SUNSET

CREDIT SEQUENCE:

The image is in black and white.

The sun disappears behind arid cliffs which cast giant
shadows on the sea.

A little boy around 8 years old -- tanned from head to toe
-- sprints along the cliffs, scrambles from one rock to
another with amazing agility.

In one hand, he carries a transparent plastic bag.  In the
other, a net bag containing flippers, mask, pants and
sweater.

The only thing that slows him down is his bathing suit --
obvious hand-me-downs -- way too big.  He tugs on them as
he goes, holding them up... Until they slide again... as
he leaps again... and pulls them up...

The little boy is JACQUES MAYOL.

End credits.


EXT.  GREEK ISLAND - SUNSET

JACQUES reaches a ledge jutting out over a deserted cove.

He spits in his mask... expertly spreads the spit with a
finger... locks his feet into the flippers... and dives.

He surfaces a long way out... adjusts his mask... and
swims away from shore.


IN OPEN SEA

The boy stops swimming -- starts to gulp air -- sucks it
in -- oxygenating his blood in a series of deep rapid
breaths -- almost hyperventilating, almost alarming if
we've never seen this before.

His gaze is glued to the ocean floor.  Clear clear water.
40 feet deep.  And intensely blue.

Suddenly, he catches his breath and dives -- into the
blue.


UNDERWATER

JACQUES touches bottom.  Clamps his legs around a rock to
hold himself down.  Unhurried, thoroughly at home, 40 feet
under... he opens the plastic bag.  A huge speckled moray
eel appears in a hole in the rock, slithers toward him.
The carnivore's jaws are bigger than the boy's head.

The boy smiles at him.  Pulls a piece of raw meat out of
his bag and holds it out.  The eel takes the morsel
delicately -- and slithers back into his hole.

Gravely, JACQUES takes another morsel out of the bag.


EXT.  VILLAGE - DUSK

JACQUES walks up a steep road bordering the port, almost
dry now.

Two boys about his age run up the streets; call out, catch
up with him and gesture toward the port.

					THE BOYS
		Jacques!  Come quick!


EXT.  PIER - DUSK

The little boys tug JACQUES to the end of the pier and
point to something in the water.

					BOYS
		Look!  Right there!  It's shining!

JACQUES walks over, and sure enough sees something shining
a few feet down in the water.

					JACQUES
			   (squinting)
		A coin.

					FIRST BOY
		I found it.

					SECOND BOY
		Liar!

Camera pans and we see a middle-aged PRIEST loading
supplies into a small boat.  He stops to watch the
children's negotiations.  Little JACQUES is putting his
flippers on.

					JACQUES
		Ok.  I'll get it, but no fighting,
		all right?

The two boys nod as they point to the coin.

					JACQUES
		We'll split it.

					FIRST BOY
		You can't split a coin.  That's
		stupid.

					SECOND BOY
		He's right.  You're stupid.

The pope smiles.

					JACQUES
		Then we'll buy something and split
		that.

					SECOND BOY
		A helicopter...

					JACQUES
		It's a small coin.

					FIRST BOY
		A Ferrari.

					SECOND BOY
		I don't want a Ferrari... What is
		it?

					JACQUES
			   (interrupting them)
		Maybe a little radio.

The two boys look at each other.

					JACQUES
		Well.  We'll decide later.  The light
		is going.

					SECOND BOY
		I get the radio from after school,
		until midnight.

					FIRST BOY
		Since when do you stay up until
		midnight?

					JACQUES
		All right, all right... Can I
		concentrate?  And you can stop
		pointing.  I've seen it.

					VOICE (O.S.)
		I've seen it too.

The voice is ENZO'S.  Another young boy wearing little
round glasses.

					FIRST BOY
			   (annoyed)
		Shit, it's the Italian!

He is slightly older than JACQUES but he is taller.  ENZO
is with ROBERTO, his younger brother, the only one allowed
to carry his flippers.  Five kids are behind him.

					ENZO
		Well, if it isn't the little
		Frenchman!  How is the little
		Frenchman?

					JACQUES
			   (cool)
		Fine!

ENZO pats JACQUES on the shoulder and leaves his hand
there -- a lightly intimidating gesture.

					ENZO
		You don't mind if I go instead, do
		you?

					JACQUES
			   (intimidated, and
			    pretending not to
			    be)
		No...

					ENZO
		If you did mind, you'd tell me,
		wouldn't you?

ENZO pats his shoulder reassuringly.

					ENZO
			   (to his brother)
		Roberto, mio palmo!

ROBERTO who has already started to moisten his big
brother's gear in the water, holds a pair of dripping
flippers and a glistening mask.  The pope watches the
scene with obvious pleasure.

					ENZO
			   (to his brother on
			    the edge of the
			    pier)
		Count!

Sure of himself, ENZO takes a deep breath and dives in the
water.  ROBERTO counts out loud.

					ROBERTO
		1... 2... 3...

The kids all walk over to the edge of the pier.  A few
feet away, JACQUES takes off his flippers.

					ROBERTO
		4... 5... 6...

ENZO bursts out of the water, the coin in his hand.  The
children cheer and clap.  ROBERTO rushes to catch the
equipment that comes flying at him, piece by piece.
ENZO walks over to JACQUES.

					ENZO
			   (showing him the
			    coin)
		Who's is it now?  You saw it but I
		dove for it!

JACQUES doesn't answer.

ENZO smiles and slowly puts the coin in his pocket.  He
pulls it out again and waves it under JACQUES' nose.

					ENZO
			   (without turning
			    around)
		Roberto?  How long?

					ROBERTO
		Six seconds.

ENZO looks at JACQUES for a while.

					ENZO
		I'll throw it back into the water.
		You dive and if you do less than
		six, it's yours.

JACQUES doesn't say anything, then finally shakes his
head, negatively.  ENZO smiles, taps him on the shoulder.

					ENZO
		Brava!

The first boy finally sums up his courage to speak.

					BOY
			   (timidly)
		Enzo?  I saw the coin first... We
		split?

					ENZO
			   (smiling)
		You can't split a coin, stupid.

ENZO laughing, sticks the coin in his pocket and leaves
the pier with his gang.

The pope smiles and pulls a coin from his pocket.

With his flippers dangling from one hand, JACQUES sadly
stares out at the sea.  The pope calls him over.

					PRIEST
		Jacques... Come, look.

JACQUES goes over to him, sees where he is pointing, the
faint gleam of the coin underwater.

					PRIEST
		Is it a coin shining down there?

					JACQUES
			   (overjoyed)
		It is.  It's a coin!  I'll get it
		for you, Father!

					PRIEST
		It'll be for the poor.

JACQUES, intent on the coin's glimmer, quickly slips on
his fins, prepares his mask.  He swims in the water like a
fish, goes directly to the coin.  Scoops it up, brings it
to the surface.

He breaks water, waves the coin, looks for the priest and
sees he is no longer there.

					JACQUES
		Padre?

He looks at the ancient impression on the coin -- "Boy on
a Dolphin".

								    DISSOLVE TO:

ON JACQUES - UNDERWATER

He's swimming near the spot where he fed the moray eel.
He senses something behind him and turns around.  He sees
a dolphin, still and silent, floating vertically.  It
seems to be watching him.  The surprise is such that
JACQUES is in a panic, leaps up to the surface...


ON JACQUES - IN BED

He bolts upright, as if suddenly awakening from a dream.


INT.  ROOM - ON JACQUES' FATHER - DARK

A BURLY MAN, around fifty, crosses the room in the shadows
and throws open the shutters with a bang.  Sunlight pours
in.  He walks over to JACQUES' bed in the one room house,
and runs his hand through his hair.

					FATHER
			   (with a smile)
		... Come on, time to get up,
		Jacques!

JACQUES rubs his eyes.  His father walks over to a pile of
blankets on the floor, on the other side of the room.  He
gives the pile a kick.

					FATHER
			   (screaming at the
			    top of his lungs)
		Louis, wake up!

He uncovers a kettle on the fire and ladles up a big bowl
of soup for Jacques.  A fifty year old man pokes his head
out from under the pile of blankets.  It's UNCLE LOUIS,
who is having a very hard time, waking up.


EXT.  HOUSE - DAY

JACQUES bursts out of the house, running.  Diving gear
under his arm.  A piece of buttered bread in his mouth.

He catches up with his father and UNCLE LOUIS.  They're on
a path winding down to the port.  JACQUES slows down
abruptly.  Tries to imitate their stride.  The weather is
balmy and the sea lies before them, peaceful and blue.


EXT.  SEA - DAY

Their boat on the water.  The chug of its ENGINE ECHOES
off the cliffs.  A few gulls -- drawn by the sound -- skim
the waves of its wake.


EXT.  BOAT - DAY

On board.  JACQUES' Father checks the antique air pump.
JACQUES polishes the enormous copper diver's helmet and
lays out the rest of an old fashioned deep sea diver's
suit.

At the foot of an old monastery another boat passes.
The Priest is in it.

JACQUES' Father and LOUIS take off their caps.  JACQUES
takes the gold coin out of his pocket.

The pope nods to JACQUES.  His father looks over at him
without understanding.  The child quickly puts the coin
back in his pocket.


EXT.  BOAT - DAY

LOUIS casts anchor.  A few feet away, siting on a rock,
the kid with little round glasses is fishing.  He turns
around to the boat.  JACQUES smiles and waves at him.
ENZO waves back, obviously disturbed in his fishing
session.

					FATHER
		Jacques, come help me.

JACQUES helps his father into the diver's suit.  The burly
man struggles into a pair of weighted lead shoes.  He
seems sluggish and tired.  JACQUES watches worriedly.  He
has a weird feeling.

					JACQUES
		You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.

					UNCLE LOUIS
		Then you shouldn't eat everyday,
		Jacques.

His father catches him fondly by the scruff of the neck.

					FATHER
			   (winks at him)
		Don't worry.  When I'm tired down
		there, the mermaids help me out.

Father and son smile at each other.  Then his father puts
the helmet on.  JACQUES joins LOUIS at the pump.

The heavy diver's suit disappears slowly underwater.  The
gleaming copper helmet is the last thing to slide out of
sight.

JACQUES and LOUIS work the pump.  Regular, steady motions
to maintain the flow of air.

					UNCLE LOUIS
			   (to Jacques)
		Hey!  Have you ever seen a mermaid?

					JACQUES
		No.

They keep on pumping for a while, then...

					UNCLE LOUIS
		I've seen them.

UNCLE LOUIS goes on.  JACQUES doesn't budge.

					UNCLE LOUIS
		Don't you want to know where?

JACQUES looks at the bottom to watch his father.
He doesn't answer.


UNDERWATER - JACQUES' FATHER

He moves along slowly in his cumbersome diving suit.  He
is working the top of a rock outcrop on the sea floor.  He
sees a sponge, hooks it; puts it in a bag that's attached
to a life line from the boat fastened to his waist.  He
moves on.


INT.  BOAT - JACQUES AND LOUIS PUMPING

They keep up the rhythm.  Sitting on a rock at a distance,
ENZO watches them.  UNCLE LOUIS is bored stiff.

					UNCLE LOUIS
		Why don't you ask me?

					JACQUES
		What?

					UNCLE LOUIS
		Where I saw the mermaids?!  Why
		don't you ever ask any question?
		I'm always the one asking the
		question!  We're sitting here like
		two stones and I'm taking to myself.
		Ask me something, Goddamnit!

JACQUES calmly looks over at him, slows down his pumping
and almost serenely asks him:

					JACQUES
			   (in a completely
			    flat tone)
		Why did my mother leave?

UNCLE LOUIS seems disturbed by the question.  A beat.

					UNCLE LOUIS
			   (ill at ease)
		Come on now, pump!


UNDERWATER - JACQUES' FATHER

He is walking with difficulty at the bottom.  His bag is
full of sponges.  He seems to be having trouble breathing.


EXT.  BOAT - JACQUES AND LOUIS

JACQUES and LOUIS are pumping silently.  UNCLE LOUIS feels
obliged to answer JACQUES' question.

UNCLE LOUIS finally breaks the silence and explains:

					UNCLE LOUIS
		Your mother didn't leave.  She went
		back to America, that's all.  It's
		her home.  She's allergic to this
		Island.  She likes refrigerators and
		machines that clean the floor... so
		one day she left.  Woman are like
		that, unpredictable, like the sea.

They haven't been paying attention to the bubbles gushing
at the surface.  The air hose is being pulled down in a
very worrisome way.

					JACQUES
			   (with a slight grin)
		So where did you see mermaids?

UNCLE LOUIS smiles.

					UNCLE LOUIS
		In the bars in Athens!

Very pleased with himself, UNCLE LOUIS burst out laughing.
JACQUES shyly shrugs his shoulders.  The air hose is
suddenly yanked down.  JACQUES immediately sees all the
bubbles.  He is white as a sheet.

JACQUES rushes to the side of the boat and starts yelling
down at his father.  He grabs the life line and starts
pulling at it hysterically.  The air hose snaps and
starts flying around like some crazy snake.  JACQUES tries
to jump overboard.  UNCLE LOUIS catches hold of his foot
at the last second.  JACQUES is slapping the water with
his hands, trying to go down but UNCLE LOUIS won't let
him.  JACQUES is yelling desperately.  ENZO is now
standing on his rock, watching the scene, horrified.

The sea now looks as if it were boiling.

UNCLE LOUIS grabs hold of JACQUES and hugs him in his
arms.  Standing on his rock, ENZO is now crying
desperately.

					ENZO
			   (screaming)
		Jacques!  Jacques!

The last air bubbles are now breaking on the surface; it
looks as if they will never stop.

								    DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  ITALIAN VILLAGE STREET - DAY

The image is now in color.

A rocky pink cliff over looks the very bright sea which
fills the screen.

SUPERIMPOSED:  1987 SICILY

ALFREDO runs (skips) up the cobbled street as fast as he
can go, surprisingly fast.

He runs to the large terrace of a restaurant which he
enters.  We have time to read the sign carrying the
restaurant's name:  "LA MAMMA".


INT.  RESTAURANT - DAY

ALFREDO skips in.  He is panting, covered in sweat.  His
panic is palpable.  The whole room watches him approach a
long table where a large family is having a birthday party
for a very old lady.

He has to stop a second and catch his breath before he can
get the words out.  Then leans over and whispers in the
ear of a great big man -- around 30 -- built like a bull,
wearing little round glasses.

The man listens, then stiffens.


EXT.  HARBOR - CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

A beat-up FIAT, towing an equally beat-up trailer, stops.

ENZO unfolds out of the driver's seat, like a circus clown
emerging from a toy car.

The construction SUPERVISOR, an American, wearing a three
piece suit, hurries over to him.

ENZO has already started undressing.  ROBERTO unloads the
diving gear from the trailer.

					SUPERVISOR
			   (exhausted)
		Signore Molinari?

					ROBERTO
			   (shaking his hand)
		Yes.

					ENZO
			   (calmly undressing,
			    expressionless)
		How did it happen?

					SUPERVISOR
			   (upset)
		The company asked me to extract
		everything I could from the wreck;
		so the divers were trying to get at
		the engine... and then the boat
		turned over... in the current...
		and... look, I fucked up!  Can you
		help?

					ENZO
		How many are, down there?

ENZO goes back to the car.

					SUPERVISOR
		Just one... We're feeding him air,
		but he's not breathing regularly...
		You've got to get him out fast.

ENZO glances at the map, then at the accident site.

					ENZO
			   (a beat)
		Ten thousand.

					SUPERVISOR
		Lira?

					ENZO
		Dollars.

					SUPERVISOR
		You're going to hold me up at a time
		like this?

					ROBERTO
		You do understand you're talking to
		the champion diver of the world?

					SUPERVISOR
		Yes, but ten thousand dollars...

ENZO opens the trunk of his FIAT and pulls out the jack.
He slams the trunk shut, and stands looking at the
American, straight in the eyes.

					ENZO
		Okay.  You tell me.  How much would
		you say the man's life is worth?

Extremely uncomfortable, the SUPERVISOR doesn't answer.

					ENZO
		In my village, we have a saying:
		when the wind blows, the flags of
		all nations flap in the same
		direction.

					SUPERVISOR
			   (baffled)
		What does that mean?

					ROBERTO
		That you should get your checkbook.
		Damn quick.


EXT.  UNFINISHED PIER - ENZO

He's at the end of the pier, his feet dangling in the
muddy water of the port.  A few feet away a pump sends air
HISSING through a rubber tube to the diver trapped below.

ENZO inhales steadily, his chest heaving like a bellow.
He carefully puts his spectacles inside his shoes, dons
his flippers, etc., with his usual flair of suspense.

Behind him the SUPERVISOR and other construction workers
watch expectantly.  ROBERTO heaves a stone weight into the
bay, a cable attached to it plays out from a drum on the
pier.

ENZO ignoring everyone, grabs the ordinary tire jack,
flip-flops over to the now taut cable, the stone has hit
bottom.  He takes a deep breath and dives into the bay.


UNDERWATER - WRECK

ENZO dives down a chimney of muck.  Picks his way over and
around every hazard, until he reaches the diver, trapped
under a huge piece of debris.

He pats his shoulder to comfort him, he then inserts the
tire jack under a piece of concrete... And, as if he were
changing a tire, begins to pump the handle...

Slowly, in a swirl of mud and water, the chunk of debris
rises off the diver's leg.


EXT.  CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

Everyone is staring at the water silently, suspensefully.
The SUPERVISOR has his checkbook in hand, but has
completely forgotten it, intent upon what's going on
underwater.  ROBERTO taps him on the shoulder.

					ROBERTO
		Since we have a little time, what do
		you say you write that check?


UNDERWATER - WRECK

ENZO cuts the cables tangled around the diver's torso.
Then he takes off his flippers, plants his bare feet on
the concrete, grabs the diver by the shoulders and pulls
him free.

The diver drops the air tube and climbs as quickly as
possible toward the surface.


EXT.  CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

The diver surfaces, gasping for breath.  A cheer goes up
from the crowd.  Several men hurry to pull him onto dry
land.  But there is no sign of ENZO.  Everyone waits,
breathless.

					ROBERTO
			   (to the Supervisor)
		Sign here.

Suddenly, ENZO appears, burst out of the water, holding
his flippers up in the air like a trophy.  The onlookers
cheer, help him out of the water, slapping him on the
back.

ENZO tosses the jack and his flippers to ROBERTO.
Impassive and silent, he slips his arms into the prize
fighter's robe that ROBERTO holds out for him, walks
solemnly back to his car.

ROBERTO takes the check and walks over to the car.  ENZO
bends down into the car and opens the roof.

					SUPERVISOR
			   (through the open
			    roof smiling)
		Thanks, thanks a lot.  I mean that
		too... You extortionist bastard!

The car rushes off.  In the distance we see a police
(carabinieri) car and an old fire engine rolling in the
direction of the construction site.


INSIDE FIAT - DRIVING AWAY

ENZO'S car drives past them.  ENZO looks at ROBERTO out of
the corner of his eye, then suddenly explodes with joy.

					ENZO
		Dollars, Roberto!  We took him for
		ten thousand dollars!

ROBERTO whoops and whistles.  ENZO reaches over and leans
on the horn.  The little car races by and finally stops at
the top of the cliff facing the sea.


EXT.  TOP OF CLIFF - DAY

The two brothers sit back, relax.

Stare out to sea.

					ROBERTO
			   (after a while)
		Enzo, what are you going to do with
		the money?

					ENZO
		Have the car painted.

					ROBERTO
		Santini will do that for 25 dollars!

					ENZO
		Then tell him to wax it too.

					ROBERTO
		Enzo, really.  What are you going to
		get?

					ENZO
			   (thinking)
		A rosary for Mama, a dress for
		Angelica, something with rhine-
		stones for what's her name, and get
		yourself a suit that fits... But
		most important...

					ROBERTO
		Yes?

					ENZO
		Find the Frenchman.  Find me Mayol.


EXT.  FLAKES OF SNOW - MOUNTAINS - DAY

Mountain peaks, stark and white.  A winter sky which is
strangely and disquietingly dark.  A landscape swept by
snow.

SUPERIMPOSED ON SCREEN: PERU - LAKE HUACRACOCHA - MAY 1987

A yellow light comes out of the storm -- advances toward
us.  The headlight of a train.

A narrow gauge locomotive steams up grade pushing piles of
snow in front of it.


INT.  TRAIN - DAY

Sitting in the train, leaning against the misty window,
JOHANA CROSS, 27, has clear quick charm and a sort of
romantic fragility.  She is dressed simply but warmly.
She looks through the window; all she sees is white.

It is clear that she was not the one who decided on this
trip.  Reading the key phrases from a beat-up note book,
she calls upon an old Peruvian.

					JOHANA
			   (in Spanish)
		Is this the Lago del Demonio?
		(Es bien aqui el Lago del Demonio)
		... Huacracocha?

The old man goes into a long, rambling explanation.
JOHANA nods without understanding a thing.

					JOHANA
		Gracias.

					OLD MAN
		You welcome.


EXT.  TRAIN STATION - DAY

The train pulls in, slowly pushing piles of snow in front
of it and finally stops in front of an old shack which
serves as the station.

A man, FRANK, bundled in a parka, comes out of a
snowmobile parked by the station, and walks up to the
train.

JOHANA steps down, carrying her suitcase and drops two
feet in the snow as she comes off the last step.  FRANK
walks over and leans down towards her.

					FRANK
			   (smiling)
		Welcome to Peru!


INT.  SNOWMOBILE - DAY

FRANK throws the luggage into the back of the snowmobile,
jumps in and turns the ignition on.  JOHANA takes her hat,
scarf and gloves off.  FRANK glances over at her, he is
both amused and charmed.

					JOHANA
		Don't you have a heater?

					FRANK
			   (hitting at the
			    dashboard)
		Yeah... Sure... Is this your first
		trip to Peru?

					JOHANA
		Does anybody live to make a second?

FRANK smiles and kicks the heating system, then leans over
to check it, his eyes off the road.

					JOHANA
			   (a little worried)
		Forget about the heater!


EXT.  LAKE OF THE DEMON - CAMP - DAY

The storm is at its peak.  The frozen snowmobile plows
along side the lake HUACRACOCHA and stops in front of a
cluster of quonset huts almost completely buried in snow.

FRANK gets the bags out of the back.  The suitcases are by
now frozen stiff.  JOHANA follows in his steps.

A couple of llamas are huddled up against the hut in
attempt to protect themselves from the storm.

JOHANA is bewildered.  Shacks in the middle of the Andes,
the lake of the "Demon", and now llama that have to be
pushed aside to enter one's home.

As FRANK opens the door, a man is leaving the hut.  The
man is JACQUES MAYOL.  JOHANA and JACQUES pass each other
in slow motion.  Everything seems suddenly suspended:
time, sound, cold...

JACQUES MAYOL instantly makes an impression on her.  He is
now 34, still dark-haired, with dark eyes.  He is wearing
a red diving suit and a pair of round goggles.  He looks
like some legendary creature one would dream about.

Everything finally regains its formal speed.  The door
slams, the man is gone.  She and FRANK are in the middle
of the entrance hall.  JOHANA hasn't yet gotten over the
vision she has just had, but she regains composure and
enters the next room.


INT.  QUONSET HUT

JOHANA happily takes her gloves off.

FRANK puts down the bags and walks into the next room.
It's a sort of laboratory, filled with ultra modern
equipment.

A big bay window overlooks the lake on which is built a
long wooden dock.

Sitting in a corner, an old Peruvian man is preparing hot
drinks.  JOHANA drops into a chair.

					FRANK
		A drink to warm up?

					JOHANA
		Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if
		possible.

					FRANK
			   (pulling out a flask)
		Tea... or whiskey?

					JOHANA
		... both.  Did I just see a man in a
		red suit and goggles?

FRANK smiles and pours some whiskey in her tea cup.

					FRANK
		... right.
			   (calling out)
		Dr. Lawrence?  The insurance man...
		uh... The insurance person is here!

					LAWRENCE
		It's about time!

FRANK smiles and pours JOHANA some tea.  She warms her
hands on the cup.  She asks blankly.

					JOHANA
		Would it be out of place to ask what
		he's doing?

					FRANK
		Who?

					JOHANA
		The guy in the Halloween suit!

LAWRENCE comes in from the other side of the room.

He walks straight over to the bay window.

					LAWRENCE
		Did you have a nice trip?  We were
		getting restless, it's been three
		weeks since the accident.

JOHANA walks over to the bay window and starts staring at
something in the distance.


EXT.  DOCK - ON JACQUES

At the end of the dock, JACQUES who is sitting on the edge
of a hole which is cut in the ice, is putting a pair of
gloves on.  He then grabs the handles of a strange machine
which emerges from the water and starts taking deep
breaths, oblivious to the cold, his mind completely
elsewhere.


BACK IN LAB

JOHANA watches JACQUES.  She just can't believe her eyes.
LAWRENCE is bent over one of his machines, fiddling with
different switches.

					LAWRENCE
			   (to Johana)
		You should get things moving, you
		know.  We're out of equipment and we
		can't do half of our experiments...!
		Frank, check the program!

JOHANA is finally able to speak.

					JOHANA
		Who... Who is that?

					LAWRENCE
		Mayol... Jacques Mayol.

					JOHANA
		That's the experiment?  Dumping a
		guy into a frozen lake?

LAWRENCE turns one last knob.

					LAWRENCE
		... The truck fell into a very deep
		crevasse.  We weren't able to save
		the equipment.

					JOHANA
		I'll have to talk to the driver.

					LAWRENCE
		In the spring when he melts!

JOHANA walks closer to the window.  She isn't hearing a
thing he's saying.

JACQUES is putting on his flippers.

JOHANA can't believe it.

JACQUES is standing by a hole cut in the ice.  He is
holding onto the machine in the water.  He is waving a
mask.

					JOHANA
			   (dumbfounded)
		You really send him under the ice?
		He isn't a slave or a convict or
		anything?

					LAWRENCE
		My dear, science is a cruel
		mistress.

					JOHANA
		But... how is he going to breathe?

					LAWRENCE
		He isn't going to breathe.

JACQUES takes a deep breath, turns a handle and a weight
yanks him straight down into the water.  LAWRENCE sets his
stop watch off and flips a few switches.

JOHANA grabs his arm as if they could do something about
it.

					LAWRENCE
		Listen...

He raises the volume:  we hear the man's heartbeat through
a small speaker.

					LAWRENCE
		That's his heartbeat.
			   (excited)
		Can you hear the speed at which it's
		slowing down, it's incredible.

LAWRENCE tears off the sheet with the heartbeat measures
on it and hands it to JOHANA.

JOHANA feels she's on the verge of crying, and can't
figure it out.


UNDERWATER - JACQUES

JACQUES stops his machine by turning one of the handles.
He's deep beneath the surface of the frozen lake.  He
swims deliberately, carefully into a large tube which is
hinged open.  He closes it around himself.  His heart is
still slowing down.  He pushes a button on the machine,
and a flash of light bursts in the opaque night
surrounding him.


BACK IN LAB - ON VIDEO SCREEN

We see a moving X-ray image.

					LAWRENCE
		He's in the fluoroscope now.  Listen
		to his heart.  Impressive, huh?  The
		flow of blood is concentrated in the
		brain and doesn't even feed the
		limbs anymore.  It's a phenomena that
		has only been observed with
		dolphins... until now.

					JOHANA
		How long can he stay down?  Without
		breathing?

					LAWRENCE
		It depends.  He should come up soon.
			   (smiling)
		Unless he's decided to stay for the
		night.

					JOHANA
		Why is he doing this?

					LAWRENCE
		For one thing, it's his job... as
		for the rest of it, I wish I knew.

JOHANA sighs with relief as JACQUES appears at the surface
in one big breath.

					JOHANA
		Shouldn't somebody take him a
		blanket or something?

					LAWRENCE
			   (smiling at Frank)
		Coffee might be nice.

She heads towards the Old Peruvian and pours a cup of
coffee...

					JOHANA
			   (afterthought)
		Will he understand Spanish?

					LAWRENCE
		His mother's an American.  He spent
		half of his life in the states.  I'd
		try English if I were you.


EXT.  DOCK - JACQUES SURFACING

He's groggy, half hypnotized.  He looks up at the dock,
sees JOHANA with a cup of coffee.  He stares at her.  She
hands him the coffee.

					JACQUES
			   (puzzled)
		I recognize you.

					JOHANA
		We saw each other a little while
		ago.

					JACQUES
			   (serious)
		In the lake?

					JOHANA
			   (wondering whether he
			    is joking or not)
		No... in the hut.

After a long beat...

					JACQUES
			   (with a beautiful
			    smile)
		Then it was somebody that looked a
		lot like you... Thank you.

JACQUES then turns around and walks toward the huts.

JOHANA still hasn't moved, as if petrified by her emotions
and the severe cold.  She then walks up to the hole in the
ice and peers into the dark water.  She shudders.


INT.  CABIN - DAWN

JOHANA emerges from a down sleeping bag.  She's wearing a
big sweater and a wool hat.  She is not sleeping.

Intrigued by the sound of the snowmobile, she gets up and
walks over to the frozen window.  JACQUES and FRANK are
loading their luggage onto the snowmobile.

Outside, LAWRENCE is saying "Goodbye" to JACQUES.  Unseen,
JOHANA also waves from behind her curtain.  JACQUES senses
something:  he turns around toward the cabin and smiles,
waving his hand at JOHANA.  She hides behind the curtain
and shyly waves back.

JACQUES gets into the snowmobile and drives out of the
frame.  We are left with an endless array of snow-caped
mountains.

								    DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  COTE D'AZUR - DAY

Fixed image of the Cote d'Azur.  The sparkling blue sea
fades into the distance.

A French taxi rides along the winding road overlooking the
creeks.


INT.  - TAXI

From behind all his bags, JACQUES obsessively stares at
the sea.

The driver smiles.

					DRIVER
		It's beautiful, isn't it?

JACQUES smiles.

					DRIVER
		We had some bad wind this week.  The
		"Mistral"!!  "Peuchere"!  There
		isn't one olive left on its tree.
		It suddenly left us this morning...
		I sure won't be the one to call it
		back.


EXT.  ANTIBES - ROAD TO MARINELAND

The taxi comes to a stop in front of Marineland.  JACQUES
gets out, carrying one of his bags.

					JACQUES
			   (to the driver)
		I'll only be five minutes.

He enters Marineland.


EXT.  MARINELAND - ON JACQUES

The park is closed, the paths are deserted.  JACQUES
approaches the Dolphin's tank.  All three dolphins rise up
in the water.  Greet him with a click and clatter of
tongues.  JACQUES sits down at the edge of the tank.

					JACQUES
		Good morning, everybody!  Did you
		sleep well?  I slept in a plane, and
		it wasn't too great.

He opens his duffel bag.  Hunts around, comes up with two
packages wrapped in brownpaper.  The dolphins stare at
him, intrigued.

					JACQUES
			   (calling out)
		Hey!  presents.

The dolphins CACKLE some more.

					JACQUES
		You think I'd forget you?

He laughs.  The driver, who seems to be quite familiar
with the place, walks in heading straight over to the soda
machine.  Out of the corner of his eye, he takes in the
scene, very intrigued.

JACQUES has not noticed him.

He starts unwrapping the first package.

					JACQUES
		For Bathsheba.

He produces a little ceramic Llama.

ON BATHSHEBA

looking at the llama, bewildered.  As bewildered as a
dolphin can be.  JACQUES turns the llama upside down.  It
moos:  HIAK, HIAK...

					JACQUES
		It's a Llama.  You understand?  From
		Peru.  It's fighting.

BATHSHEBA shakes her head.  JACQUES throws the llama into
the water.  He unwraps the second package.  A pair of
Peruvian gloves and hat.  Wide eyed, the driver sits in
the stands to watch the show.

					JACQUES
		That's for you, Darjeeling.  We
		wouldn't want you to catch cold!

He throws them to DARJEELING who catches them.

					JACQUES
		And now...
			   (singing out)
		"Ta, da..." For you Tina.

He pulls out a thermos.

					JACQUES
		Something you've never seen either.

He opens the thermos.

					JACQUES
		Snow!

He sprinkles snow flakes on TINA'S head.  She tries to
taste it.

					JACQUES
			   (smiling like a
			    child)
		A new experience, Tina.
			   (nostalgic)
		I missed you little rascals.  Did
		you get my post card?

The three dolphins leap into the air and land with a huge
splash which soaks JACQUES.  He takes his shirt off.

					JACQUES
			   (pretending to be
			    serious)
		Oh?  Is that what you want?
		Alright, but five minutes, no more.
		I have a taxi waiting.

He takes off his pants.  The taxi driver gets up, as if to
keep him from going in.  JACQUES dives into the pool.


UNDERWATER - ON JACQUES

He swims under the dolphin, reaches out and grabs hold of
the dolphin's snout.

The dolphin pulls JACQUES around and around the basin
while JACQUES pets his chest and belly.  We have never
seen JACQUES so relaxed and happy.

EXT.  MANHATTAN - DAWN

Overview of a gray and dirty Manhattan morning.  JOHANA
depressed, stares blankly out of the window of a yellow
cab.  She watches the muddy brown water flow under the
Brooklyn Bridge.

The driver keeps yelling obscenities to all the cars
around him.


EXT.  MANHATTAN - DAY

A suitcase in each hand, JOHANA gets out of the cab and
walks up the stairs of her apartment.


INT.  HALLWAY - DAY

JOHANA puts down her suitcase wearily.  Catches her breath
and gets out her keys.  She tries one in the top lock.  It
doesn't work.  She tries harder.  There's a woman's voice
yelling angrily from inside the apartment.

					SALLY (O.S.)
		I changed the lock you son of a
		bitch!

					JOHANA
		... Sally?

The door opens.

					SALLY
		You're back!  Hello.  We were
		burgled.

					JOHANA
		Again?

					SALLY
		They got the new T.V.

JOHANA comes in, looks at the ransacked apartment.

					SALLY
		... And the new stereo.

					JOHANA
		I hope they remembered to take the
		microwave this time?

					SALLY
		Yep.  How was your trip...?  Help me
		clean up, okay?

					JOHANA
		You called the police?

					SALLY
		They're going to send detectives.
		When they get around to it.

					JOHANA
			   (shrugging)
		So what, all they ever want is your
		phone number anyway.

JOHANA goes over, slumps into an easy chair and sighs.

After a beat...

					SALLY
		Well?

					JOHANA
		What?

					SALLY
		How was your trip?

					JOHANA
			   (flatly)
		Nice... Very interesting... Great!
			   (doubtfully)
		... I guess.

					SALLY
			   (ironically)
		Okay... Who'd you meet?

JOHANA opens her handbag, takes out the strip of
electrocardiogram paper, hands it to her.

					SALLY
		A cardiogram...?  You met a doctor!
		Congratulations, you're in the
		chips...
			   (an afterthought)
		Unless they have socialized medicine
		in Peru.  Do they?

					JOHANA
			   (indicating paper)
		It's his heartbeat.

					SALLY
		Oh Jesus...!  I'll make some coffee.
			   (starts toward
			    kitchen)
		They left the stove.

								    TIME DISSOLVE:

INT.  APARTMENT - LATER

The living room is almost completely put back together...
SALLY is replacing books in the bookcase, JOHANA is using
a carpet sweeper, and talking away.

					JOHANA
			   (nonstop)
		6'3", 6'1", maybe 5'9" -- You can't
		be sure, you know the flippers, they
		add height or they take it away, or
		something.  Anyway short dark hair...
		Not punk or anything, just short.
		And the cutest smile.  He wasn't
		smiling at me, I don't think -- just
		smiling.  And he thought he saw me in
		the lake.  I mean that was a figure
		of speech... They're so romantic,
		the French.

					SALLY
			   (bored, half asleep)
		I thought you said he was Peruvian?

					JOHANA
			   (annoyed)
		Haven't you been listening?

SALLY opens the drapes, revealing it's dawn outside.

					SALLY
		... Since eight o'clock last
		night...!  You're in love.

					JOHANA
		Don't be a jerk.
			   (emphatically)
		There's no such thing as love at
		first sight.

UNDERWATER - SWIMMING POOL

JACQUES is swimming alone at the bottom of a gigantic
swimming pool.  He wears a monofin, his head and chest are
wired up to an assistant who runs back and forth alongside
the pool.

A man's feet are seen walking over to the side of the
pool.

JACQUES is swimming laps, arching his body like a dolphin.

As he approaches one end of the pool, he sees a coin
slowly falling in front of him.  JACQUES picks it up and
looks at it:  it's an old Greek coin.

JACQUES smiles and swims to the surface.


EXT.  ON SIDE OF SWIMMING POOL - DAY

JACQUES pokes his head out of the water and pulls off his
goggles.

ENZO stands over him, smiling.

					ENZO
		Jacques, my friend, how are you?

					JACQUES
			   (happy)
		Enzo...

A beat.

					ENZO
		I leave you swimming and twenty
		years later, you're still in the
		water!  What the hell are you doing?
		Training?

					JACQUES
		Yes.

An uneasiness sweeps over ENZO'S face and quickly
disappears.

					ENZO
		That's good.
			   (smiling again)
		You never would have recognized me,
		huh?  Check out the suit!  Looking
		good, no?  You know I'm the world
		champion?

					JACQUES
		Yes, I know.

					ENZO
		I dove 315 feet!

					JACQUES
		Great!

					ENZO
		They say I'm like Lazarus.  You
		know, the guy who was raised from
		the dead?!

He laughs.  JACQUES smiles.  ENZO goes on.

					ENZO
			   (serious)
		Doesn't it surprise you that I just
		show up like this... Listen, the
		world championship starts in ten
		days in Taormina.  Be my guest.

ENZO puts down an airplane ticket on the side of the pool.

					ENZO
		Your ticket.

Surprised, JACQUES looks over at the ticket.

					JACQUES
		Why?

					ENZO
		Because I'm sure you're dying to
		beat me.

					JACQUES
			   (shaking his head)
		I don't want to be in any
		competition... I dive because I like
		to, not to beat a record... don't
		you have to be very mad at somebody
		to want to beat him?

					ENZO
		No.  All you need is to want to be
		the best.

					JACQUES
			   (smiles)
		You're the best, Enzo!

					ENZO
			   (with a tense grin
			    on his face)
		That's too easy!  Every time I beat
		a record there's always some
		dumbshit asking me:  "D'you know
		that French guy, Mayol?  He's
		supposed to be very good!  Too bad
		he doesn't compete." So, you're
		going to come with me to Taormina!
		First, because you're my friend and

EXT.  OFFICE BUILDING - NEW YORK - DAY


INT.  DUFFY'S OFFICE - DUFFY - JOHANA

She is seated across the desk from him.  He's reading
through her report.  Behind him, outside the large plate
glass window, window-washers are seated on a scaffold
suspended far above the city.  They eat lunch.

JOHANA'S eyes wander (bored) around the office as DUFFY
reads.  He looks up.

					DUFFY
			   (indicating report)
		This is good work... unfortunately
		it's incomplete.
			   (he glances at the
			    window)
		Could you eat a sandwich 40 floors
		above the street.

					JOHANA
			   (absently)
		What kind?

					DUFFY
		Johana, am I boring you?

					JOHANA
		Sorry.  Of course not, definitely
		not... well, maybe a little.  What
		did you say?

					DUFFY
		I said that the file is incomplete.
		See if you can get through to this
		Lawrence character and have him send
		the Peruvian registration for his
		missing truck... and don't let him
		tell you it was in the glove
		compartment.

					JOHANA
		Right Chief!

She starts out of the office.

					DUFFY
			   (to her back)
		Did the driver really freeze?

					JOHANA
		Like a popsicle.  They're keeping
		him on a stick until spring.

					DUFFY
		My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.

					JOHANA
			   (under her breath,
			    leaving)
		... So am I.

JOHANA sits at her desk, she too is yelling into the
telephone.  Her colleague looks over at her and smiles.

					JOHANA
			   (with a sigh)
		Okay, listen, just get the custom's
		office to send me a copy as fast as
		possible.  We can't send you new

INT.  QUONSET HUT - PERU - DAY

					LAWRENCE
		Okay, okay.  You'll have it by the

		Then, goodbye.

He is just about to hang up.

JOHANA jumps up.

					JOHANA
		Wait!  Professor...?

					LAWRENCE (V.O.)
		... Yes?

JOHANA starts snooping around the papers on her desk,
embarrassed by the presence of her colleague.

					JOHANA
			   (as softly as
			    possible)
		You don't know how I could reach

		I mean, we have a few questions to

JOHANA dashes in without knocking.

					JOHANA
		Listen, I just found out we've got

					DUFFY
			   (alarmed)
		What d'you mean?

					JOHANA
			   (improvising)
		The mafia!  La Cosa Nostra!
		Coppola!  De Niro...!  I knew it!  I

					DUFFY
			   (pale)
		What's happened??

					JOHANA
		The documents are forged.

					DUFFY
		No!

					JOHANA
		Yes!  The notary is a phony.  He has
		the same signature as the
		contractor!

					DUFFY
			   (outraged)
		It can't be true!

					JOHANA
			   (fast talking)
		We have to send somebody over there
		immediately!  If we prove the
		forgery we can cancel the policy.
		We'll be off the hook.  There's a
		flight to Rome in two hours and from
		there its just a short hop to
		Sicily.

					DUFFY
			   (reaching for phone)
		I'll send Cardoza, he'll be able
		to...

					JOHANA
			   (interrupting)
		I tried him, he can't go.  His son
		is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow...
		I'll go, boss.

					DUFFY
		I thought it was Spanish that you
		spoke?

					JOHANA
			   (after a beat)
		Italian is practically the same
		thing.


EXT.  PORT OF MESSINE - DAY

A ferry comes into the dock, as a plank is slowly lowered.

As it descends, four rail cars lie in wait in its belly.
JOHANA comes off the boat, carrying her suitcase, she
wears a light summer dress.  She looks around, seeming a
little lost.

A white FIAT taxi screeches to a halt beside her.  JOHANA
jumps.  The driver whose arm loosely dangles from the car
window, grins at her.

					DRIVER
		... Taxi?


EXT.  SAN DOMENICO - DAY

The white FIAT taxi pulls up in front of the SAN DOMENICO
hotel, but it is JACQUES who gets out of it.  The driver
helps him with his bags.

					RECEPTIONIST
			   (checking the books)
		Mayol... Mayol... No reservation.

					JACQUES
			   (uncomfortable)
		... Are you sure?

					RECEPTIONIST
		Positive, Sir.

JACQUES looks down at the piece of paper stapled to his
ticket.

					JACQUES
		This is the hotel San Domenico?

					RECEPTIONIST
		Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127
		years.

					JACQUES
			   (more and more
			    uncomfortable)
		Yes, but... So, you haven't got a
		room left?

					RECEPTIONIST
		No Sir, the hotel is full because of
		the Diving championship.

					JACQUES
		Ah?!

The Receptionist starts working on his papers again.
JACQUES, completely lost, stares blankly at the hotel
clerk, wondering what to do next.


INT.  HOTEL - DAY

The tiny FIAT clatters onto the sidewalk in front of the
hotel narrowly avoiding the Countess' limo.  Parks its
frontwheels on the sidewalk, rear end in the road.

ENZO, followed by ROBERTO, get out of his car, like a king
descending from his carriage.  On the way, he stops and
kisses a distinguished elderly woman's hand?  The hotel's
CONTESSA.

ENZO tosses his keys to a doorman who stepped up to
complain.

					ENZO
			   (to doorman)
		Be careful with that car, it's a new
		paint job.

ENZO enters the hotel and sees JACQUES.

					ENZO
			   (yelling across the
			    lobby)
		Giacomino!  My friend!  My brother!

ENZO and JACQUES.  The two men kiss each other on both
cheeks, pound each others back.  They are both moved.

					ENZO
			   (looking at him)
		So you finally decided to join us?
		You did the right thing!

					ENZO
			   (to the desk clerk)
		Hey Paolo!  Come stai?  Get my key!
			   (to Jacques,
			    gesturing over his
			    shoulder)
		You remember my little brother
		Roberto?

Roberto (26) nods to JACQUES who shakes his hand.

					JACQUES
		I remember.  Hi Roberto!

					ENZO
		What room have you got?

					JACQUES
		I don't have one.

					ENZO
		You don't have a room?
			   (at the top of his
			    lungs)
		Paolo?  What did I just hear?  I
		personally called you to reserve a
		room for my good friend Jacques
		Mayol and you treat him like a
		stranger?!

					JACQUES
			   (embarrassed)
		It's okay, Enzo.  I'll go somewhere
		else.

					ENZO
		Not only is Jacques Mayol a very
		special friend, but he happens to be
		one of the best divers in the world!
		And you're throwing him out!  Are
		you crazy, or what?  Stupido!

					JACQUES
			   (really embarrassed
			    now)
		Enzo drop it, I'll find something.

ENZO looks at him for a moment and gives him a warm smile.

He hands him his own keys.

					ENZO
		Take mine.  I'll take the Countess'
		suite.  She told me she was leaving
		for the cemetery... She'll be more
		comfortable there.

PAOLO half-heartedly, hands him the key.  ENZO glances at
JACQUES to make sure he's properly impressed.  He throws
his arm around JACQUES' shoulder, hugs him and gives him a
real smile.

					ENZO
			   (sincerely)
		I'm glad you're here.


EXT.  HOTEL TERRACE TAORMINA - JACQUES - ENZO - DAY

They're at a table on a terrace that overlooks the sea.
They've just arrived and all around them people are
lunching away furiously.

ENZO beckons to a passing WAITER who comes to the table.
He's a very handsome, slightly effeminate young man.

					ENZO
			   (to waiter)
		"Spaghetti del mare"
			   (to Jacques)
		It's delicious here.  It's the one
		thing they really know how to make.

					WAITER
		Del mare for two?

					JACQUES
			   (nodding quickly)
		Yes, sure, for two.

					ENZO
		And a bottle of "Frascatti".  Two
		bottles!

					WAITER
		Si Signore, grazie mille.

The waiter hurries away.  ENZO watches his departure, then
thoughtfully.

					ENZO
		He moves just like a woman.
			   (then, as if he were
			    speaking to Jacques)
		It must be hard to live in two
		worlds like that, huh?  To breathe
		in one, swim in the other...

JACQUES nods without really knowing.

					ENZO
			   (suddenly louder)
		Anyway!  Nothing beats a sexy broad!
		Huh, Jacques!

ENZO starts laughing.  JACQUES would like to crawl under
the table.

								 TIME DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  HOTEL TERRACE TAORMINA - JACQUES - ENZO - LATER

Their lunch is on the table, half eaten.

					ENZO
		... So, after all these years, you
		must have lots of questions to ask.
		Am I right?

					JACQUES
			   (quickly)
		Yes, of course.  Lots of questions.

JACQUES is satisfied with his answer.  He thinks that the
subject is closed.  They eat silently for a moment.  ENZO
watches him.  Then:

					ENZO
		Well, what are they?

					JACQUES
			   (giving up)
		I'm sorry... I don't know how to ask
		the questions.

ENZO bursts out laughing.

					ENZO
		Well, then.  I'll do the asking for
		you.  "Tell me dear Enzo, how did
		you become World Champion?"  Oh,
		that's a long story.
			   (his voice changes)
		Well, after you left Amorgos, I went
		back to Italy and joined the Navy.
		So you now have in front of you --
		Captain Molinari, who's been on
		leave of absence for the past 14
		years...

					JACQUES
		That's good.

					ENZO
		How do you make a living?  Your
		experiments, does it pay well?

					JACQUES
		It's okay.

					ENZO
		... You married?

JACQUES doesn't seem to have ever thought about marriage.

					JACQUES
		No.

					ENZO
		Me neither, 'cause of my Mother.
		She's a curse, my Mamma, a tornado.
		Stubborn as a mule!  I was
		engaged... for a week.  After that,
		Mamma was so mad, I tell you, pasta
		was bouncing off the walls.

JACQUES smiles.

					ENZO
		So, not married.  Well, good for
		you.  You play the field, like me.
		A girl in every port, huh?

					JACQUES
			   (bluffing)
		Exactly, I mean, after all, we're
		men!

					ENZO
			   (slapping the table
			    top)
		Damn right!  That's what I tell them
		when people say you've turned into a
		fish.

					JACQUES
			   (concerned)
		People say that?

					ENZO
			   (sorry he went too
			    far)
		Forget it.  I was joking.


EXT.  ENTRANCE TO TERRACE - ON JOHANA

JOHANA comes out of the stone tunnel which leads to the
terrace.  She looks over the crowd, trying to find
someone.

JACQUES is sitting with his back to her.  She finally
spots him and walks over to the table.

					ENZO
		Eh!  La Madonna!  This one is for
		me.  I'll bet you my watch that
		she's in my bed tonight.

JACQUES turns around and recognizes her.  JOHANA smiles
and walks up to the table.  ENZO takes his watch off and
puts it on the table.

					ENZO
			   (quickly)
		I tell you she's mine!

					JOHANA
			   (to Jacques)
		Hello!

					ENZO
			   (surprised)
		You know each other?

					JOHANA
		Yes.

					ENZO
		Enzo Molinari.

ENZO kisses her hand and brushes his watch off the table
in the same movement.

					ENZO
		This is a great pleasure.

					JOHANA
			   (laughing at the
			    protocol)
		Johana Cross, pleased to meet you.
			   (then to Jacques,
			    faking surprise)
		Well!  Isn't this a coincidence.  I
		really wasn't expecting this... All
		the way out here.  It's incredible!

					JACQUES
		Please, have a seat.

					JOHANA
		Thank you.  I wouldn't want to
		interrupt anything.

JOHANA sits down.

					JACQUES
		No, no!

					ENZO
		Not at all!

					JACQUES
		You're staying at the hotel?

					JOHANA
		I wish, but it's full.  They
		recommended a pension in town.  They
		say that all of Taormina is full.
		What's going on here?

					ENZO
		It's the Free Diving World
		Championship.  I am by the way world
		champion!

JOHANA has turned toward JACQUES, paying no attention to
ENZO.  JACQUES can't stop looking at JOHANA.

					JACQUES
		But what brought you to Sicily?

					JOHANA
		I was doing an insurance
		investigation in Palermo.
			   (to Enzo)
		I work for an insurance company.
			   (back to Jacques)
		So, I decided to take a few days
		off.
			   (uncomfortable)
		I don't know this island at all.  It
		really is gorgeous.

					ENZO
		There is no place in the world more
		beautiful than Sicily!

The waiter passes behind them.  ENZO reaches out, grabs
him by the arm, pulls him to the table.

					ENZO
			   (to waiter)
		A spaghetti del mare for the super
		dedicated traveling insurance
		agent.

					JOHANA
			   (smiling)
		I think I'll have a coffee.

					JACQUES
		No, no.  You'll like it.  It's
		superb.

					JOHANA
		... Okay.  I'll try.

ENZO pours the wine.

JOHANA shrugs fatalistically.  The waiter leaves.
JACQUES, intrigued, stares at JOHANA.  She pretends not to
notice.

					ENZO
			   (impatient)
		Where did you two meet?

					JOHANA
		In a lake.

					ENZO
		I might have known.
			   (to Johana)
		As I was telling you earlier, I'm
		the world champion free diver.

					JOHANA
		Congratulations.

					ENZO
		Some people say it's the most virile
		sport in the world.  One has to
		admit that when you see those men
		diving head first in that deep blue
		sea, all muscles contracted in one
		super human effort...

					JACQUES
			   (interrupting)
		Enzo?

					ENZO
			   (annoyed)
		What?

					JACQUES
		Your mother?

					ENZO
		Ahi, ahi, cazzo!  Ma mamia!
		Where...?  God, she'll kill me...
			   (pushing the plate
			    in front of Johana)
		... if she catches me eating pasta
		in a restaurant.

He quickly brushes off the crumbs in front of him.

ON ENZO'S MOTHER

heading toward them.  She's a huge woman in widow's black.
She shoulders her way through the tables.

ROBERTO carrying her suitcases follows at her heels.

ENZO jumps to his feet.  Throws his arms around her.

					ENZO
		... Mamma!

					MAMMA MOLINARI
			   (expressionless)
		You expect me to carry all the
		luggage myself?

					ENZO
		Mamma.  Roberto and an elevator...
		Isn't that enough?

A beat.  Signora MOLINARI inspects the plates on the
table.

					MAMMA MOLINARI
			   (suspiciously)
		What have you been eating?

					ENZO
		Coffee only, I'm diving tomorrow.
		You remember little Jacques, Jacques
		Mayol...

					JACQUES
			   (timidly)
		Madame...

					ENZO
		... And his friend, Johana...

Signora MOLINARI nods grudgingly.

					WAITER
			   (arriving proudly)
		Spaghetti del mare!

Dead silence.

ENZO is the only one with no plate in front of him.
Signora MOLINARI'S eyebrows condense into a dark stripe
across her forehead.

JOHANA hands ENZO'S plate to the WAITER and takes the full
one.

					JOHANA
			   (to waiter)
		Thank you.

And begins to eat, ignoring the expressions of amazement
all around her.

					MAMMA MOLINARI
		Americana?

JOHANA nods enthusiastically, her mouth too full to speak.

					MAMMA MOLINARI
			   (impressed, to
			    Johana)
		Benvenuto!

MAMMA MOLINARI has a huge grin on her face.


EXT.  TAORMINA STREET - JACQUES, JOHANA - TWILIGHT

They emerge onto the street in front of the entrance of a
small rooming house.

JACQUES is carrying JOHANA'S luggage.  The old pension is
covered in bright pink bougainvilliers, there is laundry
hanging on the other side of the street.

					JOHANA
		Thanks for helping with the bag.
			   (she looks up at the
			    pension with little
			    enthusiasm)
		It looks great!

					JACQUES
		I thought it was a nice place.
			   (suddenly doubting)
		Isn't it?

					JOHANA
		I'm being a pain in the ass.
			   (looking at him)
		It's beautiful here.

They look at each other.  JACQUES is silent.  He just
stands there, a suitcase in each hand.

JOHANA breaks the silence.

					JOHANA
		You're going to be very busy these
		days aren't you?

					JACQUES
		I don't know... why?

					JOHANA
		Just because... I would have liked
		to visit the town... See the
		coast... I don't know anybody...
		Expect for you.
			   (feeling she has
			    gone too far)
		But you are going to be very busy.
		You must have tons of things to
		prepare, interviews... And a
		competition like this one must
		require a great deal of
		concentration, right?

					JACQUES
			   (shakes his head
			    negatively)
		Yes... Maybe... I don't know.  I
		don't like competitions... It ruins
		the fun.  Don't you think?

					JOHANA
			   (with a faint smile)
		I guess... But you know... I'm
		American and I've mostly been taught
		to be competitive... There's always
		pleasure of being the best?

					JACQUES
		Maybe on earth there is one... but
		not when you dive... You see, to
		dive deep into the sea, for no
		reason... just to do it.  It's a
		feeling... I don't know how to say
		this... Voluptuous?

He looks up at her as he pronounces the last word.  She
smiles at him, lovingly.

					JOHANA
			   (laughing)
		You can put down the suitcases, you
		know.

He lets go of the suitcases.  Suddenly, behind them, there
is a loud screech of tires.  The FIAT tears across the
street.

ENZO in his FIAT.  He pokes his head out of the window.

					ENZO
		C'mon, you two... Jacques, we have
		to get ready for the ceremony
		tonight.  We have a new world
		champion.

					JACQUES
		I'm a little tired, I don't know
		if...

					ENZO
		Get in the car!


INT.  ENZO'S SUITE - ENZO, JACQUES, ROBERTO - NIGHT

They're in front of a wardrobe looking JACQUES over in the
full-length mirrors.  He's wearing an evening shirt and a
tuxedo of ENZO'S.  The collar is too big, the sleeves
hangover his hands.  He looks at himself dubiously in the
mirror.

					ENZO
		Roberto!  The bow-tie!

ROBERTO hands ENZO the bow-tie, he hooks it around
JACQUES' collar.

					ENZO
			   (taking a few steps
			    back)
		Very good.

JACQUES looks down at his tennis shoes.

					ROBERTO
		What about the shoes?

					ENZO
		Very chic.
			   (hesitates)
		Anyway, you don't have anything
		else, do you?

					JACQUES
		No.

					ENZO
		Then, it's very chic.  Avanti!


EXT.  RECEPTION ON TERRACE - NIGHT

A big reception is organized on the terrace of the hotel.
The official divers and technicians are all gathered in
front of a podium.  The terrace is loaded with
photographers.

ROBERTO keeps turning round and round the long buffet
table.

JACQUES is alone at the bar.  Incongruous detail:  a
whiskey bottle on the table beside him.

JOHANA enters.  She has also had a few drinks.

					JOHANA
		I thought you'd be at the dinner.

					JACQUES
		It's too loud for me.

He tugs at his over-sized tuxedo.

					JOHANA
		You look adorable.

					JACQUES
		Thank you...

					JOHANA
			   (smiling)
		... Especially the sneakers.

JACQUES looks down at his feet, doesn't know what to make
of her comment.  JOHANA sits down beside him and pours
herself a drink.  They touch glasses.


EXT.  ON PODIUM - NIGHT

On the podium, NOVELLI, the organizer of the championship,
stands in his tuxedo, talking into a microphone.  An older
man in a worn out suit, stands next to him.

					NOVELLI
		Ladies and Gentlemen, your
		attention, please.  Mr. Andre
		Bonnet, President of the
		International Diving Championship
		Committee, is going to present this
		trophy to the new world champion of
		free diving.  This afternoon, our
		new champion descended to the
		remarkable depth of 280 feet.

The audience applauds.

					NOVELLI
		This young man Tia...

NOVELLI can't quite read his notes.

					NOVELLI
		Tiraro... Tirao-re... Moa...

ANDRE BONNET takes his turn to read the note.  A young
Tahitian jumps up, heads for the podium.

					TAHITIAN
		Tiraero Moameora.

NOVELLI hesitates to repeat the name.

					NOVELLI
		... Let's all give him a big hand.

The audience cheers and applauds the new champion.  ENZO
sits at a table, watching the ceremony.

					ENZO
			   (very sarcastic)
		A one day hero!

He gets up and walks out of the room.


INT.  BAR - NIGHT

JACQUES and JOHANA are sitting at the bar.  The whiskeys
have gone to their heads.  ENZO walks over to them.

					ENZO
		A new world record!  That's great!
		It gives me something to beat
		tomorrow!
			   (to Johana)
		You ever been to Tahiti?

					JOHANA
		No.

					ENZO
		I'll take you there.  We'll live in
		the sun.  You'll cook fresh fish and
		we'll make love under the coconut
		trees.

JOHANA smiles and shakes her head.

					JOHANA
		You forgot the Hula!

					ENZO
		Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!

					JOHANA
		You'll be lovely, but no thanks.
			   (to Jacques)
		Jacques, would you do a native dance
		for me?

					JACQUES
		I don't know how... Excuse me.

JACQUES leaves the bar.  JOHANA watches him go.  ENZO
notices her way of watching him.  He's a little jealous.

					ENZO
		He looks strange, doesn't he?  Like
		a baby that just learned to walk.

					JOHANA
		Have you known him long?

					ENZO
		Forever.  We used to live on the
		same island in Greece, when we were
		kids.

					JOHANA
		What was he like, when he was little?

					ENZO
		Little.  Very little.  And skinny,
		very skinny too.  That is compared
		to me.

					JOHANA
			   (amused)
		I get it, Enzo you were a superior
		child.

					ENZO
		Exactly!  What is it Johana?  You're
		so crazy about him, you don't see
		the truth?!

She doesn't answer.

					ENZO
		Forget it, don't think of Jacques as
		a human being.  He's from another
		world.

She smiles.

					JOHANA
		And just where are you from?

					ENZO
		Italy!


EXT.  TERRACE OF THE HOTEL - NIGHT

ENZO sits at the grand piano in the corner of the terrace.
Beethoven was always a favorite of his.

JACQUES, very tipsy by now walks over, a glass in each
hand.  He hands ENZO a glass, then takes off his tennis
shoes and sits them neatly on the piano.

					ENZO
		There is nothing like music.  It
		speaks from the heart.  Can you tell
		me why we bother diving in the dark,
		the cold, without ever taking the
		time to breathe?  Huh?  Can you tell
		me why we do it?

JACQUES nods.

					ENZO
		Why?

					JACQUES
		... For the mermaids.

ENZO smiles, moved.

					ENZO
		My father used to see them
		everywhere too... but the only one
		he ever caught was my mother...
		Actually she caught him.

A beat.

					JACQUES
		Today at lunch, you asked me if I
		had any questions.

					ENZO
		Ah ha.  You finally want to know
		about women.

					JACQUES
		Why?  Are they what's most
		important?

					ENZO
		No... It depends... Sometimes they
		are... What, exactly do you want to
		know?

					JACQUES
		... Everything.

					ENZO
		Everything about what?

					JACQUES
			   (thinking)
		Well... about everything.

ENZO grins at JACQUES and starts playing again.

							TIME DISSOLVE TO LATER:

JACQUES AND ENZO

There are now several empty champagne bottles around.
They are both quite drunk.  ENZO is philosophizing.
JOHANA is looking for them.

					ENZO
		... So, between Mamma, Roberto and
		the sisters, we yell and scream all
		day long.  Except with Angelica.
		She just cries.  And then finally,
		we all end up kissing.  Can you
		explain that to me?

JACQUES can't answer.

					ENZO
		Because that's what love is all
		about.  It's a pain in the ass but
		keeps us together.
			   (then, in a half
			    dreaming, half
			    desperate tone)
		A large and beautiful family!

JOHANA walks over to them.

					JACQUES
			   (suddenly)
		Enzo... We must quit the
		competition.

ENZO hits a wrong note on the piano.

					ENZO
			   (worried)
		Why?

					JACQUES
		If we don't... I'm going to beat
		you.

JOHANA stands next to JACQUES.

					ENZO
			   (with a nervous
			    laugh)
		Huh?  Well listen to him!
			   (to Johana)
		Do you hear that?

					JOHANA
		No.

					ENZO
		He looks me in the eye like some
		fuckin' gold fish, and says:  "I'm
		going to beat you".

					JOHANA
			   (with a smile)
		... That's what he's here for, isn't
		he?

					ENZO
		Listen to her!  "That's what he's
		here for"!  He's here to loose,
		that's what he's here for.  First of
		all, I'm unbeatable.  Second, how
		old are you?

					JACQUES
		Two years younger than you.

					ENZO
		As I said, second of all you're too
		skinny.  You've got tiny lungs.  I
		still don't understand how you can
		dive without getting sick.

					JACQUES
		The size of the lungs has nothing to
		do with it!

					ENZO
		Look at me.  These aren't lungs.
		These are... Tanks.  How long can
		you hold your breath?

ENZO is getting really angry.  The drinks have a lot to do
with it.

					JACQUES
			   (impatiently)
		I don't know.  Longer than you.

ENZO pulls open his collar and rises.

					ENZO
		We'll see.


EXT.  HOTEL - SWIMMING POOL - UNDERWATER - NIGHT

JACQUES and ENZO dive into the pool in their Tuxedos.
Each one carries a beach umbrella in a concrete base to
help them stay at the bottom.

ENZO takes two goblets out of his pocket, hands them to
JACQUES.  Takes a bottle of Champagne out of the other
pocket and opens it.  The cork floats out of the bottle.

Above on the surface of the pool there's a splash.  JOHANA
finds a mask on the side of the pool and watches them.
Her dress is soaked by now.

ENZO pours champagne.  Courteous and grave, they clink
glasses and begin to drink.  They have already been
underwater longer than a minute.  They can't really drink
out of the glasses and ENZO offers JACQUES the bottle.
JACQUES studies the label like a connoisseur.  He drinks,
passes the bottle back to ENZO.


INT.  HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Paramedics roll two stretchers toward the elevators at
full speed.  ENZO on one, JACQUES on the other.  Both men
keep throwing up water.


INT.  JACQUES'S ROOM - NIGHT

The paramedics roll the stretcher toward the bed.
JOHANA very worried, follows them.

					JOHANA
		Take it easy...

					PARAMEDIC
		Don't worry, he's empty now.  He
		needs sleep, that's all.

The two men leave the room.

JOHANA walks over to the chair and rearranges JACQUES'
shirt and jacket which the paramedic had thrown down.
JACQUES looks like he's just had a very rough night.  He
sits up and grabs the sides of the bed, as if he were on a
moving boat.

					JACQUES
		Who won?

JOHANA turns around, furious.

					JOHANA
		Won what?  The Ass Hole Award?
		Well, let me tell you, it's a tie!

She walks over to the bed.

					JOHANA
		Acting like a pair of two year olds!
		You could have died in that damn
		pool!

					JACQUES
		Please move slowly, you're rocking
		the boat.

					JOHANA
			   (smiling)
		Lucky I was there to save you.

					JACQUES
			   (seeing her wet
			    dress)
		You jumped in?

					JOHANA
		Only to help the medics, I assure
		you.

					JACQUES
		My wallet.

JOHANA wet, walks over to the wet clothes on the chair.
She pulls out JACQUES soaking wallet from one of the
jacket pockets.

					JOHANA
		It's still here.

She tries to wipe it.

					JACQUES
		No.  I want to show you.  Is it
		ruined?

					JOHANA
		Well, water isn't exactly the best
		thing for pictures... Not even for
		pictures of dolphins...

					JACQUES
		Give it to me.

JOHANA hands him the photograph.  He stares at it, looking
very sad.  Worried JOHANA sits down next to him.

					JACQUES
			   (on the verge of
			    tears)
		My real family...
			   (he looks at the
			    picture and cries)
		What kind of man has such a family?

She takes the picture out of his hands.

He is so upset that JOHANA can hardly help from crying
with him.  She sits next to him and strokes his hair.

					JACQUES
		I'm sick of never feeling at home
		anywhere.

JOHANA takes him in her arms.  He breaks down.


EXT.  HOTEL - DAWN

The early morning sun slowly lights up the water.  A yacht
has left the hotel dock.  It is moving out to sea off the
coast of TAORMINA.


EXT.  YACHT - ON DECK

This is the Committee Boat for the diving competition.

On the boat, ROBERTO is worried.  He checks his watch and
finally decides to wake up his brother.  ENZO is asleep in
the fore peak, curled up on a coil of line, snoring away.
He wears his tuxedo jacket over a skimpy bathing suit.

					ROBERTO
		Enzo, wake up!

					ENZO
			   (pulled from his
			    dream)
		Eh?  Si!  Avanti!

He gets up on one arm.

					ROBERTO
		The medics are looking all over for
		you.

					ENZO
			   (irritated)
		I'm meditating, can't you see?
		Jacques does two hours of yoga
		before going down.  I can take a
		five minute nap, can't I?

The boat stops.  The anchor is thrown over board.

The sailors, technicians and officials are getting ready
for the competition.  Today is ENZO'S turn to dive.  A man
is hooking a plaque indicating the depth (324 feet) onto a
lead disk which he heaves into the water on a cable.


INT.  YACHT - DOCTOR'S CABIN - DAY

A medic is bending over ENZO, taking his blood pressure.

ROBERTO pulls the tuxedo jacket down.  The doctor puts a
blood pressure band around ENZO'S upper arm, pumps it up.
He listens with his stethoscope.

					DOCTOR
		Mr. Molinari, I'm terribly sorry but
		I cannot allow you to dive in such
		an advanced state of exhaustion.

ENZO jumps to his feet, grabs the doctor by his lapels,
lifts him in the air.

					ENZO
			   (outraged)
		What do you know about the sea?
		Huh?  Nothing!  So you just put your
		tubes and tin cans away.  The sea is
		mine!  I know when she is ready for
		me and when she isn't.  And today,
		she is ready.  Understand?

					DOCTOR
		You dive at your own risk.  You're
		been warned.

ENZO smiles and pats the doctor on the shoulder.

					ENZO
		Brave.


EXT.  YACHT - ON DIVING PLATFORM

It's a large float, rigged to the stern of the Committee
Boat.  ROBERTO and an assistant help ENZO down the swim
ladder to the platform.  He's wearing a wet suit and fins.
He flip-flops to the end of the platform.

ROBERTO hands him his mask.  The goggles are filled with
polystyrene to eliminate as much air pressure as possible.
Only two pinholes to see through.  The mask fits tightly
over his nose.  When ENZO puts it on, he looks like an
astonished insect.  ENZO breathes faster and faster.
ROBERTO holds the wire controlling the weighted diving
apparatus.  ENZO crosses himself, takes a last long gulp
of air.

ROBERTO releases the weight.  It sinks and drags ENZO
down, he quickly disappears into the dark water...


BLACK AND WHITE

But this is JACQUES as he was a child.  He swims along the
bottom, finds and picks up a gold coin.  We can see its
ancient markings, a youth on a dolphin.

JACQUES looks up.  In front of him is a dolphin, floating
vertically, still, apparently just watching.  JACQUES
isn't scared anymore.  But every time he swims toward the
dolphin, it moves further away.  It finally disappears.


INT.  HOTEL ROOM - JACQUES - DAY

He sits bolt upright in bed, awakened by his dream.  He
looks around the room, trying to get his bearings.

JOHANA is asleep in a chair across the room.  On the wall
behind her, her last nights dress is drying on a hanger.
She's wrapped up in a hotel bathrobe fast asleep.

JACQUES finally awake from his dream, sees JOHANA
sleeping.  He walks over to her, touches her shoulder.
She wakes up, starts out of the chair.  She grabs the
blanket to cover herself, and in doing so, a book falls on
the floor.  It's one of his.

					JOHANA
		You scared me!

JACQUES picks up the book.  JOHANA smiles.

					JOHANA
		Just checking up on your family.
			   (then embarrassed)
		I guess I was drunker than I thought
		and the idea of going back to my
		hotel in a wet dress... Well...

					JACQUES
		I'm glad you stayed.  Thank you.

					JOHANA
			   (getting up)
		I'd better get back now.

					JACQUES
		You... You wouldn't want to spend
		the day with me?

She sits back in her chair, amazed that he would even ask.

					JACQUES
			   (self conscious)
		... No?

					JOHANA
		No?  Huh?
			   (she says "No" as if
			    she had asked the
			    question)
		Yes, of course!!


EXT.  MARINELAND - TAORMINA - DAY

JACQUES and JOHANA enter the dolphinarium.  JOHANA is
wearing an old pair of JACQUES SHORTS along with an
oversized T-shirt and rolled up sweater.  She seems quite
pleased with her new attire.

JACQUES and JOHANA walk straight through MARINELAND and
head toward the dolphin pool.  It's pretty crowded, mostly
kids.

The dolphins are lying motionless at the bottom of the
pool.  The trainer is tired of throwing fish in the pool
and getting absolutely no reaction.

					JACQUES
		What's the matter?

					TRAINER
		I don't understand.  We've tried for
		two days.  They won't eat.  They
		won't perform.  It's since we got
		the new one.

CLOSE ON DOLPHIN

surfacing.  It thrusts its head over the edge of the pool,
looks to JACQUES and SPEAKS.

					JACQUES
		Is she the new one?

Surprised, the trainer nods.

JOHANA looks over at JACQUES then at the dolphin.  She
doesn't understand.

					JOHANA
		How can you tell it's a female?

					JACQUES
		... The way she moves.

Three other dolphins gather around the one that JACQUES is
patting.

JACQUES is staring at the female dolphin.  It looks like
the animal is trying to tell him something.  Suddenly the
dolphin grabs him by the sleeve and pulls him into the
pool.


UNDERWATER - DOLPHIN POOL

JACQUES hangs onto the dolphin's muzzle.  Let's it pull
him along.  The dolphin swims to a far corner of the pool,
and pulls JACQUES to the bottom.  The other dolphins
circle above.


EXT.  DOLPHIN POOL - DAY

JACQUES pops up.  As he does, three dolphins leap in the
air behind him.  JOHANA walks closer to the pool.  She is
so excited by what JACQUES is doing, she finally falls
into the pool.

After a while, JACQUES gets out of the pool and helps
JOHANA out.

					TRAINER
		Did you ever think of trying the
		public pool?

					JOHANA
		He's a dolphin specialist.

					TRAINER
		In that case what's wrong with the
		new one?  Is she sick or not.

					JACQUES
			   (taking his time to
			    answer)
		Not the way you mean.

					TRAINER
		What am I supposed to do?  Do I call
		the dealer...?  The investment, you
		understand... I certainly am
		entitled to complain!

					JACQUES
		It's going to cost you more than you
		think!

JACQUES turns around and walks off.  JOHANA catches up
with him.

					JACQUES
		She's not like the others.  She
		can't stand to be away from the sea.

					JOHANA
			   (impressed)
		How do you know that?

					JACQUES
			   (stopping)
		I don't know, I just feel it.


INT.  HALL - HOTEL - DAY

JACQUES and JOHANA are walking across the corridor.

ENZO walks up to them, followed by his tribe.  Everybody
is congratulating him.

ROBERTO is screaming, MAMMA MOLINARI is crying.  ENZO
smiles as he talks back to them.  He sees JACQUES.

					ENZO
			   (screaming)
		Ah!  Jacques!

ENZO grabs hold of his shoulders.  JACQUES and JOHANA are
completely soaked.

					ENZO
		Don't be sad, I only took back what
		was mine.

He gives JACQUES the diving plaque, it reads 280 feet.

					ENZO
		Here, it's a present.

JOHANA and JACQUES smile at each other.  JACQUES has won
his bet.

					JACQUES
			   (touched)
		... Thank you.

ENZO slaps him on the shoulder.

					ENZO
			   (to Johana)
		Tonight we're having a little party
		among ourselves.  8 o'clock in my
		suite?

					JOHANA
		Okay.

ENZO walks off then turns back toward them.  He whispers
in JACQUES' ear.

					ENZO
		Tell me... Can you explain why you
		are soaking wet?

A beat.

					JOHANA
		... We're in training.

ENZO walks off.


INT.  HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Three formally dressed officials are waiting in front of
one of the hotel rooms.  One of them holds a medal in his
hand, a glass of champagne in the other.

					NOVELLI
			   (through the door)
		Mr. Roberto, tell your brother to be
		reasonable.  Everyone is waiting for
		him upstairs.  The photographers are
		there, the press...

					ROBERTO (O.S.)
		He can't, he's indisposed.

					NOVELLI
			   (trying to keep his
			    calm)
		Shall we call a doctor?

					ROBERTO
		No, it's okay.  Mamma is going to
		try something.

JACQUES and JOHANA walk up from the other side of the hall
and stop in front of the same door.

					NOVELLI
		Mr. Mayol, help us.  He refuses to
		receive his medal and everybody is
		waiting for him up there.  We
		already have problems with the press
		because of the danger, and if we
		don't even have the divers help...!

					JACQUES
			   (dubious)
		... I'll do my best.

					NOVELLI
		That's very kind of you.

JACQUES knocks on the door.

					JACQUES
		It's Jacques... Mayol!

A beat.  Then ENZO opens the door himself.

					ENZO
		Jacques!  My friend!  Come on in!

The officials look at each other baffled.

					NOVELLI
		Mr. Enzo Molinari, allow me to
		impress upon you the importance of
		your attending the Award Ceremony...
		For the press...

					ENZO
			   (loosing his temper)
		I think my brother told you I was
		indisposed, that should do it, no?
		I'm allowed to be indisposed, right?
		So, you just tell the press that the
		"big" Enzo Molinari, overwhelmed by
		his inspiring descent to 324 feet,
		will not be able to receive this
		trinket because he is...

He looks inquisitively at the three men.  ENZO looses his
temper.

					ENZO
		Because he is?!

					ONE OF THE THREE MEN
		... Indisposed.

					ENZO
			   (smiling)
		Brave!

He slams the door in their face.


INT.  HOTEL - ENZO'S ROOM - NIGHT

					JACQUES
		Tell me, why don't you go and get
		your medal?

					ENZO
		Because pasta should be eaten "Al
		Dente".  So the trinket will just
		have to wait a bit.

ENZO takes JACQUES by the shoulder.  Inside his room is
absolute chaos:  dancing, singing, eating.  Wet suits hung
out to dry everywhere.  MAMMA MOLINARI is whipping up
mountains of spaghetti on an improvised stove in the
middle of the room.  A lot of smoke... steam... color...
noise... All of Italy crammed into a few square feet.

JOHANA taken in by the warm atmosphere, sits in a corner
of the room.  JACQUES walks over and sits down at her
side.

					ENZO
			   (to Mamma)
		Mamma!  La pasta?!

					MAMMA MOLINARI
		Arrivo!  Arrivo!

She points at ROBERTO who is taking forever to grate the
cheese.  ENZO grabs the guitar from his other brother's
hands and starts playing.

					ENZO
		... It's easy.  You go down.  You
		come up.
			   (to Johana)
		... Right, Johana?

					JOHANA
			   (smiling)
		Congratulations, Enzo.

					ENZO
		Don't you agree, Jacques?

					JACQUES
		... You always were the best.

ENZO laughs then sees his mother.

					ENZO
		Ah!  La pasta!

ENZO starts singing in Italian.  MAMMA MOLINARI serves the
pasta, ROBERTO follows her around, sprinkling his cheese
on the plates.  She serves JOHANA a huge plate of pasta,
enough for three giants.

					MAMMA MOLINARI
			   (with a smile)
		Buon appetito, Signorina!

JOHANA who isn't even hungry, grins uncertainly.  JACQUES
has walked up to ENZO.  He doesn't dare ask his question.

					ENZO
			   (smiling)
		What's the matter?  You still have a
		bunch of things to ask me?  You want
		to know the price of tea in China of
		how we landed on the moon?  Is that
		it?

ENZO laughs.  JACQUES is serious.

					JACQUES
		No, I have to ask you a favor...
			   (a beat)
		You're the only one who'll
		understand.

					ENZO
			   (seriously)
		... I'm listening.


INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT

					MAMMA MOLINARI
		Tutto va bene?

The three officials are eating pasta, plates on their
knees.  Their mouths are too full to speak, they nod
enthusiastically.

					NOVELLI
			   (mouth full)
		Gracie mille, chignora.

MAMMA MOLINARI smiles and slams the door.


INT.  FIAT - NIGHT

JACQUES is driving, JOHANA sits beside him.  ENZO crammed
in the back seat, very uncomfortably, because of a
stretcher which takes up all the space.

They are dressed as they were at ENZO'S party.

					ENZO
			   (leaning forward)
		Hey!  Will you slow down!  When did
		you learn how to drive?

					JACQUES
		Driving isn't the problem, it's
		remembering the right road.

JACQUES runs a red light.

					ENZO
		And the lights!  Running lights,
		stealing stretchers...!  You'll have
		us in jail.

					JOHANA
		Enzo, stop bitching, will you?


EXT.  MARINELAND PARKING LOT - FIAT - NIGHT

They get out of the car.  JACQUES starts to change into
his swimming trunks.  ENZO shakes his head, can't believe
he's really come along.  He laughs and starts undressing.


INT./ EXT.  FIAT - STREET TAORMINA - NIGHT

It's a very narrow street.  The car moves down it quickly.
JACQUES drives.  The back seat is now occupied by the
dolphin.  Its nose and tail protruding through the
windows.

JOHANA is in the front seat, turned around, spraying the
dolphin with a watering can.


EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

They have driven to the public beach.  They slowly lower
the stretcher into the water.  The dolphin, leaving the
stretcher, swims around a little but won't go away.

He won't leave JACQUES.

					JACQUES
			   (moved)
		You can't stay here!  Come on!  Go
		away!

JACQUES swims off with her for a while.

ENZO walks back toward the car with the stretcher.

JOHANA, standing by the water looks at JACQUES and the
dolphin who are swimming off together.

JACQUES keeps splashing the dolphin as they swim.

					ENZO
		You can stop that now, she has all
		the water she needs.

JACQUES cannot get rid of the dolphin.

					ENZO
		All right, we did it.  Let's go back
		to the party.

JACQUES and the dolphin can't seem to part.

					JACQUES
		Just one minute.

JOHANA is worried, she walks up to ENZO who goes back into
the water and takes JACQUES by the arm.

					ENZO
		Jacques, the dolphin is home now.
		And that's where we're going.  Come
		on!  Hurry up now.  Our girlfriend
		is freezing over there.

The dolphin starts swimming off.  JACQUES follows ENZO
half-heartedly.


EXT.  JOHANA'S PENSION - NIGHT

ENZO stops the FIAT in front of the pension.  The three of
them get out.  ENZO hasn't bothered to dress.

JOHANA heads for the gate, she obviously has no desire of
leaving JACQUES.

					JOHANA
		Well, good night, then...

					ENZO
		You going to sleep here, all by
		yourself?

					JOHANA
		Yes...

She looks over at the pension, having a hard time
concealing her lack of enthusiasm.

					JOHANA
		... It's a comfortable place.

					ENZO
		Sinister is what I'd call it...!
		Ours is so much cheerful!  Why don't
		you come and stay with me... There's
		plenty of room in my suite.

					JOHANA
			   (smiles)
		The Mamma's there too.

					ENZO
			   (face clouds up)
		Yes, the Mamma is is there.

					JOHANA
		Good night Enzo, Good night Jacques.

					JACQUES
		Good night.

					ENZO
			   (to Jacques)
		You don't need a stretcher to take
		her with you.  You know that, don't
		you?

					JACQUES
		What?

					ENZO
		The dolphins aren't the only ones
		who don't feel very good sometimes.

					JOHANA
		Leave it alone, Enzo, it's okay.

She rings the bell for the concierge, then looks back at
JACQUES.

					JOHANA
		Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?

					JACQUES
			   (lost)
		Uh... Yes, of course!

The concierge comes out and opens the iron gate for her.
JOHANA disappears into the parc.  ENZO turns to JACQUES.

					ENZO
		You really do have a few things to
		learn about women!


EXT.  SEA - DAY

The sun is rising on a rough sea.  The Committee Boat is
anchored in the open sea, 600 feet above the sea bed.


EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - BAY OF TAORMINA - DAY

JACQUES who is on the foredeck of a boat at sea has just
laid a towel down before him.  He's suited up, sitting in
the lotus position, staring straight ahead, clearly self-
hypnotized.

JOHANA, NOVELLI, and other officials are in the stern of
the boat watching last minute preparations.

The scuba divers in brightly colored wetsuits and
aqualungs, flop out onto the diving platform, plunge into
the water, disappear.

					JOHANA
		What are they for?

					NOVELLI
		They're paramedics.  They wait at
		180 feet.

					JOHANA
			   (just checking)
		If there was a problem, they could
		do something right?

					NOVELLI
		Of course, that's what they're for.

JOHANA sees scuba divers with weird air tanks.

					JOHANA
			   (pointing)
		... And those?

					NOVELLI
		Those are the divers who go down 300
		to 330 feet.  They dive with a
		Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that
		depth, compressed air is too
		dangerous because it contains carbon
		dioxide.

					JOHANA
		What's that little air bottle on the
		machine?

					NOVELLI
		That isn't for the divers actually.
		It's for the balloon.  It blows up
		and pulls the diver up like an
		elevator.  Without it, with the
		pressure at the bottom, the diver
		would just stay pinned to the sea
		bed.

					JOHANA
			   (shocked)
		But doesn't Jacques dive without
		anything?

					NOVELLI
			   (smiling)
		Yes... It's magic.


INT.  BOAT - DAY - LATER

On the boat, NOVELLI checks his watch.  JACQUES comes out
of his room.  He's dressed to dive.  He ignores everyone
as he goes down the ladder to the diving platform.  He
seems to be in another world.  All sounds coming to him
are drowned out.


EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - DAY

JACQUES sits in the diver's slot.  Opens his eyes slowly
and looks around.  He puts his flippers on, an assistant
stands at his side.

HIS POV

The figures on the platform are vague, the VOICES are
GARBLED and incomprehensible.  Moving almost in slow
motion he raises three fingers.

					TECHNICIAN
		Tre minuti!

BACK TO SCENE

Ten other divers have waited for this signal to dive.
They disappear one by one into the blue.

JACQUES uses contact lenses instead of a mask.  He puts
them in, and now, his view of the world is as distorted as
his hearing... bodies deform... sounds fade...

Already euphoric from the vast amount of oxygen in his
system, he moves into another reality altogether... seems
to empty himself out.

					TECHNICIAN
		Due minuti!

JACQUES fills a small tube with water.  Pours it into his
nostrils... tilts his head... then lets it run out... He
puts on his gloves... all his movements are slow, he seems
to be operating in a different time zone... He seems
unable to take his eyes off the water.


EXT.  END OF DIVING PLATFORM - DAY

					TECHNICIAN
		Uno minuto!

JACQUES puts his nose clip on.  He puts his hand on the
gueuse.  Closes his eyes and inhales slowly.  Then he
takes a sudden last breath, nods, the technician releases
the gueuse and in one flashing movement, he disappears.


UNDERWATER

The gueuse slides down the cable.  JACQUES hangs on like a
ribbon in the wind, past a marker, 90 feet down.

Above him, the boat disappears from sight.

He moves faster and faster... through a sea that looks
like a cloudy sky.  The light fades rapidly around him.

Below, white spotlights pierce an ocean dark as night.
JACQUES reaches them in a matter of seconds.  Turns the
brakes, brings his machine to a halt, 180 feet down.

The medics are waiting for him there.  They take his
pulse.  Check his eyes... 15 seconds... normal... the
bubbles from there scuba tanks churn the water around
them...

JACQUES closes his eyes... a tap on the shoulder, he
releases the brake on the gueuse.  Plunges further, this
time into pitch black.

Below him a faint spotlight glows on the bottom.  He
reaches it and the dark diver moves to him.  JACQUES
brakes his machine.  Moving very slowly, turns his body
right side up.  Like a sleep walker, JACQUES starts to
take the plaque off the plumbline... pauses in the middle
of the gesture.

The dark diver flashes the high sign to JACQUES, thumb and
forefinger touching, fingers extended, all clear.  JACQUES
does not respond.  The diver repeats the signal.  JACQUES
does not respond.

The diver taps JACQUES on the shoulder... a beat... and
then JACQUES responds, thumb and forefinger touching okay.
Slowly, reluctantly, he wraps his hand around the handle
of the balloon.

The dark diver quickly turns the handle for him.  The
balloon inflates.  JACQUES hangs on... lets it carry him
up.

At the plague marking 210 feet, JACQUES lets go of the the
balloon.  With a burst of speed, it darts toward the
surface.

JACQUES follows slowly, undulating like a fish... He's
getting warm now... He closes his eyes.

Passes the medical control without stopping... without
even seeing it like someone asleep.

He's moving faster now, toward the warmth, toward the air.
JACQUES opens his eyes, watches the lights grow brighter.

The silhouette of the boat comes back into view.  60 feet
to go.


EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - DAY

In slow motion JACQUES' hand holding the plaque breaks out
of the water followed by his arm, in one continuous
movement, his shoulders and head.

He gasps for air.

A trickle of blood comes from his nose.

Flashbulbs flicker, spectators cheer.


EXT.  OPEN SEA - A DOLPHIN

The dolphin, the one rescued last night, leaps into the
air, in perfect harmony with JACQUES' triumph.


EXT.  DOLPHINARIUM

The dolphins in the dolphinarium leap into the air at the
exact same moment.

The trainer doesn't understand what's going on.


EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - DAY

JACQUES falls back into the water.  Two divers run over
and pull him up onto the dock.

JACQUES seems completely dazed, almost in a trance.  He
slowly comes to and starts screaming louder and louder.
It is the scream of his body in need of the surface,
reality and the feel of the land.

JOHANA is terrified.  She can hardly breathe.  Everybody
applauds.


EXT.  HOTEL DOCK - DAY

JACQUES and JOHANA walk down the gangway.  NOVELLI has
lead the way and the news has been spread.

JACQUES looks very weak and punchy.

JOHANA holds him up.

The spectators applaud as he goes by.  Intrigued, JACQUES
looks at them all.

					JOHANA
			   (excited)
		Jacques, listen to the applause.

He doesn't respond.

					JOHANA
			   (trying to keep up)
		Jacques, you set a world record.

					JACQUES
		I did?

					JOHANA
		Aren't you happy?  Don't you feel
		proud...?  I feel proud and all I
		did was watch.

He is staring at her, he's returning to the real world.
Slowly he smiles.

She grabs hold of his arm and gives him a proud kiss on
the mouth.  JACQUES is a little stunned.


EXT.  TERRACE - SWIMMING POOL - DAY

ENZO walks into the hotel, his arms filled with packages.
He sees JACQUES and JOHANA.  From the look on his face we
can tell he knows that JACQUES has beaten his record.  He
deliberately puts on a huge smile as he walks over to
them.


INT.  TERRACE - SWIMMING POOL

					ENZO
		Congratulations Jacques!  It's
		wonderful!  Wonderful!

He drops his packages on the bar and gives Jacques a big
hug.

					ENZO
		I'm happy for you!

He kisses him and starts handing out his presents.

					ENZO
			   (to Jacques)
		Here...
			   (to Johana)
		Here...

					JACQUES
		What is it?

					ENZO
		Little presents, nothing much... I
		knew it, I just knew it!  Look here!

He holds up his arm:  he is wearing two watches.

					ENZO
		Roberto's watch!  I won it!  He bet
		that you couldn't beat me!

JACQUES opens his present.  It's a little ceramic dolphin.

					ENZO
		You still collect them?

					JACQUES
		Yes.

					ENZO
		You don't have that one, do you?

					JACQUES
		No.  Thank you.  It's really
		beautiful.

					ENZO
		Oh it's nothing.  I knew it.  I told
		Roberto "He's very good that little
		Frenchman, very good".  I lost my
		title but I won a watch!

JOHANA has opened her package.  It's a big plate with a
text engraved on it.

					JOHANA
		Is it a poem?

					ENZO
		No, it's the recipe for spaghetti
		"Frutti del mare".
			   (to Jacques)
		You see I was right in getting you
		out here.  You're a world champion,
		my friend!

JACQUES has opened the last small package.  It's a
measuring tape.  He looks at it without understanding.

ENZO explains:

					ENZO
		It's a measuring tape.

He grabs hold of the tape and lets it roll to the ground.

					ENZO
		You see this is your record, three
		feet more than mine!  Looking at it
		from here, it doesn't look like
		much, does it?

JACQUES looks at him without saying a word.

ENZO hands him the measuring tape.

					ENZO
		Keep your little measuring tape, my
		friend, it will be a nice souvenir
		when I beat you next.

ENZO taps his shoulder and smiles.


INT.  ELEVATOR ASCENDING - JACQUES - JOHANA

They're locked in a long kiss.  He untucks the bottom of
her shirt and slides his hands under it.


INT.  HOTEL ROOM - JACQUES - JOHANA - TWILIGHT

They're in bed, making love in their fashion.  Moonlight
shines in the silver sea.  In the background are the
lights of the bay of TAORMINA.

LATER

JACQUES is in bed with JOHANA.  They are both asleep.
Suddenly, he sits up, as he always does after his
recurrent dream.

He's wide awake, looks over at her sleeping.  She sleeps
peacefully like a baby.  Quietly, gently, he eases out of
bed and walks to the open window.

He stands on the balcony, staring at the sea.  Then in the
distance in the moonlight, a dolphin leaps out of the
water, once, twice, a third time.

JACQUES laughs and goes back to the bed where he sits down
next to JOHANA.  She is still sound asleep.


EXT.  HOTEL - PIER - NIGHT

JACQUES quickly gets into one of his diving suits.  He
puts on his flippers.  The dolphin is still jumping in and
out of the water.  JACQUES jumps off the pier and swims
over to her.


INT.  JACQUES' HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

JOHANA rolls over and feels the bed in her sleep.

JACQUES' absence wakes her.

					JOHANA
		Jacques?

She gets up and walks over to the balcony.  She doesn't
see anything.


EXT.  PIER - NIGHT

JOHANA walks down the pier and notices the little pile of
clothes JACQUES has left behind.  She looks around but
still can't see anything.  She decides to sit next to the
pile of clothes, and waits, her eyes riveted to the sea.


EXT.  PIER - DAWN

The sky has just begun to light up again.  JOHANA is still
sitting next to the pile of clothes.

She is wearing JACQUES' sweater.  She looks sad, yet
serene.  The look of a woman who has been thinking over
the situation and who has made up her mind.

Tired, JACQUES swims back to the pier.  It looks as if he
has come out of nowhere.

He is exhausted.  He takes off his flippers and gets up
onto the pier in front of JOHANA.  He looks at her, a
little surprised to find her there.

					JACQUES
			   (warm)
		What are you doing here?

She answers in a far away voice, with the same serene
sadness.

					JOHANA
		I'm going to leave, Jacques.

Dripping with water, he sits down next to her.  His face
is drawn from fatigue.  She continues.

					JOHANA
		I'm going back home.

					JACQUES
		Why?

					JOHANA
		Because one shouldn't fall in love
		with creatures from the sea.

					JACQUES
		I'm not from the sea... I don't
		understand what you're talking
		about.

					JOHANA
		Yes you do.  You know exactly what
		I'm talking about.  You're afraid I
		want to hold onto you, and I do,
		but you're not ready... at least not
		for me.

					JACQUES
		But it's not true, I feel good with
		you... It feels right...

She looks at him for a moment, then takes his face in her
hands and rests it on her bosom, as if a small child.

					JOHANA
		I've got to get back to the hotel...
		and get my suitcase packed.


INT.  TRAIN STATION - JACQUES - JOHANA - DAY

The train station faces the sea.  JACQUES and JOHANA are
standing on the platform, amid others.  In the distance we
hear the rumble and whistle of a train.

JOHANA gets on the train.  The station master blows his
whistle.

					JACQUES
		Will... will we see each other
		again?

JOHANA'S eyes are filled with tears.

					JOHANA
		Take good care of yourself, Jacques.

The train starts pulling out of the station.

					JACQUES
		Where can I call you?  Johana, tell
		me where can I call you?

JOHANA doesn't answer.  JACQUES stands helplessly in the
station, his eyes filled with tears.


INT.  ENZO'S ROOM - DAY

ENZO opens the door of his suite.  His hair is messed up,
he's got "sheet prints" on his face and is wearing the top
of a diving suit.

					JACQUES
		Can I come in?

					ENZO
		No problem, I enjoy talking in my
		sleep.

ENZO walks back into the apartment and crashes on the bed.
He's lying on his stomach.  JACQUES walks in and lets
himself drop in a chair.

					ENZO
		Wake me up at 11:00.

ENZO closes his eyes.  JACQUES looks over at the clock, it
says 11:25.  JACQUES doesn't say anything and stares
blankly out of the window.

					ENZO
			   (opening one eye)
		Hmmm!  Something wrong?

JACQUES doesn't answer.

					ENZO
		Is it the girl?

JACQUES stares out the window.

					ENZO
		Did she leave?

No answer.  ENZO gets up and sits on the side of the bed.

					ENZO
		Hey!  I'm going to take care of you!
		I've got this job, on an oil rig, no
		sweat!  I'm taking you along... Come
		on!  Get your bags packed!  You're
		coming with me, I tell you!

He pats him on the back.

					ENZO
		We'll make a great team, the two of
		us.  You'll see!


EXT.  OIL DRILLING PLATFORM - AT SEA - DAY

The platform shines in the morning light.

There are several stories of crew housing and offices
above the deck.  Long steel legs disappear into the
swelling slate-gray ocean.  We hear WHOP-WHOP-WHOP of a
helicopter.


EXT.  HELICOPTER - PLATFORM

The helicopter is landing.  Crewmen rush to secure it to
the oil rig's deck.  Doors open and two passengers get
off:  JACQUES and ENZO.  They each carry a duffel bag of
personal belongings.  They're both wearing fluorescent
diving suits.

The DRILLING SUPERINTENDENT comes to meet them.

					SUPERINTENDENT
		Mayol, Molinari...?

They nod.

					SUPERINTENDENT
		We've been waiting for you for three
		days.  Goddamnit!

					ENZO
		Is that the way you talk to the best
		diver in the world...?  And to his
		friend Jacques Mayol!

The SUPERINTENDENT smiles sourly, and gestures to a
crewman.

					SUPERINTENDENT
		Show them their quarters.

Five minutes later, JACQUES and ENZO are following the
crewman.

					JACQUES
			   (whispering)
		He doesn't like us.

					ENZO
		So what!?  His job is to hand out
		the paychecks.  And he does that
		very well, let me tell you.


INT.  DIVING CAPSULE - DAY

The diving capsule, suspended by cables, begins its
descent through a trap door in the deck.  It plunges into
the sea.

The three men in the capsule are:  JACQUES, ENZO and the
tough looking CAPSULE COMMANDER NOIREUTER, who is much too
professional for ENZO'S tastes.

ENZO watches through a porthole while the COMMANDER
concentrates on the control console.  He runs through a
checklist of systems.  JACQUES responds with a "check" as
he verifies each one.  ENZO is already bored and fed up by
the procedures.

JACQUES is lost in thought, they don't look cheerful.

					ENZO
			   (suddenly)
		You still thinking about her?

JACQUES doesn't answer.  ENZO goes on.

					ENZO
		Don't think about her anymore!  Let
		me tell you, you're just making
		yourself unhappy!  There are so many
		women in the world!

He takes a cigarette from a pouch in his diving suit and
stares at NOIREUTER.

					ENZO
		Plenty of women everywhere right?

					NOIREUTER
			   (coldly)
		Smoking is absolutely forbidden.

					ENZO
		It isn't lit yet.

					NOIREUTER
		You shouldn't even carry cigarettes
		on board!

					ENZO
		Listen we're not supposed to piss
		either but that doesn't stop you
		from carrying "it" on board?!

					NOIREUTER
			   (stubborn)
		The rules are the rules.

					ENZO
			   (checking out this
			    creature)
		... What's your name again?

					NOIREUTER
		Noireuter.

					ENZO
		And where did you say you were from?

					NOIREUTER
		I didn't say...
			   (contemptuous)
		Brussels!

ENZO smiles sardonically, shaking his head very slowly.
The COMMANDER'S answer explains it all.


INT.  DRILLING PLATFORM - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

A technician is overlooking the capsule descent on a
video screen.

The SUPERINTENDENT watches over the technician's shoulder.

					TECHNICIAN
		They're at 450 feet.


INT.  DIVING CAPSULE - DAY

ENZO, a cigarette dangling from his lips, looks through
the porthole.

					ENZO
		... I was seventeen, I loved her so
		much I tried to die for her.  Two
		years later I couldn't even remember
		her name!  Let me tell you, time
		erases everything!

					JACQUES
		I don't want to erase anything.

					ENZO
		You'd rather think about it and make
		yourself miserable?

					JACQUES
			   (after thinking about
			    it)
		... Yes.

					ENZO
			   (smiles)
		I give you this.  You're stubborn...
		Dumb, but stubborn.

					JACQUES
			   (taking it as a
			    compliment)
		Thank you.


INT.  CAPSULE - DAY

The technician fiddles with a few knobs.

					TECHNICIAN
		Minus 800 feet.  End of descent.


INT.  DIVING CAPSULE

The diving capsule ends its descent.  The COMMANDER turns
to ENZO and JACQUES who is still staring out the porthole.

					NOIREUTER
			   (with a Mickey Mouse
			    voice)
		You have enough air for 15 minutes.

ENZO bursts out laughing.

					ENZO
			   (with Donald Ducks
			    voice)
		What's with the voice?

					NOIREUTER
		It's nothing.  It's just the helium,
		because of the air pressure.

					ENZO
			   (worried)
		And... does the voice come back?

					NOIREUTER
		For others, yes... For you, who
		knows?

					ENZO
			   (still a little
			    worried, to Jacques)
		Try speaking to me?

					JACQUES
			   (with Daffy Ducks
			    voice)
		I don't find this funny.  We were
		having a serious conversation.

ENZO and JACQUES burst out laughing.  They keep these same
voice till the end of the scene.

ENZO pulls out a tiny silver flask out of his pocket.

					ENZO
			   (to Jacques)
		Here, give me your finger.

ENZO taps a drop onto JACQUES' finger, then on his own.
Then NOIREUTER blows up.

					NOIREUTER
			   (in a panic)
		Is that alcohol?  Are you out of
		your mind?  Alcohol is strictly
		forbidden.

					ENZO
			   (loosing his temper)
		Hey!  D'you have any other
		complaints?  Just make a list and
		we'll stick it on the porthole!
		Okay?

ENZO pours a second drop on his own finger.

					ENZO
		Go on, suck your finger.

JACQUES hesitates.  ENZO has no qualms about it and sucks
his own finger.  NOIREUTER is petrified.

					NOIREUTER
		Are you crazy?  At this pressure?

					JACQUES
		It's very deep down here.

					ENZO
		Come on, suck your finger, you'll be
		seeing mermaids everywhere!

JACQUES, convinced sucks his finger too.  ENZO smiles.
The alcohol has an immediate effect on them.

					ENZO
			   (to Jacques)
		A thousand commanders and we get a
		Belgian from Alcoholic's Anonymous.


UNDERWATER

ENZO gets out of the diving capsule, head first.
He is connected to the capsule by a number of cables.

JACQUES, who follows him, gets completely tangled up in
them.  They are both hilariously drunk.


INT.  DRILLING PLATFORM - CONTROL ROOM

The SUPERINTENDENT hears them laughing through the control
room speakers.  He flips a communication switch.

					SUPERINTENDENT
		Can you hear me?  What's going on?
			   (to the technician)
		Are you sure you're on the right
		channel?

The technician nods back to him.


UNDERWATER

The two divers have gotten to the spot they are supposed
to be working on.  They have their arms around each other
and are dancing.

NOIREUTER watches them through the porthole.  He shakes
his head in complete disbelief.


INT.  CONTROL ROOM

We hear the two friends humming the tune of a Viennese
waltz.

					SUPERINTENDENT
		If those guys are playing a radio
		down there they'd just better watch
		out!!


INT.  JOHANA'S APARTMENT

SALLY is talking away, pointing around the apartment.

					SALLY
		... And if we repaint the walls,
		we'll need new curtains, you put the
		painters on you Visa and I'll do the
		curtains on American Express... for
		the couch there's Bloomingdales...
		or are you still over your limit?

					JOHANA
			   (flatly)
		Way past it.

					SALLY
		Does that have a hidden meaning?

					JOHANA
		No.  I'm just depressed.

					SALLY
		You look it too.  You haven't been
		working out, you haven't been taking
		your vitamins!  You haven't been
		drinking your herbs, you haven't
		been...

					JOHANA
			   (stopping her)
		I know, I know!  I'm a terrible
		person...
			   (after a beat)
		It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.

					SALLY
		What is it honey... the frenchy?

					JOHANA
			   (tentatively)
		Do you think I should have stayed?
		Don't you think maybe I should have
		stayed?  I've been a jerk, right?
			   (then, emphatically)
		I should have stayed!  I was
		supposed to be in love... I was in
		love!  I am in love, why did I act
		like a bitch?  He went swimming.
		All the man did was go swimming!  I
		must be crazy.  It was too good to
		be true.

					SALLY
		Vitamins, exercise, herb tea... and
		see a doctor, will ya?


INT.  DOCTOR'S OFFICE - JOHANA - DAY

The doctor enters with a folder, speaks to JOHANA

					DOCTOR
		Well Miss Cross, herbs aren't going
		to do the trick this time.

					JOHANA
			   (worried)
		It's serious, right?

					DOCTOR
		I think so.  You're pregnant...
		Congratulations!  If that's in
		order?

JOHANA breaks into a wide grin.

					JOHANA
		It's in order!  Thank you.  Thank
		you.

					DOCTOR
		I don't think it's me you have to
		thank.


INT.  DUFFY'S OFFICE - DUFFY - DAY

DUFFY is at his desk.  His lunch is spread out in front of
him.  Outside the window, the window-washers are eating
their lunch too.  JOHANA hurries in.

					DUFFY
		Good afternoon.

					JOHANA
			   (agitated)
		I came to make a clean breast of
		everything... the whole business.

					DUFFY
			   (bluffing, with his
			    mouth full of
			    sandwich)
		Yes.  Of course.  Very wise.

					JOHANA
			   (in a rush)
		Remember when I went to Italy and
		canceled the policy on the new
		stadium.  Well, we weren't being
		cheated by the Mafia or anybody
		except maybe by me...
			   (she sees the window-
			    washers)
		... Do they come for lunch everyday?
		I really went on my own business, to
		see a man that I happen to be in
		love with... and I'm glad I did it,
		but I'm sorry about the policy and
		I'll be happy to make up the money
		the company didn't get... of course
		just now I don't have...
			   (she checks a note
			    she's holding)
		One million, four hundred and ten
		thousand dollars.  But if you were
		to dock my salary, say, twenty
		dollars a week, in a few hundred
		years we'd be even... and I think
		this is where you fire me?

					DUFFY
			   (swallowing sandwich)
		You're right.  You're fired.

					JOHANA
		Will that interfere with my getting
		maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.

					DUFFY
		The Italian, I presume?

					JOHANA
		No.  He's French, he was just in
		Italy for the competition.

					DUFFY
			   (smiling)
		He seems to have won it.

					JOHANA
		Yes, isn't it wonderful?  I'm so
		happy.  I'll bet I'm the happiest
		pregnant fired person in the world!

She starts to leave... calls out to the window-washers.

					JOHANA
		Bon appetit and Adieu!


INT.  JOHANA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

JOHANA stares out of the bay window of her Manhattan
apartment.  Hesitant, she walks around her telephone.
Finally she makes up her mind, picks up her address book
and dials the number.

					JACQUES (V.O.)
		Hello?

					JOHANA
		It's me... Johana.


INT.  JACQUES' APARTMENT

JACQUES is on the telephone, in front of a little window
overlooking the sea.  He is very glad to hear her voice.

					JACQUES
		How are you?


INT.  JOHANA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

					JOHANA
		I got fired.

					JACQUES (V.O.)
		... That's funny... I had this job
		with Enzo... we got fired too.

JOHANA'S face lights up with a huge smile.

								    DISSOLVE TO:

LATER

JOHANA is still on the phone, sitting in front of the bay
window.  Day is dawning.

					JOHANA
			   (looking out at the
			    skyline)
		It's getting light out.

					JACQUES (V.O.)
		Here, it's getting dark.

JOHANA smiles.  She stretches, lies down on the carpeted
floor.  JACQUES seems to have gone through all topics of
conversation.

					JACQUES
		I've been thinking about you a lot,
		you know...

JOHANA is by now completely stretched out on the floor.

					JOHANA
		So have I.
			   (a beat)
		... Hello?

					JACQUES
		I'm still here.

					JOHANA
		Well, then, talk to me some more.

					JACQUES
		... It's hard you know.  You're so
		far away and I don't know what else
		to say.

					JOHANA
		Then, tell me a story.

					JACQUES
		Uh... Ah!  A story?

He turns around and sits on the window sill, his feet
dangling in mid air.

He looks at the sea, seeking inspiration.

					JACQUES
		Do you know how it is?
			   (starting again)
		Do you know what you're supposed to
		do to meet a mermaid?

					JOHANA
			   (with a smile)
		No... tell me.

					JACQUES
		You go down to the bottom of the
		sea, where the water isn't even blue
		anymore, where the sky is only a
		memory... and you float there,
		quietly, quietly and stay there...
		and you decide that you will die for
		them... Only then do they start
		coming out.  They come and greet you
		and they judge the love you have for
		them... If it's sincere.  If it's
		pure... They will be with you and
		take you away forever.

JOHANA listens with the abandon of a child being put to
sleep.


INT.  JACQUES' ROOM - ANTIBES

The sun hits the roof tops.  The sea is sparkling.
The phone rings on the window sill.  JACQUES answers.

					JACQUES
		Hello?

					JOHANA (V.O.)
		It's me again.

JACQUES smiles.

					JOHANA
			   (after a silence)
		I'm being a pain, huh?

					JACQUES
		... Not at all.

					JOHANA (V.O.)
		You sure?

					JACQUES
			   (smiling)
		Absolutely positive.

					JOHANA (V.O.)
		Okay.  In that case... I'm at the
		airport in Nice.

JACQUES doesn't know what to say.  He looks around him,
can't figure out what to do.

					JACQUES
			   (lost)
		Okay... huh, I'll be right over.


INT.  AIRPORT - DAY

JOHANA is standing in front of the airport.

JACQUES sees her.  They smile shyly at each other.


EXT.  STREET - NICE - OPPOSITE THE NEGRESCO HOTEL

JACQUES and JOHANA are sitting in the back of a taxi.  The
driver stops in front of the hotel.

					DRIVER
			   (loud)
		The Carlton!  Enjoy your siesta.

JACQUES and JOHANA look at each other.


INT.  HOTEL ROOM - JACQUES - JOHANA - DAY

The room is in semi-darkness, despite the blazing sunlight
coming through cracks in the shutters.  JACQUES and JOHANA
are making love.  JACQUES is on top of her, his whole body
covered in sweat.  The rumpled sheets and the movements of
their bodies suggest the movements of the sea.  ALL SOUNDS
are disproportionate and slightly distorted, they are
underwater...

ALL JOHANA'S reluctance has vanished.  Both of them act
like people who have never felt anything like this before.
A certain astonishment at the depth of their feeling.  An
increasing freedom.  All the muscles of their bodies
stretch to their limits.

JACQUES, progressively, finds himself disappearing.  His
image dissolves point by point... disintegrates into
unbroken blue... The effect creates the impression of
someone melting, the screen is now totally blue.

A thin, HIGH-PITCHED SOUND.

From the bottom of the image, a tiny pinpoint starts
TOWARD the CAMERA.  It is JACQUES, naked, swimming out of
the deep blue ocean toward the light as if he were coming
out of a dive.  He comes CLOSER and CLOSER to the
CAMERA...

Until his head almost touches the lens...

A sudden DEAFENING NOISE... and we find JACQUES on top of
JOHANA.  He looks down at her, speechless.

					JOHANA
			   (a little frightened)
		Are you okay?

After a long beat.

					JACQUES
		... I think I love you.


INT.  APARTMENT BUILDING - ANTIBES - DAY

JACQUES and JOHANA step out of the elevator of a 19th
century building.

JACQUES is carrying her suitcases.

					JOHANA
		Why did you take me to the hotel, if
		you live here.

					JACQUES
		You'll understand.

JACQUES rings the door bell and sticks his key in the
door.

					JOHANA
			   (surprised)
		Someone in there?

JACQUES nods and pushes the door open with the bags he's
carrying.  They enter a huge, very old apartment filled
with models and paintings of boats.

JACQUES leads JOHANA to the other end of the apartment.


INT.  BATHROOM - ON UNCLE LOUIS (SORT OF)

It's a huge old-fashioned bathroom.  The centerpiece is a
deep ancient bathtub on faded gild feet.  There's a
rippling shadow of a body under the bath water.

JOHANA gasps.

					JACQUES
		Don't be afraid.  It's my Uncle...
		Louis.

He goes to the tub and pinches the end of a tube.  UNCLE
LOUIS, underwater, has been breathing through it.  LOUIS'
head pops out of the water, furious.

					UNCLE LOUIS
		Assassin!

					JACQUES
			   (loud, as if speaking
			    to a deaf man)
		Uncle Louis, this is my friend
		Johana.

					UNCLE LOUIS
		Did you buy the cassettes?  The
		Wagner, the Berlioz?

					JACQUES
		I brought Johana to meet you.

					UNCLE LOUIS
		Are you crazy?  I have no use for a
		woman!  Since my accident.

					JACQUES
		No, no.  Johana is visiting me.

					JOHANA
			   (tentatively)
		Bonjour Monsieur... Louis.
			   (she looks to
			    Jacques)

					JACQUES
			   (whispering to
			    Johana)
		Uncle Louis.  He's a 75 year old
		amazing guy, isn't he?

					JOHANA
		I'm very pleased to meet you, Uncle
		Louis.

					UNCLE LOUIS
			   (to Johana)
		Did you bring the cassettes, the
		Wagner, the Berlioz?
			   (pointing to Jacques)
		This idiot never listens to anything
		I say.  Sometimes I wonder if he
		isn't deaf.

LOUIS climbs out of the bathtub, and pulls on a bathrobe.
Behind him he's pulling two insulated wires out of the
bathtub.  We see that they're connected to small
underwater speakers.  As they surface, incredibly LOUD
MUSIC BLASTS:  the finale of the "1812 Overture",
(trumpets, timpani, cannons, etc...) The sound fills the
room, the apartment, and probably all of ANTIBES.


INT.  DINING ROOM - JACQUES - JOHANA - LOUIS - LATER

The three of them are at the table.  There are a few
scraps on their plates on a threadbare lace tablecloth.

Incredibly LOUD SYMPHONIC MUSIC is PLAYING.  LOUIS is as
deaf as a fence post.

Everyone has to scream over the music.

					UNCLE LOUIS
		Where are you from, Henrietta?

					JACQUES
			   (correcting him)
		Johana... New York.

					UNCLE LOUIS
		What kind of name is that?  To be
		named after a city?

					JACQUES
			   (smiling)
		He doesn't hear too well.

					JOHANA
			   (yelling)
		I said I was from New York.

					UNCLE LOUIS
			   (yelling at Jacques)
		That explains it!  The best lays are
		from New York!

					JACQUES
		Uncle Louis!

					UNCLE LOUIS
		No, no.  It's true.  When I was in
		New York, oh boy!
			   (to Johana)
		Before my accident, you understand?
			   (then back to
			    Jacques)

JACQUES stands up and lowers the music.

					JACQUES
			   (impatient)
		Uncle Louis!  Johana is my friend.
		She's come to stay with me for a
		while.

					UNCLE LOUIS
		Good.  That way I'll see more of
		you... Where are you going to stay?

					JACQUES
		Well... here.

					UNCLE LOUIS
			   (outraged)
		In my apartment?

					JACQUES
			   (with a sigh)
		It's my apartment.

					UNCLE LOUIS
			   (jumping up)
		Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you
		were an orphan I nursed you at my
		breast.

					JACQUES
		Uncle Louis, we have a guest!

					UNCLE LOUIS
		I'm going to put a lock on the
		telephone.
			   (them calming down,
			    to Johana)
		Did you bring the cassettes?


INT.  BEDROOM - JACQUES - JOHANA

JACQUES' room looks like a diving equipment storage room
with a bed in it.  JACQUES notices JOHANA'S gaze.

					JACQUES
			   (solicitously)
		You think it'll be all right?
		You'll be comfortable here?

					JOHANA
			   (catching her breath)
		It's going to be... interesting.


EXT.  PORT OF ANTIBES - DAY

JACQUES, JOHANA and ROBERTO are waiting at the port.

					ROBERTO
			   (glancing at his
			    watch)
		... It's not like him to be late.
		Of course sometimes he doesn't show
		up at all.  Once in Capri, he...

					JOHANA
			   (interrupting)
		We get the picture, Roberto.
			   (looks over her
			    shoulder)
		Jacques, I think Louis needs help.

JACQUES turns around.  UNCLE LOUIS is a few yards behind
them at a fish stand on the dock.  He's holding up an eel
and screaming at the fishmonger.

					UNCLE LOUIS
			   (yelling)
		Two dollars for this!  This fish
		wasn't caught.  It died of cancer!

JACQUES shrugs his shoulders and gives up on the idea of
interfering.

					ROBERTO
			   (pointing)
		Here he comes!

A speed boat races along the water.  It's a beautiful
highly-varnished mahogany Riva.  It races into the port.
Standing at the helm, looking like Christopher Columbus
his hair brushed back by the wind, is ENZO.

Next to him hanging on to the windscreen is an impressive
six foot, dark haired beauty.  She has a scarf over her
hair.  She wears a purple leather micro-mini with a cerise
halter top and her ruby fingernails are three inches long.
If she ever actually would get cast in a movie, she'd make
Raquel Welch hide in shame.  Her stage name is BONITA
MARIPOSA.

ENZO kills the THROTTLE, swings the speedboat into a
perfect landing at the dock.  ROBERTO takes the lines.

					ENZO
		Jacques!  Johana!

					JOHANA
		Enzo!

					JACQUES
		Enzo!

During all of this, everyone's attention is actually on
BONITA who is tugging at her long black hair.  They're all
awestruck except for ROBERTO.

					ROBERTO
			   (meaning the speed
			    boat)
		Where did you get that?

					ENZO
			   (meaning Bonita)
		"That"!  This is not a "that"...
		This is Bonita Mariposa, the famous
		Spanish actress.
			   (whispering to
			    Bonita)
		... Who is going to be careful with
		the varnish...
			   (back to Roberto)
		And who has come to spend a few days
		with us.
			   (and very quickly)
		Where's Mamma?

					ROBERTO
			   (checking watch)
		You have eight hours before she gets
		here.

ENZO glances at his watch and sighs with relief.  BONITA
says hello to JACQUES, kisses JOHANA.


INT.  LIVING ROOM IN JACQUES' APARTMENT - DAY

Loud classical music booms from the stereo.  The noise
pins JACQUES, ENZO and ROBERTO to their chairs.

UNCLE LOUIS gets a bottle of whiskey and serves everybody.

					ENZO
		He's really going totally deaf!

					UNCLE LOUIS
		I'm not as deaf as you are blind, my
		boy!  You take care of your eyes,
		I'll take care of my ears!

					ENZO
			   (laughing)
		I'm sorry Uncle Louis.

UNCLE LOUIS pours him a whiskey.

					UNCLE LOUIS
		Come on, drink up, my boy!  It might
		just save us from your bullshit.

The bottle is empty.  UNCLE LOUIS goes to the kitchen.
JACQUES turns down the music, and finally hears the bell
which has been ringing.  JACQUES opens the apartment door:
it's Professor LAWRENCE.  Suit and tie and carrying a
bottle.

					JACQUES
		I'm glad you could come.  I want you
		to meet Enzo.

ENZO and LAWRENCE shake hands.

					LAWRENCE
			   (with a smile)
		So you're the famous Enzo Molinari?

					ENZO
			   (with an even bigger
			    smile)
		In the flesh.  I have that honor!


INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

JOHANA comes into the bathroom, closes the door, cutting
down the blaring music.  The paint is peeling off the
ceiling.

BONITA is standing under a 40 watt lamp, putting on make-
up in front of JACQUES' cracked shaving mirror.

					BONITA
		You're going to live here
		permanently?

					JOHANA
		... Maybe, if Jacques will let me
		fix up the place a little.

JOHANA walks over to the mirror and watches BONITA put on
her make-up like a professional.

					BONITA
			   (wistfully)
		He's shy, not like Enzo.

					JOHANA
		Yes.  Not like Enzo.

					BONITA
			   (putting on
			    eyelashes)
		I think, he's really nice... He's a
		funny guy... sometimes even very
		moving.

					JOHANA
			   (after a long
			    silence)
		... I'm pregnant, Bonita!

BONITA stops working on her make-up and looks pensively at
JOHANA.

					BONITA
		Are you going to keep it?

					JOHANA
		Yes.

					BONITA
		Does he know?

					JOHANA
		No.

					BONITA
			   (thinking)
		Maybe you should talk to him about
		it.

					JOHANA
		I can't... I just don't know how
		to...

BONITA looks at her with the same pensive look.

JOHANA goes on.

					JOHANA
		I was thinking of something kinda
		stupid last night.  You know those
		women in the greek mythology that
		made love with the Gods.  Take Leda
		for example, sleeping with Jupiter,
		who came to earth as a swan... Well,
		can you imagine Leda announcing to
		her swan "You're going to be a
		father, my little chick-a-dee"?

					BONITA
			   (starts laughing)
		But your man isn't quite a God!

					JOHANA
			   (smiles)
		Probably not, but I still don't have
		the nerve to tell him.

					BONITA
		Well, you're going to have to tell
		him, sometime!

Unconvinced, JOHANA nods.  She changes the subject.

					JOHANA
		And you...?  Do you love Enzo?

					BONITA
			   (earnestly)
		Very much, I think.
			   (a beat)
		But, there's going to be a problem.


EXT.  TERRACE OF RESTAURANT - NIGHT

The "problem":  MAMMA MOLINARI sits between ENZO and
ROBERTO, looking like a malevolent storm cloud, staring
across at BONITA.

					ROBERTO
			   (desperately)
		Mamma, calimari fritti... Zuppa de
		pesci.  Sono buoni.

					MAMMA MOLINARI
			   (eyeing Bonita)
		Nothing.  I'm not hungry.

					ENZO
		Mamma, Bonita is an actress like
		Sophia Loren, Anna Magnani...

					BONITA
			   (icy)
		Sarah Bernardt.  I sing too... a
		hell of a Carmen.  Want to hear?

					MAMMA MOLINARI
			   (coldly)
		No thank you.

There's an interminable awkward silence.  Then UNCLE LOUIS
at last finds his way to the table.  JACQUES who is too
grateful for the interruption springs to his feet.

					JACQUES
		Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's
		mother Signora Molinari from
		Amorgos?

					UNCLE LOUIS
			   (screaming)
		The whale!  How could I forget?
		Always was something fishy about
		that woman!

MAMMA MOLINARI is having trouble breathing.

					UNCLE LOUIS
		What were Italians doing living in
		Greece anyway?

					JACQUES
		Louis, we were French!

					UNCLE LOUIS
		That's different!  What's the matter
		with you?

					ROBERTO
			   (complete panic)
		Mamma, pesce di spada?

All of them are gasping for air, trying so hard not to
laugh.

					UNCLE LOUIS
			   (to Mamma)
		Hey, whale!  Can you pass down the
		squids?

They all burst out laughing.


EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT AT SEA - DAY

The diving platform is out.  The competition has begun.
ENZO is at the gueuse, getting ready to dive.  ROBERTO
works around him busily.

BONITA on deck above him is making little gestures of
encouragement.  ENZO isn't amused.

Other competitors watch from the Committee Boat.

ENZO turns the handle on the gueuse, plunges into the
water.

Professor LAWRENCE, taking notes, stands a few feet away.


UNDERWATER - ON ENZO

He dives down, further and further down.  He approaches
the two medics in aqualungs at the control point (210
feet).

They move toward him.


EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - ENZO

Surfacing.  Assistants help him onto the platform.
ROBERTO pulls off his fins.  ENZO rips off his mask.  He
looks furious.  He tosses the depth plaque (which proves
he is qualified) back into the water.

					ENZO
		A shit dive.

He looks around angrily for an official.  Sees NOVELLI.

					ENZO
		Those goddamned frogmen doctors
		waiting around at 200 feet they just
		kill your concentration.

					NOVELLI
		They're required by law.

					ENZO
			   (climbing off
			    platform)
		There's no law down there!  The only
		law is what your lungs can take.
			   (to the next diver)
		... Have fun!  They waiting for you
		down there, to take the temperature
		of your ass.

He keeps on walking across the boat, runs into JACQUES,
who's just about to begin his yoga preparation.

JACQUES sees ENZO'S expression, looks concerned.

					ENZO
			   (defensively)
		Anybody can have a bad day!

					JACQUES
		I've had many... when the sea
		doesn't want you.

					ENZO
			   (disgusted)
		It's never the sea!  It's Roberto,
		Mamma, that stupid actress... Oh
		shit!  Jacques, what do you know?
		Go do your Hindu exercises and don't
		break my balls!

ENZO stamps into one of the cabins.


INT.  JACQUES' APARTMENT - NIGHT

JOHANA is reading a child birth catalog.  She throws it
away upside down, as soon as she hears JACQUES
approaching.  JACQUES comes in and sits opposite her.  He
seems bitter.

					JOHANA
		Well, how was it?

In an involuntary gesture, JACQUES flips through the
catalog.

					JACQUES
			   (sadly)
		Enzo had a bad day.

JOHANA wonders if JACQUES will understand the presence of
the baby magazine.

					JOHANA
			   (tense)
		And you?

					JACQUES
		I didn't dive.

					JOHANA
			   (she takes the
			    magazine)
		You'll try again tomorrow?

					JACQUES
		I don't know... it didn't feel
		right.  I'm going to bed.  I'm tired.

He goes away.

					JOHANA
		You forgot your magazine!

He hasn't heard.

JACQUES goes to the bedroom, and throws himself on the
bed.

JOHANA looks as if she had wished he'd put two and two
together.

					JACQUES
		What?

					JOHANA
		... Nothing.

								    DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT AT SEA - DAY

ENZO bursts out of the water.  He rips off his face mask,
throws it on the diving platform, roaring with pleasure.
He tosses the depth plague to ROBERTO.

					ENZO
		Let them try.


INT.  JACQUES' APARTMENT - DAY

JOHANA opens the apartment door.  BONITA is standing
there, a suitcase in one hand.

					BONITA
		I wanted to say goodbye, Johana.

They kiss each other goodbye.

JOHANA is very uncomfortable.

					JOHANA
		You're leaving?

					BONITA
		Yes...
			   (she hands her a
			    note)
		Could you please give this to Enzo.

					JOHANA
		Of course.

BONITA grabs the note back and tears it up.

					BONITA
		It's no use... Just tell him I said
		goodbye... And give him a kiss for
		me, Okay?

The two women hug again.

					JOHANA
			   (sorry)
		Bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged
		so easily.

					BONITA
		I don't have the strength to fight
		off la Mamma... Anyway who wants to
		spend their whole life waiting at
		the end of a pier.

BONITA rests her hand on JOHANA'S stomach.

					BONITA
		Did you tell him?

					JOHANA
		Not yet... I'm waiting for the right
		moment.

					BONITA
		... You take care of yourself,
		Johana.

BONITA smiles at her and disappears down the stairs.


EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - DOCKING - DAY

Officials, NOVELLI, LAWRENCE, ROBERTO and of course ENZO
disembark.  There is a lot of excitement on the dock.
Everyone has already heard the news.
People swarm around ENZO.

LAWRENCE spots JACQUES in the crowd, and goes to him.

					JACQUES
			   (smiling)
		Good huh?

					LAWRENCE
		He really was unbelievable, 328
		feet, deeper than the world
		record...
			   (then eagerly)
		... And, Jacques!  He held his
		breath for four minutes and fifty
		seconds!

					JACQUES
			   (smiles too)
		Good... I guess I have tomorrow's
		work cut out for me as Enzo would
		say...

					LAWRENCE
			   (seriously)
		You must be very careful, Jacques.
		At these depths, to hold your breath
		for over five minutes is... You'd
		really be pushing it.  I think it's
		very, very dangerous.

JACQUES sees ENZO being carried past on the shoulders of
the crowd.  He ignores LAWRENCE, runs beside ENZO.

					JACQUES
			   (yelling)
		Enzo, Enzo!  Congratulations!


EXT.  AWARD CEREMONY - NIGHT

					ENZO
			   (in answer to the
			    crowd's applause)
		Thank you, thank you very much!

ENZO and NOVELLI stand on a little stage facing the crowd.
ENZO is holding a gold trophy, waving to friends in the
audience.

					NOVELLI
		... Now I'm sure you've heard that
		some people have suggested it is too
		dangerous for us to continue.
		Dangerous, because we don't know how
		to measure the physiological
		consequences of this type of dive
		and also because the scuba divers
		are not used to going down below 300
		feet.

While the attentive crowd listens to NOVELLI, ENZO is
gesturing to ROBERTO, explaining what appetizers he wants
from the cocktail trays.

The crowd laughs.

					NOVELLI
		But, we polled the free divers and
		they insist that the competition
		continue!

There's wild applause.  ENZO lifts the trophy over his
head, smiles like a champ and yells into the microphone.

					ENZO
			   (yelling)
		Good luck to you all!


EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - DAY

ENZO and ROBERTO are on the front deck watching the
divers.

A German diver comes up to the surface, empty handed.
ENZO smiles.

The Tahitian comes out of the water in a semi-coma.  The
doctors carry him away.  Once he's sure that the diver is
out of danger, ENZO smiles again.

A whole team of Japanese walk over to the diving platform.
The team consists of one diver and six assistants, three
of them playing music to help the diver concentrate.  The
diver wears a white wet suit with a red circle on his
forehead.  He is concentrating very hard, so much that
ENZO walks over to him to make sure he's okay.  The
Japanese diver concentrates with such strength that he
faints.

					ENZO
			   (smiling to his
			    brother)
		Fabulous, what a dive, huh?

ROBERTO smiles.

The diver from the Philippines stands at the end of the
diving platform.  He concentrates for a moment then gives
up and walks away.

					ENZO
		He's right.  What's the point of
		knocking yourself out?


INT.  BEDROOM - JACQUES - JOHANA - NIGHT

They're in bed, side by side, both of them half asleep.
The only light in the room comes from the open windows.
He rolls over and watches her sleep, looking down at her
adoringly.  He slips off the chain with the gold coin.
Slowly, holding the chain, he runs the coin gently over
her body, stops at the level of her stomach and lets it
rest there.  She opens her eyes and looks at him,
wondering if he senses something.

					JOHANA
			   (softly)
		What are you doing?

					JACQUES
		I'm putting you on the coin... Your
		essence... That way you'll always be
		with me when I dive.

She smiles, closes her eyes.  He swings the coin over her
face gently, some kind of private ceremony.  She looks
just a little intimidated.

The coin is now dangling in front of her mouth.  She
hesitates then opens her mouth, JACQUES lets the coin
slide into it.


EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - DAY

JACQUES walks up to the diving platform.

LAWRENCE has fixed scientific equipment on his chest.
JACQUES wets and slowly puts them on.

ENZO watches from the deck, his expression has changed.

JOHANA, on the deck also, opposite ENZO, watches a little
worried.  JACQUES concentrates then releases the gueuse
and lets himself disappear under the water.


UNDERWATER

JACQUES dives down very fast.  The control takes place at
200 feet, the doctors check him and let him go.  He
continues his descent, it's getting darker and darker
around him.

The gueuse stops at the level of the underwater platform,
just below the diver, who swims over to him in a sea of
bubbles from his oxygen bottles.  He asks JACQUES if he is
alright, JACQUES nods and gives him a huge smile before
swimming off, downwards!

The diver realizes and starts after him.  He grabs JACQUES
by one of his fins and pulls him back to the round
platform.  JACQUES lets go of the balloon.

The diver panics.  JACQUES slowly motions that everything
is fine and slowly paddles up to the surface.


EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - DAY

The boat's huge stop watch indicates min:  4:50, then
5:00, then 5:10.  JACQUES has been down there for over 5
minutes.

JOHANA is worried sick.  ENZO doesn't know what to make of
it and LAWRENCE feels completely helpless.  The stopwatch
indicates 5:20, then 5:25 and JACQUES, half unconscious,
brakes through the surface of the water.

JOHANA screams and cries with joy when she sees him.  The
crowd applauds.  ENZO is somber.

NOVELLI takes the plaque from JACQUES' hands and turns to
the crowd.

					NOVELLI
			   (stunned)
		360 feet!  He dove 360 feet!!!

The crowd cheers in excitement.

ENZO is sullen.  LAWRENCE is very worried.


EXT.  ON PORT - END OF THE DAY

There's a pile of gear on the dock.

ENZO is in the boat loading one piece of luggage at a
time, JACQUES comes up to the boat.  Parked in the
background, we see a taxi waiting with JOHANA sitting in
the back seat.  ENZO pretends not to notice JACQUES'
arrival.

JACQUES watches him for a moment then finally dares to
speak.

					JACQUES
			   (pointing at taxi)
		... There's a party at the hotel
		tonight.

ENZO keeps loading up the boat.

					ENZO
			   (busy)
		That's good.

					JACQUES
			   (after a beat)
		Enzo, don't be angry.  I was
		lucky... that's all.

ENZO throws the last duffel bag into the cockpit.

					ENZO
			   (serious)
		I'll see you in Amorgos.

ENZO turns around and jumps onto his boat.

JACQUES walks off the dock, past the cab.  JOHANA opens
the door to let him in, but he keeps walking.

					JOHANA
		Jacques...?

					JACQUES
		You go back, I'll walk.

He walks off.


EXT.  MARINELAND - DOLPHIN POOL - ANTIBES - NIGHT

The park is empty as JACQUES approaches the pool.

TINA the dolphin, jumps out of the water, swims to meet
JACQUES.  JACQUES pats her and kneels to talk to TINA
NINA.

					JACQUES
			   (sadly)
		I won today.  I dove very deep,
		Tina.

The dolphin giggles.

					JACQUES
		What's so funny?  Can you dive
		deeper?

The dolphin nods "yes".

JACQUES smiles.

					JACQUES
			   (smiling)
		So you understand everything?

The dolphin nods.

					JACQUES
		That's good... So tell me why
		they're all angry at me?  Why is
		Enzo angry?  I never wanted to
		compete with him.  I never wanted to
		be champion of anything... All I
		want is to escape from them all...
		For just a few minutes, no people...
		No noise... Nothing but the sea.

The dolphin nods and giggles.

					JACQUES
		Do you really understand me?  Huh?
		Are we actually having a
		conversation here?

Again the dolphin nods "yes".

					JACQUES
		All right then, tell me:  can I ever
		dive as deep as you?  Stay under as
		long...?

A beat.  Then the dolphin nods "yes".

					JACQUES
		Are you sure?

The two other dolphins stick their heads out of the water.
They all nod together.

JACQUES is awed and perplexed at the same time.


EXT.  AMORGOS - DAY

The little town of Amorgos is beautiful, mountainous.
It's surrounded by a luminous turquoise sea, with white
villas clinging to hillsides.  There is a small port.  (we
saw it in the opening sequence) Further along the coast,
we see the Diving Federation Committee Boat surrounded by
all sorts of activity.


INT.  HOTEL ROOM - JACQUES - JOHANA - DAY

Through the open windows we can see parts of the village
where JACQUES grew up.  He's staring out the window, lost
in his own thoughts.

					JACQUES
		It's beautiful, isn't it?

Behind him, JOHANA is hiding and throwing up.  He walks to
her.

					JACQUES
		What's wrong?

					JOHANA
		It's nothing.  Just the long trip.
		I'm a little jet-lagged.

					JACQUES
		You want to lie down for a while?

					JOHANA
		No, I'll be fine.  Can you just hand
		me a glass of water?

While JACQUES gets her the water, JOHANA stares at the
view.


EXT.  ENZO'S BOAT - IN THE LITTLE PORT

ROBERTO stands on the port, waiting for his brother.
Suddenly the sound of a motor boat and twelve note horn
echoes in the bay.

The boat has just arrived at the town dock.

ENZO, tears rolling down his cheeks from the wind, throws
a duffel bag on the dock and looks up at ROBERTO.

					ENZO
		Is he here?

					ROBERTO
			   (uncomfortable)
		He's training.

ENZO makes a face.


EXT.  SMALL PORT - DAY

JOHANA sits on the little dock in front of the hotel.
JACQUES pulls on his fins, looks out into the water.

She clutches a stopwatch, ready to set it off.

A few yards behind, hidden between two bungalows, ENZO
watches them.  JACQUES takes a few deep breaths and dives
a few feet underwater.

JOHANA starts the stopwatch.

ENZO, who sees JACQUES disappear, walks over to JOHANA and
sits down beside her.

					ENZO
		Okay, now we have a good five
		minutes to have a nice peaceful
		talk.

					JOHANA
		What are you doing here?

					ENZO
		Checking out the competition.

					JOHANA
		Enzo, why do you guys do this?

					ENZO
			   (teasing)
		What else is there?

					JOHANA
			   (seriously)
		You know what I'm talking about.
		Why do you and Jacques risk your
		lives diving?

					ENZO
			   (avoiding the
			    question)
		You risk your life when you cross
		the street.

					JOHANA
			   (frustrated)
		Damn it!  Why won't you give me a
		straight answer, for once?!

					ENZO
		Because you'd laugh.

					JOHANA
		I won't, I swear.

					ENZO
			   (seriously)
		I dive in search of God.  If I go
		deep enough I'm going to find him.
		To me, the sea is a religion... That
		surprises you, doesn't it?

					JOHANA
			   (looking down at
			    Jacques in the
			    water)
		A little... You think it's the same
		for Jacques?

					ENZO
			   (shaking his head)
		No.  Jacques is a creature of the
		sea.  He isn't meant to live on
		earth, among us... You should know
		this, Johana.

					JOHANA
			   (reassuring herself)
		He can learn.  He is learning.

					ENZO
		You really think so?  Did you tell
		him you were pregnant?

					JOHANA
			   (surprised)
		How do you know that?

					ENZO
		You told Bonita, but you didn't tell
		him, right?

JOHANA shakes her head negatively.

					JOHANA
		... Not yet.

					ENZO
		Don't.

					JOHANA
		Why?

					ENZO
		Because he won't understand and it
		will just hurt you... Jacques has
		been put on earth by complete
		mistake.  And he's only waiting for
		one thing:  that some God up there
		will turn him into a fish!  How long
		has that moron been down there?

					JOHANA
			   (looking at the
			    stopwatch)
		Five minutes and fifty seconds.

					ENZO
			   (grabbing away the
			    stopwatch)
		That idiot!

They jump up.  ENZO dives into the water.

As JOHANA watches panicky, ENZO pulls JACQUES up onto the
dock, in his arms.  JACQUES is unconscious.

ENZO is furious.  The fear of loosing his friend has
absolutely enraged him.  He starts pacing up and down the
dock.

					JOHANA
		Is he alright?  What happened?

					ENZO
			   (furious)
		The fool was asleep!  If I weren't
		around, he'd already be dead!!!  Is
		that who you want to live with?
		Well, good luck!  You better learn
		to look after him because I won't
		always be here to do it!

Once again he marches off, then comes back.

					JACQUES
			   (mumbling)
		... How long was I asleep?

					ENZO
			   (to Jacques)
		Long enough to die.  Listen, if you
		really want to die, that's your
		problem, but don't do it under my
		nose, okay?

A few steps away, then coming back.

					ENZO
			   (to Jacques)
		I'll never let you take away my
		title.  D'you hear me?  Never!

ENZO stalks off defiantly.


EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - ANCHORED OFF THE COAST

There's activity.  The competition has begun.

MUSIC

A SERIES OF QUICK SHOTS of different competitors at
various points in their dives.

The Tahitian comes up unconscious.
The German comes up unconscious.
So does the diver from the Philippines.

NOVELLI doesn't know what to think.


EXT.  TERRACE OF RESTAURANT - JACQUES - JOHANA - SUNSET

JACQUES is in a T-shirt and jeans, rope-sole sandals.
JOHANA wears a light white cotton dress.  They both sit on
the restaurant's terrace overlooking the sea.

Below them, a small boat passes.  In it are baskets filled
with sponges.  JACQUES stares at them for a long time.

					JOHANA
		Do you ever sometimes just stop and
		think how sweet life can be?

A beat.

					JACQUES
		... Sure.

JOHANA wants to say something.

					JOHANA
		... When you dive... with that
		machine... What does it feel like?

					JACQUES
			   (after thinking about
			    it)
		... The feeling of slipping without
		falling... The hardest is once you
		are at the bottom.

					JOHANA
		Why?

					JACQUES
		Because you have to find a good
		reason to come back up again... And
		I always have a hard time finding
		one.

JOHANA has never looked so sad and lost.

JACQUES doesn't notice.

ENZO who is sitting at the piano behind them, starts to
play, staring at the sea.

JACQUES and JOHANA turn around and look at him.

					ENZO
			   (smiling)
		... You should start playing the
		piano, the piano is really
		refreshing, it clears the sinuses.
		Very good the piano!  Tomorrow is
		going to be a big day!


EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT UNDERWAY - ON JACQUES

He's alone in the bow.  The others are clustered in the
saloon, cockpit in the stern.  The boat is moving close to
the cliffs.  The monastery looms above them.

CLOSE ON JACQUES

He's scanning the apparently abandoned monastery searching
for signs of life.

A red and blue taxi-boat pulls up alongside the Committee
Boat.  In it, LAWRENCE waits to climb on board.


EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - DAY

ENZO puts his flippers on and grabs his gueuse.  He is
serious, concentrating hard.

LAWRENCE'S boat slides along the big Committee Boat and
the DOCTOR climbs onto it.


INT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - LAWRENCE - NOVELLI - OTHERS

LAWRENCE'S briefcase is open.  There's a stack of graph
paper on a cabin table.

					LAWRENCE
		... When I analyzed the data from
		Mayol's last dive, it became
		apparent...
			   (taps the graph
			    paper)
		... At the depths these men are
		diving, it is a physiological
		impossibility that they can retain
		enough oxygen in their blood to make
		it back to the surface.  It's a
		function of how long it takes to get
		to the bottom, orient themselves and
		to return... To attempt to break
		Mayol's record is simple suicide.
			   (to Novelli)
		For the last time.  I'm telling you
		cancel the competition.

NOVELLI and the MEDIC look over at the diving platform
where ENZO is concentrating.

					MEDIC
		Molinari's a seventeen time world
		champion.  Do you want to tell him
		he can't dive.

LAWRENCE doesn't answer.  NOVELLI is thinking.

					NOVELLI
		Get Mayol in here.


EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - ENZO

ENZO is preparing.  He sits at the edge of the platform
hyperventilating, almost in a trance.

We see JACQUES in the background, talking to NOVELLI, he
then walks over to ENZO and climbs down next to him.

					JACQUES
		Enzo?
			   (no response)
		Enzo... I know you're angry at me.
			   (no response)
		Enzo, it's important.

ENZO opens one eye.

					ENZO
		I'm concentrating.

					JACQUES
			   (quickly)
		We can't dive anymore.  They want to
		cancel the competition for a while.

ENZO looks at him coldly.  Takes another deep breath.

					JACQUES
			   (rushing on)
		It's not safe, they say.  The
		doctors say it isn't possible to go
		deeper and live.  Free diving is
		over as a sport.

					ENZO
		You say that because you have the
		title!

					JACQUES
		No!  I would never cheat you.

					ENZO
		Well that's very nice of you.

He takes a last breath, signs himself and reaching for the
gueuse, disappears into the water.

LAWRENCE, NOVELLI, the MEDICS, and others are arguing.
LAWRENCE is furious that ENZO is diving.  NOVELLI is
balling out his assistants.

JACQUES is on the platform watching the others as if they
were a gaggle of geese.  He listens to the sound of the
gueuse playing out, watches the depth indicator, the
stopwatches.  He knows something is wrong.

He walks over to the edge and grabs hold of a little
oxygen bottle which is there for security.  He takes a few
breaths of the oxygen as he puts on his flippers and dives
down after ENZO.


UNDERWATER - JACQUES

JACQUES pulls himself down the cable, hand over hand.
80 or 90 feet down he sees a group of MEDICS coming toward
him carrying ENZO'S unconscious body.

JACQUES struggles with them, pushes them away, takes ENZO
in his arms and climbs toward the surface, frantic,
screaming silently at him, desperate to get away from the
flow of air bubbles from the scuba tanks, the commotion,
the memory of death.

ENZO has a big serene smile on his face.  The MEDICS push
both divers toward the surface.

As if they were on land, JACQUES starts shaking ENZO to
wake him up.  He then slaps his face but ENZO remains
unconscious.

They finally break the surface in each others arms.


EXT.  ON DIVING PLATFORM

They pull ENZO out of the water.  The doctors open his
jacket.  ENZO motions to JACQUES to come close.  He still
has that long smile.

					ENZO
			   (faintly)
		You were right.

					JACQUES
			   (moved)
		... I was right about what?

					ENZO
			   (after a long
			    silence)
		... It is much better down there.
		It's a better place.

He tries to take a deep breath, the effort is exhausting.
JACQUES smiles, holding back his tears.

					ENZO
		... Push me back in the water...

					JACQUES
			   (crying)
		I can't.

					ENZO
		Jacques, take me back down...
		Please.

His smile freezes, he stops breathing.  His eyes close.

JACQUES puts his head down on his friend's chest and sobs.
The doctors gently try to move him away, but JACQUES
resists.

					LAWRENCE
		Just give him five minutes!  What
		does it matter now, anyway... Come
		on, just leave him alone!

LAWRENCE encourages everybody to leave the platform.

JACQUES quickly grabs the nearest rope and ties it to his
belt.  Before anybody can stop him, JACQUES rolls ENZO'S
body back into the water and dives after it.


UNDERWATER - JACQUES

He holds ENZO in his arms.  Lets the dead weight of the
body pull him down, deeper and deeper.  The rope around
JACQUES' waist runs out, stops his descent with an abrupt
jerk.  When he feels it, JACQUES lets go... watches as
ENZO'S body continues to drift by itself into the
bottomless blue...


EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM

The doctors have run over and are pulling the cable that
JACQUES is attached to.  He is unconscious when they pull
him up.  They hold him up by his feet.  JACQUES throws up
gallons of water.  They put an oxygen mask on his face.

					A DOCTOR
			   (listening to his
			    heartbeat)
		The heart is going to stop!  The
		stimulator, quickly.

Suddenly, everything collapses for JACQUES.  Sounds
disappear.  The image slows down, the light fades.

JACQUES only hears his heartbeat, which slows down.

His heart stops.

Among the crowd around him, he sees JOHANA, fresh, gentle,
smiling.  Her movements are smooth and slowed down.  She
smiles at him, simply.  JACQUES smiles back.  The heart
starts again slowly.

The image goes back to normal.

Sounds multiply (doctors, the panic, etc...) and slowly
come back.

JACQUES falls unconscious.

					A DOCTOR
		The heart started again!  It's all
		right!

NOVELLI falls back in his chair, relieved.


INT.  JACQUES' ROOM - NIGHT

JACQUES is lying on the bed, he has a strong fever.

JOHANA sits at his feet.

LAWRENCE rummages through a medical kit.  He takes a pill
from a bottle and gives it to him.

					LAWRENCE
		Take this.  Have a good sleep.

JACQUES swallows the pills.  JOHANA walks over from the
balcony.

					LAWRENCE
		Sweet dreams.

LAWRENCE motions to JOHANA that they should let him sleep.
He goes out of the room.

					JACQUES
			   (tenderly to Johana,
			    who had started to
			    leave the room)
		Kiss me.

JOHANA bends over and kisses him.

JACQUES holds her by the arm, doesn't want her to leave.

					JOHANA
		Sleep now.  We'll talk later.

JOHANA kisses him on the forehead and leaves the room.


EXT.  HOTEL BAR - ON TERRACE - LAWRENCE - JOHANA

They're at the little zinc bar.  Not talking, not really
drinking either, just toying with their glasses.

ROBERTO passes, stops.

					ROBERTO
		I've packed all of... Enzo's
		clothes.
			   (a beat)
		I'm going to the radio telephone...
			   (swallowing)
		... to call Mamma.

They watch sadly as he leaves.


INT.  JACQUES ROOM - NIGHT

JACQUES sitting up in bed finally lies down under the
sheets.  He turns off the light by the bed.


INT.  HOTEL RESTAURANT - LAWRENCE - JOHANA

They've moved from the bar to the table.  There is uneaten
food in front of them.  A third place is set.

JOHANA looks at the wall clock.

					JOHANA
		I'll go see how he's doing.

					LAWRENCE
		Let him sleep.


INT.  JACQUES ROOM - JACQUES

JACQUES is lying on the bed, he is not moving anymore.  He
is breathing loudly, as if tired out.  From his POV the
room becomes very dark and blue.  The noise is unbearable.
The ceiling turns into water.

JACQUES' eyes are wide open.  His face is sweating.  The
water level, from the ceiling, comes down to him, until he
is swallowed by it.

As he falls into the water, we see a dolphin gulping air
at the surface and going back very quickly to the blue.

The dolphin meets his group, about ten of them, 250 Kg of
muscles, swimming at more than 40 km/H underwater.  They
all break through the surface to gulp air regularly.

Suddenly, one of them, leaves the group.  He crosses the
blue and seems to make sonar-like sounds.  We see a sonar
picture.  It's an image in which the dolphin will appear a
few seconds later.  The dolphin comes up like a rocket,
gulps air and goes back down.

The sonar image appears again.  Finally, the dolphin,
locates a group of fish and starts hunting them, exactly
like a war plane.  He manages to break the group in two,
then in four, and this way, he isolates his victim.

He breaks the surface to gulp air and goes back down.  He
goes full power.  The fish he is after are even more
divided.  There is only one left, totally lost and in a
panic.

The exhausted fish is swallowed.

The dolphin slows down, goes back up, breaks the surface
in slow motion.  Images becomes pale and bright.

He screams inhumanly.

Image is white, black, silence.


INT.  HOTEL ROOM - JACQUES

JOHANA opens the shutters.

The room is a shamble of broken glass, water pitcher and
glasses, lamps and vases.  The windows are blown out.

JACQUES is lying in bed.  There is a thin trickle of blood
coming from his nose and ears.

					JOHANA
			   (in a panic)
		Jacques... Are you alright?


EXT.  DOCK - JACQUES - JOHANA - NIGHT

JACQUES jumps into ENZO'S boat.

					JOHANA
			   (still worried)
		Jacques?  Are you alright?  Answer
		me!  Are you alright?

She jumps down into ENZO'S boat.  He starts the engine.
The boat is racing out of the port.  JOHANA yells over the
sound of the engine.

					JOHANA
		You've got to tell me what happened?

					JACQUES
		I saw how it has to be.

JACQUES parks the boat in front of the COMMITTEE BOAT'S
DIVING PLATFORM.  He turns on the platform lights:  above
and underwater.  He throws down the diving cable:  60, 90,
120 feet...

JACQUES gets undressed and sits down in the lotus
position, concentrating...

JOHANA sits down a few feet away and watches him,
wondering just how far he is going to push this whole
thing.

As the cable unrolls, JOHANA starts crying.  She
understands that JACQUES is going to dive to the bottom,
into the blue, into himself.

					JOHANA
		Jacques, you know I love you.

JACQUES is putting on his flippers, and stands facing his
gueuse.

					JACQUES
			   (after a silence)
		Don't be sad... It's not because of
		you, it's me.  It's all going on
		inside me!
			   (a beat)
		I've gotta go and see.

JOHANA starts pacing up and down the diving platform.

					JOHANA
		See what?  There is nothing to see!
		It's pitch black down there!  It's
		cold.  You'll be all alone!  Look at
		me, Jacques!  I am here!  I exist!
		Look!!!
			   (she starts waving
			    her arms)
		I'm real!  I am not a dream!
		Jacques will you look at me?
			   (she breaks down)
		Please!

JACQUES has not moved, he still sits motionless, facing
his gueuse.

JOHANA doesn't know what to do or say.  She is totally
drained.

					JOHANA
		Jacques?  I'm pregnant.

					JACQUES
		That's good... that's wonderful.
		It's wonderful for you.

					JOHANA
		You are the father.

Silence.  JACQUES is petrified, without any reaction.  He
doesn't understand.  She realizes it's hopeless and stares
at the sea.

					JOHANA
			   (after a while)
		I lied... to keep you here.

She kisses him.

					JOHANA
		Promise me one thing.

					JACQUES
		Anything.

					JOHANA
		Promise you won't forget me.

She pulls the line releasing the gueuse.

JACQUES takes a deep breath and grabbing hold of the
gueuse, disappears into the water -- as if swallowed by
the ocean.


UNDERWATER

JACQUES slides along the cable, pulled by the weight of
the gueuse.  He has a beautiful smile on his face.  He is
in his element.  Night has closed in around him.  He turns
on the headlight of the gueuse, it casts a dim light
around him.


EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - NIGHT

JOHANA has walked over to the edge of the platform.  She
is holding the cable, to "hear" JACQUES' descent.

The counter shows that JACQUES is quickly passing the 300
feet mark.


UNDERWATER

JACQUES keeps going down, as serene as ever.  He has
gained a lot of speed.


EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - NIGHT

JOHANA holds her face in her hands.  The counter indicates
that JACQUES is going very fast.


UNDERWATER

The gueuse jerks to a stop and shakes the cable.  JACQUES
turns his body right side up.


EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - NIGHT

The counter now indicates a depth of 600 feet.

JOHANA has felt the jolt of the cable.  She cries her
tears and looks down at the water.


UNDERWATER

The headlight on the gueuse illuminates only a few feet
around JACQUES, as if he were standing in a circle of
light.  He stays there, patiently floating around and
around his cable... as if he were waiting for something.

A long form circles the border between the darkness and
the light.

JACQUES holds out his hand.  A dolphin comes and presses
its body against it.  Two other dolphins come out of the
night.  JACQUES watches in amazement.

A dolphin lays his muzzle in JACQUES' hand, ready to lead
him off.  JACQUES hesitates.

JACQUES lets go of the cable and lets himself be led away.
Their silhouettes disappear in the deep blue night.

					THE END
THE BIG BLUE

FADE IN:

EXT.  GREEK ISLAND - SUNSET

CREDIT SEQUENCE:

The image is in black and white.

The sun disappears behind arid cliffs which cast giant
shadows on the sea.

A little boy around 8 years old -- tanned from head to toe
-- sprints along the cliffs, scrambles from one rock to
another with amazing agility.

In one hand, he carries a transparent plastic bag.  In the
other, a net bag containing flippers, mask, pants and
sweater.

The only thing that slows him down is his bathing suit --
obvious hand-me-downs -- way too big.  He tugs on them as
he goes, holding them up... Until they slide again... as
he leaps again... and pulls them up...

The little boy is JACQUES MAYOL.

End credits.


EXT.  GREEK ISLAND - SUNSET

JACQUES reaches a ledge jutting out over a deserted cove.

He spits in his mask... expertly spreads the spit with a
finger... locks his feet into the flippers... and dives.

He surfaces a long way out... adjusts his mask... and
swims away from shore.


IN OPEN SEA

The boy stops swimming -- starts to gulp air -- sucks it
in -- oxygenating his blood in a series of deep rapid
breaths -- almost hyperventilating, almost alarming if
we've never seen this before.

His gaze is glued to the ocean floor.  Clear clear water.
40 feet deep.  And intensely blue.

Suddenly, he catches his breath and dives -- into the
blue.


UNDERWATER

JACQUES touches bottom.  Clamps his legs around a rock to
hold himself down.  Unhurried, thoroughly at home, 40 feet
under... he opens the plastic bag.  A huge speckled moray
eel appears in a hole in the rock, slithers toward him.
The carnivore's jaws are bigger than the boy's head.

The boy smiles at him.  Pulls a piece of raw meat out of
his bag and holds it out.  The eel takes the morsel
delicately -- and slithers back into his hole.

Gravely, JACQUES takes another morsel out of the bag.


EXT.  VILLAGE - DUSK

JACQUES walks up a steep road bordering the port, almost
dry now.

Two boys about his age run up the streets; call out, catch
up with him and gesture toward the port.

					THE BOYS
		Jacques!  Come quick!


EXT.  PIER - DUSK

The little boys tug JACQUES to the end of the pier and
point to something in the water.

					BOYS
		Look!  Right there!  It's shining!

JACQUES walks over, and sure enough sees something shining
a few feet down in the water.

					JACQUES
			   (squinting)
		A coin.

					FIRST BOY
		I found it.

					SECOND BOY
		Liar!

Camera pans and we see a middle-aged PRIEST loading
supplies into a small boat.  He stops to watch the
children's negotiations.  Little JACQUES is putting his
flippers on.

					JACQUES
		Ok.  I'll get it, but no fighting,
		all right?

The two boys nod as they point to the coin.

					JACQUES
		We'll split it.

					FIRST BOY
		You can't split a coin.  That's
		stupid.

					SECOND BOY
		He's right.  You're stupid.

The pope smiles.

					JACQUES
		Then we'll buy something and split
		that.

					SECOND BOY
		A helicopter...

					JACQUES
		It's a small coin.

					FIRST BOY
		A Ferrari.

					SECOND BOY
		I don't want a Ferrari... What is
		it?

					JACQUES
			   (interrupting them)
		Maybe a little radio.

The two boys look at each other.

					JACQUES
		Well.  We'll decide later.  The light
		is going.

					SECOND BOY
		I get the radio from after school,
		until midnight.

					FIRST BOY
		Since when do you stay up until
		midnight?

					JACQUES
		All right, all right... Can I
		concentrate?  And you can stop
		pointing.  I've seen it.

					VOICE (O.S.)
		I've seen it too.

The voice is ENZO'S.  Another young boy wearing little
round glasses.

					FIRST BOY
			   (annoyed)
		Shit, it's the Italian!

He is slightly older than JACQUES but he is taller.  ENZO
is with ROBERTO, his younger brother, the only one allowed
to carry his flippers.  Five kids are behind him.

					ENZO
		Well, if it isn't the little
		Frenchman!  How is the little
		Frenchman?

					JACQUES
			   (cool)
		Fine!

ENZO pats JACQUES on the shoulder and leaves his hand
there -- a lightly intimidating gesture.

					ENZO
		You don't mind if I go instead, do
		you?

					JACQUES
			   (intimidated, and
			    pretending not to
			    be)
		No...

					ENZO
		If you did mind, you'd tell me,
		wouldn't you?

ENZO pats his shoulder reassuringly.

					ENZO
			   (to his brother)
		Roberto, mio palmo!

ROBERTO who has already started to moisten his big
brother's gear in the water, holds a pair of dripping
flippers and a glistening mask.  The pope watches the
scene with obvious pleasure.

					ENZO
			   (to his brother on
			    the edge of the
			    pier)
		Count!

Sure of himself, ENZO takes a deep breath and dives in the
water.  ROBERTO counts out loud.

					ROBERTO
		1... 2... 3...

The kids all walk over to the edge of the pier.  A few
feet away, JACQUES takes off his flippers.

					ROBERTO
		4... 5... 6...

ENZO bursts out of the water, the coin in his hand.  The
children cheer and clap.  ROBERTO rushes to catch the
equipment that comes flying at him, piece by piece.
ENZO walks over to JACQUES.

					ENZO
			   (showing him the
			    coin)
		Who's is it now?  You saw it but I
		dove for it!

JACQUES doesn't answer.

ENZO smiles and slowly puts the coin in his pocket.  He
pulls it out again and waves it under JACQUES' nose.

					ENZO
			   (without turning
			    around)
		Roberto?  How long?

					ROBERTO
		Six seconds.

ENZO looks at JACQUES for a while.

					ENZO
		I'll throw it back into the water.
		You dive and if you do less than
		six, it's yours.

JACQUES doesn't say anything, then finally shakes his
head, negatively.  ENZO smiles, taps him on the shoulder.

					ENZO
		Brava!

The first boy finally sums up his courage to speak.

					BOY
			   (timidly)
		Enzo?  I saw the coin first... We
		split?

					ENZO
			   (smiling)
		You can't split a coin, stupid.

ENZO laughing, sticks the coin in his pocket and leaves
the pier with his gang.

The pope smiles and pulls a coin from his pocket.

With his flippers dangling from one hand, JACQUES sadly
stares out at the sea.  The pope calls him over.

					PRIEST
		Jacques... Come, look.

JACQUES goes over to him, sees where he is pointing, the
faint gleam of the coin underwater.

					PRIEST
		Is it a coin shining down there?

					JACQUES
			   (overjoyed)
		It is.  It's a coin!  I'll get it
		for you, Father!

					PRIEST
		It'll be for the poor.

JACQUES, intent on the coin's glimmer, quickly slips on
his fins, prepares his mask.  He swims in the water like a
fish, goes directly to the coin.  Scoops it up, brings it
to the surface.

He breaks water, waves the coin, looks for the priest and
sees he is no longer there.

					JACQUES
		Padre?

He looks at the ancient impression on the coin -- "Boy on
a Dolphin".

								    DISSOLVE TO:

ON JACQUES - UNDERWATER

He's swimming near the spot where he fed the moray eel.
He senses something behind him and turns around.  He sees
a dolphin, still and silent, floating vertically.  It
seems to be watching him.  The surprise is such that
JACQUES is in a panic, leaps up to the surface...


ON JACQUES - IN BED

He bolts upright, as if suddenly awakening from a dream.


INT.  ROOM - ON JACQUES' FATHER - DARK

A BURLY MAN, around fifty, crosses the room in the shadows
and throws open the shutters with a bang.  Sunlight pours
in.  He walks over to JACQUES' bed in the one room house,
and runs his hand through his hair.

					FATHER
			   (with a smile)
		... Come on, time to get up,
		Jacques!

JACQUES rubs his eyes.  His father walks over to a pile of
blankets on the floor, on the other side of the room.  He
gives the pile a kick.

					FATHER
			   (screaming at the
			    top of his lungs)
		Louis, wake up!

He uncovers a kettle on the fire and ladles up a big bowl
of soup for Jacques.  A fifty year old man pokes his head
out from under the pile of blankets.  It's UNCLE LOUIS,
who is having a very hard time, waking up.


EXT.  HOUSE - DAY

JACQUES bursts out of the house, running.  Diving gear
under his arm.  A piece of buttered bread in his mouth.

He catches up with his father and UNCLE LOUIS.  They're on
a path winding down to the port.  JACQUES slows down
abruptly.  Tries to imitate their stride.  The weather is
balmy and the sea lies before them, peaceful and blue.


EXT.  SEA - DAY

Their boat on the water.  The chug of its ENGINE ECHOES
off the cliffs.  A few gulls -- drawn by the sound -- skim
the waves of its wake.


EXT.  BOAT - DAY

On board.  JACQUES' Father checks the antique air pump.
JACQUES polishes the enormous copper diver's helmet and
lays out the rest of an old fashioned deep sea diver's
suit.

At the foot of an old monastery another boat passes.
The Priest is in it.

JACQUES' Father and LOUIS take off their caps.  JACQUES
takes the gold coin out of his pocket.

The pope nods to JACQUES.  His father looks over at him
without understanding.  The child quickly puts the coin
back in his pocket.


EXT.  BOAT - DAY

LOUIS casts anchor.  A few feet away, siting on a rock,
the kid with little round glasses is fishing.  He turns
around to the boat.  JACQUES smiles and waves at him.
ENZO waves back, obviously disturbed in his fishing
session.

					FATHER
		Jacques, come help me.

JACQUES helps his father into the diver's suit.  The burly
man struggles into a pair of weighted lead shoes.  He
seems sluggish and tired.  JACQUES watches worriedly.  He
has a weird feeling.

					JACQUES
		You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.

					UNCLE LOUIS
		Then you shouldn't eat everyday,
		Jacques.

His father catches him fondly by the scruff of the neck.

					FATHER
			   (winks at him)
		Don't worry.  When I'm tired down
		there, the mermaids help me out.

Father and son smile at each other.  Then his father puts
the helmet on.  JACQUES joins LOUIS at the pump.

The heavy diver's suit disappears slowly underwater.  The
gleaming copper helmet is the last thing to slide out of
sight.

JACQUES and LOUIS work the pump.  Regular, steady motions
to maintain the flow of air.

					UNCLE LOUIS
			   (to Jacques)
		Hey!  Have you ever seen a mermaid?

					JACQUES
		No.

They keep on pumping for a while, then...

					UNCLE LOUIS
		I've seen them.

UNCLE LOUIS goes on.  JACQUES doesn't budge.

					UNCLE LOUIS
		Don't you want to know where?

JACQUES looks at the bottom to watch his father.
He doesn't answer.


UNDERWATER - JACQUES' FATHER

He moves along slowly in his cumbersome diving suit.  He
is working the top of a rock outcrop on the sea floor.  He
sees a sponge, hooks it; puts it in a bag that's attached
to a life line from the boat fastened to his waist.  He
moves on.


INT.  BOAT - JACQUES AND LOUIS PUMPING

They keep up the rhythm.  Sitting on a rock at a distance,
ENZO watches them.  UNCLE LOUIS is bored stiff.

					UNCLE LOUIS
		Why don't you ask me?

					JACQUES
		What?

					UNCLE LOUIS
		Where I saw the mermaids?!  Why
		don't you ever ask any question?
		I'm always the one asking the
		question!  We're sitting here like
		two stones and I'm taking to myself.
		Ask me something, Goddamnit!

JACQUES calmly looks over at him, slows down his pumping
and almost serenely asks him:

					JACQUES
			   (in a completely
			    flat tone)
		Why did my mother leave?

UNCLE LOUIS seems disturbed by the question.  A beat.

					UNCLE LOUIS
			   (ill at ease)
		Come on now, pump!


UNDERWATER - JACQUES' FATHER

He is walking with difficulty at the bottom.  His bag is
full of sponges.  He seems to be having trouble breathing.


EXT.  BOAT - JACQUES AND LOUIS

JACQUES and LOUIS are pumping silently.  UNCLE LOUIS feels
obliged to answer JACQUES' question.

UNCLE LOUIS finally breaks the silence and explains:

					UNCLE LOUIS
		Your mother didn't leave.  She went
		back to America, that's all.  It's
		her home.  She's allergic to this
		Island.  She likes refrigerators and
		machines that clean the floor... so
		one day she left.  Woman are like
		that, unpredictable, like the sea.

They haven't been paying attention to the bubbles gushing
at the surface.  The air hose is being pulled down in a
very worrisome way.

					JACQUES
			   (with a slight grin)
		So where did you see mermaids?

UNCLE LOUIS smiles.

					UNCLE LOUIS
		In the bars in Athens!

Very pleased with himself, UNCLE LOUIS burst out laughing.
JACQUES shyly shrugs his shoulders.  The air hose is
suddenly yanked down.  JACQUES immediately sees all the
bubbles.  He is white as a sheet.

JACQUES rushes to the side of the boat and starts yelling
down at his father.  He grabs the life line and starts
pulling at it hysterically.  The air hose snaps and
starts flying around like some crazy snake.  JACQUES tries
to jump overboard.  UNCLE LOUIS catches hold of his foot
at the last second.  JACQUES is slapping the water with
his hands, trying to go down but UNCLE LOUIS won't let
him.  JACQUES is yelling desperately.  ENZO is now
standing on his rock, watching the scene, horrified.

The sea now looks as if it were boiling.

UNCLE LOUIS grabs hold of JACQUES and hugs him in his
arms.  Standing on his rock, ENZO is now crying
desperately.

					ENZO
			   (screaming)
		Jacques!  Jacques!

The last air bubbles are now breaking on the surface; it
looks as if they will never stop.

								    DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  ITALIAN VILLAGE STREET - DAY

The image is now in color.

A rocky pink cliff over looks the very bright sea which
fills the screen.

SUPERIMPOSED:  1987 SICILY

ALFREDO runs (skips) up the cobbled street as fast as he
can go, surprisingly fast.

He runs to the large terrace of a restaurant which he
enters.  We have time to read the sign carrying the
restaurant's name:  "LA MAMMA".


INT.  RESTAURANT - DAY

ALFREDO skips in.  He is panting, covered in sweat.  His
panic is palpable.  The whole room watches him approach a
long table where a large family is having a birthday party
for a very old lady.

He has to stop a second and catch his breath before he can
get the words out.  Then leans over and whispers in the
ear of a great big man -- around 30 -- built like a bull,
wearing little round glasses.

The man listens, then stiffens.


EXT.  HARBOR - CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

A beat-up FIAT, towing an equally beat-up trailer, stops.

ENZO unfolds out of the driver's seat, like a circus clown
emerging from a toy car.

The construction SUPERVISOR, an American, wearing a three
piece suit, hurries over to him.

ENZO has already started undressing.  ROBERTO unloads the
diving gear from the trailer.

					SUPERVISOR
			   (exhausted)
		Signore Molinari?

					ROBERTO
			   (shaking his hand)
		Yes.

					ENZO
			   (calmly undressing,
			    expressionless)
		How did it happen?

					SUPERVISOR
			   (upset)
		The company asked me to extract
		everything I could from the wreck;
		so the divers were trying to get at
		the engine... and then the boat
		turned over... in the current...
		and... look, I fucked up!  Can you
		help?

					ENZO
		How many are, down there?

ENZO goes back to the car.

					SUPERVISOR
		Just one... We're feeding him air,
		but he's not breathing regularly...
		You've got to get him out fast.

ENZO glances at the map, then at the accident site.

					ENZO
			   (a beat)
		Ten thousand.

					SUPERVISOR
		Lira?

					ENZO
		Dollars.

					SUPERVISOR
		You're going to hold me up at a time
		like this?

					ROBERTO
		You do understand you're talking to
		the champion diver of the world?

					SUPERVISOR
		Yes, but ten thousand dollars...

ENZO opens the trunk of his FIAT and pulls out the jack.
He slams the trunk shut, and stands looking at the
American, straight in the eyes.

					ENZO
		Okay.  You tell me.  How much would
		you say the man's life is worth?

Extremely uncomfortable, the SUPERVISOR doesn't answer.

					ENZO
		In my village, we have a saying:
		when the wind blows, the flags of
		all nations flap in the same
		direction.

					SUPERVISOR
			   (baffled)
		What does that mean?

					ROBERTO
		That you should get your checkbook.
		Damn quick.


EXT.  UNFINISHED PIER - ENZO

He's at the end of the pier, his feet dangling in the
muddy water of the port.  A few feet away a pump sends air
HISSING through a rubber tube to the diver trapped below.

ENZO inhales steadily, his chest heaving like a bellow.
He carefully puts his spectacles inside his shoes, dons
his flippers, etc., with his usual flair of suspense.

Behind him the SUPERVISOR and other construction workers
watch expectantly.  ROBERTO heaves a stone weight into the
bay, a cable attached to it plays out from a drum on the
pier.

ENZO ignoring everyone, grabs the ordinary tire jack,
flip-flops over to the now taut cable, the stone has hit
bottom.  He takes a deep breath and dives into the bay.


UNDERWATER - WRECK

ENZO dives down a chimney of muck.  Picks his way over and
around every hazard, until he reaches the diver, trapped
under a huge piece of debris.

He pats his shoulder to comfort him, he then inserts the
tire jack under a piece of concrete... And, as if he were
changing a tire, begins to pump the handle...

Slowly, in a swirl of mud and water, the chunk of debris
rises off the diver's leg.


EXT.  CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

Everyone is staring at the water silently, suspensefully.
The SUPERVISOR has his checkbook in hand, but has
completely forgotten it, intent upon what's going on
underwater.  ROBERTO taps him on the shoulder.

					ROBERTO
		Since we have a little time, what do
		you say you write that check?


UNDERWATER - WRECK

ENZO cuts the cables tangled around the diver's torso.
Then he takes off his flippers, plants his bare feet on
the concrete, grabs the diver by the shoulders and pulls
him free.

The diver drops the air tube and climbs as quickly as
possible toward the surface.


EXT.  CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

The diver surfaces, gasping for breath.  A cheer goes up
from the crowd.  Several men hurry to pull him onto dry
land.  But there is no sign of ENZO.  Everyone waits,
breathless.

					ROBERTO
			   (to the Supervisor)
		Sign here.

Suddenly, ENZO appears, burst out of the water, holding
his flippers up in the air like a trophy.  The onlookers
cheer, help him out of the water, slapping him on the
back.

ENZO tosses the jack and his flippers to ROBERTO.
Impassive and silent, he slips his arms into the prize
fighter's robe that ROBERTO holds out for him, walks
solemnly back to his car.

ROBERTO takes the check and walks over to the car.  ENZO
bends down into the car and opens the roof.

					SUPERVISOR
			   (through the open
			    roof smiling)
		Thanks, thanks a lot.  I mean that
		too... You extortionist bastard!

The car rushes off.  In the distance we see a police
(carabinieri) car and an old fire engine rolling in the
direction of the construction site.


INSIDE FIAT - DRIVING AWAY

ENZO'S car drives past them.  ENZO looks at ROBERTO out of
the corner of his eye, then suddenly explodes with joy.

					ENZO
		Dollars, Roberto!  We took him for
		ten thousand dollars!

ROBERTO whoops and whistles.  ENZO reaches over and leans
on the horn.  The little car races by and finally stops at
the top of the cliff facing the sea.


EXT.  TOP OF CLIFF - DAY

The two brothers sit back, relax.

Stare out to sea.

					ROBERTO
			   (after a while)
		Enzo, what are you going to do with
		the money?

					ENZO
		Have the car painted.

					ROBERTO
		Santini will do that for 25 dollars!

					ENZO
		Then tell him to wax it too.

					ROBERTO
		Enzo, really.  What are you going to
		get?

					ENZO
			   (thinking)
		A rosary for Mama, a dress for
		Angelica, something with rhine-
		stones for what's her name, and get
		yourself a suit that fits... But
		most important...

					ROBERTO
		Yes?

					ENZO
		Find the Frenchman.  Find me Mayol.


EXT.  FLAKES OF SNOW - MOUNTAINS - DAY

Mountain peaks, stark and white.  A winter sky which is
strangely and disquietingly dark.  A landscape swept by
snow.

SUPERIMPOSED ON SCREEN: PERU - LAKE HUACRACOCHA - MAY 1987

A yellow light comes out of the storm -- advances toward
us.  The headlight of a train.

A narrow gauge locomotive steams up grade pushing piles of
snow in front of it.


INT.  TRAIN - DAY

Sitting in the train, leaning against the misty window,
JOHANA CROSS, 27, has clear quick charm and a sort of
romantic fragility.  She is dressed simply but warmly.
She looks through the window; all she sees is white.

It is clear that she was not the one who decided on this
trip.  Reading the key phrases from a beat-up note book,
she calls upon an old Peruvian.

					JOHANA
			   (in Spanish)
		Is this the Lago del Demonio?
		(Es bien aqui el Lago del Demonio)
		... Huacracocha?

The old man goes into a long, rambling explanation.
JOHANA nods without understanding a thing.

					JOHANA
		Gracias.

					OLD MAN
		You welcome.


EXT.  TRAIN STATION - DAY

The train pulls in, slowly pushing piles of snow in front
of it and finally stops in front of an old shack which
serves as the station.

A man, FRANK, bundled in a parka, comes out of a
snowmobile parked by the station, and walks up to the
train.

JOHANA steps down, carrying her suitcase and drops two
feet in the snow as she comes off the last step.  FRANK
walks over and leans down towards her.

					FRANK
			   (smiling)
		Welcome to Peru!


INT.  SNOWMOBILE - DAY

FRANK throws the luggage into the back of the snowmobile,
jumps in and turns the ignition on.  JOHANA takes her hat,
scarf and gloves off.  FRANK glances over at her, he is
both amused and charmed.

					JOHANA
		Don't you have a heater?

					FRANK
			   (hitting at the
			    dashboard)
		Yeah... Sure... Is this your first
		trip to Peru?

					JOHANA
		Does anybody live to make a second?

FRANK smiles and kicks the heating system, then leans over
to check it, his eyes off the road.

					JOHANA
			   (a little worried)
		Forget about the heater!


EXT.  LAKE OF THE DEMON - CAMP - DAY

The storm is at its peak.  The frozen snowmobile plows
along side the lake HUACRACOCHA and stops in front of a
cluster of quonset huts almost completely buried in snow.

FRANK gets the bags out of the back.  The suitcases are by
now frozen stiff.  JOHANA follows in his steps.

A couple of llamas are huddled up against the hut in
attempt to protect themselves from the storm.

JOHANA is bewildered.  Shacks in the middle of the Andes,
the lake of the "Demon", and now llama that have to be
pushed aside to enter one's home.

As FRANK opens the door, a man is leaving the hut.  The
man is JACQUES MAYOL.  JOHANA and JACQUES pass each other
in slow motion.  Everything seems suddenly suspended:
time, sound, cold...

JACQUES MAYOL instantly makes an impression on her.  He is
now 34, still dark-haired, with dark eyes.  He is wearing
a red diving suit and a pair of round goggles.  He looks
like some legendary creature one would dream about.

Everything finally regains its formal speed.  The door
slams, the man is gone.  She and FRANK are in the middle
of the entrance hall.  JOHANA hasn't yet gotten over the
vision she has just had, but she regains composure and
enters the next room.


INT.  QUONSET HUT

JOHANA happily takes her gloves off.

FRANK puts down the bags and walks into the next room.
It's a sort of laboratory, filled with ultra modern
equipment.

A big bay window overlooks the lake on which is built a
long wooden dock.

Sitting in a corner, an old Peruvian man is preparing hot
drinks.  JOHANA drops into a chair.

					FRANK
		A drink to warm up?

					JOHANA
		Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if
		possible.

					FRANK
			   (pulling out a flask)
		Tea... or whiskey?

					JOHANA
		... both.  Did I just see a man in a
		red suit and goggles?

FRANK smiles and pours some whiskey in her tea cup.

					FRANK
		... right.
			   (calling out)
		Dr. Lawrence?  The insurance man...
		uh... The insurance person is here!

					LAWRENCE
		It's about time!

FRANK smiles and pours JOHANA some tea.  She warms her
hands on the cup.  She asks blankly.

					JOHANA
		Would it be out of place to ask what
		he's doing?

					FRANK
		Who?

					JOHANA
		The guy in the Halloween suit!

LAWRENCE comes in from the other side of the room.

He walks straight over to the bay window.

					LAWRENCE
		Did you have a nice trip?  We were
		getting restless, it's been three
		weeks since the accident.

JOHANA walks over to the bay window and starts staring at
something in the distance.


EXT.  DOCK - ON JACQUES

At the end of the dock, JACQUES who is sitting on the edge
of a hole which is cut in the ice, is putting a pair of
gloves on.  He then grabs the handles of a strange machine
which emerges from the water and starts taking deep
breaths, oblivious to the cold, his mind completely
elsewhere.


BACK IN LAB

JOHANA watches JACQUES.  She just can't believe her eyes.
LAWRENCE is bent over one of his machines, fiddling with
different switches.

					LAWRENCE
			   (to Johana)
		You should get things moving, you
		know.  We're out of equipment and we
		can't do half of our experiments...!
		Frank, check the program!

JOHANA is finally able to speak.

					JOHANA
		Who... Who is that?

					LAWRENCE
		Mayol... Jacques Mayol.

					JOHANA
		That's the experiment?  Dumping a
		guy into a frozen lake?

LAWRENCE turns one last knob.

					LAWRENCE
		... The truck fell into a very deep
		crevasse.  We weren't able to save
		the equipment.

					JOHANA
		I'll have to talk to the driver.

					LAWRENCE
		In the spring when he melts!

JOHANA walks closer to the window.  She isn't hearing a
thing he's saying.

JACQUES is putting on his flippers.

JOHANA can't believe it.

JACQUES is standing by a hole cut in the ice.  He is
holding onto the machine in the water.  He is waving a
mask.

					JOHANA
			   (dumbfounded)
		You really send him under the ice?
		He isn't a slave or a convict or
		anything?

					LAWRENCE
		My dear, science is a cruel
		mistress.

					JOHANA
		But... how is he going to breathe?

					LAWRENCE
		He isn't going to breathe.

JACQUES takes a deep breath, turns a handle and a weight
yanks him straight down into the water.  LAWRENCE sets his
stop watch off and flips a few switches.

JOHANA grabs his arm as if they could do something about
it.

					LAWRENCE
		Listen...

He raises the volume:  we hear the man's heartbeat through
a small speaker.

					LAWRENCE
		That's his heartbeat.
			   (excited)
		Can you hear the speed at which it's
		slowing down, it's incredible.

LAWRENCE tears off the sheet with the heartbeat measures
on it and hands it to JOHANA.

JOHANA feels she's on the verge of crying, and can't
figure it out.


UNDERWATER - JACQUES

JACQUES stops his machine by turning one of the handles.
He's deep beneath the surface of the frozen lake.  He
swims deliberately, carefully into a large tube which is
hinged open.  He closes it around himself.  His heart is
still slowing down.  He pushes a button on the machine,
and a flash of light bursts in the opaque night
surrounding him.


BACK IN LAB - ON VIDEO SCREEN

We see a moving X-ray image.

					LAWRENCE
		He's in the fluoroscope now.  Listen
		to his heart.  Impressive, huh?  The
		flow of blood is concentrated in the
		brain and doesn't even feed the
		limbs anymore.  It's a phenomena that
		has only been observed with
		dolphins... until now.

					JOHANA
		How long can he stay down?  Without
		breathing?

					LAWRENCE
		It depends.  He should come up soon.
			   (smiling)
		Unless he's decided to stay for the
		night.

					JOHANA
		Why is he doing this?

					LAWRENCE
		For one thing, it's his job... as
		for the rest of it, I wish I knew.

JOHANA sighs with relief as JACQUES appears at the surface
in one big breath.

					JOHANA
		Shouldn't somebody take him a
		blanket or something?

					LAWRENCE
			   (smiling at Frank)
		Coffee might be nice.

She heads towards the Old Peruvian and pours a cup of
coffee...

					JOHANA
			   (afterthought)
		Will he understand Spanish?

					LAWRENCE
		His mother's an American.  He spent
		half of his life in the states.  I'd
		try English if I were you.


EXT.  DOCK - JACQUES SURFACING

He's groggy, half hypnotized.  He looks up at the dock,
sees JOHANA with a cup of coffee.  He stares at her.  She
hands him the coffee.

					JACQUES
			   (puzzled)
		I recognize you.

					JOHANA
		We saw each other a little while
		ago.

					JACQUES
			   (serious)
		In the lake?

					JOHANA
			   (wondering whether he
			    is joking or not)
		No... in the hut.

After a long beat...

					JACQUES
			   (with a beautiful
			    smile)
		Then it was somebody that looked a
		lot like you... Thank you.

JACQUES then turns around and walks toward the huts.

JOHANA still hasn't moved, as if petrified by her emotions
and the severe cold.  She then walks up to the hole in the
ice and peers into the dark water.  She shudders.


INT.  CABIN - DAWN

JOHANA emerges from a down sleeping bag.  She's wearing a
big sweater and a wool hat.  She is not sleeping.

Intrigued by the sound of the snowmobile, she gets up and
walks over to the frozen window.  JACQUES and FRANK are
loading their luggage onto the snowmobile.

Outside, LAWRENCE is saying "Goodbye" to JACQUES.  Unseen,
JOHANA also waves from behind her curtain.  JACQUES senses
something:  he turns around toward the cabin and smiles,
waving his hand at JOHANA.  She hides behind the curtain
and shyly waves back.

JACQUES gets into the snowmobile and drives out of the
frame.  We are left with an endless array of snow-caped
mountains.

								    DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  COTE D'AZUR - DAY

Fixed image of the Cote d'Azur.  The sparkling blue sea
fades into the distance.

A French taxi rides along the winding road overlooking the
creeks.


INT.  - TAXI

From behind all his bags, JACQUES obsessively stares at
the sea.

The driver smiles.

					DRIVER
		It's beautiful, isn't it?

JACQUES smiles.

					DRIVER
		We had some bad wind this week.  The
		"Mistral"!!  "Peuchere"!  There
		isn't one olive left on its tree.
		It suddenly left us this morning...
		I sure won't be the one to call it
		back.


EXT.  ANTIBES - ROAD TO MARINELAND

The taxi comes to a stop in front of Marineland.  JACQUES
gets out, carrying one of his bags.

					JACQUES
			   (to the driver)
		I'll only be five minutes.

He enters Marineland.


EXT.  MARINELAND - ON JACQUES

The park is closed, the paths are deserted.  JACQUES
approaches the Dolphin's tank.  All three dolphins rise up
in the water.  Greet him with a click and clatter of
tongues.  JACQUES sits down at the edge of the tank.

					JACQUES
		Good morning, everybody!  Did you
		sleep well?  I slept in a plane, and
		it wasn't too great.

He opens his duffel bag.  Hunts around, comes up with two
packages wrapped in brownpaper.  The dolphins stare at
him, intrigued.

					JACQUES
			   (calling out)
		Hey!  presents.

The dolphins CACKLE some more.

					JACQUES
		You think I'd forget you?

He laughs.  The driver, who seems to be quite familiar
with the place, walks in heading straight over to the soda
machine.  Out of the corner of his eye, he takes in the
scene, very intrigued.

JACQUES has not noticed him.

He starts unwrapping the first package.

					JACQUES
		For Bathsheba.

He produces a little ceramic Llama.

ON BATHSHEBA

looking at the llama, bewildered.  As bewildered as a
dolphin can be.  JACQUES turns the llama upside down.  It
moos:  HIAK, HIAK...

					JACQUES
		It's a Llama.  You understand?  From
		Peru.  It's fighting.

BATHSHEBA shakes her head.  JACQUES throws the llama into
the water.  He unwraps the second package.  A pair of
Peruvian gloves and hat.  Wide eyed, the driver sits in
the stands to watch the show.

					JACQUES
		That's for you, Darjeeling.  We
		wouldn't want you to catch cold!

He throws them to DARJEELING who catches them.

					JACQUES
		And now...
			   (singing out)
		"Ta, da..." For you Tina.

He pulls out a thermos.

					JACQUES
		Something you've never seen either.

He opens the thermos.

					JACQUES
		Snow!

He sprinkles snow flakes on TINA'S head.  She tries to
taste it.

					JACQUES
			   (smiling like a
			    child)
		A new experience, Tina.
			   (nostalgic)
		I missed you little rascals.  Did
		you get my post card?

The three dolphins leap into the air and land with a huge
splash which soaks JACQUES.  He takes his shirt off.

					JACQUES
			   (pretending to be
			    serious)
		Oh?  Is that what you want?
		Alright, but five minutes, no more.
		I have a taxi waiting.

He takes off his pants.  The taxi driver gets up, as if to
keep him from going in.  JACQUES dives into the pool.


UNDERWATER - ON JACQUES

He swims under the dolphin, reaches out and grabs hold of
the dolphin's snout.

The dolphin pulls JACQUES around and around the basin
while JACQUES pets his chest and belly.  We have never
seen JACQUES so relaxed and happy.

EXT.  MANHATTAN - DAWN

Overview of a gray and dirty Manhattan morning.  JOHANA
depressed, stares blankly out of the window of a yellow
cab.  She watches the muddy brown water flow under the
Brooklyn Bridge.

The driver keeps yelling obscenities to all the cars
around him.


EXT.  MANHATTAN - DAY

A suitcase in each hand, JOHANA gets out of the cab and
walks up the stairs of her apartment.


INT.  HALLWAY - DAY

JOHANA puts down her suitcase wearily.  Catches her breath
and gets out her keys.  She tries one in the top lock.  It
doesn't work.  She tries harder.  There's a woman's voice
yelling angrily from inside the apartment.

					SALLY (O.S.)
		I changed the lock you son of a
		bitch!

					JOHANA
		... Sally?

The door opens.

					SALLY
		You're back!  Hello.  We were
		burgled.

					JOHANA
		Again?

					SALLY
		They got the new T.V.

JOHANA comes in, looks at the ransacked apartment.

					SALLY
		... And the new stereo.

					JOHANA
		I hope they remembered to take the
		microwave this time?

					SALLY
		Yep.  How was your trip...?  Help me
		clean up, okay?

					JOHANA
		You called the police?

					SALLY
		They're going to send detectives.
		When they get around to it.

					JOHANA
			   (shrugging)
		So what, all they ever want is your
		phone number anyway.

JOHANA goes over, slumps into an easy chair and sighs.

After a beat...

					SALLY
		Well?

					JOHANA
		What?

					SALLY
		How was your trip?

					JOHANA
			   (flatly)
		Nice... Very interesting... Great!
			   (doubtfully)
		... I guess.

					SALLY
			   (ironically)
		Okay... Who'd you meet?

JOHANA opens her handbag, takes out the strip of
electrocardiogram paper, hands it to her.

					SALLY
		A cardiogram...?  You met a doctor!
		Congratulations, you're in the
		chips...
			   (an afterthought)
		Unless they have socialized medicine
		in Peru.  Do they?

					JOHANA
			   (indicating paper)
		It's his heartbeat.

					SALLY
		Oh Jesus...!  I'll make some coffee.
			   (starts toward
			    kitchen)
		They left the stove.

INT.  APARTMENT - LATER

The living room is almost completely put back together...
SALLY is replacing books in the bookcase, JOHANA is using
a carpet sweeper, and talking away.

		6'3", 6'1", maybe 5'9" -- You can't
		be sure, you know the flippers, they
		add height or they take it away, or
		something.  Anyway short dark hair...
		Not punk or anything, just short.
		And the cutest smile.  He wasn't
		smiling at me, I don't think -- just
		smiling.  And he thought he saw me in
		the lake.  I mean that was a figure
		of speech... They're so romantic,
		the French.

					SALLY
			   (bored, half asleep)
		I thought you said he was Peruvian?

					JOHANA
			   (annoyed)
		Haven't you been listening?

SALLY opens the drapes, revealing it's dawn outside.

					SALLY
		... Since eight o'clock last

		Don't be a jerk.

		There's no such thing as love at

UNDERWATER - SWIMMING POOL

JACQUES is swimming alone at the bottom of a gigantic
swimming pool.  He wears a monofin, his head and chest are
wired up to an assistant who runs back and forth alongside
the pool.

A man's feet are seen walking over to the side of the
pool.

JACQUES is swimming laps, arching his body like a dolphin.

As he approaches one end of the pool, he sees a coin
slowly falling in front of him.  JACQUES picks it up and
looks at it:  it's an old Greek coin.

JACQUES smiles and swims to the surface.


EXT.  ON SIDE OF SWIMMING POOL - DAY

JACQUES pokes his head out of the water and pulls off his
goggles.

ENZO stands over him, smiling.

					ENZO
		Jacques, my friend, how are you?

					JACQUES
			   (happy)
		Enzo...

A beat.

					ENZO
		I leave you swimming and twenty
		years later, you're still in the
		water!  What the hell are you doing?
		Training?

					JACQUES
		Yes.

An uneasiness sweeps over ENZO'S face and quickly
disappears.

					ENZO
		That's good.
			   (smiling again)
		You never would have recognized me,
		huh?  Check out the suit!  Looking
		good, no?  You know I'm the world
		champion?

					JACQUES
		Yes, I know.

					ENZO
		I dove 315 feet!

					JACQUES
		Great!

					ENZO
		They say I'm like Lazarus.  You
		know, the guy who was raised from
		the dead?!

He laughs.  JACQUES smiles.  ENZO goes on.

					ENZO
			   (serious)
		Doesn't it surprise you that I just
		show up like this... Listen, the
		world championship starts in ten
		days in Taormina.  Be my guest.

ENZO puts down an airplane ticket on the side of the pool.

					ENZO
		Your ticket.

Surprised, JACQUES looks over at the ticket.

					JACQUES
		Why?

					ENZO
		Because I'm sure you're dying to
		beat me.

					JACQUES
			   (shaking his head)
		I don't want to be in any
		competition... I dive because I like
		to, not to beat a record... don't
		you have to be very mad at somebody
		to want to beat him?

					ENZO
		No.  All you need is to want to be
		the best.

					JACQUES
			   (smiles)
		You're the best, Enzo!

					ENZO
			   (with a tense grin
			    on his face)
		That's too easy!  Every time I beat
		a record there's always some
		dumbshit asking me:  "D'you know
		that French guy, Mayol?  He's
		supposed to be very good!  Too bad
		he doesn't compete." So, you're
		going to come with me to Taormina!
		First, because you're my friend and

EXT.  OFFICE BUILDING - NEW YORK - DAY


INT.  DUFFY'S OFFICE - DUFFY - JOHANA

She is seated across the desk from him.  He's reading
through her report.  Behind him, outside the large plate
glass window, window-washers are seated on a scaffold
suspended far above the city.  They eat lunch.

JOHANA'S eyes wander (bored) around the office as DUFFY
reads.  He looks up.

					DUFFY
			   (indicating report)
		This is good work... unfortunately
		it's incomplete.
			   (he glances at the
			    window)
		Could you eat a sandwich 40 floors
		above the street.

					JOHANA
			   (absently)
		What kind?

					DUFFY
		Johana, am I boring you?

					JOHANA
		Sorry.  Of course not, definitely
		not... well, maybe a little.  What
		did you say?

					DUFFY
		I said that the file is incomplete.
		See if you can get through to this
		Lawrence character and have him send
		the Peruvian registration for his
		missing truck... and don't let him
		tell you it was in the glove
		compartment.

					JOHANA
		Right Chief!

She starts out of the office.

					DUFFY
			   (to her back)
		Did the driver really freeze?

					JOHANA
		Like a popsicle.  They're keeping
		him on a stick until spring.

					DUFFY
		My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.

		office to send me a copy as fast as
		possible.  We can't send you new
		equipment until our file is
		complete.  Okay?


INT.  QUONSET HUT - PERU - DAY

					LAWRENCE
		Okay, okay.  You'll have it by the
		end of the week, how's that?

					JOHANA (V.O.)
		You've made me a happy insurance
		person.

					LAWRENCE
		Then, goodbye.

He is just about to hang up.


INT.  JOHANA'S OFFICE - MANHATTAN

JOHANA jumps up.

					JOHANA
		Wait!  Professor...?

					LAWRENCE (V.O.)
		... Yes?

JOHANA starts snooping around the papers on her desk,
embarrassed by the presence of her colleague.

					JOHANA
			   (as softly as
			    possible)
		You don't know how I could reach
		that diver of yours... Mayol... We
		need some additional information...
		I mean, we have a few questions to
		ask him.


INT.  QUONSET HUT - PERU - DAY

					LAWRENCE
		The last thing I heard, he was off
		to Taormina for the world diving
		championships.  That's Taormina, in
		Sicily!


INT.  DUFFY'S OFFICE - DAY

JOHANA dashes in without knocking.

					JOHANA
		Listen, I just found out we've got
		real problems in Sicily!

					DUFFY
			   (alarmed)
		What d'you mean?

					JOHANA
			   (improvising)
		The mafia!  La Cosa Nostra!
		Coppola!  De Niro...!  I knew it!  I
		knew we shouldn't have written that
		policy!!

					DUFFY
			   (pale)
		What's happened??

					JOHANA
		The documents are forged.

					DUFFY
		No!

					JOHANA
		Yes!  The notary is a phony.  He has
		the same signature as the
		contractor!

					DUFFY
			   (outraged)
		It can't be true!

					JOHANA
			   (fast talking)
		We have to send somebody over there
		immediately!  If we prove the
		forgery we can cancel the policy.
		We'll be off the hook.  There's a
		flight to Rome in two hours and from
		there its just a short hop to
		Sicily.

					DUFFY
			   (reaching for phone)
		I'll send Cardoza, he'll be able
		to...

					JOHANA
			   (interrupting)
		I tried him, he can't go.  His son
		is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow...
		I'll go, boss.

					DUFFY
		I thought it was Spanish that you
		spoke?

					JOHANA
			   (after a beat)
		Italian is practically the same
		thing.


EXT.  PORT OF MESSINE - DAY

A ferry comes into the dock, as a plank is slowly lowered.

As it descends, four rail cars lie in wait in its belly.
JOHANA comes off the boat, carrying her suitcase, she
wears a light summer dress.  She looks around, seeming a
little lost.

A white FIAT taxi screeches to a halt beside her.  JOHANA
jumps.  The driver whose arm loosely dangles from the car
window, grins at her.

					DRIVER
		... Taxi?


EXT.  SAN DOMENICO - DAY

The white FIAT taxi pulls up in front of the SAN DOMENICO
hotel, but it is JACQUES who gets out of it.  The driver
helps him with his bags.

					RECEPTIONIST
			   (checking the books)
		Mayol... Mayol... No reservation.

					JACQUES
			   (uncomfortable)
		... Are you sure?

					RECEPTIONIST
		Positive, Sir.

JACQUES looks down at the piece of paper stapled to his
ticket.

					JACQUES
		This is the hotel San Domenico?

					RECEPTIONIST
		Yes Sir, and it has been so for 127
		years.

					JACQUES
			   (more and more
			    uncomfortable)
		Yes, but... So, you haven't got a
		room left?

					RECEPTIONIST
		No Sir, the hotel is full because of
		the Diving championship.

					JACQUES
		Ah?!

The Receptionist starts working on his papers again.
JACQUES, completely lost, stares blankly at the hotel
clerk, wondering what to do next.


INT.  HOTEL - DAY

The tiny FIAT clatters onto the sidewalk in front of the
hotel narrowly avoiding the Countess' limo.  Parks its
frontwheels on the sidewalk, rear end in the road.

ENZO, followed by ROBERTO, get out of his car, like a king
descending from his carriage.  On the way, he stops and
kisses a distinguished elderly woman's hand?  The hotel's
CONTESSA.

ENZO tosses his keys to a doorman who stepped up to
complain.

					ENZO
			   (to doorman)
		Be careful with that car, it's a new
		paint job.

ENZO enters the hotel and sees JACQUES.

					ENZO
			   (yelling across the
			    lobby)
		Giacomino!  My friend!  My brother!

ENZO and JACQUES.  The two men kiss each other on both
cheeks, pound each others back.  They are both moved.

					ENZO
			   (looking at him)
		So you finally decided to join us?
		You did the right thing!

					ENZO
			   (to the desk clerk)
		Hey Paolo!  Come stai?  Get my key!
			   (to Jacques,
			    gesturing over his
			    shoulder)
		You remember my little brother
		Roberto?

Roberto (26) nods to JACQUES who shakes his hand.

					JACQUES
		I remember.  Hi Roberto!

					ENZO
		What room have you got?

					JACQUES
		I don't have one.

					ENZO
		You don't have a room?
			   (at the top of his
			    lungs)
		Paolo?  What did I just hear?  I
		personally called you to reserve a
		room for my good friend Jacques
		Mayol and you treat him like a
		stranger?!

					JACQUES
			   (embarrassed)
		It's okay, Enzo.  I'll go somewhere
		else.

					ENZO
		Not only is Jacques Mayol a very
		special friend, but he happens to be
		one of the best divers in the world!
		And you're throwing him out!  Are
		you crazy, or what?  Stupido!

					JACQUES
			   (really embarrassed
			    now)
		Enzo drop it, I'll find something.

ENZO looks at him for a moment and gives him a warm smile.

He hands him his own keys.

					ENZO
		Take mine.  I'll take the Countess'
		suite.  She told me she was leaving
		for the cemetery... She'll be more
		comfortable there.

PAOLO half-heartedly, hands him the key.  ENZO glances at
JACQUES to make sure he's properly impressed.  He throws
his arm around JACQUES' shoulder, hugs him and gives him a
real smile.

					ENZO
			   (sincerely)
		I'm glad you're here.


EXT.  HOTEL TERRACE TAORMINA - JACQUES - ENZO - DAY

They're at a table on a terrace that overlooks the sea.
They've just arrived and all around them people are
lunching away furiously.

ENZO beckons to a passing WAITER who comes to the table.
He's a very handsome, slightly effeminate young man.

					ENZO
			   (to waiter)
		"Spaghetti del mare"
			   (to Jacques)
		It's delicious here.  It's the one
		thing they really know how to make.

					WAITER
		Del mare for two?

					JACQUES
			   (nodding quickly)
		Yes, sure, for two.

					ENZO
		And a bottle of "Frascatti".  Two
		bottles!

					WAITER
		Si Signore, grazie mille.

The waiter hurries away.  ENZO watches his departure, then
thoughtfully.

					ENZO
		He moves just like a woman.
			   (then, as if he were
			    speaking to Jacques)
		It must be hard to live in two
		worlds like that, huh?  To breathe
		in one, swim in the other...

JACQUES nods without really knowing.

					ENZO
			   (suddenly louder)
		Anyway!  Nothing beats a sexy broad!
		Huh, Jacques!

ENZO starts laughing.  JACQUES would like to crawl under
the table.

								 TIME DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  HOTEL TERRACE TAORMINA - JACQUES - ENZO - LATER

Their lunch is on the table, half eaten.

					ENZO
		... So, after all these years, you
		must have lots of questions to ask.
		Am I right?

					JACQUES
			   (quickly)
		Yes, of course.  Lots of questions.

JACQUES is satisfied with his answer.  He thinks that the
subject is closed.  They eat silently for a moment.  ENZO
watches him.  Then:

					ENZO
		Well, what are they?

					JACQUES
			   (giving up)
		I'm sorry... I don't know how to ask
		the questions.

ENZO bursts out laughing.

					ENZO
		Well, then.  I'll do the asking for
		you.  "Tell me dear Enzo, how did
		you become World Champion?"  Oh,
		that's a long story.
			   (his voice changes)
		Well, after you left Amorgos, I went
		back to Italy and joined the Navy.
		So you now have in front of you --
		Captain Molinari, who's been on
		leave of absence for the past 14
		years...

					JACQUES
		That's good.

					ENZO
		How do you make a living?  Your
		experiments, does it pay well?

					JACQUES
		It's okay.

					ENZO
		... You married?

JACQUES doesn't seem to have ever thought about marriage.

					JACQUES
		No.

					ENZO
		Me neither, 'cause of my Mother.
		She's a curse, my Mamma, a tornado.
		Stubborn as a mule!  I was
		engaged... for a week.  After that,
		Mamma was so mad, I tell you, pasta
		was bouncing off the walls.

JACQUES smiles.

					ENZO
		So, not married.  Well, good for
		you.  You play the field, like me.
		A girl in every port, huh?

					JACQUES
			   (bluffing)
		Exactly, I mean, after all, we're
		men!

					ENZO
			   (slapping the table
			    top)
		Damn right!  That's what I tell them
		when people say you've turned into a
		fish.

					JACQUES
			   (concerned)
		People say that?

					ENZO
			   (sorry he went too
			    far)
		Forget it.  I was joking.


EXT.  ENTRANCE TO TERRACE - ON JOHANA

JOHANA comes out of the stone tunnel which leads to the
terrace.  She looks over the crowd, trying to find
someone.

JACQUES is sitting with his back to her.  She finally
spots him and walks over to the table.

					ENZO
		Eh!  La Madonna!  This one is for
		me.  I'll bet you my watch that
		she's in my bed tonight.

JACQUES turns around and recognizes her.  JOHANA smiles
and walks up to the table.  ENZO takes his watch off and
puts it on the table.

					ENZO
			   (quickly)
		I tell you she's mine!

					JOHANA
			   (to Jacques)
		Hello!

					ENZO
			   (surprised)
		You know each other?

					JOHANA
		Yes.

					ENZO
		Enzo Molinari.

ENZO kisses her hand and brushes his watch off the table
in the same movement.

					ENZO
		This is a great pleasure.

					JOHANA
			   (laughing at the
			    protocol)
		Johana Cross, pleased to meet you.
			   (then to Jacques,
			    faking surprise)
		Well!  Isn't this a coincidence.  I
		really wasn't expecting this... All
		the way out here.  It's incredible!

					JACQUES
		Please, have a seat.

					JOHANA
		Thank you.  I wouldn't want to
		interrupt anything.

JOHANA sits down.

					JACQUES
		No, no!

					ENZO
		Not at all!

					JACQUES
		You're staying at the hotel?

					JOHANA
		I wish, but it's full.  They
		recommended a pension in town.  They
		say that all of Taormina is full.
		What's going on here?

					ENZO
		It's the Free Diving World
		Championship.  I am by the way world
		champion!

JOHANA has turned toward JACQUES, paying no attention to
ENZO.  JACQUES can't stop looking at JOHANA.

					JACQUES
		But what brought you to Sicily?

					JOHANA
		I was doing an insurance
		investigation in Palermo.
			   (to Enzo)
		I work for an insurance company.
			   (back to Jacques)
		So, I decided to take a few days
		off.
			   (uncomfortable)
		I don't know this island at all.  It
		really is gorgeous.

					ENZO
		There is no place in the world more
		beautiful than Sicily!

The waiter passes behind them.  ENZO reaches out, grabs
him by the arm, pulls him to the table.

					ENZO
			   (to waiter)
		A spaghetti del mare for the super
		dedicated traveling insurance
		agent.

					JOHANA
			   (smiling)
		I think I'll have a coffee.

					JACQUES
		No, no.  You'll like it.  It's
		superb.

					JOHANA
		... Okay.  I'll try.

ENZO pours the wine.

JOHANA shrugs fatalistically.  The waiter leaves.
JACQUES, intrigued, stares at JOHANA.  She pretends not to
notice.

					ENZO
			   (impatient)
		Where did you two meet?

					JOHANA
		In a lake.

					ENZO
		I might have known.
			   (to Johana)
		As I was telling you earlier, I'm
		the world champion free diver.

					JOHANA
		Congratulations.

					ENZO
		Some people say it's the most virile
		sport in the world.  One has to
		admit that when you see those men
		diving head first in that deep blue
		sea, all muscles contracted in one
		super human effort...

					JACQUES
			   (interrupting)
		Enzo?

					ENZO
			   (annoyed)
		What?

					JACQUES
		Your mother?

					ENZO
		Ahi, ahi, cazzo!  Ma mamia!
		Where...?  God, she'll kill me...
			   (pushing the plate
			    in front of Johana)
		... if she catches me eating pasta
		in a restaurant.

He quickly brushes off the crumbs in front of him.

ON ENZO'S MOTHER

heading toward them.  She's a huge woman in widow's black.
She shoulders her way through the tables.

ROBERTO carrying her suitcases follows at her heels.

ENZO jumps to his feet.  Throws his arms around her.

					ENZO
		... Mamma!

					MAMMA MOLINARI
			   (expressionless)
		You expect me to carry all the
		luggage myself?

					ENZO
		Mamma.  Roberto and an elevator...
		Isn't that enough?

A beat.  Signora MOLINARI inspects the plates on the
table.

					MAMMA MOLINARI
			   (suspiciously)
		What have you been eating?

					ENZO
		Coffee only, I'm diving tomorrow.
		You remember little Jacques, Jacques
		Mayol...

					JACQUES
			   (timidly)
		Madame...

					ENZO
		... And his friend, Johana...

Signora MOLINARI nods grudgingly.

					WAITER
			   (arriving proudly)
		Spaghetti del mare!

Dead silence.

ENZO is the only one with no plate in front of him.
Signora MOLINARI'S eyebrows condense into a dark stripe
across her forehead.

JOHANA hands ENZO'S plate to the WAITER and takes the full
one.

					JOHANA
			   (to waiter)
		Thank you.

And begins to eat, ignoring the expressions of amazement
all around her.

					MAMMA MOLINARI
		Americana?

JOHANA nods enthusiastically, her mouth too full to speak.

					MAMMA MOLINARI
			   (impressed, to
			    Johana)
		Benvenuto!

MAMMA MOLINARI has a huge grin on her face.


EXT.  TAORMINA STREET - JACQUES, JOHANA - TWILIGHT

They emerge onto the street in front of the entrance of a
small rooming house.

JACQUES is carrying JOHANA'S luggage.  The old pension is
covered in bright pink bougainvilliers, there is laundry
hanging on the other side of the street.

					JOHANA
		Thanks for helping with the bag.
			   (she looks up at the
			    pension with little
			    enthusiasm)
		It looks great!

					JACQUES
		I thought it was a nice place.
			   (suddenly doubting)
		Isn't it?

					JOHANA
		I'm being a pain in the ass.
			   (looking at him)
		It's beautiful here.

They look at each other.  JACQUES is silent.  He just
stands there, a suitcase in each hand.

JOHANA breaks the silence.

					JOHANA
		You're going to be very busy these
		days aren't you?

					JACQUES
		I don't know... why?

					JOHANA
		Just because... I would have liked
		to visit the town... See the
		coast... I don't know anybody...
		Expect for you.
			   (feeling she has
			    gone too far)
		But you are going to be very busy.
		You must have tons of things to
		prepare, interviews... And a
		competition like this one must
		require a great deal of
		concentration, right?

					JACQUES
			   (shakes his head
			    negatively)
		Yes... Maybe... I don't know.  I
		don't like competitions... It ruins
		the fun.  Don't you think?

					JOHANA
			   (with a faint smile)
		I guess... But you know... I'm
		American and I've mostly been taught
		to be competitive... There's always
		pleasure of being the best?

					JACQUES
		Maybe on earth there is one... but
		not when you dive... You see, to
		dive deep into the sea, for no
		reason... just to do it.  It's a
		feeling... I don't know how to say
		this... Voluptuous?

He looks up at her as he pronounces the last word.  She
smiles at him, lovingly.

					JOHANA
			   (laughing)
		You can put down the suitcases, you
		know.

He lets go of the suitcases.  Suddenly, behind them, there
is a loud screech of tires.  The FIAT tears across the
street.

ENZO in his FIAT.  He pokes his head out of the window.

					ENZO
		C'mon, you two... Jacques, we have
		to get ready for the ceremony
		tonight.  We have a new world
		champion.

					JACQUES
		I'm a little tired, I don't know
		if...

					ENZO
		Get in the car!


INT.  ENZO'S SUITE - ENZO, JACQUES, ROBERTO - NIGHT

They're in front of a wardrobe looking JACQUES over in the
full-length mirrors.  He's wearing an evening shirt and a
tuxedo of ENZO'S.  The collar is too big, the sleeves
hangover his hands.  He looks at himself dubiously in the
mirror.

					ENZO
		Roberto!  The bow-tie!

ROBERTO hands ENZO the bow-tie, he hooks it around
JACQUES' collar.

					ENZO
			   (taking a few steps
			    back)
		Very good.

JACQUES looks down at his tennis shoes.

					ROBERTO
		What about the shoes?

					ENZO
		Very chic.
			   (hesitates)
		Anyway, you don't have anything
		else, do you?

					JACQUES
		No.

					ENZO
		Then, it's very chic.  Avanti!


EXT.  RECEPTION ON TERRACE - NIGHT

A big reception is organized on the terrace of the hotel.
The official divers and technicians are all gathered in
front of a podium.  The terrace is loaded with
photographers.

ROBERTO keeps turning round and round the long buffet
table.

JACQUES is alone at the bar.  Incongruous detail:  a
whiskey bottle on the table beside him.

JOHANA enters.  She has also had a few drinks.

					JOHANA
		I thought you'd be at the dinner.

					JACQUES
		It's too loud for me.

He tugs at his over-sized tuxedo.

					JOHANA
		You look adorable.

					JACQUES
		Thank you...

					JOHANA
			   (smiling)
		... Especially the sneakers.

JACQUES looks down at his feet, doesn't know what to make
of her comment.  JOHANA sits down beside him and pours
herself a drink.  They touch glasses.


EXT.  ON PODIUM - NIGHT

On the podium, NOVELLI, the organizer of the championship,
stands in his tuxedo, talking into a microphone.  An older
man in a worn out suit, stands next to him.

					NOVELLI
		Ladies and Gentlemen, your
		attention, please.  Mr. Andre
		Bonnet, President of the
		International Diving Championship
		Committee, is going to present this
		trophy to the new world champion of
		free diving.  This afternoon, our
		new champion descended to the
		remarkable depth of 280 feet.

The audience applauds.

					NOVELLI
		This young man Tia...

NOVELLI can't quite read his notes.

					NOVELLI
		Tiraro... Tirao-re... Moa...

ANDRE BONNET takes his turn to read the note.  A young
Tahitian jumps up, heads for the podium.

					TAHITIAN
		Tiraero Moameora.

NOVELLI hesitates to repeat the name.

					NOVELLI
		... Let's all give him a big hand.

The audience cheers and applauds the new champion.  ENZO
sits at a table, watching the ceremony.

					ENZO
			   (very sarcastic)
		A one day hero!

He gets up and walks out of the room.


INT.  BAR - NIGHT

JACQUES and JOHANA are sitting at the bar.  The whiskeys
have gone to their heads.  ENZO walks over to them.

					ENZO
		A new world record!  That's great!
		It gives me something to beat
		tomorrow!
			   (to Johana)
		You ever been to Tahiti?

					JOHANA
		No.

					ENZO
		I'll take you there.  We'll live in
		the sun.  You'll cook fresh fish and
		we'll make love under the coconut
		trees.

JOHANA smiles and shakes her head.

					JOHANA
		You forgot the Hula!

					ENZO
		Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!

					JOHANA
		You'll be lovely, but no thanks.
			   (to Jacques)
		Jacques, would you do a native dance
		for me?

					JACQUES
		I don't know how... Excuse me.

JACQUES leaves the bar.  JOHANA watches him go.  ENZO
notices her way of watching him.  He's a little jealous.

					ENZO
		He looks strange, doesn't he?  Like
		a baby that just learned to walk.

					JOHANA
		Have you known him long?

					ENZO
		Forever.  We used to live on the
		same island in Greece, when we were
		kids.

					JOHANA
		What was he like, when he was little?

					ENZO
		Little.  Very little.  And skinny,
		very skinny too.  That is compared
		to me.

					JOHANA
			   (amused)
		I get it, Enzo you were a superior
		child.

					ENZO
		Exactly!  What is it Johana?  You're
		so crazy about him, you don't see
		the truth?!

She doesn't answer.

					ENZO
		Forget it, don't think of Jacques as
		a human being.  He's from another
		world.

She smiles.

					JOHANA
		And just where are you from?

					ENZO
		Italy!


EXT.  TERRACE OF THE HOTEL - NIGHT

ENZO sits at the grand piano in the corner of the terrace.
Beethoven was always a favorite of his.

JACQUES, very tipsy by now walks over, a glass in each
hand.  He hands ENZO a glass, then takes off his tennis
shoes and sits them neatly on the piano.

					ENZO
		There is nothing like music.  It
		speaks from the heart.  Can you tell
		me why we bother diving in the dark,
		the cold, without ever taking the
		time to breathe?  Huh?  Can you tell
		me why we do it?

JACQUES nods.

					ENZO
		Why?

					JACQUES
		... For the mermaids.

ENZO smiles, moved.

					ENZO
		My father used to see them
		everywhere too... but the only one
		he ever caught was my mother...
		Actually she caught him.

A beat.

					JACQUES
		Today at lunch, you asked me if I
		had any questions.

					ENZO
		Ah ha.  You finally want to know
		about women.

					JACQUES
		Why?  Are they what's most
		important?

					ENZO
		No... It depends... Sometimes they
		are... What, exactly do you want to
		know?

					JACQUES
		... Everything.

					ENZO
		Everything about what?

					JACQUES
			   (thinking)
		Well... about everything.

ENZO grins at JACQUES and starts playing again.

							TIME DISSOLVE TO LATER:

JACQUES AND ENZO

There are now several empty champagne bottles around.
They are both quite drunk.  ENZO is philosophizing.
JOHANA is looking for them.

					ENZO
		... So, between Mamma, Roberto and
		the sisters, we yell and scream all
		day long.  Except with Angelica.
		She just cries.  And then finally,
		we all end up kissing.  Can you
		explain that to me?

JACQUES can't answer.

					ENZO
		Because that's what love is all
		about.  It's a pain in the ass but
		keeps us together.
			   (then, in a half
			    dreaming, half
			    desperate tone)
		A large and beautiful family!

JOHANA walks over to them.

					JACQUES
			   (suddenly)
		Enzo... We must quit the
		competition.

ENZO hits a wrong note on the piano.

					ENZO
			   (worried)
		Why?

					JACQUES
		If we don't... I'm going to beat
		you.

JOHANA stands next to JACQUES.

					ENZO
			   (with a nervous
			    laugh)
		Huh?  Well listen to him!
			   (to Johana)
		Do you hear that?

					JOHANA
		No.

					ENZO
		He looks me in the eye like some
		fuckin' gold fish, and says:  "I'm
		going to beat you".

					JOHANA
			   (with a smile)
		... That's what he's here for, isn't
		he?

					ENZO
		Listen to her!  "That's what he's
		here for"!  He's here to loose,
		that's what he's here for.  First of
		all, I'm unbeatable.  Second, how
		old are you?

					JACQUES
		Two years younger than you.

					ENZO
		As I said, second of all you're too
		skinny.  You've got tiny lungs.  I
		still don't understand how you can
		dive without getting sick.

					JACQUES
		The size of the lungs has nothing to
		do with it!

					ENZO
		Look at me.  These aren't lungs.
		These are... Tanks.  How long can
		you hold your breath?

ENZO is getting really angry.  The drinks have a lot to do
with it.

					JACQUES
			   (impatiently)
		I don't know.  Longer than you.

ENZO pulls open his collar and rises.

					ENZO
		We'll see.


EXT.  HOTEL - SWIMMING POOL - UNDERWATER - NIGHT

JACQUES and ENZO dive into the pool in their Tuxedos.
Each one carries a beach umbrella in a concrete base to
help them stay at the bottom.

ENZO takes two goblets out of his pocket, hands them to
JACQUES.  Takes a bottle of Champagne out of the other
pocket and opens it.  The cork floats out of the bottle.

Above on the surface of the pool there's a splash.  JOHANA
finds a mask on the side of the pool and watches them.
Her dress is soaked by now.

ENZO pours champagne.  Courteous and grave, they clink
glasses and begin to drink.  They have already been
underwater longer than a minute.  They can't really drink
out of the glasses and ENZO offers JACQUES the bottle.
JACQUES studies the label like a connoisseur.  He drinks,
passes the bottle back to ENZO.


INT.  HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Paramedics roll two stretchers toward the elevators at
full speed.  ENZO on one, JACQUES on the other.  Both men
keep throwing up water.


INT.  JACQUES'S ROOM - NIGHT

The paramedics roll the stretcher toward the bed.
JOHANA very worried, follows them.

					JOHANA
		Take it easy...

					PARAMEDIC
		Don't worry, he's empty now.  He
		needs sleep, that's all.

The two men leave the room.

JOHANA walks over to the chair and rearranges JACQUES'
shirt and jacket which the paramedic had thrown down.
JACQUES looks like he's just had a very rough night.  He
sits up and grabs the sides of the bed, as if he were on a
moving boat.

					JACQUES
		Who won?

JOHANA turns around, furious.

					JOHANA
		Won what?  The Ass Hole Award?
		Well, let me tell you, it's a tie!

She walks over to the bed.

					JOHANA
		Acting like a pair of two year olds!
		You could have died in that damn
		pool!

					JACQUES
		Please move slowly, you're rocking
		the boat.

					JOHANA
			   (smiling)
		Lucky I was there to save you.

					JACQUES
			   (seeing her wet
			    dress)
		You jumped in?

					JOHANA
		Only to help the medics, I assure
		you.

					JACQUES
		My wallet.

JOHANA wet, walks over to the wet clothes on the chair.
She pulls out JACQUES soaking wallet from one of the
jacket pockets.

					JOHANA
		It's still here.

She tries to wipe it.

					JACQUES
		No.  I want to show you.  Is it
		ruined?

					JOHANA
		Well, water isn't exactly the best
		thing for pictures... Not even for
		pictures of dolphins...

					JACQUES
		Give it to me.

JOHANA hands him the photograph.  He stares at it, looking
very sad.  Worried JOHANA sits down next to him.

					JACQUES
			   (on the verge of
			    tears)
		My real family...
			   (he looks at the
			    picture and cries)
		What kind of man has such a family?

She takes the picture out of his hands.

He is so upset that JOHANA can hardly help from crying
with him.  She sits next to him and strokes his hair.

					JACQUES
		I'm sick of never feeling at home
		anywhere.

JOHANA takes him in her arms.  He breaks down.


EXT.  HOTEL - DAWN

The early morning sun slowly lights up the water.  A yacht
has left the hotel dock.  It is moving out to sea off the
coast of TAORMINA.


EXT.  YACHT - ON DECK

This is the Committee Boat for the diving competition.

On the boat, ROBERTO is worried.  He checks his watch and
finally decides to wake up his brother.  ENZO is asleep in
the fore peak, curled up on a coil of line, snoring away.
He wears his tuxedo jacket over a skimpy bathing suit.

					ROBERTO
		Enzo, wake up!

					ENZO
			   (pulled from his
			    dream)
		Eh?  Si!  Avanti!

He gets up on one arm.

					ROBERTO
		The medics are looking all over for
		you.

					ENZO
			   (irritated)
		I'm meditating, can't you see?
		Jacques does two hours of yoga
		before going down.  I can take a
		five minute nap, can't I?

The boat stops.  The anchor is thrown over board.

The sailors, technicians and officials are getting ready
for the competition.  Today is ENZO'S turn to dive.  A man
is hooking a plaque indicating the depth (324 feet) onto a
lead disk which he heaves into the water on a cable.


INT.  YACHT - DOCTOR'S CABIN - DAY

A medic is bending over ENZO, taking his blood pressure.

ROBERTO pulls the tuxedo jacket down.  The doctor puts a
blood pressure band around ENZO'S upper arm, pumps it up.
He listens with his stethoscope.

					DOCTOR
		Mr. Molinari, I'm terribly sorry but
		I cannot allow you to dive in such
		an advanced state of exhaustion.

ENZO jumps to his feet, grabs the doctor by his lapels,
lifts him in the air.

					ENZO
			   (outraged)
		What do you know about the sea?
		Huh?  Nothing!  So you just put your
		tubes and tin cans away.  The sea is
		mine!  I know when she is ready for
		me and when she isn't.  And today,
		she is ready.  Understand?

					DOCTOR
		You dive at your own risk.  You're
		been warned.

ENZO smiles and pats the doctor on the shoulder.

					ENZO
		Brave.


EXT.  YACHT - ON DIVING PLATFORM

It's a large float, rigged to the stern of the Committee
Boat.  ROBERTO and an assistant help ENZO down the swim
ladder to the platform.  He's wearing a wet suit and fins.
He flip-flops to the end of the platform.

ROBERTO hands him his mask.  The goggles are filled with
polystyrene to eliminate as much air pressure as possible.
Only two pinholes to see through.  The mask fits tightly
over his nose.  When ENZO puts it on, he looks like an
astonished insect.  ENZO breathes faster and faster.
ROBERTO holds the wire controlling the weighted diving
apparatus.  ENZO crosses himself, takes a last long gulp
of air.

ROBERTO releases the weight.  It sinks and drags ENZO
down, he quickly disappears into the dark water...


BLACK AND WHITE

But this is JACQUES as he was a child.  He swims along the
bottom, finds and picks up a gold coin.  We can see its
ancient markings, a youth on a dolphin.

JACQUES looks up.  In front of him is a dolphin, floating
vertically, still, apparently just watching.  JACQUES
isn't scared anymore.  But every time he swims toward the
dolphin, it moves further away.  It finally disappears.


INT.  HOTEL ROOM - JACQUES - DAY

He sits bolt upright in bed, awakened by his dream.  He
looks around the room, trying to get his bearings.

JOHANA is asleep in a chair across the room.  On the wall
behind her, her last nights dress is drying on a hanger.
She's wrapped up in a hotel bathrobe fast asleep.

JACQUES finally awake from his dream, sees JOHANA
sleeping.  He walks over to her, touches her shoulder.
She wakes up, starts out of the chair.  She grabs the
blanket to cover herself, and in doing so, a book falls on
the floor.  It's one of his.

					JOHANA
		You scared me!

JACQUES picks up the book.  JOHANA smiles.

					JOHANA
		Just checking up on your family.
			   (then embarrassed)
		I guess I was drunker than I thought
		and the idea of going back to my
		hotel in a wet dress... Well...

					JACQUES
		I'm glad you stayed.  Thank you.

					JOHANA
			   (getting up)
		I'd better get back now.

					JACQUES
		You... You wouldn't want to spend
		the day with me?

She sits back in her chair, amazed that he would even ask.

					JACQUES
			   (self conscious)
		... No?

					JOHANA
		No?  Huh?
			   (she says "No" as if
			    she had asked the
			    question)
		Yes, of course!!


EXT.  MARINELAND - TAORMINA - DAY

JACQUES and JOHANA enter the dolphinarium.  JOHANA is
wearing an old pair of JACQUES SHORTS along with an
oversized T-shirt and rolled up sweater.  She seems quite
pleased with her new attire.

JACQUES and JOHANA walk straight through MARINELAND and
head toward the dolphin pool.  It's pretty crowded, mostly
kids.

The dolphins are lying motionless at the bottom of the
pool.  The trainer is tired of throwing fish in the pool
and getting absolutely no reaction.

					JACQUES
		What's the matter?

					TRAINER
		I don't understand.  We've tried for
		two days.  They won't eat.  They
		won't perform.  It's since we got
		the new one.

CLOSE ON DOLPHIN

surfacing.  It thrusts its head over the edge of the pool,
looks to JACQUES and SPEAKS.

					JACQUES
		Is she the new one?

Surprised, the trainer nods.

JOHANA looks over at JACQUES then at the dolphin.  She
doesn't understand.

					JOHANA
		How can you tell it's a female?

					JACQUES
		... The way she moves.

Three other dolphins gather around the one that JACQUES is
patting.

JACQUES is staring at the female dolphin.  It looks like
the animal is trying to tell him something.  Suddenly the
dolphin grabs him by the sleeve and pulls him into the
pool.


UNDERWATER - DOLPHIN POOL

JACQUES hangs onto the dolphin's muzzle.  Let's it pull
him along.  The dolphin swims to a far corner of the pool,
and pulls JACQUES to the bottom.  The other dolphins
circle above.


EXT.  DOLPHIN POOL - DAY

JACQUES pops up.  As he does, three dolphins leap in the
air behind him.  JOHANA walks closer to the pool.  She is
so excited by what JACQUES is doing, she finally falls
into the pool.

After a while, JACQUES gets out of the pool and helps
JOHANA out.

					TRAINER
		Did you ever think of trying the
		public pool?

					JOHANA
		He's a dolphin specialist.

					TRAINER
		In that case what's wrong with the
		new one?  Is she sick or not.

					JACQUES
			   (taking his time to
			    answer)
		Not the way you mean.

					TRAINER
		What am I supposed to do?  Do I call
		the dealer...?  The investment, you
		understand... I certainly am
		entitled to complain!

					JACQUES
		It's going to cost you more than you
		think!

JACQUES turns around and walks off.  JOHANA catches up
with him.

					JACQUES
		She's not like the others.  She
		can't stand to be away from the sea.

					JOHANA
			   (impressed)
		How do you know that?

					JACQUES
			   (stopping)
		I don't know, I just feel it.


INT.  HALL - HOTEL - DAY

JACQUES and JOHANA are walking across the corridor.

ENZO walks up to them, followed by his tribe.  Everybody
is congratulating him.

ROBERTO is screaming, MAMMA MOLINARI is crying.  ENZO
smiles as he talks back to them.  He sees JACQUES.

					ENZO
			   (screaming)
		Ah!  Jacques!

ENZO grabs hold of his shoulders.  JACQUES and JOHANA are
completely soaked.

					ENZO
		Don't be sad, I only took back what
		was mine.

He gives JACQUES the diving plaque, it reads 280 feet.

					ENZO
		Here, it's a present.

JOHANA and JACQUES smile at each other.  JACQUES has won
his bet.

					JACQUES
			   (touched)
		... Thank you.

ENZO slaps him on the shoulder.

					ENZO
			   (to Johana)
		Tonight we're having a little party
		among ourselves.  8 o'clock in my
		suite?

					JOHANA
		Okay.

ENZO walks off then turns back toward them.  He whispers
in JACQUES' ear.

					ENZO
		Tell me... Can you explain why you
		are soaking wet?

A beat.

					JOHANA
		... We're in training.

ENZO walks off.


INT.  HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Three formally dressed officials are waiting in front of
one of the hotel rooms.  One of them holds a medal in his
hand, a glass of champagne in the other.

					NOVELLI
			   (through the door)
		Mr. Roberto, tell your brother to be
		reasonable.  Everyone is waiting for
		him upstairs.  The photographers are
		there, the press...

					ROBERTO (O.S.)
		He can't, he's indisposed.

					NOVELLI
			   (trying to keep his
			    calm)
		Shall we call a doctor?

					ROBERTO
		No, it's okay.  Mamma is going to
		try something.

JACQUES and JOHANA walk up from the other side of the hall
and stop in front of the same door.

					NOVELLI
		Mr. Mayol, help us.  He refuses to
		receive his medal and everybody is
		waiting for him up there.  We
		already have problems with the press
		because of the danger, and if we
		don't even have the divers help...!

					JACQUES
			   (dubious)
		... I'll do my best.

					NOVELLI
		That's very kind of you.

JACQUES knocks on the door.

					JACQUES
		It's Jacques... Mayol!

A beat.  Then ENZO opens the door himself.

					ENZO
		Jacques!  My friend!  Come on in!

The officials look at each other baffled.

					NOVELLI
		Mr. Enzo Molinari, allow me to
		impress upon you the importance of
		your attending the Award Ceremony...
		For the press...

					ENZO
			   (loosing his temper)
		I think my brother told you I was
		indisposed, that should do it, no?
		I'm allowed to be indisposed, right?
		So, you just tell the press that the
		"big" Enzo Molinari, overwhelmed by
		his inspiring descent to 324 feet,
		will not be able to receive this
		trinket because he is...

He looks inquisitively at the three men.  ENZO looses his
temper.

					ENZO
		Because he is?!

					ONE OF THE THREE MEN
		... Indisposed.

					ENZO
			   (smiling)
		Brave!

He slams the door in their face.


INT.  HOTEL - ENZO'S ROOM - NIGHT

					JACQUES
		Tell me, why don't you go and get
		your medal?

					ENZO
		Because pasta should be eaten "Al
		Dente".  So the trinket will just
		have to wait a bit.

ENZO takes JACQUES by the shoulder.  Inside his room is
absolute chaos:  dancing, singing, eating.  Wet suits hung
out to dry everywhere.  MAMMA MOLINARI is whipping up
mountains of spaghetti on an improvised stove in the
middle of the room.  A lot of smoke... steam... color...
noise... All of Italy crammed into a few square feet.

JOHANA taken in by the warm atmosphere, sits in a corner
of the room.  JACQUES walks over and sits down at her
side.

					ENZO
			   (to Mamma)
		Mamma!  La pasta?!

					MAMMA MOLINARI
		Arrivo!  Arrivo!

She points at ROBERTO who is taking forever to grate the
cheese.  ENZO grabs the guitar from his other brother's
hands and starts playing.

					ENZO
		... It's easy.  You go down.  You
		come up.
			   (to Johana)
		... Right, Johana?

					JOHANA
			   (smiling)
		Congratulations, Enzo.

					ENZO
		Don't you agree, Jacques?

					JACQUES
		... You always were the best.

ENZO laughs then sees his mother.

					ENZO
		Ah!  La pasta!

ENZO starts singing in Italian.  MAMMA MOLINARI serves the
pasta, ROBERTO follows her around, sprinkling his cheese
on the plates.  She serves JOHANA a huge plate of pasta,
enough for three giants.

					MAMMA MOLINARI
			   (with a smile)
		Buon appetito, Signorina!

JOHANA who isn't even hungry, grins uncertainly.  JACQUES
has walked up to ENZO.  He doesn't dare ask his question.

					ENZO
			   (smiling)
		What's the matter?  You still have a
		bunch of things to ask me?  You want
		to know the price of tea in China of
		how we landed on the moon?  Is that
		it?

ENZO laughs.  JACQUES is serious.

					JACQUES
		No, I have to ask you a favor...
			   (a beat)
		You're the only one who'll
		understand.

					ENZO
			   (seriously)
		... I'm listening.


INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT

					MAMMA MOLINARI
		Tutto va bene?

The three officials are eating pasta, plates on their
knees.  Their mouths are too full to speak, they nod
enthusiastically.

					NOVELLI
			   (mouth full)
		Gracie mille, chignora.

MAMMA MOLINARI smiles and slams the door.


INT.  FIAT - NIGHT

JACQUES is driving, JOHANA sits beside him.  ENZO crammed
in the back seat, very uncomfortably, because of a
stretcher which takes up all the space.

They are dressed as they were at ENZO'S party.

					ENZO
			   (leaning forward)
		Hey!  Will you slow down!  When did
		you learn how to drive?

					JACQUES
		Driving isn't the problem, it's
		remembering the right road.

JACQUES runs a red light.

					ENZO
		And the lights!  Running lights,
		stealing stretchers...!  You'll have
		us in jail.

					JOHANA
		Enzo, stop bitching, will you?


EXT.  MARINELAND PARKING LOT - FIAT - NIGHT

They get out of the car.  JACQUES starts to change into
his swimming trunks.  ENZO shakes his head, can't believe
he's really come along.  He laughs and starts undressing.


INT./ EXT.  FIAT - STREET TAORMINA - NIGHT

It's a very narrow street.  The car moves down it quickly.
JACQUES drives.  The back seat is now occupied by the
dolphin.  Its nose and tail protruding through the
windows.

JOHANA is in the front seat, turned around, spraying the
dolphin with a watering can.


EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

They have driven to the public beach.  They slowly lower
the stretcher into the water.  The dolphin, leaving the
stretcher, swims around a little but won't go away.

He won't leave JACQUES.

					JACQUES
			   (moved)
		You can't stay here!  Come on!  Go
		away!

JACQUES swims off with her for a while.

ENZO walks back toward the car with the stretcher.

JOHANA, standing by the water looks at JACQUES and the
dolphin who are swimming off together.

JACQUES keeps splashing the dolphin as they swim.

					ENZO
		You can stop that now, she has all
		the water she needs.

JACQUES cannot get rid of the dolphin.

					ENZO
		All right, we did it.  Let's go back
		to the party.

JACQUES and the dolphin can't seem to part.

					JACQUES
		Just one minute.

JOHANA is worried, she walks up to ENZO who goes back into
the water and takes JACQUES by the arm.

					ENZO
		Jacques, the dolphin is home now.
		And that's where we're going.  Come
		on!  Hurry up now.  Our girlfriend
		is freezing over there.

The dolphin starts swimming off.  JACQUES follows ENZO
half-heartedly.


EXT.  JOHANA'S PENSION - NIGHT

ENZO stops the FIAT in front of the pension.  The three of
them get out.  ENZO hasn't bothered to dress.

JOHANA heads for the gate, she obviously has no desire of
leaving JACQUES.

					JOHANA
		Well, good night, then...

					ENZO
		You going to sleep here, all by
		yourself?

					JOHANA
		Yes...

She looks over at the pension, having a hard time
concealing her lack of enthusiasm.

					JOHANA
		... It's a comfortable place.

					ENZO
		Sinister is what I'd call it...!
		Ours is so much cheerful!  Why don't
		you come and stay with me... There's
		plenty of room in my suite.

					JOHANA
			   (smiles)
		The Mamma's there too.

					ENZO
			   (face clouds up)
		Yes, the Mamma is is there.

					JOHANA
		Good night Enzo, Good night Jacques.

					JACQUES
		Good night.

					ENZO
			   (to Jacques)
		You don't need a stretcher to take
		her with you.  You know that, don't
		you?

					JACQUES
		What?

					ENZO
		The dolphins aren't the only ones
		who don't feel very good sometimes.

					JOHANA
		Leave it alone, Enzo, it's okay.

She rings the bell for the concierge, then looks back at
JACQUES.

					JOHANA
		Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?

					JACQUES
			   (lost)
		Uh... Yes, of course!

The concierge comes out and opens the iron gate for her.
JOHANA disappears into the parc.  ENZO turns to JACQUES.

					ENZO
		You really do have a few things to
		learn about women!


EXT.  SEA - DAY

The sun is rising on a rough sea.  The Committee Boat is
anchored in the open sea, 600 feet above the sea bed.


EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - BAY OF TAORMINA - DAY

JACQUES who is on the foredeck of a boat at sea has just
laid a towel down before him.  He's suited up, sitting in
the lotus position, staring straight ahead, clearly self-
hypnotized.

JOHANA, NOVELLI, and other officials are in the stern of
the boat watching last minute preparations.

The scuba divers in brightly colored wetsuits and
aqualungs, flop out onto the diving platform, plunge into
the water, disappear.

					JOHANA
		What are they for?

					NOVELLI
		They're paramedics.  They wait at
		180 feet.

					JOHANA
			   (just checking)
		If there was a problem, they could
		do something right?

					NOVELLI
		Of course, that's what they're for.

JOHANA sees scuba divers with weird air tanks.

					JOHANA
			   (pointing)
		... And those?

					NOVELLI
		Those are the divers who go down 300
		to 330 feet.  They dive with a
		Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that
		depth, compressed air is too
		dangerous because it contains carbon
		dioxide.

					JOHANA
		What's that little air bottle on the
		machine?

					NOVELLI
		That isn't for the divers actually.
		It's for the balloon.  It blows up
		and pulls the diver up like an
		elevator.  Without it, with the
		pressure at the bottom, the diver
		would just stay pinned to the sea
		bed.

					JOHANA
			   (shocked)
		But doesn't Jacques dive without
		anything?

					NOVELLI
			   (smiling)
		Yes... It's magic.


INT.  BOAT - DAY - LATER

On the boat, NOVELLI checks his watch.  JACQUES comes out
of his room.  He's dressed to dive.  He ignores everyone
as he goes down the ladder to the diving platform.  He
seems to be in another world.  All sounds coming to him
are drowned out.


EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - DAY

JACQUES sits in the diver's slot.  Opens his eyes slowly
and looks around.  He puts his flippers on, an assistant
stands at his side.

HIS POV

The figures on the platform are vague, the VOICES are
GARBLED and incomprehensible.  Moving almost in slow
motion he raises three fingers.

					TECHNICIAN
		Tre minuti!

BACK TO SCENE

Ten other divers have waited for this signal to dive.
They disappear one by one into the blue.

JACQUES uses contact lenses instead of a mask.  He puts
them in, and now, his view of the world is as distorted as
his hearing... bodies deform... sounds fade...

Already euphoric from the vast amount of oxygen in his
system, he moves into another reality altogether... seems
to empty himself out.

					TECHNICIAN
		Due minuti!

JACQUES fills a small tube with water.  Pours it into his
nostrils... tilts his head... then lets it run out... He
puts on his gloves... all his movements are slow, he seems
to be operating in a different time zone... He seems
unable to take his eyes off the water.


EXT.  END OF DIVING PLATFORM - DAY

					TECHNICIAN
		Uno minuto!

JACQUES puts his nose clip on.  He puts his hand on the
gueuse.  Closes his eyes and inhales slowly.  Then he
takes a sudden last breath, nods, the technician releases
the gueuse and in one flashing movement, he disappears.


UNDERWATER

The gueuse slides down the cable.  JACQUES hangs on like a
ribbon in the wind, past a marker, 90 feet down.

Above him, the boat disappears from sight.

He moves faster and faster... through a sea that looks
like a cloudy sky.  The light fades rapidly around him.

Below, white spotlights pierce an ocean dark as night.
JACQUES reaches them in a matter of seconds.  Turns the
brakes, brings his machine to a halt, 180 feet down.

The medics are waiting for him there.  They take his
pulse.  Check his eyes... 15 seconds... normal... the
bubbles from there scuba tanks churn the water around
them...

JACQUES closes his eyes... a tap on the shoulder, he
releases the brake on the gueuse.  Plunges further, this
time into pitch black.

Below him a faint spotlight glows on the bottom.  He
reaches it and the dark diver moves to him.  JACQUES
brakes his machine.  Moving very slowly, turns his body
right side up.  Like a sleep walker, JACQUES starts to
take the plaque off the plumbline... pauses in the middle
of the gesture.

The dark diver flashes the high sign to JACQUES, thumb and
forefinger touching, fingers extended, all clear.  JACQUES
does not respond.  The diver repeats the signal.  JACQUES
does not respond.

The diver taps JACQUES on the shoulder... a beat... and
then JACQUES responds, thumb and forefinger touching okay.
Slowly, reluctantly, he wraps his hand around the handle
of the balloon.

The dark diver quickly turns the handle for him.  The
balloon inflates.  JACQUES hangs on... lets it carry him
up.

At the plague marking 210 feet, JACQUES lets go of the the
balloon.  With a burst of speed, it darts toward the
surface.

JACQUES follows slowly, undulating like a fish... He's
getting warm now... He closes his eyes.

Passes the medical control without stopping... without
even seeing it like someone asleep.

He's moving faster now, toward the warmth, toward the air.
JACQUES opens his eyes, watches the lights grow brighter.

The silhouette of the boat comes back into view.  60 feet
to go.


EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - DAY

In slow motion JACQUES' hand holding the plaque breaks out
of the water followed by his arm, in one continuous
movement, his shoulders and head.

He gasps for air.

A trickle of blood comes from his nose.

Flashbulbs flicker, spectators cheer.


EXT.  OPEN SEA - A DOLPHIN

The dolphin, the one rescued last night, leaps into the
air, in perfect harmony with JACQUES' triumph.


EXT.  DOLPHINARIUM

The dolphins in the dolphinarium leap into the air at the
exact same moment.

The trainer doesn't understand what's going on.


EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - DAY

JACQUES falls back into the water.  Two divers run over
and pull him up onto the dock.

JACQUES seems completely dazed, almost in a trance.  He
slowly comes to and starts screaming louder and louder.
It is the scream of his body in need of the surface,
reality and the feel of the land.

JOHANA is terrified.  She can hardly breathe.  Everybody
applauds.


EXT.  HOTEL DOCK - DAY

JACQUES and JOHANA walk down the gangway.  NOVELLI has
lead the way and the news has been spread.

JACQUES looks very weak and punchy.

JOHANA holds him up.

The spectators applaud as he goes by.  Intrigued, JACQUES
looks at them all.

					JOHANA
			   (excited)
		Jacques, listen to the applause.

He doesn't respond.

					JOHANA
			   (trying to keep up)
		Jacques, you set a world record.

					JACQUES
		I did?

					JOHANA
		Aren't you happy?  Don't you feel
		proud...?  I feel proud and all I
		did was watch.

He is staring at her, he's returning to the real world.
Slowly he smiles.

She grabs hold of his arm and gives him a proud kiss on
the mouth.  JACQUES is a little stunned.


EXT.  TERRACE - SWIMMING POOL - DAY

ENZO walks into the hotel, his arms filled with packages.
He sees JACQUES and JOHANA.  From the look on his face we
can tell he knows that JACQUES has beaten his record.  He
deliberately puts on a huge smile as he walks over to
them.


INT.  TERRACE - SWIMMING POOL

					ENZO
		Congratulations Jacques!  It's
		wonderful!  Wonderful!

He drops his packages on the bar and gives Jacques a big
hug.

					ENZO
		I'm happy for you!

He kisses him and starts handing out his presents.

					ENZO
			   (to Jacques)
		Here...
			   (to Johana)
		Here...

					JACQUES
		What is it?

					ENZO
		Little presents, nothing much... I
		knew it, I just knew it!  Look here!

He holds up his arm:  he is wearing two watches.

					ENZO
		Roberto's watch!  I won it!  He bet
		that you couldn't beat me!

JACQUES opens his present.  It's a little ceramic dolphin.

					ENZO
		You still collect them?

					JACQUES
		Yes.

					ENZO
		You don't have that one, do you?

					JACQUES
		No.  Thank you.  It's really
		beautiful.

					ENZO
		Oh it's nothing.  I knew it.  I told
		Roberto "He's very good that little
		Frenchman, very good".  I lost my
		title but I won a watch!

JOHANA has opened her package.  It's a big plate with a
text engraved on it.

					JOHANA
		Is it a poem?

					ENZO
		No, it's the recipe for spaghetti
		"Frutti del mare".
			   (to Jacques)
		You see I was right in getting you
		out here.  You're a world champion,
		my friend!

JACQUES has opened the last small package.  It's a
measuring tape.  He looks at it without understanding.

ENZO explains:

					ENZO
		It's a measuring tape.

He grabs hold of the tape and lets it roll to the ground.

					ENZO
		You see this is your record, three
		feet more than mine!  Looking at it
		from here, it doesn't look like
		much, does it?

JACQUES looks at him without saying a word.

ENZO hands him the measuring tape.

					ENZO
		Keep your little measuring tape, my
		friend, it will be a nice souvenir
		when I beat you next.

ENZO taps his shoulder and smiles.


INT.  ELEVATOR ASCENDING - JACQUES - JOHANA

They're locked in a long kiss.  He untucks the bottom of
her shirt and slides his hands under it.


INT.  HOTEL ROOM - JACQUES - JOHANA - TWILIGHT

They're in bed, making love in their fashion.  Moonlight
shines in the silver sea.  In the background are the
lights of the bay of TAORMINA.

LATER

JACQUES is in bed with JOHANA.  They are both asleep.
Suddenly, he sits up, as he always does after his
recurrent dream.

He's wide awake, looks over at her sleeping.  She sleeps
peacefully like a baby.  Quietly, gently, he eases out of
bed and walks to the open window.

He stands on the balcony, staring at the sea.  Then in the
distance in the moonlight, a dolphin leaps out of the
water, once, twice, a third time.

JACQUES laughs and goes back to the bed where he sits down
next to JOHANA.  She is still sound asleep.


EXT.  HOTEL - PIER - NIGHT

JACQUES quickly gets into one of his diving suits.  He
puts on his flippers.  The dolphin is still jumping in and
out of the water.  JACQUES jumps off the pier and swims
over to her.


INT.  JACQUES' HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

JOHANA rolls over and feels the bed in her sleep.

JACQUES' absence wakes her.

					JOHANA
		Jacques?

She gets up and walks over to the balcony.  She doesn't
see anything.


EXT.  PIER - NIGHT

JOHANA walks down the pier and notices the little pile of
clothes JACQUES has left behind.  She looks around but
still can't see anything.  She decides to sit next to the
pile of clothes, and waits, her eyes riveted to the sea.


EXT.  PIER - DAWN

The sky has just begun to light up again.  JOHANA is still
sitting next to the pile of clothes.

She is wearing JACQUES' sweater.  She looks sad, yet
serene.  The look of a woman who has been thinking over
the situation and who has made up her mind.

Tired, JACQUES swims back to the pier.  It looks as if he
has come out of nowhere.

He is exhausted.  He takes off his flippers and gets up
onto the pier in front of JOHANA.  He looks at her, a
little surprised to find her there.

					JACQUES
			   (warm)
		What are you doing here?

She answers in a far away voice, with the same serene
sadness.

					JOHANA
		I'm going to leave, Jacques.

Dripping with water, he sits down next to her.  His face
is drawn from fatigue.  She continues.

					JOHANA
		I'm going back home.

					JACQUES
		Why?

					JOHANA
		Because one shouldn't fall in love
		with creatures from the sea.

					JACQUES
		I'm not from the sea... I don't
		understand what you're talking
		about.

					JOHANA
		Yes you do.  You know exactly what
		I'm talking about.  You're afraid I
		want to hold onto you, and I do,
		but you're not ready... at least not
		for me.

					JACQUES
		But it's not true, I feel good with
		you... It feels right...

She looks at him for a moment, then takes his face in her
hands and rests it on her bosom, as if a small child.

					JOHANA
		I've got to get back to the hotel...
		and get my suitcase packed.


INT.  TRAIN STATION - JACQUES - JOHANA - DAY

The train station faces the sea.  JACQUES and JOHANA are
standing on the platform, amid others.  In the distance we
hear the rumble and whistle of a train.

JOHANA gets on the train.  The station master blows his
whistle.

					JACQUES
		Will... will we see each other
		again?

JOHANA'S eyes are filled with tears.

					JOHANA
		Take good care of yourself, Jacques.

The train starts pulling out of the station.

					JACQUES
		Where can I call you?  Johana, tell
		me where can I call you?

JOHANA doesn't answer.  JACQUES stands helplessly in the
station, his eyes filled with tears.


INT.  ENZO'S ROOM - DAY

ENZO opens the door of his suite.  His hair is messed up,
he's got "sheet prints" on his face and is wearing the top
of a diving suit.

					JACQUES
		Can I come in?

					ENZO
		No problem, I enjoy talking in my
		sleep.

ENZO walks back into the apartment and crashes on the bed.
He's lying on his stomach.  JACQUES walks in and lets
himself drop in a chair.

					ENZO
		Wake me up at 11:00.

ENZO closes his eyes.  JACQUES looks over at the clock, it
says 11:25.  JACQUES doesn't say anything and stares
blankly out of the window.

					ENZO
			   (opening one eye)
		Hmmm!  Something wrong?

JACQUES doesn't answer.

					ENZO
		Is it the girl?

JACQUES stares out the window.

					ENZO
		Did she leave?

No answer.  ENZO gets up and sits on the side of the bed.

					ENZO
		Hey!  I'm going to take care of you!
		I've got this job, on an oil rig, no
		sweat!  I'm taking you along... Come
		on!  Get your bags packed!  You're
		coming with me, I tell you!

He pats him on the back.

					ENZO
		We'll make a great team, the two of
		us.  You'll see!


EXT.  OIL DRILLING PLATFORM - AT SEA - DAY

The platform shines in the morning light.

There are several stories of crew housing and offices
above the deck.  Long steel legs disappear into the
swelling slate-gray ocean.  We hear WHOP-WHOP-WHOP of a
helicopter.


EXT.  HELICOPTER - PLATFORM

The helicopter is landing.  Crewmen rush to secure it to
the oil rig's deck.  Doors open and two passengers get
off:  JACQUES and ENZO.  They each carry a duffel bag of
personal belongings.  They're both wearing fluorescent
diving suits.

The DRILLING SUPERINTENDENT comes to meet them.

					SUPERINTENDENT
		Mayol, Molinari...?

They nod.

					SUPERINTENDENT
		We've been waiting for you for three
		days.  Goddamnit!

					ENZO
		Is that the way you talk to the best
		diver in the world...?  And to his
		friend Jacques Mayol!

The SUPERINTENDENT smiles sourly, and gestures to a
crewman.

					SUPERINTENDENT
		Show them their quarters.

Five minutes later, JACQUES and ENZO are following the
crewman.

					JACQUES
			   (whispering)
		He doesn't like us.

					ENZO
		So what!?  His job is to hand out
		the paychecks.  And he does that
		very well, let me tell you.


INT.  DIVING CAPSULE - DAY

The diving capsule, suspended by cables, begins its
descent through a trap door in the deck.  It plunges into
the sea.

The three men in the capsule are:  JACQUES, ENZO and the
tough looking CAPSULE COMMANDER NOIREUTER, who is much too
professional for ENZO'S tastes.

ENZO watches through a porthole while the COMMANDER
concentrates on the control console.  He runs through a
checklist of systems.  JACQUES responds with a "check" as
he verifies each one.  ENZO is already bored and fed up by
the procedures.

JACQUES is lost in thought, they don't look cheerful.

					ENZO
			   (suddenly)
		You still thinking about her?

JACQUES doesn't answer.  ENZO goes on.

					ENZO
		Don't think about her anymore!  Let
		me tell you, you're just making
		yourself unhappy!  There are so many
		women in the world!

He takes a cigarette from a pouch in his diving suit and
stares at NOIREUTER.

					ENZO
		Plenty of women everywhere right?

					NOIREUTER
			   (coldly)
		Smoking is absolutely forbidden.

					ENZO
		It isn't lit yet.

					NOIREUTER
		You shouldn't even carry cigarettes
		on board!

					ENZO
		Listen we're not supposed to piss
		either but that doesn't stop you
		from carrying "it" on board?!

					NOIREUTER
			   (stubborn)
		The rules are the rules.

					ENZO
			   (checking out this
			    creature)
		... What's your name again?

					NOIREUTER
		Noireuter.

					ENZO
		And where did you say you were from?

					NOIREUTER
		I didn't say...
			   (contemptuous)
		Brussels!

ENZO smiles sardonically, shaking his head very slowly.
The COMMANDER'S answer explains it all.


INT.  DRILLING PLATFORM - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

A technician is overlooking the capsule descent on a
video screen.

The SUPERINTENDENT watches over the technician's shoulder.

					TECHNICIAN
		They're at 450 feet.


INT.  DIVING CAPSULE - DAY

ENZO, a cigarette dangling from his lips, looks through
the porthole.

					ENZO
		... I was seventeen, I loved her so
		much I tried to die for her.  Two
		years later I couldn't even remember
		her name!  Let me tell you, time
		erases everything!

					JACQUES
		I don't want to erase anything.

					ENZO
		You'd rather think about it and make
		yourself miserable?

					JACQUES
			   (after thinking about
			    it)
		... Yes.

					ENZO
			   (smiles)
		I give you this.  You're stubborn...
		Dumb, but stubborn.

					JACQUES
			   (taking it as a
			    compliment)
		Thank you.


INT.  CAPSULE - DAY

The technician fiddles with a few knobs.

					TECHNICIAN
		Minus 800 feet.  End of descent.


INT.  DIVING CAPSULE

The diving capsule ends its descent.  The COMMANDER turns
to ENZO and JACQUES who is still staring out the porthole.

					NOIREUTER
			   (with a Mickey Mouse
			    voice)
		You have enough air for 15 minutes.

ENZO bursts out laughing.

					ENZO
			   (with Donald Ducks
			    voice)
		What's with the voice?

					NOIREUTER
		It's nothing.  It's just the helium,
		because of the air pressure.

					ENZO
			   (worried)
		And... does the voice come back?

					NOIREUTER
		For others, yes... For you, who
		knows?

					ENZO
			   (still a little
			    worried, to Jacques)
		Try speaking to me?

					JACQUES
			   (with Daffy Ducks
			    voice)
		I don't find this funny.  We were
		having a serious conversation.

ENZO and JACQUES burst out laughing.  They keep these same
voice till the end of the scene.

ENZO pulls out a tiny silver flask out of his pocket.

					ENZO
			   (to Jacques)
		Here, give me your finger.

ENZO taps a drop onto JACQUES' finger, then on his own.
Then NOIREUTER blows up.

					NOIREUTER
			   (in a panic)
		Is that alcohol?  Are you out of
		your mind?  Alcohol is strictly
		forbidden.

					ENZO
			   (loosing his temper)
		Hey!  D'you have any other
		complaints?  Just make a list and
		we'll stick it on the porthole!
		Okay?

ENZO pours a second drop on his own finger.

					ENZO
		Go on, suck your finger.

JACQUES hesitates.  ENZO has no qualms about it and sucks
his own finger.  NOIREUTER is petrified.

					NOIREUTER
		Are you crazy?  At this pressure?

					JACQUES
		It's very deep down here.

					ENZO
		Come on, suck your finger, you'll be
		seeing mermaids everywhere!

JACQUES, convinced sucks his finger too.  ENZO smiles.
The alcohol has an immediate effect on them.

					ENZO
			   (to Jacques)
		A thousand commanders and we get a
		Belgian from Alcoholic's Anonymous.


UNDERWATER

ENZO gets out of the diving capsule, head first.
He is connected to the capsule by a number of cables.

JACQUES, who follows him, gets completely tangled up in
them.  They are both hilariously drunk.


INT.  DRILLING PLATFORM - CONTROL ROOM

The SUPERINTENDENT hears them laughing through the control
room speakers.  He flips a communication switch.

					SUPERINTENDENT
		Can you hear me?  What's going on?
			   (to the technician)
		Are you sure you're on the right
		channel?

The technician nods back to him.


UNDERWATER

The two divers have gotten to the spot they are supposed
to be working on.  They have their arms around each other
and are dancing.

NOIREUTER watches them through the porthole.  He shakes
his head in complete disbelief.


INT.  CONTROL ROOM

We hear the two friends humming the tune of a Viennese
waltz.

					SUPERINTENDENT
		If those guys are playing a radio
		down there they'd just better watch
		out!!


INT.  JOHANA'S APARTMENT

SALLY is talking away, pointing around the apartment.

					SALLY
		... And if we repaint the walls,
		we'll need new curtains, you put the
		painters on you Visa and I'll do the
		curtains on American Express... for
		the couch there's Bloomingdales...
		or are you still over your limit?

					JOHANA
			   (flatly)
		Way past it.

					SALLY
		Does that have a hidden meaning?

					JOHANA
		No.  I'm just depressed.

					SALLY
		You look it too.  You haven't been
		working out, you haven't been taking
		your vitamins!  You haven't been
		drinking your herbs, you haven't
		been...

					JOHANA
			   (stopping her)
		I know, I know!  I'm a terrible
		person...
			   (after a beat)
		It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.

					SALLY
		What is it honey... the frenchy?

					JOHANA
			   (tentatively)
		Do you think I should have stayed?
		Don't you think maybe I should have
		stayed?  I've been a jerk, right?
			   (then, emphatically)
		I should have stayed!  I was
		supposed to be in love... I was in
		love!  I am in love, why did I act
		like a bitch?  He went swimming.
		All the man did was go swimming!  I
		must be crazy.  It was too good to
		be true.

					SALLY
		Vitamins, exercise, herb tea... and
		see a doctor, will ya?


INT.  DOCTOR'S OFFICE - JOHANA - DAY

The doctor enters with a folder, speaks to JOHANA

					DOCTOR
		Well Miss Cross, herbs aren't going
		to do the trick this time.

					JOHANA
			   (worried)
		It's serious, right?

					DOCTOR
		I think so.  You're pregnant...
		Congratulations!  If that's in
		order?

JOHANA breaks into a wide grin.

					JOHANA
		It's in order!  Thank you.  Thank
		you.

					DOCTOR
		I don't think it's me you have to
		thank.


INT.  DUFFY'S OFFICE - DUFFY - DAY

DUFFY is at his desk.  His lunch is spread out in front of
him.  Outside the window, the window-washers are eating
their lunch too.  JOHANA hurries in.

					DUFFY
		Good afternoon.

					JOHANA
			   (agitated)
		I came to make a clean breast of
		everything... the whole business.

					DUFFY
			   (bluffing, with his
			    mouth full of
			    sandwich)
		Yes.  Of course.  Very wise.

					JOHANA
			   (in a rush)
		Remember when I went to Italy and
		canceled the policy on the new
		stadium.  Well, we weren't being
		cheated by the Mafia or anybody
		except maybe by me...
			   (she sees the window-
			    washers)
		... Do they come for lunch everyday?
		I really went on my own business, to
		see a man that I happen to be in
		love with... and I'm glad I did it,
		but I'm sorry about the policy and
		I'll be happy to make up the money
		the company didn't get... of course
		just now I don't have...
			   (she checks a note
			    she's holding)
		One million, four hundred and ten
		thousand dollars.  But if you were
		to dock my salary, say, twenty
		dollars a week, in a few hundred
		years we'd be even... and I think
		this is where you fire me?

					DUFFY
			   (swallowing sandwich)
		You're right.  You're fired.

					JOHANA
		Will that interfere with my getting
		maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.

					DUFFY
		The Italian, I presume?

					JOHANA
		No.  He's French, he was just in
		Italy for the competition.

					DUFFY
			   (smiling)
		He seems to have won it.

					JOHANA
		Yes, isn't it wonderful?  I'm so
		happy.  I'll bet I'm the happiest
		pregnant fired person in the world!

She starts to leave... calls out to the window-washers.

					JOHANA
		Bon appetit and Adieu!


INT.  JOHANA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

JOHANA stares out of the bay window of her Manhattan
apartment.  Hesitant, she walks around her telephone.
Finally she makes up her mind, picks up her address book
and dials the number.

					JACQUES (V.O.)
		Hello?

					JOHANA
		It's me... Johana.


INT.  JACQUES' APARTMENT

JACQUES is on the telephone, in front of a little window
overlooking the sea.  He is very glad to hear her voice.

					JACQUES
		How are you?


INT.  JOHANA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

					JOHANA
		I got fired.

					JACQUES (V.O.)
		... That's funny... I had this job
		with Enzo... we got fired too.

JOHANA'S face lights up with a huge smile.

								    DISSOLVE TO:

LATER

JOHANA is still on the phone, sitting in front of the bay
window.  Day is dawning.

					JOHANA
			   (looking out at the
			    skyline)
		It's getting light out.

					JACQUES (V.O.)
		Here, it's getting dark.

JOHANA smiles.  She stretches, lies down on the carpeted
floor.  JACQUES seems to have gone through all topics of
conversation.

					JACQUES
		I've been thinking about you a lot,
		you know...

JOHANA is by now completely stretched out on the floor.

					JOHANA
		So have I.
			   (a beat)
		... Hello?

					JACQUES
		I'm still here.

					JOHANA
		Well, then, talk to me some more.

					JACQUES
		... It's hard you know.  You're so
		far away and I don't know what else
		to say.

					JOHANA
		Then, tell me a story.

					JACQUES
		Uh... Ah!  A story?

He turns around and sits on the window sill, his feet
dangling in mid air.

He looks at the sea, seeking inspiration.

					JACQUES
		Do you know how it is?
			   (starting again)
		Do you know what you're supposed to
		do to meet a mermaid?

					JOHANA
			   (with a smile)
		No... tell me.

					JACQUES
		You go down to the bottom of the
		sea, where the water isn't even blue
		anymore, where the sky is only a
		memory... and you float there,
		quietly, quietly and stay there...
		and you decide that you will die for
		them... Only then do they start
		coming out.  They come and greet you
		and they judge the love you have for
		them... If it's sincere.  If it's
		pure... They will be with you and
		take you away forever.

JOHANA listens with the abandon of a child being put to
sleep.


INT.  JACQUES' ROOM - ANTIBES

The sun hits the roof tops.  The sea is sparkling.
The phone rings on the window sill.  JACQUES answers.

					JACQUES
		Hello?

					JOHANA (V.O.)
		It's me again.

JACQUES smiles.

					JOHANA
			   (after a silence)
		I'm being a pain, huh?

					JACQUES
		... Not at all.

					JOHANA (V.O.)
		You sure?

					JACQUES
			   (smiling)
		Absolutely positive.

					JOHANA (V.O.)
		Okay.  In that case... I'm at the
		airport in Nice.

JACQUES doesn't know what to say.  He looks around him,
can't figure out what to do.

					JACQUES
			   (lost)
		Okay... huh, I'll be right over.


INT.  AIRPORT - DAY

JOHANA is standing in front of the airport.

JACQUES sees her.  They smile shyly at each other.


EXT.  STREET - NICE - OPPOSITE THE NEGRESCO HOTEL

JACQUES and JOHANA are sitting in the back of a taxi.  The
driver stops in front of the hotel.

					DRIVER
			   (loud)
		The Carlton!  Enjoy your siesta.

JACQUES and JOHANA look at each other.


INT.  HOTEL ROOM - JACQUES - JOHANA - DAY

The room is in semi-darkness, despite the blazing sunlight
coming through cracks in the shutters.  JACQUES and JOHANA
are making love.  JACQUES is on top of her, his whole body
covered in sweat.  The rumpled sheets and the movements of
their bodies suggest the movements of the sea.  ALL SOUNDS
are disproportionate and slightly distorted, they are
underwater...

ALL JOHANA'S reluctance has vanished.  Both of them act
like people who have never felt anything like this before.
A certain astonishment at the depth of their feeling.  An
increasing freedom.  All the muscles of their bodies
stretch to their limits.

JACQUES, progressively, finds himself disappearing.  His
image dissolves point by point... disintegrates into
unbroken blue... The effect creates the impression of
someone melting, the screen is now totally blue.

A thin, HIGH-PITCHED SOUND.

From the bottom of the image, a tiny pinpoint starts
TOWARD the CAMERA.  It is JACQUES, naked, swimming out of
the deep blue ocean toward the light as if he were coming
out of a dive.  He comes CLOSER and CLOSER to the
CAMERA...

Until his head almost touches the lens...

A sudden DEAFENING NOISE... and we find JACQUES on top of
JOHANA.  He looks down at her, speechless.

					JOHANA
			   (a little frightened)
		Are you okay?

After a long beat.

					JACQUES
		... I think I love you.


INT.  APARTMENT BUILDING - ANTIBES - DAY

JACQUES and JOHANA step out of the elevator of a 19th
century building.

JACQUES is carrying her suitcases.

					JOHANA
		Why did you take me to the hotel, if
		you live here.

					JACQUES
		You'll understand.

JACQUES rings the door bell and sticks his key in the
door.

					JOHANA
			   (surprised)
		Someone in there?

JACQUES nods and pushes the door open with the bags he's
carrying.  They enter a huge, very old apartment filled
with models and paintings of boats.

JACQUES leads JOHANA to the other end of the apartment.


INT.  BATHROOM - ON UNCLE LOUIS (SORT OF)

It's a huge old-fashioned bathroom.  The centerpiece is a
deep ancient bathtub on faded gild feet.  There's a
rippling shadow of a body under the bath water.

JOHANA gasps.

					JACQUES
		Don't be afraid.  It's my Uncle...
		Louis.

He goes to the tub and pinches the end of a tube.  UNCLE
LOUIS, underwater, has been breathing through it.  LOUIS'
head pops out of the water, furious.

					UNCLE LOUIS
		Assassin!

					JACQUES
			   (loud, as if speaking
			    to a deaf man)
		Uncle Louis, this is my friend
		Johana.

					UNCLE LOUIS
		Did you buy the cassettes?  The
		Wagner, the Berlioz?

					JACQUES
		I brought Johana to meet you.

					UNCLE LOUIS
		Are you crazy?  I have no use for a
		woman!  Since my accident.

					JACQUES
		No, no.  Johana is visiting me.

					JOHANA
			   (tentatively)
		Bonjour Monsieur... Louis.
			   (she looks to
			    Jacques)

					JACQUES
			   (whispering to
			    Johana)
		Uncle Louis.  He's a 75 year old
		amazing guy, isn't he?

					JOHANA
		I'm very pleased to meet you, Uncle
		Louis.

					UNCLE LOUIS
			   (to Johana)
		Did you bring the cassettes, the
		Wagner, the Berlioz?
			   (pointing to Jacques)
		This idiot never listens to anything
		I say.  Sometimes I wonder if he
		isn't deaf.

LOUIS climbs out of the bathtub, and pulls on a bathrobe.
Behind him he's pulling two insulated wires out of the
bathtub.  We see that they're connected to small
underwater speakers.  As they surface, incredibly LOUD
MUSIC BLASTS:  the finale of the "1812 Overture",
(trumpets, timpani, cannons, etc...) The sound fills the
room, the apartment, and probably all of ANTIBES.


INT.  DINING ROOM - JACQUES - JOHANA - LOUIS - LATER

The three of them are at the table.  There are a few
scraps on their plates on a threadbare lace tablecloth.

Incredibly LOUD SYMPHONIC MUSIC is PLAYING.  LOUIS is as
deaf as a fence post.

Everyone has to scream over the music.

					UNCLE LOUIS
		Where are you from, Henrietta?

					JACQUES
			   (correcting him)
		Johana... New York.

					UNCLE LOUIS
		What kind of name is that?  To be
		named after a city?

					JACQUES
			   (smiling)
		He doesn't hear too well.

					JOHANA
			   (yelling)
		I said I was from New York.

					UNCLE LOUIS
			   (yelling at Jacques)
		That explains it!  The best lays are
		from New York!

					JACQUES
		Uncle Louis!

					UNCLE LOUIS
		No, no.  It's true.  When I was in
		New York, oh boy!
			   (to Johana)
		Before my accident, you understand?
			   (then back to
			    Jacques)

JACQUES stands up and lowers the music.

					JACQUES
			   (impatient)
		Uncle Louis!  Johana is my friend.
		She's come to stay with me for a
		while.

					UNCLE LOUIS
		Good.  That way I'll see more of
		you... Where are you going to stay?

					JACQUES
		Well... here.

					UNCLE LOUIS
			   (outraged)
		In my apartment?

					JACQUES
			   (with a sigh)
		It's my apartment.

					UNCLE LOUIS
			   (jumping up)
		Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you
		were an orphan I nursed you at my
		breast.

					JACQUES
		Uncle Louis, we have a guest!

					UNCLE LOUIS
		I'm going to put a lock on the
		telephone.
			   (them calming down,
			    to Johana)
		Did you bring the cassettes?


INT.  BEDROOM - JACQUES - JOHANA

JACQUES' room looks like a diving equipment storage room
with a bed in it.  JACQUES notices JOHANA'S gaze.

					JACQUES
			   (solicitously)
		You think it'll be all right?
		You'll be comfortable here?

					JOHANA
			   (catching her breath)
		It's going to be... interesting.


EXT.  PORT OF ANTIBES - DAY

JACQUES, JOHANA and ROBERTO are waiting at the port.

					ROBERTO
			   (glancing at his
			    watch)
		... It's not like him to be late.
		Of course sometimes he doesn't show
		up at all.  Once in Capri, he...

					JOHANA
			   (interrupting)
		We get the picture, Roberto.
			   (looks over her
			    shoulder)
		Jacques, I think Louis needs help.

JACQUES turns around.  UNCLE LOUIS is a few yards behind
them at a fish stand on the dock.  He's holding up an eel
and screaming at the fishmonger.

					UNCLE LOUIS
			   (yelling)
		Two dollars for this!  This fish
		wasn't caught.  It died of cancer!

JACQUES shrugs his shoulders and gives up on the idea of
interfering.

					ROBERTO
			   (pointing)
		Here he comes!

A speed boat races along the water.  It's a beautiful
highly-varnished mahogany Riva.  It races into the port.
Standing at the helm, looking like Christopher Columbus
his hair brushed back by the wind, is ENZO.

Next to him hanging on to the windscreen is an impressive
six foot, dark haired beauty.  She has a scarf over her
hair.  She wears a purple leather micro-mini with a cerise
halter top and her ruby fingernails are three inches long.
If she ever actually would get cast in a movie, she'd make
Raquel Welch hide in shame.  Her stage name is BONITA
MARIPOSA.

ENZO kills the THROTTLE, swings the speedboat into a
perfect landing at the dock.  ROBERTO takes the lines.

					ENZO
		Jacques!  Johana!

					JOHANA
		Enzo!

					JACQUES
		Enzo!

During all of this, everyone's attention is actually on
BONITA who is tugging at her long black hair.  They're all
awestruck except for ROBERTO.

					ROBERTO
			   (meaning the speed
			    boat)
		Where did you get that?

					ENZO
			   (meaning Bonita)
		"That"!  This is not a "that"...
		This is Bonita Mariposa, the famous
		Spanish actress.
			   (whispering to
			    Bonita)
		... Who is going to be careful with
		the varnish...
			   (back to Roberto)
		And who has come to spend a few days
		with us.
			   (and very quickly)
		Where's Mamma?

					ROBERTO
			   (checking watch)
		You have eight hours before she gets
		here.

ENZO glances at his watch and sighs with relief.  BONITA
says hello to JACQUES, kisses JOHANA.


INT.  LIVING ROOM IN JACQUES' APARTMENT - DAY

Loud classical music booms from the stereo.  The noise
pins JACQUES, ENZO and ROBERTO to their chairs.

UNCLE LOUIS gets a bottle of whiskey and serves everybody.

					ENZO
		He's really going totally deaf!

					UNCLE LOUIS
		I'm not as deaf as you are blind, my
		boy!  You take care of your eyes,
		I'll take care of my ears!

					ENZO
			   (laughing)
		I'm sorry Uncle Louis.

UNCLE LOUIS pours him a whiskey.

					UNCLE LOUIS
		Come on, drink up, my boy!  It might
		just save us from your bullshit.

The bottle is empty.  UNCLE LOUIS goes to the kitchen.
JACQUES turns down the music, and finally hears the bell
which has been ringing.  JACQUES opens the apartment door:
it's Professor LAWRENCE.  Suit and tie and carrying a
bottle.

					JACQUES
		I'm glad you could come.  I want you
		to meet Enzo.

ENZO and LAWRENCE shake hands.

					LAWRENCE
			   (with a smile)
		So you're the famous Enzo Molinari?

					ENZO
			   (with an even bigger
			    smile)
		In the flesh.  I have that honor!


INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

JOHANA comes into the bathroom, closes the door, cutting
down the blaring music.  The paint is peeling off the
ceiling.

BONITA is standing under a 40 watt lamp, putting on make-
up in front of JACQUES' cracked shaving mirror.

					BONITA
		You're going to live here
		permanently?

					JOHANA
		... Maybe, if Jacques will let me
		fix up the place a little.

JOHANA walks over to the mirror and watches BONITA put on
her make-up like a professional.

					BONITA
			   (wistfully)
		He's shy, not like Enzo.

					JOHANA
		Yes.  Not like Enzo.

					BONITA
			   (putting on
			    eyelashes)
		I think, he's really nice... He's a
		funny guy... sometimes even very
		moving.

					JOHANA
			   (after a long
			    silence)
		... I'm pregnant, Bonita!

BONITA stops working on her make-up and looks pensively at
JOHANA.

					BONITA
		Are you going to keep it?

					JOHANA
		Yes.

					BONITA
		Does he know?

					JOHANA
		No.

					BONITA
			   (thinking)
		Maybe you should talk to him about
		it.

					JOHANA
		I can't... I just don't know how
		to...

BONITA looks at her with the same pensive look.

JOHANA goes on.

					JOHANA
		I was thinking of something kinda
		stupid last night.  You know those
		women in the greek mythology that
		made love with the Gods.  Take Leda
		for example, sleeping with Jupiter,
		who came to earth as a swan... Well,
		can you imagine Leda announcing to
		her swan "You're going to be a
		father, my little chick-a-dee"?

					BONITA
			   (starts laughing)
		But your man isn't quite a God!

					JOHANA
			   (smiles)
		Probably not, but I still don't have
		the nerve to tell him.

					BONITA
		Well, you're going to have to tell
		him, sometime!

Unconvinced, JOHANA nods.  She changes the subject.

					JOHANA
		And you...?  Do you love Enzo?

					BONITA
			   (earnestly)
		Very much, I think.
			   (a beat)
		But, there's going to be a problem.


EXT.  TERRACE OF RESTAURANT - NIGHT

The "problem":  MAMMA MOLINARI sits between ENZO and
ROBERTO, looking like a malevolent storm cloud, staring
across at BONITA.

					ROBERTO
			   (desperately)
		Mamma, calimari fritti... Zuppa de
		pesci.  Sono buoni.

					MAMMA MOLINARI
			   (eyeing Bonita)
		Nothing.  I'm not hungry.

					ENZO
		Mamma, Bonita is an actress like
		Sophia Loren, Anna Magnani...

					BONITA
			   (icy)
		Sarah Bernardt.  I sing too... a
		hell of a Carmen.  Want to hear?

					MAMMA MOLINARI
			   (coldly)
		No thank you.

There's an interminable awkward silence.  Then UNCLE LOUIS
at last finds his way to the table.  JACQUES who is too
grateful for the interruption springs to his feet.

					JACQUES
		Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's
		mother Signora Molinari from
		Amorgos?

					UNCLE LOUIS
			   (screaming)
		The whale!  How could I forget?
		Always was something fishy about
		that woman!

MAMMA MOLINARI is having trouble breathing.

					UNCLE LOUIS
		What were Italians doing living in
		Greece anyway?

					JACQUES
		Louis, we were French!

					UNCLE LOUIS
		That's different!  What's the matter
		with you?

					ROBERTO
			   (complete panic)
		Mamma, pesce di spada?

All of them are gasping for air, trying so hard not to
laugh.

					UNCLE LOUIS
			   (to Mamma)
		Hey, whale!  Can you pass down the
		squids?

They all burst out laughing.


EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT AT SEA - DAY

The diving platform is out.  The competition has begun.
ENZO is at the gueuse, getting ready to dive.  ROBERTO
works around him busily.

BONITA on deck above him is making little gestures of
encouragement.  ENZO isn't amused.

Other competitors watch from the Committee Boat.

ENZO turns the handle on the gueuse, plunges into the
water.

Professor LAWRENCE, taking notes, stands a few feet away.


UNDERWATER - ON ENZO

He dives down, further and further down.  He approaches
the two medics in aqualungs at the control point (210
feet).

They move toward him.


EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - ENZO

Surfacing.  Assistants help him onto the platform.
ROBERTO pulls off his fins.  ENZO rips off his mask.  He
looks furious.  He tosses the depth plaque (which proves
he is qualified) back into the water.

					ENZO
		A shit dive.

He looks around angrily for an official.  Sees NOVELLI.

					ENZO
		Those goddamned frogmen doctors
		waiting around at 200 feet they just
		kill your concentration.

					NOVELLI
		They're required by law.

					ENZO
			   (climbing off
			    platform)
		There's no law down there!  The only
		law is what your lungs can take.
			   (to the next diver)
		... Have fun!  They waiting for you
		down there, to take the temperature
		of your ass.

He keeps on walking across the boat, runs into JACQUES,
who's just about to begin his yoga preparation.

JACQUES sees ENZO'S expression, looks concerned.

					ENZO
			   (defensively)
		Anybody can have a bad day!

					JACQUES
		I've had many... when the sea
		doesn't want you.

					ENZO
			   (disgusted)
		It's never the sea!  It's Roberto,
		Mamma, that stupid actress... Oh
		shit!  Jacques, what do you know?
		Go do your Hindu exercises and don't
		break my balls!

ENZO stamps into one of the cabins.


INT.  JACQUES' APARTMENT - NIGHT

JOHANA is reading a child birth catalog.  She throws it
away upside down, as soon as she hears JACQUES
approaching.  JACQUES comes in and sits opposite her.  He
seems bitter.

					JOHANA
		Well, how was it?

In an involuntary gesture, JACQUES flips through the
catalog.

					JACQUES
			   (sadly)
		Enzo had a bad day.

JOHANA wonders if JACQUES will understand the presence of
the baby magazine.

					JOHANA
			   (tense)
		And you?

					JACQUES
		I didn't dive.

					JOHANA
			   (she takes the
			    magazine)
		You'll try again tomorrow?

					JACQUES
		I don't know... it didn't feel
		right.  I'm going to bed.  I'm tired.

He goes away.

					JOHANA
		You forgot your magazine!

He hasn't heard.

JACQUES goes to the bedroom, and throws himself on the
bed.

JOHANA looks as if she had wished he'd put two and two
together.

					JACQUES
		What?

					JOHANA
		... Nothing.

								    DISSOLVE TO:

EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT AT SEA - DAY

ENZO bursts out of the water.  He rips off his face mask,
throws it on the diving platform, roaring with pleasure.
He tosses the depth plague to ROBERTO.

					ENZO
		Let them try.


INT.  JACQUES' APARTMENT - DAY

JOHANA opens the apartment door.  BONITA is standing
there, a suitcase in one hand.

					BONITA
		I wanted to say goodbye, Johana.

They kiss each other goodbye.

JOHANA is very uncomfortable.

					JOHANA
		You're leaving?

					BONITA
		Yes...
			   (she hands her a
			    note)
		Could you please give this to Enzo.

					JOHANA
		Of course.

BONITA grabs the note back and tears it up.

					BONITA
		It's no use... Just tell him I said
		goodbye... And give him a kiss for
		me, Okay?

The two women hug again.

					JOHANA
			   (sorry)
		Bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged
		so easily.

					BONITA
		I don't have the strength to fight
		off la Mamma... Anyway who wants to
		spend their whole life waiting at
		the end of a pier.

BONITA rests her hand on JOHANA'S stomach.

					BONITA
		Did you tell him?

					JOHANA
		Not yet... I'm waiting for the right
		moment.

					BONITA
		... You take care of yourself,
		Johana.

BONITA smiles at her and disappears down the stairs.


EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - DOCKING - DAY

Officials, NOVELLI, LAWRENCE, ROBERTO and of course ENZO
disembark.  There is a lot of excitement on the dock.
Everyone has already heard the news.
People swarm around ENZO.

LAWRENCE spots JACQUES in the crowd, and goes to him.

					JACQUES
			   (smiling)
		Good huh?

					LAWRENCE
		He really was unbelievable, 328
		feet, deeper than the world
		record...
			   (then eagerly)
		... And, Jacques!  He held his
		breath for four minutes and fifty
		seconds!

					JACQUES
			   (smiles too)
		Good... I guess I have tomorrow's
		work cut out for me as Enzo would
		say...

					LAWRENCE
			   (seriously)
		You must be very careful, Jacques.
		At these depths, to hold your breath
		for over five minutes is... You'd
		really be pushing it.  I think it's
		very, very dangerous.

JACQUES sees ENZO being carried past on the shoulders of
the crowd.  He ignores LAWRENCE, runs beside ENZO.

					JACQUES
			   (yelling)
		Enzo, Enzo!  Congratulations!


EXT.  AWARD CEREMONY - NIGHT

					ENZO
			   (in answer to the
			    crowd's applause)
		Thank you, thank you very much!

ENZO and NOVELLI stand on a little stage facing the crowd.
ENZO is holding a gold trophy, waving to friends in the
audience.

					NOVELLI
		... Now I'm sure you've heard that
		some people have suggested it is too
		dangerous for us to continue.
		Dangerous, because we don't know how
		to measure the physiological
		consequences of this type of dive
		and also because the scuba divers
		are not used to going down below 300
		feet.

While the attentive crowd listens to NOVELLI, ENZO is
gesturing to ROBERTO, explaining what appetizers he wants
from the cocktail trays.

The crowd laughs.

					NOVELLI
		But, we polled the free divers and
		they insist that the competition
		continue!

There's wild applause.  ENZO lifts the trophy over his
head, smiles like a champ and yells into the microphone.

					ENZO
			   (yelling)
		Good luck to you all!


EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - DAY

ENZO and ROBERTO are on the front deck watching the
divers.

A German diver comes up to the surface, empty handed.
ENZO smiles.

The Tahitian comes out of the water in a semi-coma.  The
doctors carry him away.  Once he's sure that the diver is
out of danger, ENZO smiles again.

A whole team of Japanese walk over to the diving platform.
The team consists of one diver and six assistants, three
of them playing music to help the diver concentrate.  The
diver wears a white wet suit with a red circle on his
forehead.  He is concentrating very hard, so much that
ENZO walks over to him to make sure he's okay.  The
Japanese diver concentrates with such strength that he
faints.

					ENZO
			   (smiling to his
			    brother)
		Fabulous, what a dive, huh?

ROBERTO smiles.

The diver from the Philippines stands at the end of the
diving platform.  He concentrates for a moment then gives
up and walks away.

					ENZO
		He's right.  What's the point of
		knocking yourself out?


INT.  BEDROOM - JACQUES - JOHANA - NIGHT

They're in bed, side by side, both of them half asleep.
The only light in the room comes from the open windows.
He rolls over and watches her sleep, looking down at her
adoringly.  He slips off the chain with the gold coin.
Slowly, holding the chain, he runs the coin gently over
her body, stops at the level of her stomach and lets it
rest there.  She opens her eyes and looks at him,
wondering if he senses something.

					JOHANA
			   (softly)
		What are you doing?

					JACQUES
		I'm putting you on the coin... Your
		essence... That way you'll always be
		with me when I dive.

She smiles, closes her eyes.  He swings the coin over her
face gently, some kind of private ceremony.  She looks
just a little intimidated.

The coin is now dangling in front of her mouth.  She
hesitates then opens her mouth, JACQUES lets the coin
slide into it.


EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - DAY

JACQUES walks up to the diving platform.

LAWRENCE has fixed scientific equipment on his chest.
JACQUES wets and slowly puts them on.

ENZO watches from the deck, his expression has changed.

JOHANA, on the deck also, opposite ENZO, watches a little
worried.  JACQUES concentrates then releases the gueuse
and lets himself disappear under the water.


UNDERWATER

JACQUES dives down very fast.  The control takes place at
200 feet, the doctors check him and let him go.  He
continues his descent, it's getting darker and darker
around him.

The gueuse stops at the level of the underwater platform,
just below the diver, who swims over to him in a sea of
bubbles from his oxygen bottles.  He asks JACQUES if he is
alright, JACQUES nods and gives him a huge smile before
swimming off, downwards!

The diver realizes and starts after him.  He grabs JACQUES
by one of his fins and pulls him back to the round
platform.  JACQUES lets go of the balloon.

The diver panics.  JACQUES slowly motions that everything
is fine and slowly paddles up to the surface.


EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - DAY

The boat's huge stop watch indicates min:  4:50, then
5:00, then 5:10.  JACQUES has been down there for over 5
minutes.

JOHANA is worried sick.  ENZO doesn't know what to make of
it and LAWRENCE feels completely helpless.  The stopwatch
indicates 5:20, then 5:25 and JACQUES, half unconscious,
brakes through the surface of the water.

JOHANA screams and cries with joy when she sees him.  The
crowd applauds.  ENZO is somber.

NOVELLI takes the plaque from JACQUES' hands and turns to
the crowd.

					NOVELLI
			   (stunned)
		360 feet!  He dove 360 feet!!!

The crowd cheers in excitement.

ENZO is sullen.  LAWRENCE is very worried.


EXT.  ON PORT - END OF THE DAY

There's a pile of gear on the dock.

ENZO is in the boat loading one piece of luggage at a
time, JACQUES comes up to the boat.  Parked in the
background, we see a taxi waiting with JOHANA sitting in
the back seat.  ENZO pretends not to notice JACQUES'
arrival.

JACQUES watches him for a moment then finally dares to
speak.

					JACQUES
			   (pointing at taxi)
		... There's a party at the hotel
		tonight.

ENZO keeps loading up the boat.

					ENZO
			   (busy)
		That's good.

					JACQUES
			   (after a beat)
		Enzo, don't be angry.  I was
		lucky... that's all.

ENZO throws the last duffel bag into the cockpit.

					ENZO
			   (serious)
		I'll see you in Amorgos.

ENZO turns around and jumps onto his boat.

JACQUES walks off the dock, past the cab.  JOHANA opens
the door to let him in, but he keeps walking.

					JOHANA
		Jacques...?

					JACQUES
		You go back, I'll walk.

He walks off.


EXT.  MARINELAND - DOLPHIN POOL - ANTIBES - NIGHT

The park is empty as JACQUES approaches the pool.

TINA the dolphin, jumps out of the water, swims to meet
JACQUES.  JACQUES pats her and kneels to talk to TINA
NINA.

					JACQUES
			   (sadly)
		I won today.  I dove very deep,
		Tina.

The dolphin giggles.

					JACQUES
		What's so funny?  Can you dive
		deeper?

The dolphin nods "yes".

JACQUES smiles.

					JACQUES
			   (smiling)
		So you understand everything?

The dolphin nods.

					JACQUES
		That's good... So tell me why
		they're all angry at me?  Why is
		Enzo angry?  I never wanted to
		compete with him.  I never wanted to
		be champion of anything... All I
		want is to escape from them all...
		For just a few minutes, no people...
		No noise... Nothing but the sea.

The dolphin nods and giggles.

					JACQUES
		Do you really understand me?  Huh?
		Are we actually having a
		conversation here?

Again the dolphin nods "yes".

					JACQUES
		All right then, tell me:  can I ever
		dive as deep as you?  Stay under as
		long...?

A beat.  Then the dolphin nods "yes".

					JACQUES
		Are you sure?

The two other dolphins stick their heads out of the water.
They all nod together.

JACQUES is awed and perplexed at the same time.


EXT.  AMORGOS - DAY

The little town of Amorgos is beautiful, mountainous.
It's surrounded by a luminous turquoise sea, with white
villas clinging to hillsides.  There is a small port.  (we
saw it in the opening sequence) Further along the coast,
we see the Diving Federation Committee Boat surrounded by
all sorts of activity.


INT.  HOTEL ROOM - JACQUES - JOHANA - DAY

Through the open windows we can see parts of the village
where JACQUES grew up.  He's staring out the window, lost
in his own thoughts.

					JACQUES
		It's beautiful, isn't it?

Behind him, JOHANA is hiding and throwing up.  He walks to
her.

					JACQUES
		What's wrong?

					JOHANA
		It's nothing.  Just the long trip.
		I'm a little jet-lagged.

					JACQUES
		You want to lie down for a while?

					JOHANA
		No, I'll be fine.  Can you just hand
		me a glass of water?

While JACQUES gets her the water, JOHANA stares at the
view.


EXT.  ENZO'S BOAT - IN THE LITTLE PORT

ROBERTO stands on the port, waiting for his brother.
Suddenly the sound of a motor boat and twelve note horn
echoes in the bay.

The boat has just arrived at the town dock.

ENZO, tears rolling down his cheeks from the wind, throws
a duffel bag on the dock and looks up at ROBERTO.

					ENZO
		Is he here?

					ROBERTO
			   (uncomfortable)
		He's training.

ENZO makes a face.


EXT.  SMALL PORT - DAY

JOHANA sits on the little dock in front of the hotel.
JACQUES pulls on his fins, looks out into the water.

She clutches a stopwatch, ready to set it off.

A few yards behind, hidden between two bungalows, ENZO
watches them.  JACQUES takes a few deep breaths and dives
a few feet underwater.

JOHANA starts the stopwatch.

ENZO, who sees JACQUES disappear, walks over to JOHANA and
sits down beside her.

					ENZO
		Okay, now we have a good five
		minutes to have a nice peaceful
		talk.

					JOHANA
		What are you doing here?

					ENZO
		Checking out the competition.

					JOHANA
		Enzo, why do you guys do this?

					ENZO
			   (teasing)
		What else is there?

					JOHANA
			   (seriously)
		You know what I'm talking about.
		Why do you and Jacques risk your
		lives diving?

					ENZO
			   (avoiding the
			    question)
		You risk your life when you cross
		the street.

					JOHANA
			   (frustrated)
		Damn it!  Why won't you give me a
		straight answer, for once?!

					ENZO
		Because you'd laugh.

					JOHANA
		I won't, I swear.

					ENZO
			   (seriously)
		I dive in search of God.  If I go
		deep enough I'm going to find him.
		To me, the sea is a religion... That
		surprises you, doesn't it?

					JOHANA
			   (looking down at
			    Jacques in the
			    water)
		A little... You think it's the same
		for Jacques?

					ENZO
			   (shaking his head)
		No.  Jacques is a creature of the
		sea.  He isn't meant to live on
		earth, among us... You should know
		this, Johana.

					JOHANA
			   (reassuring herself)
		He can learn.  He is learning.

					ENZO
		You really think so?  Did you tell
		him you were pregnant?

					JOHANA
			   (surprised)
		How do you know that?

					ENZO
		You told Bonita, but you didn't tell
		him, right?

JOHANA shakes her head negatively.

					JOHANA
		... Not yet.

					ENZO
		Don't.

					JOHANA
		Why?

					ENZO
		Because he won't understand and it
		will just hurt you... Jacques has
		been put on earth by complete
		mistake.  And he's only waiting for
		one thing:  that some God up there
		will turn him into a fish!  How long
		has that moron been down there?

					JOHANA
			   (looking at the
			    stopwatch)
		Five minutes and fifty seconds.

					ENZO
			   (grabbing away the
			    stopwatch)
		That idiot!

They jump up.  ENZO dives into the water.

As JOHANA watches panicky, ENZO pulls JACQUES up onto the
dock, in his arms.  JACQUES is unconscious.

ENZO is furious.  The fear of loosing his friend has
absolutely enraged him.  He starts pacing up and down the
dock.

					JOHANA
		Is he alright?  What happened?

					ENZO
			   (furious)
		The fool was asleep!  If I weren't
		around, he'd already be dead!!!  Is
		that who you want to live with?
		Well, good luck!  You better learn
		to look after him because I won't
		always be here to do it!

Once again he marches off, then comes back.

					JACQUES
			   (mumbling)
		... How long was I asleep?

					ENZO
			   (to Jacques)
		Long enough to die.  Listen, if you
		really want to die, that's your
		problem, but don't do it under my
		nose, okay?

A few steps away, then coming back.

					ENZO
			   (to Jacques)
		I'll never let you take away my
		title.  D'you hear me?  Never!

ENZO stalks off defiantly.


EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - ANCHORED OFF THE COAST

There's activity.  The competition has begun.

MUSIC

A SERIES OF QUICK SHOTS of different competitors at
various points in their dives.

The Tahitian comes up unconscious.
The German comes up unconscious.
So does the diver from the Philippines.

NOVELLI doesn't know what to think.


EXT.  TERRACE OF RESTAURANT - JACQUES - JOHANA - SUNSET

JACQUES is in a T-shirt and jeans, rope-sole sandals.
JOHANA wears a light white cotton dress.  They both sit on
the restaurant's terrace overlooking the sea.

Below them, a small boat passes.  In it are baskets filled
with sponges.  JACQUES stares at them for a long time.

					JOHANA
		Do you ever sometimes just stop and
		think how sweet life can be?

A beat.

					JACQUES
		... Sure.

JOHANA wants to say something.

					JOHANA
		... When you dive... with that
		machine... What does it feel like?

					JACQUES
			   (after thinking about
			    it)
		... The feeling of slipping without
		falling... The hardest is once you
		are at the bottom.

					JOHANA
		Why?

					JACQUES
		Because you have to find a good
		reason to come back up again... And
		I always have a hard time finding
		one.

JOHANA has never looked so sad and lost.

JACQUES doesn't notice.

ENZO who is sitting at the piano behind them, starts to
play, staring at the sea.

JACQUES and JOHANA turn around and look at him.

					ENZO
			   (smiling)
		... You should start playing the
		piano, the piano is really
		refreshing, it clears the sinuses.
		Very good the piano!  Tomorrow is
		going to be a big day!


EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT UNDERWAY - ON JACQUES

He's alone in the bow.  The others are clustered in the
saloon, cockpit in the stern.  The boat is moving close to
the cliffs.  The monastery looms above them.

CLOSE ON JACQUES

He's scanning the apparently abandoned monastery searching
for signs of life.

A red and blue taxi-boat pulls up alongside the Committee
Boat.  In it, LAWRENCE waits to climb on board.


EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - DAY

ENZO puts his flippers on and grabs his gueuse.  He is
serious, concentrating hard.

LAWRENCE'S boat slides along the big Committee Boat and
the DOCTOR climbs onto it.


INT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - LAWRENCE - NOVELLI - OTHERS

LAWRENCE'S briefcase is open.  There's a stack of graph
paper on a cabin table.

					LAWRENCE
		... When I analyzed the data from
		Mayol's last dive, it became
		apparent...
			   (taps the graph
			    paper)
		... At the depths these men are
		diving, it is a physiological
		impossibility that they can retain
		enough oxygen in their blood to make
		it back to the surface.  It's a
		function of how long it takes to get
		to the bottom, orient themselves and
		to return... To attempt to break
		Mayol's record is simple suicide.
			   (to Novelli)
		For the last time.  I'm telling you
		cancel the competition.

NOVELLI and the MEDIC look over at the diving platform
where ENZO is concentrating.

					MEDIC
		Molinari's a seventeen time world
		champion.  Do you want to tell him
		he can't dive.

LAWRENCE doesn't answer.  NOVELLI is thinking.

					NOVELLI
		Get Mayol in here.


EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - ENZO

ENZO is preparing.  He sits at the edge of the platform
hyperventilating, almost in a trance.

We see JACQUES in the background, talking to NOVELLI, he
then walks over to ENZO and climbs down next to him.

					JACQUES
		Enzo?
			   (no response)
		Enzo... I know you're angry at me.
			   (no response)
		Enzo, it's important.

ENZO opens one eye.

					ENZO
		I'm concentrating.

					JACQUES
			   (quickly)
		We can't dive anymore.  They want to
		cancel the competition for a while.

ENZO looks at him coldly.  Takes another deep breath.

					JACQUES
			   (rushing on)
		It's not safe, they say.  The
		doctors say it isn't possible to go
		deeper and live.  Free diving is
		over as a sport.

					ENZO
		You say that because you have the
		title!

					JACQUES
		No!  I would never cheat you.

					ENZO
		Well that's very nice of you.

He takes a last breath, signs himself and reaching for the
gueuse, disappears into the water.

LAWRENCE, NOVELLI, the MEDICS, and others are arguing.
LAWRENCE is furious that ENZO is diving.  NOVELLI is
balling out his assistants.

JACQUES is on the platform watching the others as if they
were a gaggle of geese.  He listens to the sound of the
gueuse playing out, watches the depth indicator, the
stopwatches.  He knows something is wrong.

He walks over to the edge and grabs hold of a little
oxygen bottle which is there for security.  He takes a few
breaths of the oxygen as he puts on his flippers and dives
down after ENZO.


UNDERWATER - JACQUES

JACQUES pulls himself down the cable, hand over hand.
80 or 90 feet down he sees a group of MEDICS coming toward
him carrying ENZO'S unconscious body.

JACQUES struggles with them, pushes them away, takes ENZO
in his arms and climbs toward the surface, frantic,
screaming silently at him, desperate to get away from the
flow of air bubbles from the scuba tanks, the commotion,
the memory of death.

ENZO has a big serene smile on his face.  The MEDICS push
both divers toward the surface.

As if they were on land, JACQUES starts shaking ENZO to
wake him up.  He then slaps his face but ENZO remains
unconscious.

They finally break the surface in each others arms.


EXT.  ON DIVING PLATFORM

They pull ENZO out of the water.  The doctors open his
jacket.  ENZO motions to JACQUES to come close.  He still
has that long smile.

					ENZO
			   (faintly)
		You were right.

					JACQUES
			   (moved)
		... I was right about what?

					ENZO
			   (after a long
			    silence)
		... It is much better down there.
		It's a better place.

He tries to take a deep breath, the effort is exhausting.
JACQUES smiles, holding back his tears.

					ENZO
		... Push me back in the water...

					JACQUES
			   (crying)
		I can't.

					ENZO
		Jacques, take me back down...
		Please.

His smile freezes, he stops breathing.  His eyes close.

JACQUES puts his head down on his friend's chest and sobs.
The doctors gently try to move him away, but JACQUES
resists.

					LAWRENCE
		Just give him five minutes!  What
		does it matter now, anyway... Come
		on, just leave him alone!

LAWRENCE encourages everybody to leave the platform.

JACQUES quickly grabs the nearest rope and ties it to his
belt.  Before anybody can stop him, JACQUES rolls ENZO'S
body back into the water and dives after it.


UNDERWATER - JACQUES

He holds ENZO in his arms.  Lets the dead weight of the
body pull him down, deeper and deeper.  The rope around
JACQUES' waist runs out, stops his descent with an abrupt
jerk.  When he feels it, JACQUES lets go... watches as
ENZO'S body continues to drift by itself into the
bottomless blue...


EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM

The doctors have run over and are pulling the cable that
JACQUES is attached to.  He is unconscious when they pull
him up.  They hold him up by his feet.  JACQUES throws up
gallons of water.  They put an oxygen mask on his face.

					A DOCTOR
			   (listening to his
			    heartbeat)
		The heart is going to stop!  The
		stimulator, quickly.

Suddenly, everything collapses for JACQUES.  Sounds
disappear.  The image slows down, the light fades.

JACQUES only hears his heartbeat, which slows down.

His heart stops.

Among the crowd around him, he sees JOHANA, fresh, gentle,
smiling.  Her movements are smooth and slowed down.  She
smiles at him, simply.  JACQUES smiles back.  The heart
starts again slowly.

The image goes back to normal.

Sounds multiply (doctors, the panic, etc...) and slowly
come back.

JACQUES falls unconscious.

					A DOCTOR
		The heart started again!  It's all
		right!

NOVELLI falls back in his chair, relieved.


INT.  JACQUES' ROOM - NIGHT

JACQUES is lying on the bed, he has a strong fever.

JOHANA sits at his feet.

LAWRENCE rummages through a medical kit.  He takes a pill
from a bottle and gives it to him.

					LAWRENCE
		Take this.  Have a good sleep.

JACQUES swallows the pills.  JOHANA walks over from the
balcony.

					LAWRENCE
		Sweet dreams.

LAWRENCE motions to JOHANA that they should let him sleep.
He goes out of the room.

					JACQUES
			   (tenderly to Johana,
			    who had started to
			    leave the room)
		Kiss me.

JOHANA bends over and kisses him.

JACQUES holds her by the arm, doesn't want her to leave.

					JOHANA
		Sleep now.  We'll talk later.

JOHANA kisses him on the forehead and leaves the room.


EXT.  HOTEL BAR - ON TERRACE - LAWRENCE - JOHANA

They're at the little zinc bar.  Not talking, not really
drinking either, just toying with their glasses.

ROBERTO passes, stops.

					ROBERTO
		I've packed all of... Enzo's
		clothes.
			   (a beat)
		I'm going to the radio telephone...
			   (swallowing)
		... to call Mamma.

They watch sadly as he leaves.


INT.  JACQUES ROOM - NIGHT

JACQUES sitting up in bed finally lies down under the
sheets.  He turns off the light by the bed.


INT.  HOTEL RESTAURANT - LAWRENCE - JOHANA

They've moved from the bar to the table.  There is uneaten
food in front of them.  A third place is set.

JOHANA looks at the wall clock.

					JOHANA
		I'll go see how he's doing.

					LAWRENCE
		Let him sleep.


INT.  JACQUES ROOM - JACQUES

JACQUES is lying on the bed, he is not moving anymore.  He
is breathing loudly, as if tired out.  From his POV the
room becomes very dark and blue.  The noise is unbearable.
The ceiling turns into water.

JACQUES' eyes are wide open.  His face is sweating.  The
water level, from the ceiling, comes down to him, until he
is swallowed by it.

As he falls into the water, we see a dolphin gulping air
at the surface and going back very quickly to the blue.

The dolphin meets his group, about ten of them, 250 Kg of
muscles, swimming at more than 40 km/H underwater.  They
all break through the surface to gulp air regularly.

Suddenly, one of them, leaves the group.  He crosses the
blue and seems to make sonar-like sounds.  We see a sonar
picture.  It's an image in which the dolphin will appear a
few seconds later.  The dolphin comes up like a rocket,
gulps air and goes back down.

The sonar image appears again.  Finally, the dolphin,
locates a group of fish and starts hunting them, exactly
like a war plane.  He manages to break the group in two,
then in four, and this way, he isolates his victim.

He breaks the surface to gulp air and goes back down.  He
goes full power.  The fish he is after are even more
divided.  There is only one left, totally lost and in a
panic.

The exhausted fish is swallowed.

The dolphin slows down, goes back up, breaks the surface
in slow motion.  Images becomes pale and bright.

He screams inhumanly.

Image is white, black, silence.


INT.  HOTEL ROOM - JACQUES

JOHANA opens the shutters.

The room is a shamble of broken glass, water pitcher and
glasses, lamps and vases.  The windows are blown out.

JACQUES is lying in bed.  There is a thin trickle of blood
coming from his nose and ears.

					JOHANA
			   (in a panic)
		Jacques... Are you alright?


EXT.  DOCK - JACQUES - JOHANA - NIGHT

JACQUES jumps into ENZO'S boat.

					JOHANA
			   (still worried)
		Jacques?  Are you alright?  Answer
		me!  Are you alright?

She jumps down into ENZO'S boat.  He starts the engine.
The boat is racing out of the port.  JOHANA yells over the
sound of the engine.

					JOHANA
		You've got to tell me what happened?

					JACQUES
		I saw how it has to be.

JACQUES parks the boat in front of the COMMITTEE BOAT'S
DIVING PLATFORM.  He turns on the platform lights:  above
and underwater.  He throws down the diving cable:  60, 90,
120 feet...

JACQUES gets undressed and sits down in the lotus
position, concentrating...

JOHANA sits down a few feet away and watches him,
wondering just how far he is going to push this whole
thing.

As the cable unrolls, JOHANA starts crying.  She
understands that JACQUES is going to dive to the bottom,
into the blue, into himself.

					JOHANA
		Jacques, you know I love you.

JACQUES is putting on his flippers, and stands facing his
gueuse.

					JACQUES
			   (after a silence)
		Don't be sad... It's not because of
		you, it's me.  It's all going on
		inside me!
			   (a beat)
		I've gotta go and see.

JOHANA starts pacing up and down the diving platform.

					JOHANA
		See what?  There is nothing to see!
		It's pitch black down there!  It's
		cold.  You'll be all alone!  Look at
		me, Jacques!  I am here!  I exist!
		Look!!!
			   (she starts waving
			    her arms)
		I'm real!  I am not a dream!
		Jacques will you look at me?
			   (she breaks down)
		Please!

JACQUES has not moved, he still sits motionless, facing
his gueuse.

JOHANA doesn't know what to do or say.  She is totally
drained.

					JOHANA
		Jacques?  I'm pregnant.

					JACQUES
		That's good... that's wonderful.
		It's wonderful for you.

					JOHANA
		You are the father.

Silence.  JACQUES is petrified, without any reaction.  He
doesn't understand.  She realizes it's hopeless and stares
at the sea.

					JOHANA
			   (after a while)
		I lied... to keep you here.

She kisses him.

					JOHANA
		Promise me one thing.

					JACQUES
		Anything.

					JOHANA
		Promise you won't forget me.

She pulls the line releasing the gueuse.

JACQUES takes a deep breath and grabbing hold of the
gueuse, disappears into the water -- as if swallowed by
the ocean.


UNDERWATER

JACQUES slides along the cable, pulled by the weight of
the gueuse.  He has a beautiful smile on his face.  He is
in his element.  Night has closed in around him.  He turns
on the headlight of the gueuse, it casts a dim light
around him.


EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - NIGHT

JOHANA has walked over to the edge of the platform.  She
is holding the cable, to "hear" JACQUES' descent.

The counter shows that JACQUES is quickly passing the 300
feet mark.


UNDERWATER

JACQUES keeps going down, as serene as ever.  He has
gained a lot of speed.


EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - NIGHT

JOHANA holds her face in her hands.  The counter indicates
that JACQUES is going very fast.


UNDERWATER

The gueuse jerks to a stop and shakes the cable.  JACQUES
turns his body right side up.


EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - NIGHT

The counter now indicates a depth of 600 feet.

JOHANA has felt the jolt of the cable.  She cries her
tears and looks down at the water.


UNDERWATER

The headlight on the gueuse illuminates only a few feet
around JACQUES, as if he were standing in a circle of
light.  He stays there, patiently floating around and
around his cable... as if he were waiting for something.

A long form circles the border between the darkness and
the light.

JACQUES holds out his hand.  A dolphin comes and presses
its body against it.  Two other dolphins come out of the
night.  JACQUES watches in amazement.

A dolphin lays his muzzle in JACQUES' hand, ready to lead
him off.  JACQUES hesitates.

JACQUES lets go of the cable and lets himself be led away.
Their silhouettes disappear in the deep blue night.

                           Based on the novel "Birds"

                                       By

                               Daphne Du Maurier

                     FINAL DRAFT 2nd Revision March 2, 1962

                

	FADE IN:

	FULL SHOT - GRANT STREET - SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

	It is mid-afternoon, and there is a tempo and pace to the 
	people walking, the doorman HOOTING for taxicabs, the 
	policemen directing traffic.

	PAN SHOT - PEDESTRIANS

	waiting at street corner for light to change.

	CLOSE SHOT - MAN

	at the end of line of pedestrians. He is looking up at the 
	sky.

	TWO SHOT - MAN AND WOMAN NEXT TO HIM

	as she follows his gaze upward.

	LONG SHOT - THE SKY

	with hundreds of gulls in it, wheeling.

	MED. SHOT - THE STREET CORNER

	as the light changes and people begin to cross. In the crowd 
	walking the other way, a man turns to look up at the wheeling 
	gulls in the sky overhead. The CAMERA LOCATES:

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE DANIELS

	in the crowd of pedestrians, approaching Davidson's Pet Shop.  
	She is a young woman in her mid-twenties, sleekly groomed, 
	exquisitely dressed, though hatless. She walks with the quick 
	sureness of the city dweller, a purposefulness in her stride, 
	a mischievous grin on her face. She continues toward the 
	front door of a pet shop and enters.

	INT. BIRD SHOP - MED. SHOT

	Melanie opens the door and comes through, still looking back 
	toward the street and skywards. The proprietor, a MRS.  
	MacGRUDER, comes toward her.

				MELANIE
		Hello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever 
		seen so many gulls?

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		Hello, Miss Daniels.

				MELANIE
		What do you suppose it is?

	MED. SHOT

	Mrs. MacGruder takes a look out at the sky. A puppy is 
	BARKING, o.s.

				MRS. MACGRUDER
			(shaking her head)
		There must be a storm at sea. That 
		can drive them inland, you know.

	They are climbing the short flight of steps into the bird 
	department now. The BARKING of the dog SEGUES into the clamor 
	of innumerable birds, TWEETING, TWITTERING, CAWING as Melanie 
	and Mrs. MacGruder go to the counter at the far end.  There 
	is a circular cage in the center of the room, and the walls 
	are lined with wire-mesh cages and smaller wooden cages so 
	that the effect is one of being surrounded by birds, contained 
	birds to be sure. The birds are quite beautiful, mostly exotic 
	birds, small splashes of color behind the wire-mesh cages, 
	larger bursts of brilliant hue on the parrots and parakeets 
	in the bigger cages. As they walk:

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		I was hoping you'd be a little late, 
		Miss Daniels.
			(apologetically)
		You see, he hasn't arrived yet.

				MELANIE
		You said three o'clock.

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		I know. Oh, I know.
			(she is more distressed 
			now)
		I've been calling all morning. Oh, 
		you have no idea. Miss Daniels, 
		they're so difficult to get, really 
		they are. We get them from India, 
		you know, when they're just little 
		chicks, and then we have to...

				MELANIE
		Well, this one won't be a chick, 
		will he?

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly 
		not. This will be a full grown myna 
		bird. Full grown.

				MELANIE
		And he'll talk?

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. 
		You'll have to teach him to talk.

				MELANIE
		Yes.

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		Yes.
			(pause)
		Oh my, I suppose I should call them 
		again. They said three o'clock.
			(pause)
		Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call.  
		Would you mind waiting?

				MELANIE
			(judiciously)
		I think maybe you'd better deliver 
		him. Let me give you my address.
			(she begins taking 
			off her gloves)

				MRS. MACGRUDER
			(producing pencil and 
			pad)
		Oh. Oh, well, all right.

	As Melanie starts writing:

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		I'm sure they're on the way, though.  
		Could I just call?

				MELANIE
			(with a resigned sigh)
		Well, all right, but...

	She scurries out behind the counter and out of sight.  Melanie 
	finishes writing her address and stands impatiently by the 
	counter. She taps her teeth with the pencil.

				MRS. MACGRUDER (O.S.)
		Hello, this is Betty MacGruder at 
		Davidson's.
			(pause; accusingly)
		It's past three, you know.
			(pause)
		Well, how long do you think...? All 
		right, would you check it please?  
		Yes, I'll wait.

	Melanie sighs. Leaving her gloves and purse on the counter, 
	she begins wandering around the shop, still tapping her lips 
	with the pencil. There is no menace in the birds surrounding 
	her. They are active and beautiful as they dart behind the 
	bars and mesh of their cages. Off screen, the puppy begins 
	BARKING again as the front door opens. Melanie looks up.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH BRENNER

	as he closes the entrance door behind him and starts up the 
	steps to the bird department. He is a handsome man, about 
	twenty-nine or thirty, well-dressed, and carrying a felt 
	hat.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	seeing him, and then turning away to bend before the cage of 
	strawberry finches. She pokes the pencil through the mesh.  
	The birds are startled into scarlet flight.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	as they pass each other in the aisle. He gives a polite little 
	nod, and she gives a polite little smile. But as he passes 
	her, and unknown to her, he turns for a second look -- and 
	then vanishes behind the circular cage as he turns he corner.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	looking at her watch as she wanders around the other side of 
	the cage and then comes face to face with Mitch again.

				MITCH
		I wonder if you could help me.

				MELANIE
		What?

				MITCH
			(deliberately, and 
			with a touch of 
			hauteur)
		I said I wonder if you could help 
		me.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	a trifle annoyed by his manner at first. She is about to 
	inform him, if you please, that she is not a shopgirl. But 
	then something rebellious flashes in her eyes and an idea 
	comes to her.

				MELANIE
			(solicitously)
		Yes, what was it you were looking 
		for, sir?

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

				MITCH
			(deadpan)
		Lovebirds.

				MELANIE
		Lovebirds, sir?

				MITCH
		Yes. I understand there are different 
		varieties, it that true?

				MELANIE
		Well... yes, sir, there are.

				MITCH
		These are for my sister... her 
		birthday you see. As she'll be eleven 
		and... well, frankly, I wouldn't 
		want a pair of birds that were too 
		demonstrative.

				MELANIE
		I understand completely, sir.

				MITCH
		As the same time, I wouldn't want 
		birds that were aloof, either.

				MELANIE
			(leading him around 
			shop)
		No, of course not.

				MITCH
		Do you have a pair that are just 
		friendly?

				MELANIE
		I think so, sir.
			(she looks around)
		Now then, let me see.

				MITCH
			(at the finches)
		Aren't these lovebirds?

				MELANIE
		No, sir, those are... redbirds.

				MITCH
		The sign says strawberry finches.

				MELANIE
			(airily)
		Yes, we call them that too.
			(she moves away)
		Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds...
			(and stops before a 
			cage of canaries)

				MITCH
		Those are canaries, Miss.
			(pause)
		Doesn't this make you feel awful?

				MELANIE
			(baffled)
		Doesn't what make me...?

				MITCH
		All these innocent little creatures 
		caged up like this?

				MELANIE
		Well, we can't just let them fly 
		around the shop, you know.

				MITCH
		I suppose not. Is there an 
		ornithological reason for keeping 
		them in separate cages?

				MELANIE
		Oh, certainly. It's to protect the 
		species.

				MITCH
		I imagine that's very important.  
		Especially during the moulting season.

				MELANIE
		Yes, that's a particularly dangerous 
		time.

				MITCH
		Are they moulting now?

				MELANIE
		Some of them are.

				MITCH
		How can you tell?

				MELANIE
		Well... they get a sort of hangdog 
		expression.

	CLOSE SHOT - A CAGED BIRD - MITCH'S P.O.V.

	The bird is wearing a distinctly hangdog expression.

				MITCH
		Yes, I see.
			(pause)
		About those lovebirds, Miss...

				MELANIE
		Are you sure you wouldn't like to 
		see a canary instead? We have some 
		very nice canaries this week.

				MITCH
		All right.
			(he smiles)
		She smiles back.

				MITCH
			(he waits)
		All right, may I see one, please?

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	as she realizes she is expected to take one of the canaries 
	out of the cage. She smiles feebly, glances toward the counter 
	where she expects Mrs. MacGruder to reappear momentarily, 
	and then takes a deep breath. She opens the door to the canary 
	cage, and cautiously puts her hand into it.

				MELANIE
			(feebly)
		Here, birdie. Here, birdie, birdie.

	One of the canaries suddenly flutters out of the cage and 
	into the room. Melanie leaps back, startled.

				MELANIE
		Oh!  Ohhhhh!

	FULL SHOT - THE BIRD DEPARTMENT

	as the canary flies frantically about the room, Melanie and 
	Mitch in pursuit. Mrs. MacGruder appears at the counter, 
	finally confronted with the chaos she's been expecting all 
	day.

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		What is it? Oh! Oh my, one of the 
		birds is loose!

	She joins in the chase around the room. The bird flutters up 
	to the ceiling, and then lands on the counter and watches 
	them suspiciously.

				MITCH
		Shhh! Shhhh!

	He tiptoes up to the bird, hat in hand. Quickly, he covers 
	the bird with his hat, then reaches under to grab it.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	the canary in his hand.

				MELANIE
		There we are!

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.

	FULL SHOT - THE BIRD DEPARTMENT

	as Mitch carries the canary back to the cage. He opens the 
	door.

				MITCH
			(putting the canary 
			in)
		Back into your gilded cage, Melanie 
		Daniels.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	startled.

				MELANIE
		What did you say?

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

				MITCH
			(savoring this)
		I was merely drawing a parallel, 
		Miss Daniels.

				MELANIE
		But how... how do you know my name?

				MITCH
			(secretly)
		A little birdie told me.
			(he smiles politely)
		Good day, Miss Daniels.
			(he bows to Mrs.  
			MacGruder)
		Madam.
			(he starts out)

				MELANIE
		Hey, wait a minute!

	She goes after him. Mitch turns, stops, smiles, enjoying her 
	bafflement immensely. Melanie studies him. Then:

				MELANIE
		I don't know you.

				MITCH
		Ahhh, but I know you.

				MELANIE
		How?

				MITCH
		We met in court.

				MELANIE
		We never met in court or anyplace 
		else.

				MITCH
		That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw 
		you in court.

				MELANIE
		When?

				MITCH
		Do you remember one of your practical 
		jokes that resulted in the smashing 
		of a plate glass window?

				MELANIE
		I didn't break that window!

				MITCH
		No, but your little prank did. The 
		judge should have put you behind 
		bars!

				MELANIE
		What are you? A policeman?

				MITCH
		I simply believe in the law, Miss 
		Daniels, and I'm not too keen on 
		practical jokers.

				MELANIE
		What do you call your lovebird story 
		if not a practical...

				MITCH
		Ahhh, but I really do want those 
		birds.

				MELANIE
		You knew I didn't work here. You 
		deliberately...

				MITCH
		Right. I recognized you when I came 
		in. I thought you might like to know 
		what it felt like to be on the other 
		end of a gag. What do you think of 
		that, Miss Daniels?

				MELANIE
		I think you're a louse.

				MITCH
		I am.
			(he tips his hat)
		Good day.
			(to Mrs. MacGruder)
		Madam.
			(and he goes down the 
			steps)

				MELANIE
		And I'm glad you didn't get your 
		lovebirds!

				MITCH
			(breezily, as he goes 
			out)
		I'll find something else.
			(he gives a slight 
			bow)
		See you in court some day.

	The door closes. The puppy begins BARKING.

				MELANIE
			(angrily)
		That... that... who was that?

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		I have no idea.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	seething as she stares after him. Suddenly, she gets an idea.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	going down the steps and to the front door of the shop. She 
	looks through the glass.

	LONG SHOT - MITCH - MELANIE'S P.O.V.

	getting into his car at the curb.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	looking after the car at the curb.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE LICENSE PLATE CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	seeing the plate, giving a brief, determined, angry nod. She 
	begins to repeat the numbers to herself as she turns.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	as she comes up the steps again and walks toward the counter.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE - MRS. MACGRUDER'S P.O.V.

	as she comes up to the counter.

				MELANIE
		Have you got a pencil?

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		What? Oh, yes, certainly.

	As Melanie begins writing:

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		They said the myna bird would be 
		here later this afternoon. If you'd 
		care to come back...

				MELANIE
		No, you'd better send him. May I use 
		your phone?

				MRS. MACGRUDER
			(bewildered by 
			everything)
		Yes, certainly.
			(she puts phone on 
			counter)

				MELANIE
			(as she dials)
		Do you have any lovebirds?

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		No, not in the shop. But I can order 
		them for you.

				MELANIE
		How soon?

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		Well... well, how soon would you 
		want them?

				MELANIE
		Immediately.
			(into phone)
		Is this the Daily News? Melanie 
		Daniels. Would you get me the city 
		desk, please?

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		I might be able to have them by 
		tomorrow morning. Would that be all 
		right?

				MELANIE
			(with an edged anger)
		That would be just fine.
			(into phone)
		Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I 
		want you to do a favor for me.
			(pause)
		No, this is a small one.
			(pause)
		Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling, 
		would I try to pressure you?  Will 
		you call the Department of Motor 
		Vehicles for me and find out who 
		owns this license plate? DKQ dash 
		one seven six.
			(pause)
		Yes, a California plate.
			(pause)
		No, I'll stop up there in a little 
		while. Is daddy in his office?
			(pause)
		Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in 
		on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see 
		him later. Thank you, Charlie.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE ICY DETERMINATION ON HER FACE.

				MELANIE
		Now. What time tomorrow morning?

	FADE IN:

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE'S SPORTS CAR

	pulling up in front of Mitch's building, the top down. She 
	glances up at the address, gets out of the car, comes around 
	to the other side, and opens the door.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS

	in a cage as Melanie reaches for them.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	turning from the car and going into the building. She pauses 
	in the lobby, studies the names alongside the bell buttons.

	CLOSE SHOT - HER GLOVED HAND

	running down the list of names slowly. It stops.

	INSERT - THE CARD

	her finger beside it.

	BRENNER, M. 3B

	CLOSE SHOT - HER GLOVED HAND the forefinger extended as she 
	runs it down over every bell button in one column, and then 
	does the same for the next column.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	as she turns from the bells to the inner door of the lobby, 
	grabbing the knob. A BUZZ SOUNDS. She opens the door.

	REVERSE SHOT - MELANIE

	coming through the door and into the lobby. She walks swiftly 
	toward the elevator where a well-dressed man is standing, 
	waiting. Behind her, the inner door is BUZZING wildly with 
	answering BUZZES. Melanie and the man stand waiting for the 
	elevator, silently. Behind her, the BUZZING STOPS. The 
	elevator doors open. The man smiles pleasantly and allows 
	her to enter first. She does so with a small nod.  The 
	elevator doors close.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND THE MAN - IN THE ELEVATOR

	The birds are CHIRPING wildly in their cage. The man and 
	Melanie stand silently side by side. The man's eyes wander 
	down to the bird-cage. Melanie's eyes move toward him.  Self-
	consciously, she stands with the cage of CHATTERING birds. 
	The man is dead-panned, unsmiling. The elevator stops. The 
	doors begin to open.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	stepping out of the elevator as the doors open. The man is 
	right behind her. She begins looking for apartment 3B. The 
	man is walking down the corridor beside her. She stops in 
	front of the apartment, hesitates, hoping the man will turn 
	the corner in the corridor. Instead, he stops at the apartment 
	just opposite. He begins fumbling in his pocket for his key. 
	He looks at Melanie.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	smiling at him feebly.

	FULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR

	The man spread change and an assortment of junk on the palm 
	of his hand as he searches for his key. Impatiently, Melanie 
	watches him. Making a decision, she puts the birdcage down 
	before the door to apartment 3B, and then opens her purse.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE'S GLOVED HAND

	reaching into the purse for a white envelope.

	INSERT - THE FACE OF THE ENVELOPE

	written there in Melanie's handwriting: MR. MITCHELL BRENNER.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	as she props the envelope against the cage, and then hurriedly 
	goes down the hallway, intent on retreat.

				MAN'S VOICE
		Miss...?  She stops, distressed.

	FULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR

	the man at the one end, key in his hand; Melanie at the other 
	end, near the elevator.

				MAN
		Is that for Mitch Brenner?

				MELANIE
			(curtly)
		Yes.

				MAN
		He's not home.

				MELANIE
		That's all right.

	She presses button for the elevator.

				MAN
		He won't be back until Monday. I 
		mean, if those birds are for him....

				MELANIE
		Monday?

				MAN
		Yes. I don't think you should leave 
		them in the hall, do you?

				MELANIE
			(trapped)
		Well, I...

	The elevator doors open.

				MELANIE
		Well, where did he go?

				MAN
		Bodega Bay. He goes up there every 
		weekend.

				MELANIE
		Bodega Bay? Where's that?

				MAN
		Up on the coast. About sixty miles 
		north of here.

				MELANIE
		Sixty...
			(her face falls)
		Oh.

				MAN
		About an hour and a half on the 
		freeway. Or two if you take the coast 
		highway.

				MELANIE
		Oh.

				MAN
		I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm 
		going away myself. Someone's got to 
		feed them, I suppose.

				MELANIE
			(in utter despair now)
		Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.

				MAN
			(apologetically)
		I'm awfully sorry.

	He puts the key into his lock, opens the door, and goes 
	inside. The door closes. Melanie is alone in the hallway.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	exasperated. She looks at the open elevator. She turns to 
	look at the birds.

	LONG SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS

	in their cage outside the apartment door, CHATTERING.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	surrendering with a gesture of resignation. She walks down 
	the hall, picks up envelope and puts it in her purse, picks 
	up the bird cage, carries it back to the elevator. The birds 
	are COOING and CHIRPING madly.

				MELANIE
		Oh, shut up!

	And she steps into the elevator.

							  DISSOLVE

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE'S OPEN CAR - (MATTE)

	on the coast highway. It is a spectacularly beautiful day, 
	with a cloudless blue sky. The montage of SHOTS that follow 
	should alternate between the winding, twisting road and the 
	ocean below, and CLOSEUPS of Melanie driving with the caged 
	birds on the seat beside her. The last shot should be a FULL 
	SHOT of the car rounding a particularly sharp curve.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	She turns wheel forcefully.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS

	in the cage as the car rounds the bend. They lean to one 
	side as the car turns, come up straight again as the car 
	rounds the curve.

	FULL SHOT - (MATTE)

	Car approaching Bodega Bay seen high up.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	RADIO AND TELEVISION.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	behind wheel.

	LONG SHOT - THE TIDES

	past the gas station and beyond to the parking area and the 
	docks, continuing Melanie's slow observation of the place.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE - (PROCESS)

	studying the town. The car turns into road by gas station.

	FULL SHOT - THE TOWN

	through the windshield. The car turns right. There is life 
	in the town now, fishermen crossing the road, women with 
	their hair in curlers, old ladies carrying shopping bags.  
	This is Saturday morning, and the town -- such as it is -- 
	is alive with its inhabitants. We see them from Melanie's

	P.O.V. AS SHE SCANS THE PLACE FOR ITS POST OFFICE. (THIS TO 
	BE TAKEN ON BACK LOT.)

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR

	pulling in, in front of the post office. Melanie opens the 
	door and steps out. She is smartly dressed in a traveling 
	suit and sweater. She looks up at the sign, and then walks 
	quickly toward the front door.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	enters post office.

	CLOSE SHOT - POSTAL CLERK

	behind cage as Melanie approaches it. He is busy filling out 
	a form of some kind, affixing stamps to it, etc. He does not 
	look up as she approaches.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	through the bars of the cage.

				MELANIE
		Good morning.

	CLOSE SHOT - POSTAL CLERK

				CLERK
			(without looking up)
		Morning.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND THE CLERK

				MELANIE
		I wonder if you could help me.

				CLERK
		Try my best.

				MELANIE
		I'm looking for a man named Mitchell 
		Brenner.

				CLERK
		Yep.

	He is still busy with his form, still does not look up.

				MELANIE
		Do you know him?

				CLERK
		Yep.

				MELANIE
		Where does he live?

				CLERK
		Right here. Bodega Bay.

				MELANIE
		Yes, but where?

				CLERK
		Right across the bay there.

				MELANIE
		Where?

	It seems as if the Clerk will not answer her. Suddenly, he 
	leaves the window.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	through the bars, exasperated.

	REVERSE SHOT - FULL - MELANIE

	as she tries to peek through the bars to see where he's 
	vanished. A door to the left of the window opens, and the 
	Clerk steps out. He walks a little distance as Melanie watches 
	him, then stops, turns and looks at her surprised, as if 
	he'd expected her to be right behind him. He stands stock 
	still, looking at her, saying nothing. She understands then 
	that he wants her to follow him, and she catches up, neither 
	speaking. They go to the front door. He opens it, looks at 
	her, then looks out across the town and the bay. He extends 
	his arm and points.

				CLERK
		See where I'm pointing?

				MELANIE
		Yes?

	FULL SHOT - THE BAY - THEIR P.O.V. - (MATTE)

				CLERK (O.S.)
		See them two big trees across there?

				MELANIE (O.S.)
		Yes?

				CLERK (O.S.)

		That's where the Brenners live.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND THE CLERK

				MELANIE
		The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?

				CLERK
		Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.

				MELANIE
		The two kids?

				CLERK
		Yep. Mitch and the little girl.

				MELANIE
		I see. How do I get down there?

				CLERK
		Follow the road straight through 
		town 'til it curves off on the left.  
		That'll take you right around the 
		bay to their front door.

				MELANIE
		The front door.
			(pause)
		Isn't there a back road I can take?

				CLERK
		Nope. That's the road. Straight 
		through town, stay on your left, 
		right around the bay to the front 
		door.

				MELANIE
		You see, I wanted to surprise them.

				CLERK
		Mmmm.

				MELANIE
		I didn't want to come right down the 
		road, where they could see me.

				CLERK
		Mmmm.

				MELANIE
		It's a surprise, you see.

				CLERK
		Mmmmmm.
			(long pause)
		'Course, you could get yourself a 
		boat, cut right across the bay with 
		it. The Brenners got a little dock 
		there you could tie up at. If that's 
		what you wanted to do.

				MELANIE
		Where would I get a boat?

				CLERK
		Down at the dock by the Tides 
		Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard 
		boat?

				MELANIE
			(looking at him)
		Of course.

				CLERK
			(looks back at her)
		D'you want me to order one for you?

				MELANIE
			(surprised)
		Thank you.

				CLERK
		What name?

				MELANIE
		Daniels.

				CLERK
		Okay.

	He nods briefly and goes inside. Melanie looks across the 
	bay.

	FULL SHOT - THE BAY - MELANIE'S P.O.V. - (MATTE)

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	smiling. She gets a new idea. She reaches into her purse for 
	the envelope. She looks at the envelope, then tears it up 
	and stuffs the torn envelope into her handbag. She turns 
	back toward the post office.

	INT. THE POST OFFICE - FULL SHOT

	as Melanie approaches the Clerk's window. He is still busy, 
	still does not look up.

				MELANIE
		I wonder if you could tell me...

				CLERK
		Yep?

				MELANIE
		The little girl's name.

				CLERK
		The little Brenner girl?

				MELANIE
		Yes.

				CLERK
		Alice, I think.
			(he turns, shouts to 
			someone in rear)
		Harry, what's the little Brenner 
		girl's name?

				HARRY'S VOICE
			(shouting)
		What?

				CLERK
			(shouting)
		The little Brenner girl.

				HARRY'S VOICE
			(shouting)
		Lois!

				CLERK
			(shouting)
		It's Alice, ain't it?

				HARRY'S VOICE
			(shouting)
		No, it's Lois!

				CLERK
			(to Melanie)
		It's Alice.

				MELANIE
		Are you sure?

				CLERK
		Well, I ain't positive, if that's 
		what you mean.

				MELANIE
		I need her exact name, you see.

				CLERK
		That case, I tell you what you do.  
		You go straight through town 'til 
		you see a little hotel on your left 
		there. Not the motel, that's the 
		other end of town. This is the hotel. 
		Now you take a right turn there, you 
		got that?

				MELANIE
		Yes?

				CLERK
		Near the top of the hill, you'll see 
		the school and right behind it, the 
		church. You head for the school.  
		Now just past the school, you'll see 
		a little house with a red mail box.  
		That's where Annie Hayworth lives, 
		she's the school teacher. You ask 
		her about the little Brenner girl.

				MELANIE
		Thank you.

				CLERK
		Yep.
			(pause)
		Could save yourself a lot of trouble. 
		Her name's Alice for sure.

				MELANIE
		Can I have the boat in about twenty 
		minutes?

	The Clerk nods.

				MELANIE
		How much for the phone calls?

				CLERK
			(brushing this aside)
		It's nothing.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE RED MAIL BOX

	with the name "Hayworth" on it. PULL BACK to reveal:

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	passing the mail box and going up the walk to the front door.  
	The house is a two-story frame with steps leading to the 
	front door. There are white curtains in every window of the 
	house, and a sign in the window to the left of the doorway 
	advises, ROOM TO LET. Melanie rings the doorbell.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	waiting. She RINGS the bell again:

				ANNIE'S VOICE
			(shouting)
		Yes? Who is it?

				MELANIE
		Me!

				ANNIE'S VOICE
		Who's me?

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	walking along the porch of the house. The walk in front of 
	the house is lined with beautifully planted and cared-for 
	flowers. ANNIE HAYWORTH comes round from the back of the 
	house as Melanie reaches the corner. She is a woman of thirty-
	two, tall, big-boned, with a strong beautiful face.  Her 
	hair is disarrayed at the moment, and she is dressed for the 
	garden, wearing slacks and a loose-fitting sweater, and earth-
	stained gloves. But there is something about her, a feeling 
	of expansive comfort, rather than sloppiness.

				MELANIE
		Miss Hayworth?

				ANNIE
		Yes?

				MELANIE
		I'm Melanie Daniels. I'm sorry to 
		bother you, but...

	CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE

	She is puzzled by Melanie who, exquisitely dressed and 
	groomed, seems singularly out of place in Bodega Bay. She 
	studies her openly.

				ANNIE
		Yes?

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE

				MELANIE
		The man at the post office sent me.  
		He said you'd know the name of the 
		little Brenner girl.

				ANNIE
		Cathy?

				MELANIE
		The one who lives in the white house 
		across the bay?

				ANNIE
		That's the one. Cathy Brenner.

				MELANIE
			(smiling)
		They seemed sure it was either Alice 
		or Lois.

				ANNIE
		Which is why the mail in this town 
		never gets delivered to the right 
		place.
			(She takes out package 
			of cigarettes, offers 
			one to Melanie)
		Did you want to see Cathy about 
		something?

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	taking cigarette, hesitating.

				MELANIE
		Well... not exactly.

	CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE

	studying her, thinking she understands.

				ANNIE
		Are you a friend of Mitch's?

				MELANIE
		No, not really.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE

	There is an awkwardness here. Annie wants to know more. She 
	puffs on the cigarette, smiles, tries a friendly approach.

				ANNIE
		I've been wanting a cigarette for 
		the past twenty minutes, but I 
		couldn't convince myself to stop.  
		This 'tilling of the soil' can get a 
		little compulsive, you know.

				MELANIE
		It's a lovely garden.

				ANNIE
		Thank you. It gives me something to 
		do with my spare time.
			(pause)
		There's a lot of spare time in Bodega 
		Bay.
			(another pause)
		Did you plan on staying long?

				MELANIE
		No. Just a few hours.

				ANNIE
		You're leaving after you see Cathy?

				MELANIE
		Well... something like that.
			(pause)
		I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so 
		mysterious.

				ANNIE
		Actually, it's none of my business.

	There is a pause. Melanie, by her silence, affirms that it 
	is none of Annie's business.

				ANNIE
			(putting out cigarette)
		I'd better get on my way. Thank you 
		very much.

				ANNIE
		Not at all.

	They begin walking toward the car.

				ANNIE
			(still curious)
		Did you drive up from San Francisco?

				MELANIE
		Yes.

				ANNIE
		It's a nice drive.
			(pause)
		Is that where you met Mitch?

				MELANIE
			(hesitating, then)
		Yes.

				ANNIE
		I guess that's where everyone meets 
		him.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	as she gets in behind the wheel. Annie's remark is not lost 
	on her, and a quick look of sudden understanding crosses her 
	face.

				MELANIE
		Now you sound a bit mysterious, Miss 
		Hayworth.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE

	as Annie leans over the seat.

				ANNIE
		Do I?
			(she shakes her head, 
			smiles wistfully)
		No, I'm an open book, I'm afraid.
			(pause)
		Or maybe a closed one.
			(she smiles again, 
			sees the lovebirds)
		Pretty. What are they?

				MELANIE
		Lovebirds.

	Taking this as a further indication of Melanie's relationship 
	with Mitch:

				ANNIE
		Mmm.
			(pause)
		Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.

				MELANIE
		Thank you.

	HIGH SHOT

	She gets out of the car and walks onto one of the docks, the

	FULL SHOT - THE BOAT

	coming head-on toward CAMERA, Melanie at the tiller. She

	except for the cry of the gulls.

	LONG SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE - MELANIE'S P.O.V.

	There is not a sign of activity as the boat drifts just a 
	little closer. As Melanie watches, the front door opens and 
	a woman comes out, walks to a red pickup truck, starts the 
	engine. A little girl comes out of the house, goes to the 
	truck, gets in. The woman shouts something to a man -- Mitch 
	Brenner, probably, though it is difficult to tell from this 
	distance -- and he comes over to the truck.

	The truck grinds into gear, goes around the turnabout, and 
	heads down the road away from the farm, a huge cloud of dust 
	behind it. The farm is still again. Mitch stands looking 
	after the truck for a moment, and then begins walking up 
	toward the barn in the distance.

	CLOSE SHOT

	watching, biting her lip.

	in the boat.

				MITCH
		That was the damndest thing I ever

				MITCH
		It deliberately came down at you --
		you're bleeding...

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	a thin line of blood trickling from the cut on top of her 
	head, down onto her forehead and cheek. She seems dazed.  
	She shakes her head in answer to him, then touches the top 
	of her head, looks at her bloody fingers, and then nods 
	weakly.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	concerned.

				MITCH
		Come on, let's take care of that.

	FULL SHOT - THE DOCK

	as they climb onto it. A fisherman standing by looks at 
	Melanie curiously.

				FISHERMAN
		What happened, Mitch?

				MITCH
			(over his shoulder)
		A gull hit her.

				FISHERMAN
		A what?

	The CAMERA FOLLOWS them as they walk across the parking area 
	behind the Tides, and to the closest office. Mitch tries the 
	door knob. The door is locked.

	INSERT - SIGN ON DOOR OUT TO LUNCH TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND 
	MITCH

	as he tries door of next office. It, too, is locked.

				MITCH
		Come on, we'd better go up to the 
		restaurant.

	They walk quickly up the slope to the Tides, establishing 
	gas station across the road, the collection of stores 
	opposite, the cars pulling in and out. Mitch opens the door 
	for her, and they ENTER.

	INT. THE TIDES - FULL SHOT

	This is a small neighborhood restaurant, with the feeling of 
	a local hangout. There are fishermen lounging at the bar, 
	and a teenage boy playing one of the pinball machines. Two 
	ladies in housedresses, with their hair in curlers, are 
	sitting at one of the booths, having coffee. The rear wall 
	of the restaurant is almost all window, looking out over the 
	bay and the parking area below. A television set over the 
	bar is going. The shots and horsehoof beats of an old Western 
	movie should be HEARD muted throughout following.  DEKE 
	CARTER, who owns the restaurant with his wife, alternates 
	his attention between serving his customers and watching the 
	Western. He looks up immediately when Mitch and Melanie ENTER.

	MED. SHOT - THE BAR

	Mitch and Melanie coming over to it.

				MITCH
		Deke, have you got a first aid kit 
		back there?

				DEKE
			(instantly alarmed)
		What happened?

				MITCH
		Young woman cut herself.

				DEKE
		Shall I call the doctor?

				MITCH
			(accepting the first 
			aid kit)
		I don't think it's that serious.  
		You want to sit up here?

	Melanie climbs onto the stool.

				DEKE
		You cut yourself outside, Miss?

				MITCH
		Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a 
		boat.

	He is rummaging around in the kit.

				DEKE
		I had a man trip and fall in the 
		parking lot once, sued me before I 
		could bat an eyelash.

				MITCH
		I don't think Miss Daniels is going 
		to sue anybody.

				DEKE
			(doubtfully)
		Well, you're the lawyer.
			(goes to other end of 
			bar)

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	as he unscrews cap from bottle of peroxide.

				MELANIE
		What's that?

				MITCH
		Just some peroxide. I want to clean 
		out the cut.

	He pours peroxide onto a gauze pad and begins swabbing the 
	cut. They are silent for several seconds. Then:

				MELANIE
		So you're a lawyer.

				MITCH
		That's right. What are you doing in 
		Bodega Bay?

				MELANIE
		Do you practice here?

				MITCH
		No, San Francisco. What are you...?

				MELANIE
		What kind of law?

				MITCH
		Criminal.

				MELANIE
		Is that why you'd like to see everyone 
		behind bars?

				MITCH
		Not everyone, Miss Daniels.

				MELANIE
		Only violators and practical jokers.

				MELANIE
		That's right.

	As he swabs cut.

				MELANIE
		Ouch!

				MITCH
		I'm sorry.
			(pause)
		What are you doing up here?

				MELANIE
		Didn't you see the lovebirds?

				MITCH
		You came all the way up here to bring 
		me those birds?

				MELANIE
		To bring your sister those birds.  
		You said it was her birthday.  
		Besides, I was coming up anyway.

				MITCH
		What for?

				MELANIE
		To see a friend of mine.
			(she winces)
		Will you please be careful?

				MITCH
		I'm sorry.
			(pause)
		Who's your friend?

				MELANIE
		Why...
			(pause, stymied)

				MITCH
		Yes?

				MELANIE
			(blurting the only 
			name she knows)
		Annie. Annie Hayworth.

				MITCH
		Well, well, small world. Annie 
		Hayworth.

				MELANIE
			(realizing this was a 
			mistake)
		Yes.

				MITCH
		How do you know Annie?

				MELANIE
			(the lie getting deeper)
		We... we went to school together.  
		College.

				MITCH
		Did you! Imagine that! How long will 
		you be staying?

				MELANIE
		Just a few... just a day or two... 
		the weekend.

				MITCH
		I think we'll have to shave the hair. 
		Deke, have you got a razor?

				MELANIE
			(pulling away)
		Oh, no you don't!

				MITCH
		It's still bleeding a little. Here, 
		let me put this on.

	He takes up a tiny Band-Aid and, tearing the gauze off, says:

				MITCH
		Bend your head down. This little 
		Band-Aid won't show.

	He presses the tiny Band-Aid over the cut. Melanie takes a 
	mirror from her handbag and, bending her head down, looks at 
	it. She covers her hair over it as Mitch says:

				MITCH
		So you came up to see Annie, huh?

				MELANIE
		Yes.

				MITCH
		I don't believe you.
			(grins)
		I think you came up to see me.

				MELANIE
		Why would I want to see you, of all 
		people?

				MITCH
			(shrugging)
		I don't know. But it seems to me you 
		must have gone to a lot of trouble 
		to find out who I was, and where I 
		lived and...

				MELANIE
		It was no trouble at all. I simply 
		called my father's paper. Besides, I 
		was coming up here anyway, I already 
		told you...

				MITCH
			(grinning)
		You like me, huh?

				MELANIE
		I loathe you. You have no manners.  
		And you're arrogant and conceited 
		and... I wrote you a letter about 
		it, in fact, but I tore it up.

				MITCH
		What did it say?

				MELANIE
		None of your business.
			(pause)
		Am I still bleeding?

	She lowers her head.

				MITCH
		Can't see a thing.

				MELANIE
		I can't say I like your seagulls 
		much, either. I come all the way up 
		here to...

				MITCH
		But you were coming up anyway, 
		remember?

				MELANIE
		I was! And all I get for my pains is 
		a... a... a hole in the head!

				MITCH
			(grinning)
		Right next to the one you already 
		had.

				MELANIE
			(angrily)
		Look, Mr. Brenner...

				LYDIA (O.S.)
		Mitch?

	They turn toward the door.

	MED. SHOT - LYDIA BRENNER

	closing the door behind her, coming toward the bar. She is a 
	woman in her late forties, attractive, wearing shirt, blouse, 
	cardigan sweater, low heels. There is nothing agrarian-looking 
	about her. She speaks with the quick tempo of the city 
	dweller, and there is lively inquiry in her eyes.

				LYDIA
			(puzzled)
		I thought I saw your car. What are 
		you doing in town?

				MITCH
			(rising to greet her)
		I had to acknowledge a delivery.
			(grins)
		Mother, I'd like you to meet...

				LYDIA
		A what?

				MITCH
			(continuing)
		Melanie Daniels. Melanie, my mother.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	Her eyebrows raising ever so slightly, not in displeasure, 
	but simply in enormous curiosity as she acknowledge the 
	introduction.

				LYDIA
		How do you do, Miss Daniels?
			(to Mitch)
		Acknowledge a what?

	BACK TO SCENE

				MITCH
		A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels 
		brought some birds from San Francisco.

	Lydia thinks she understands. This is one of Mitch's San 
	Francisco chippies.

				LYDIA
		Oh. I see.

				MITCH
		For Cathy. For her birthday. By the 
		way, where is she?

				LYDIA
		Across at Brinkmeyer's.

				MITCH
		Miss Daniels is staying for the 
		weekend. In fact, I've already invited 
		her to dinner tonight.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	turning to him in surprise, beginning to shake her head.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

				MITCH
		After all, you did go to the trouble 
		of bringing up those birds.

				MELANIE (O.S.)
		I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly...

	BACK TO SCENE

				LYDIA
		You did say birds?

				MITCH
		Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...

				LYDIA
			(understanding 
			completely now)
		Lovebirds, I see.

				MITCH
		...get away without thanking you in 
		some small way. After all, you haven't 
		even met Cathy and you are staying 
		for the weekend...

				MELANIE
		Yes, but...

				MITCH
		You are, aren't you?

				MELANIE
		Certainly, but...

				MITCH
		Then it's settled. What time is 
		dinner, Mother?

				LYDIA
		Seven o'clock, same as usual.

				MITCH
		I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels.  
		Where are you staying?

				MELANIE
		With... with Annie, of course.

				MITCH
		Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter 
		to seven, will that be all right?

				MELANIE
		Annie... Annie may have made other 
		plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I 
		can find my own way.

				MITCH
		You're sure now? You won't hire a 
		boat or anything?

				MELANIE
		I'm sure.

				MITCH
		Seven o'clock then.

				MELANIE
		Maybe.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	grinning.

				MITCH
		We'll be waiting. How's your head 
		now?

	MED. SHOT - THE GROUP

	Lydia looks at Mitch inquiringly.

				MELANIE
			(with an overwarm 
			smile)
		It's nothing, Mrs. Brenner. A gull 
		hit me, that's all.

	Lydia stares at her doubtfully.

							  DISSOLVE

	EXT. ANNIE HAYWORTH'S HOUSE - FULL SHOT

	Melanie is standing on the front steps, a paper bag in her 
	hands. She rings the doorbell. The ROOM TO LET sign is still 
	in the window. The door suddenly opens.

				ANNIE
			(surprised)
		Oh, hi!
			(pause)
		Did you find her all right?

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE

				MELANIE
		Yes, I did.

	There is a long awkward pause. Annie smiles expectantly at 
	Melanie. Melanie seems hesitant.

				MELANIE
		I was wondering...

				ANNIE
		Yes?

				MELANIE
		That sign.
			(pause)
		Do you think I could have the room 
		for a single night?

				ANNIE
		Well, I'd really hope to rent it 
		for...

				MELANIE
		I would appreciate it. I've tried 
		everywhere in town, and they're all 
		full.

				ANNIE
			(after a pause)
		Sure. You can have it.
			(smiles)
		Where's your bag? In the car?

	Melanie holds up the paper bag. Annie looks at it and then 
	smiles.

				ANNIE
		It's utilitarian, I'll say that for 
		it.

				MELANIE
			(smiling)
		I just picked up some things for the 
		night at the general store. You see, 
		I hadn't planned on spending much 
		time here.

				ANNIE
		Yes, I know. Did something unexpected 
		crop up?

	There is a moment where both women look at each other...  
	When Melanie answers, it is abrupt and a trifle cold -- she 
	is again telling Annie to mind her own business.

				MELANIE
		Yes.
			(pause)
		May I use your phone? I'd like to 
		call home.

	There is another moment where Annie appraises Melanie's 
	attitude, and then accepts it. She suddenly smiles warmly.

				ANNIE
		Why don't you come in then?  I was 
		just about to mix a martini.

	She is about to lead Melanie into the house when they both 
	hear a SOUND overhead. They turn to look skyward.

	LONG SHOT - A FLOCK OF LARGE BIRDS

	flying in beautiful precise formation against the sky.

	TWO SHOT - ANNIE AND MELANIE

				ANNIE
			(shaking her head)
		Don't they ever stop migrating?

	But Melanie is watching the sky and the birds with a curiously 
	serious expression.

							  DISSOLVE

	LONG SHOT - THE APPROACH ROAD to the Brenner house. Melanie's 
	car is driving along the shore. Behind her, the sky is stained 
	with sunset. There are gulls on the bay, cawing into the 
	silence.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR

	as it pulls into the Brenner yard.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	reaching up for the rear view mirror, tilting it to examine 
	her lipstick, touching the edge of her mouth with one hand.  
	She gets out of the car, CAMERA FOLLOWING her to the house.  
	She climbs the porch steps, KNOCKS on the door. There is no 
	answer. Puzzled, she begins walking back into the yard. In 
	the distance, she sees Mitch, Lydia and Cathy coming from 
	behind the chicken sheds. She raises her arm in greeting.

				MELANIE
			(calling)
		Hi!

	FULL SHOT - MITCH, CATHY, LYDIA

	in the distance. Mitch and Cathy raise their arms.

				CATHY
			(excitedly)
		Hi!
			(she breaks into a 
			trot toward Melanie)

	CLOSE SHOT - CATHY as she approaches. She is an eleven-year-
	old child, clear-eyed, bright, uninhibited, wearing a shirt 
	and blouse, her hair cropped close to her head. She hesitates 
	for just a moment.

				CATHY
		Miss Daniels?

				MELANIE
		Yes?

	And Cathy flings herself into Melanie's arms, almost knocking 
	her off her feet, hugging her fiercely.

				CATHY
		They're beautiful! They're just what 
		I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? 
		I can't tell which is which.

				MELANIE
		Well, I suppose...

	FULL SHOT - ALL OF THEM

				MITCH
			(coming up)
		Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm 
		glad you came. Are you hungry?

				MELANIE
		Famished.

				MITCH
		Dinner's just about ready.
			(explaining)
		We were out back looking at the 
		chickens. Something seems to be wrong 
		with them.

				LYDIA
			(going toward house)
		There's nothing wrong with those 
		chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call 
		Fred Brinkmeyer right now.

				MITCH
			(as they follow into 
			house)
		I don't know what good that'll do.
			(aside to Melanie)
		Chickens won't eat.

	FULL SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE

	as they ENTER, CAMERA FOLLOWING them throughout into dining 
	room where Lydia dials phone, talking to Mitch all along.

				LYDIA
		He sold the feed to me, didn't he?

				MITCH
		Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer 
		beware.

				LYDIA
		Whose side are you on?

				MITCH
		I'm simply quoting the law.

				LYDIA
		Never mind the law. Cathy, you can 
		start serving the soup.

	She has finished dialing now, is waiting while the phone 
	RINGS.

				LYDIA
		This won't take a minute, Miss Dan...
			(into phone)
		Hello, Fred? This is Lydia Brenner.  
		I didn't interrupt your dinner, did 
		I?
			(pause)
		Fred, that feed you sold me is no 
		good.
			(pause)
		The chicken feed. The three bags I 
		brought.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	holding the telephone.

				LYDIA
		Well, it's just no good. The chickens 
		won't eat it.
			(pause)
		They're always hungry, Fred. I opened 
		one of the sacks when I got home, 
		and I poured it out for them, and 
		they wouldn't touch it. Now you know 
		chickens as well as I do, and when 
		they won't eat, there's just something 
		wrong with what they're being fed, 
		that's all.
			(pause)
		No, they're not fussy chickens.
			(pause)
		Who? What's he got to do with it?
			(pause)
		Fred, I don't care how much feed you 
		sold him. My chickens...
			(pause)
		He did? Dan Fawcett?
			(pause)
		This afternoon?
			(pause)
		Well, that only proves what I'm 
		saying. The feed you sold us is...
			(pause)
		Oh. Oh, I see. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.  Uh-
		huh. Maybe I ought to go over to see 
		him. You don't think there's something 
		going around, do you?
			(pause)
		No, never.
			(pause)
		No, Fred, they don't seem sick at 
		all. They just won't eat.
			(pause)
		Mmmm. Mmmmm. Well, I'll try to get 
		over to Dan's farm.  Maybe he'll... 
		mmmmm... mmmmm... all right, Fred,

	FULL SHOT - THE DINING ROOM

	as Lydia comes to the table. Mitch and Melanie are sitting 
	opposite each other in the center chairs. Cathy is serving 
	the last bowl of soup.

				LYDIA
			(as she sits)
		He got a call from Dan Fawcett a 
		little while ago. His chickens won't 
		eat, either.

				CATHY
		It's what you said, Mom. Mr.  
		Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.

				LYDIA
			(slowly)
		No, Cathy. He sold Mr. Fawcett a 
		different brand.
			(extremely worried)
		You don't think they're getting sick, 
		do you, Mitch?

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	her eyes troubled as she picks up her napkin.

	FULL SHOT - THE LIVING ROOM

	The meal is over. The lovebirds in their hanging cage have 
	been covered for the night. In the b.g. Mitch and Lydia are 
	carrying the stacked dishes to the kitchen. In the f.g.  
	Cathy and Melanie are by a small upright piano. Melanie is 
	playing a Debussy Arabesque: She picks up a cigarette from 
	the ashtray now and again to take a puff.

				CATHY
		I still don't understand how you 
		knew I wanted lovebirds.

				MELANIE
		Your brother told me.

				LYDIA
			(as she goes into 
			kitchen)
		Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, 
		is that right?

				MELANIE
		No, not exactly.

				CATHY
		Mitch knows lots of people in San 
		Francisco. Of course, they're mostly 
		hoods.

				LYDIA
			(from the kitchen)
		Cathy!

				CATHY
		Well, Mom, he's the first to admit 
		it.
			(to Melanie)
		He spends half his day in the 
		detention cells at the Hall of 
		Justice.

				LYDIA
			(coming from kitchen)
		In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is 
		entitled to a fair trial. Your 
		brother's practice...

				CATHY
		Mom, please, I know all the democracy 
		jazz. They're still hoods.
			(to Melanie)
		He's got a client now who shot his 
		wife in the head six times. Six times, 
		can you imagine it?
			(she starts for living 
			room)
		I mean, even twice would be overdoing 
		it, don't you think?

				MELANIE
			(to Mitch as he carries 
			load of dishes out)
		Why did he shoot her?

				MITCH
		He was watching a ball game on 
		television.

				MELANIE
		What?

				MITCH
		His wife changed the channel.

	He GOES INTO kitchen.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND CATHY

	Melanie interrupts her playing to take another puff at her 
	cigarette.

				CATHY
		Is smoking fun?

				MELANIE
		Oh, I suppose so.

				CATHY
		Could I have a puff?

				MELANIE
		I don't think your mother would like 
		that.

				CATHY (O.S.)
		Just a little one.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND CATHY

	They both glance conspiratorially toward the kitchen.  
	Quickly, Melanie extends the cigarette. Quickly, Cathy takes 
	a small puff.

				CATHY
			(delighted)
		Why, it's just like air, isn't it?
			(determined)
		When I grow up, I'm gonna smoke like 
		a chimney! I'll be eleven tomorrow, 
		you know.

				MELANIE
		I know.

				CATHY
		Are you coming to my party?

				MELANIE
		I don't think so.
			(seeing the child's 
			face)
		I have to get back to San Francisco.

				CATHY
		Don't you like us?

				MELANIE
			(touching her hair)
		Darling, of course I do!

				CATHY
		Don't you like Bodega Bay?

				MELANIE
		I don't know yet.

				CATHY
		Mitch likes it very much. He comes 
		up every weekend, you know, even 
		though he has his own apartment in 
		the city. He says San Francisco is 
		just an ant hill at the foot of a 
		bridge.

				MELANIE
			(smiling)
		I guess it does get a little hectic 
		at times.

				CATHY
		If you do decide to come, don't say 
		I told you about it. It's supposed 
		to be a surprise party.

	Melanie laughs.

				CATHY
		You see, they've got this whole 
		complicated thing figured out where 
		I'm going over to Michele's for the 
		afternoon, and Michele's mother is 
		going to say she has a headache and 
		would I mind very much if she took 
		me home. Then, when we get back here, 
		all of the kids'll jump out!
			(pause)
		Won't you come? Won't you please 
		come?

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	shaking her head, glancing toward the kitchen.

				MELANIE
		I don't think so, Cathy.

	INT. KITCHEN - TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH

	Mitch is helping her as she loads the dishwasher.

				LYDIA
		She's a charming girl, isn't she, 
		Mitch?

				MITCH
		Yes, very.

				LYDIA
		And certainly pretty.

				MITCH
		Yes.

				LYDIA
		How long have you known her?

				MITCH
		I told you. We met yesterday.

				LYDIA
		In a bird shop.

				MITCH
		Yes.

				LYDIA
		She was selling birds.

				MITCH
		No. I only led her into believing I 
		believed she was... Mother, it's 
		really very complicated.

				LYDIA
		But she did buy the lovebirds and 
		then brought them all the way...

				MITCH
		Mother, where did you go to law 
		school?

				LYDIA
			(laughing)
		Forgive me. I suppose I'm just 
		naturally curious about a girl like 
		that.
			(pause)
		She's very rich, isn't she?

				MITCH
		I suppose so. Her father owns a big 
		newspaper in San Francisco.

				LYDIA
		You'd think he could manage to keep 
		her name out of print. She's always 
		mentioned in the columns, Mitch.

				MITCH
		I know, Mother.

				LYDIA
		She is the one who jumped into that 
		fountain in Rome last summer, isn't 
		she?

				MITCH
		Yes, Mother.

				LYDIA
		Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.
			(pause)
		I know it was supposed to be very 
		warm there, Mitch, but... well...  
		actually... well, the newspaper said 
		she was naked.

				MITCH
		I know, Mother.

				LYDIA
		It's none of my business, of course, 
		but when you bring a girl like that 
		to...

				MITCH
		Mother?

				LYDIA
			(looking up)
		Yes?

				MITCH
		I think I can handle Melanie Daniels 
		by myself.

				LYDIA
		Well...
			(she sighs)
		So long as you know what you want, 
		Mitch.

				MITCH
		I know exactly what I want, Mother.

	FULL SHOT - THE BRENNER LAWN - EXTERIOR - NIGHT

	as Mitch and Melanie cross it to her car. A wind is blowing 
	off the water, and high fast clouds are scudding across the 
	face of the moon.

				MITCH
		You'll be able to find your way back, 
		won't you?

				MELANIE
		Oh, yes.

				MELANIE
		Will I be seeing you again?

				MELANIE
		San Francisco's a long way from here.

				MITCH
		I'm in San Francisco five days a 
		week. With a lot of time on my hands. 
		I'd like to see you.
			(he grins)
		Maybe we could go swimming or 
		something. Mother tells me you like 
		to swim.

				MELANIE
		How does Mother know what I like to 
		do?

				MITCH
		I guess she and I read the same gossip 
		columns.

				MELANIE
		Oh. That. Rome.

				MITCH
		Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get 
		along very...

				MELANIE
		In case you're interested, I was 
		pushed into that fountain.

				MELANIE
		Without any clothes on?

				MELANIE
		With all my clothes on!  The newspaper 
		that ran the story happens to be a 
		rival of my father's paper.  Anything 
		they said...

				MITCH
		You were just a poor, innocent victim 
		of circumstance, huh?

				MELANIE
		I'm neither poor nor innocent, but 
		the truth of that particular...

				MITCH
		The truth is you were running around 
		with a pretty wild crowd...

				MELANIE
		Yes, but...

				MITCH
		...who didn't much care for propriety 
		or convention or...

				MELANIE
		Yes.

				MITCH
		...the opinions of others, and you 
		went right along with them, isn't 
		that the truth?

				MELANIE
		Yes, that's the truth. But I was 
		pushed into that fountain, and that's 
		the truth, too.

				MITCH
		Sure. Do you really know Annie 
		Hayworth?

				MELANIE
		No.
			(pause)
		At least, I didn't until I came up 
		here.

				MITCH
		So you didn't go to school together.

				MELANIE
		No.

				MITCH
		And you didn't come up here to see 
		her.

				MELANIE
		No.

				MITCH
		You were lying.

				MELANIE
		Yes, I was lying.

				MITCH
		Did you really write a letter to me?  
		Or was that a lie, too?

				MELANIE
		I wrote the letter.

				MITCH
		What did it say?

				MELANIE
		It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think 
		you need those lovebirds, after all.  
		They may help your personality." 
		That's what it said.

				MITCH
		But you tore it up.

				MELANIE
		Yes.

				MITCH
		Why?

				MELANIE
		Because it seemed stupid and foolish.

				MITCH
		Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!

				MELANIE
		I told you what happened in Rome!

				MITCH
		Do you expect me to believe...?

				MELANIE
		I don't give a damn what you believe!

	Angrily she gets into the car, is about to slam the door 
	when Mitch catches it in his hands.

				MITCH
		I'd still like to see you.

				MELANIE
		Why?

				MITCH
		I think it could be fun.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	pulling the door shut.

				MELANIE
		That might have been good enough in 
		Rome last summer. But it's not good 
		enough now.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

				MITCH
		It is for me.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

				MELANIE
		But not for me.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

				MITCH
		What do you want ?

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

				MELANIE
			(angrily sarcastic)
		I thought you knew! I want to go 
		through life laughing and beautiful 
		and jumping into fountains naked!  
		Good night!

	MED. SHOT - THE CAR

	as it pulls away. Mitch yanks his hands back from the door.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	as he watches the car leave.

	LONG SHOT - THE ROAD

	The car turns the bend and disappears. Empty road. Only the 
	long line of telephone poles and wires and... something 
	strange on the wires.

	CLOSE SHOT MITCH

	His attention caught by the poles and wires.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE WIRES

	Hundreds of birds sitting on them.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	standing and watching. A wind blows off the water. He shivers 
	suddenly, turns up his collar, and heads for the house.

							  DISSOLVE

	INT. ANNIE HAYWORTH'S LIVING ROOM - MED. SHOT - ANNIE

	HAYWORTH

	In an easy chair, reading. She is wearing a robe and smoking, 
	absorbed in her book. She turns when she hears the front 
	DOOR OPENING.

				ANNIE
		Miss Daniels? Is that you?

				MELANIE (O.S.)
		Yes.

	Annie rises to greet her. As Melanie ENTERS THE SHOT:

				ANNIE
		Hi.
			(seeing her face)
		Is something wrong? Is that cut 
		beginning to bother you?

				MELANIE
			(touching her head)
		No, it's not the cut that's bothering 
		me.

				ANNIE
			(concerned)
		Would you like some brandy?

				MELANIE
		If you have some, I'd...

				ANNIE
		I'll get it, sit down, Miss Daniels.  
		Do you want a sweater or something?  
		A quilt?

	As Annie gets the brandy:

				MELANIE
		No, thank you.
			(pause)
		Won't you call me Melanie?

				ANNIE
		All right.
			(she smiles)

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE sitting, tucking her legs up under her. 
	She is disturbed by her conversation with Mitch and, in fact, 
	by the way this entire trip has worked out. Annie brings her 
	the glass of brandy, and she takes it gratefully.

				MELANIE
		Thank you.

				ANNIE
			(sitting opposite her)
		It gets a little chilly here at night 
		sometimes. Especially if you're over 
		near the bay.

	Melanie nods and sips at the brandy. There is a long pause.

				ANNIE
		Well, how'd your evening go?

	Melanie shrugs.

				ANNIE
		Did you meet Lydia?

	Melanie nods.

				ANNIE
		Or would you rather I changed the 
		subject?

				MELANIE
			(with a tired smile)
		I think so.

				ANNIE
			(nodding)
		How do you like our little hamlet?

				MELANIE
		I despise it.

				ANNIE
			(laughing)
		Well, I don't suppose it offers much 
		to the casual visitor. Unless you're 
		thrilled by a collection of shacks 
		on a hillside. It takes a while to 
		get used to.

				MELANIE
		Where are you from originally, Annie?

				ANNIE
		San Francisco.

				MELANIE
		How'd you happen to come here?

				ANNIE
		Oh, someone invited me up for the 
		weekend a long time ago.

	There is an awkward pause. Annie shrugs.

				ANNIE
		Look, I see no reason for being coy 
		about this. It was Mitch Brenner.

	Melanie nods.

				ANNIE
		I guess you knew that, anyway.

				MELANIE
		I suspected as much.

				ANNIE
		You needn't worry. It's over and 
		done with. A long time ago.

				MELANIE
		Annie -- there's nothing between 
		Mitch and me.

				ANNIE
		Isn't there?
			(she shrugs)
		Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's 
		never anything between Mitch and any 
		girl.

				MELANIE
		What do you mean?

				ANNIE
		I think I'll have some of that, too.
			(she pours brandy, 
			drinks, sighs)
		I was seeing quite a lot of him in 
		San Francisco, you know.
			(she smiles weakly)
		And then, one weekend, he asked me 
		up to meet Lydia.

				MELANIE
		When was this?

				ANNIE
		Four years ago. Of course, that was 
		shortly after his father died.  Things 
		may be different now.

				MELANIE
		Different?

				ANNIE
		With Lydia.
			(pause)
		Did she seem a trifle distant?

				MELANIE
			(smiling)
		A trifle.

				ANNIE
		Then maybe it isn't different at 
		all. You know, her attitude nearly 
		drove me crazy. I simply couldn't 
		understand it.

				ANNIE
		When I got back to San Francisco I 
		spent days trying to figure out just 
		what I'd done to displease her.

				MELANIE
		And what had you done?

				ANNIE
		Nothing! I simply existed. So what 
		was the answer? A jealous woman, 
		right? A clinging possessive mother.
			(she shakes her head)
		Wrong. With all due respect to 
		Oedipus, I don't think that was the 
		case at all.

				MELANIE
		Then what was it?

				ANNIE
		Lydia liked me, you see. That was 
		the strange part of it. In fact, now 
		that I'm no longer a threat, we're 
		very good friends.

				MELANIE
		Then why did she object to you?

				ANNIE
		Because she was afraid.

				MELANIE
		Afraid you'd take Mitch?

				ANNIE
		Afraid I'd give Mitch.

				MELANIE
		I don't understand.

				ANNIE
		Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch 
		the only thing Lydia can give him --
		love.

				MELANIE
		Annie, that adds up to a jealous, 
		possessive woman.

				ANNIE
		No, I don't think so. She's not afraid 
		of losing her son, you see.  She's 
		only afraid of being abandoned.

				MELANIE
		Someone ought to tell her she'd be 
		gaining a daughter.

				ANNIE
		She already has a daughter.

				MELANIE
		What about Mitch? Didn't he have 
		anything to say about this?

				ANNIE
			(apologetically)
		I can understand his position. He 
		went through a lot with Lydia after 
		his father died. He didn't want to 
		risk going through it all over again.

				MELANIE
		I see.

				ANNIE
		So it ended. Not immediately, of 
		course. I went back to San Francisco, 
		and I still saw Mitch every now and 
		then... but we both knew it was 
		finished.

				MELANIE
		Then what are you doing here in Bodega 
		Bay?

				ANNIE
		You get straight to the point, don't 
		you?

				MELANIE
		I'm sorry. Forgive me.

				ANNIE
		No, that's all right, I don't mind.  
		I came up here for two reasons. To 
		begin with, I was bored with my job 
		in San Francisco. I was teaching at 
		a private school there... well, you 
		know, you probably went to one 
		yourself.

				MELANIE
		I did.

				ANNIE
		Then you know. Little girls in brown 
		beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. 
		I'll go into that classroom on Monday 
		morning, and I'll look out at twenty-
		five upturned little faces, and each 
		of them will be saying, 'Yes, please 
		give me what you have.'
			(pause)
		And I'll give them what I have. I 
		haven't got very much, but I'll give 
		them every ounce of it. To me, that's 
		very important. It makes me want to 
		stay alive for a long long time.
			(she sighs)
		That's the first reason.

				MELANIE
		And the second?

				ANNIE
			(simply)
		I wanted to be near Mitch.
			(pause)
		It was over, and I knew it, but I 
		wanted to be near him, anyway.
			(she smiles)
		You see, I still like him a hell of 
		a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't 
		want to lose his friendship... ever.

	There is a moment of silence. Into the silence, the TELEPHONE 
	shrills. Annie hesitates a moment, and then goes to answer 
	it.

	CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE

	at the phone.

				ANNIE
		Hello?  Oh, hello. No, no, I wasn't 
		asleep. What is it?
			(pause)
		Yes, just a little while ago. Sure, 
		hold on.
			(she turns to Melanie)
		It's Mitch. For you.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE

	as they stare at each other across the room, Melanie 
	hesitating.

				ANNIE
		He's waiting.

	Melanie rises and goes to the phone. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Annie 
	to the wing chair in the foreground and stays on her 
	throughout following, recording her reactions as Melanie 
	talks to Mitch in the background.

	Annie is not devastated by this call, and yet there is a 
	wistfulness to her expression as she realizes she may finally 
	and irrevocably be losing Mitch to another girl.

				MELANIE
			(at phone; coolly)
		Hello? Yes, this is Melanie. Fine, 
		thank you. No, no trouble at all.  I 
		simply followed the road. It's a 
		very bright night.
			(pause)
		What?  Oh. Well, there's no need to 
		apologize. I can understand...
			(pause; she listens)
		Well...
			(she listens again)
		That's very kind of you. No, I'm not 
		angry.
			(she listens)
		I couldn't. I'm afraid I have to get 
		back to San Francisco.
			(pause)
		No, I wouldn't want to disappoint 
		Cathy, but...
			(pause)
		I see.
			(she is warming)
		I see. Well, if you really...
			(pause)
		All right. Yes, I'll be there.
			(pause)
		Good night, Mitch.

	She hangs up and looks at Annie in embarrassment.

				MELANIE
		He wants me to go to Cathy's party 
		tomorrow afternoon.
			(pause)
		I said I would.

				ANNIE
		I'll be going, too, to help out. It 
		should be fun, Melanie.

				MELANIE
		It seems so pointless.
			(she sighs)
		I think I'll go to sleep. This has 
		been a busy day.
			(picking up her paper 
			bag)
		My luggage.

	She smiles, takes out a flowered muumuu, holds it up to Annie.

				ANNIE
		Pretty. Did you get that at 
		Brinkmeyer's?

	Melanie nods and drapes the muumuu over her arm. She is silent 
	for a moment, pensive. Then:

				MELANIE
		Do you think I should go?

				ANNIE
		That's up to you.

				MELANIE
		It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?

				ANNIE
		Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?

				MELANIE
			(firmly)
		Yes.

				ANNIE
		Then go.

	The room is silent. Melanie nods, slowly, and then smiles.

				MELANIE
		Thank you, Annie.

	Suddenly, into the silence, comes a THUMP at the door, 
	startling them both.

				ANNIE
			(rising)
		Who can that be at this hour?
			(she walks to door)
		Who is it?
			(no answer)
		Is someone there?

	Melanie goes to stand beside Annie. Puzzled, Annie unlocks 
	the door, and then opens it. She looks out into the night.  
	There is nothing but the SOUND of the wind.

				ANNIE
			(to the emptiness 
			outside)
		Is anyone there?

				MELANIE
			(pointing to the ground)
		Look.

	CLOSE SHOT - A DEAD SEAGULL

	CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE

				ANNIE
			(sympathetically)
		Ohhh. Oh, the poor thing. He probably 
		lost his way in the dark.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	who stares at the dead bird as Annie stoops to pick it up.  
	And then, slowly:

				MELANIE
		But... it isn't dark, Annie.  There's 
		a full moon.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE

	as Annie, stooping, looks up at her. On their puzzlement and 
	consternation:

							  FADE OUT

	FADE IN

	HIGH SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE The place is decorated with 
	balloons strung from the house to various points on the lawn. 
	The children, in party clothes, with their parents, are 
	clustered around a long folding table upon which are 
	sandwiches, ice cream and soft drinks. The parents are either 
	helping the children to more or telling them they are having 
	too much. There is a general SOUND of kid's CHATTER and 
	LAUGHTER. Coming up the sloping path, away from the party, 
	are Melanie and Mitch. The CAMERA PANS them UP the slope and 
	away from the party in background. As they turn the hairpin 
	bend of the slope, and come up toward the CAMERA, we see the 
	entrance of the harbor and the Pacific in the background. 
	The CAMERA PANS them as they come near to us and, once more, 
	the party is in the background. Mitch and Melanie pass the 
	CAMERA out to the left.

	CLOSER SHOT - THE TOP OF THE DUNES

	Melanie and Mitch come INTO the picture from the right and 
	stand against the sky. Mitch takes a martini shaker from one 
	of his pockets, and two glasses from the other. He hands one 
	of the glasses to Melanie, and then pours.

				MELANIE
		I really shouldn't have any more.  
		I'm a little tipsy already.

				MITCH
		I'm trying to get you to stay for 
		dinner. We're going to have a lot of 
		roast left over.

				MELANIE
		I couldn't possibly. I have to get 
		back.

				MITCH
			(with a shrug)
		Cheers.

				MELANIE
		Cheers.

	They drink.

				MELANIE
		What's in this? Nitro-glycerin?

				MITCH
		Why do you have to rush off? What's 
		so important in San Francisco?

				MELANIE
		Well... I have to get to work tomorrow 
		morning, for one thing.

				MITCH
			(surprised)
		You have a job?

				MELANIE
			(sipping at the martini)
		I have several jobs.

				MITCH
		What do you do?

				MELANIE
		I do different things on different 
		days.

				MITCH
		Like what?

				MELANIE
			(hesitating)
		On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work 
		for the Travelers' Aid. At the 
		airport.

				MITCH
		Helping travelers.

				MELANIE
		Yes.

	She hesitates for a moment, thinking. She has never really 
	considered before what she does with her time, and now that 
	she is accounting for it, it sounds a little meaningless and 
	unimportant.

				MELANIE
		And on Tuesdays, I take a course in 
		General Semantics at Berkeley.  That's 
		not a job, of course. I just take it 
		because...

				MITCH
		What about Thursdays and Fridays?

				MELANIE
		On Thursdays I have my meeting and 
		lunch.
			(pause)
		I'm chairman of a group that's sending 
		a little Korean boy through school.  
		We plan how to raise funds and... 
		things like that.
			(she shrugs)

				MITCH
		And Fridays? What do you do then?

				MELANIE
		Nothing.
			(she smiles)
		I go to bird shops on Fridays.

				MITCH
		I'm glad you do.

				MELANIE
		Do you know what I was doing in that 
		shop?

				MITCH
		What?

				MELANIE
		I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. 
		She's seventy years old, and veddy 
		prim and strait-laced.
			(she does an imitation)
		She's coming back from Europe at the 
		end of the month, and I'm going to 
		give her a myna bird that'll talk to 
		her.

				MITCH
		What'll it say?

				MELANIE
			(facetiously)
		You'll think me very bold, sir.

				MITCH
		No, tell me.

	She leans over and whispers in his ear. They both burst out 
	LAUGHTER. But then suddenly, a very serious look comes into 
	Melanie's face.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	serious, introspective.

				MELANIE
		That's silly, isn't it?  Teaching a 
		bird to shock my aunt. That's just 
		silly and childish.
			(slight pause)
		Maybe I ought to go join the other 
		children.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	as she moves abruptly away from him, and starts toward where 
	the children have begun playing Blind Man's Bluff. Mitch 
	stares after her for a moment, moved by this sudden glimpse 
	of character, and then follows her down the dune. The children 
	are all in a circle. Annie is busy changing the blindfold 
	from Michele to Cathy.

	CAMERA PANS - MELANIE AND MITCH

	The CAMERA is now on the lawn POINTING UP toward dunes. We 
	see Mitch and Melanie descending. They are coming down by 
	way of a short cut and are not on the zig-zag path. As they 
	reach the lawn they move along the side of it at the foot of 
	the dunes. They are absorbed in each other. The CAMERA PANS 
	OFF them and BRING INTO the picture Annie, surrounded by the 
	children. She is in the act of changing the blindfold from 
	Michele to Cathy. She hands Michele her glasses back.  During 
	this, and while she is putting the blindfold round the eyes 
	of Cathy, she is looking to her right and obviously is 
	watching Mitch and Melanie.

	MITCH AND MELANIE - ANNIE'S P.O.V.

	MED. SHOT - ANNIE

	CAMERA MOVES A LITTLE to her left (CAMERA RIGHT). At this 
	moment, in the background, Lydia is emerging with the birthday 
	cake. The candles on it are unlit. Lydia immediately also 
	catches sight of Mitch and Melanie and she slows up somewhat 
	as she walks to the long table, her eyes still on the couple. 
	During this we see Annie in the foreground sending Cathy 
	off.

				ANNIE
		All right then, here we go.
			(she spins her)
		Once!
			(she spins her again)
		Twice!
			(she spins her again)
		Three! Go get 'em, Cathy!

	She says all this while still looking toward the couple. She 
	turns her head away from the couple with a new expression on 
	her face. She twists completely around to look at Lydia as 
	though she were wondering if Lydia sees what she sees.  
	Suddenly we HEAR a little boy's voice crying:

				LITTLE BOY (O.S.)
		Look! Look!

	Annie swings round and the CAMERA RUSHES INTO her face as 
	she looks up.

	LONG SHOT - ANNIE'S P.O.V.

	A gull is swooping down.

	CLOSE SHOT - CATHY

	as she changes her tactics, stops dead, and then cautiously 
	reaches out in front of her at the air. The gull suddenly 
	swoops at her, hitting her shoulder. She whirls.

				CATHY
		No touching allowed!

	She almost falls.

	FULL SHOT - THE GULL

	seen from Cathy's position. He flies off, cycles and then 
	returns.

	CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE

	reacting to gull. She turns her head back to Cathy.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	reacting to the gull hitting Cathy. They start towards Cathy.

	MED. SHOT - ANNIE

	with Cathy and the children around. The CAMERA PANS DOWN as 
	she ducks with two gulls swooping by.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	They look up.

	LONG SHOT - THE GULLS

	against the sky, flying away in formation.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	about to swing with the broom again, but the birds are no

	Melanie.

				MITCH
		Are you all right?

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

				MELANIE
		Yes.

				ANNIE
			(coming over)
		That's the darnest thing thing I've 
		ever seen in my life.

	TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH

				LYDIA
		Are they gone?

				MITCH
		They're gone, Mother.

	FULL SHOT - THE LAWN

	as the children begin drifting back toward the table and the 
	cake. There is the curious feeling of lighting having struck 
	very close by without having injured anyone. All that 
	adrenaline has boiled up, and now it has no place to go.

				LYDIA
		Well... well, is everyone all right?

				MITCH
			(with a small boy)
		I think he got a little scratch, 
		Mother.

				GIRL #3
		Did you see them? They were hawks!

				GIRL #4
		They were bigger than hawks!

				ANNIE
		Children, they were only seagulls.

	And then the meaning of what she has just said strikes her, 
	and she remembers the bird hitting her door the night before.

	TWO SHOT - ANNIE AND MELANIE

	as Annie turns to look at her and they exchange a silent 
	meaningful glance.

	BACK TO SCENE

				CATHY
		They must have been after the food, 
		Mother.

	They all turn toward the table.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE TABLE AND THE REST OF THE FOOD ON THE TABLE,

		Well, they're gone now, so... so 
		let's...
			(pause)
		Who was 'it?' You were 'it,' weren't 
		you, Cathy?

				GIRL #2
		Can I be 'it,' Miss Hayworth?

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	as Annie and the children begin the game behind them.

				MITCH
		You look a little shaken.

				MELANIE
		I... I am.
			(pause)
		Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, 
		is it? The gull yesterday when I was 
		in the boat, and the one last night 
		at Annie's, and now...

				MITCH
		Last night? What do you mean?

				MELANIE
		A gull smashed into Annie's front 
		door.
			(pause)
		Mitch... what's happening?

				MITCH
			(concerned)
		I don't know, Melanie.
			(pause)
		Look, do you have to go back to 
		Annie's?

				MELANIE
		No, I have my things in the car.

				MITCH
			(gently)
		Then stay and have something to eat 
		before you start back. I'd feel a 
		lot better.

	She nods, and then looks up at the sky. Suddenly she shudders.

	a terrible racket.

				MITCH
		Do you want some mustard with this?

				MELANIE (O.S.)
		No, thank you.

				CATHY

		Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?

				MITCH
		She said something about having to

				CATHY
		Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?

				MITCH
		Take it into the living room, would

		What's the matter with them?

	Lydia turns from a side table, where she is cutting some 
	French bread.

				LYDIA
		What's the matter with all the birds?

	She covers the cage. Under the cover, the birds are still 
	tweeting madly. Lydia stares at the covered cage for a moment, 
	and then signs heavily.

				LYDIA
		Hurry up with the rest, Mitch. I'm 
		sure Miss Daniels wants to get on

	They are now all eating with plates on their knees - buffet

				MELANIE
		If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll 
		come onto the freeway much earlier.

				LYDIA
			(picking up a cup)
		Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted, 
		isn't it, Mitch?

				MITCH
		Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that 
		traffic going back to San Francisco.

				CATHY
		Did you put the cover on that cage, 
		Mom?

				LYDIA
		Yes, I did.

				CATHY
		Just listen to them!

				MITCH

		Some cream?

	rushing to the fireplace. He is almost knocked over by birds

	She lets out a horrified scream. There are birds fluttering 
	in her hair, caught there.

	MED. SHOT - AL MALONE, THE DEPUTY

	a plain man with a limited intelligence, used to giving out 
	speeding tickets or warning drunks. He holds the bird on the 
	palm of his hand, looks at it steadily, nodding all the while.

				MALONE
		That's a chimney swift, all right.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

				MITCH
		We know what it is, Al.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

	Lydia is huddled in one of the easy chairs, still in shock.

				MALONE
		Well, these birds live in chimneys, 
		you know.

				MITCH
		Not by the thousands.

				MALONE
		No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.
			(pause)
		Did you have a light burning or 
		something.

				MITCH
		Yes, but the curtains were drawn.

				MALONE
		'Cause sometimes birds are attracted 
		by light, you know.
			(pause)
		Sure is a peculiar thing.

				MITCH
		What are we going to do about it, 
		Al?

				MALONE
		I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do 
		about what?

				MITCH
		Well...
			(he feels a little 
			foolish)
		Well... these birds attacked us.

	CLOSE SHOT - MALONE

	slight disbelief on his face.

				MALONE
		What's more likely, they got in the 
		room and was just panicked, that's 
		all.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

				MITCH
			(still a little 
			hesitant)
		All right, I'll grant you a bird'll 
		panic in an enclosed room. But, they 
		didn't just get in. They came in! 
		Right down that chimney.

	TWO SHOT - MITCH AND MALONE

				MALONE
			(trying to make sense 
			of this)
		My wife found a bird in the back 
		seat of her car once.

				MALONE
			(shrugs)
		Didn't know how he got in there.  
		Had a broken leg, turned out. Just 
		fluttering all around there.
			(he shrugs again)

				MITCH
		These birds were...

				MALONE
		What I'm trying to say, Mitch, is 
		these things happen sometimes, you 
		know? Ain't much we can do about it.
			(he shrugs)

				LYDIA
		Tell him about the party.

				MITCH
		That's right. We had a party here 
		this afternoon for Cathy. Her 
		birthday.

				MALONE
		Oh, yeah, yeah.
			(he grins)
		How old is she now?

				MITCH
		Eleven. In the middle of the party, 
		some gulls came down at the children. 
		And Miss Daniels was attacked by a 
		gull just yesterday after...

	CLOSE SHOT - MALONE

	considering this.

				MALONE
		Yeah.
			(thinking)
		Were the kids bothering them or 
		something? 'Cause sometimes they'll 
		do that, you know. If you make any 
		kind of disturbance near them, they'll 
		just come after you. I seen that 
		plenty of times myself.

	TWO SHOT - MALONE AND LYDIA

				LYDIA
		The children were playing a game, 
		Al. Those gulls attacked without...

				MALONE
		Now, Lydia, 'attack' is a pretty 
		strong word, don't you think? I mean, 
		birds just don't go around attacking 
		people without no reason, you know 
		what I mean? The kids just probably 
		scared them, that's all.

				LYDIA
		These birds attacked!

				MALONE
			(nodding)
		Well, what would you like me to do, 
		Lydia? Put out a pick up and hold on 
		any suspicious birds in the area?
			(he smiles)
		Now, that'd be pretty silly, wouldn't 
		it?

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

				MITCH
		Does this room look silly?

	TWO SHOT - MITCH AND MALONE

				MALONE
		No, you got quite a mess here, I'll 
		admit that.
			(pause)
		Maybe you oughta put some screening 
		on top of your chimney
			(pause)
		Seems a little pointless, though.

		happen again in a million years.

							  FADE OUT

	FADE IN

	INT. BEDROOM IN BRENNER HOUSE - MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	Melanie has just gotten out of bed. She is wearing the rather 
	unsophisticated nightdress she brought at the store.  Her 
	hair is loose. She wears no makeup. She is bent over a 
	lavatory which has been installed in the bedroom. She is 
	busily brushing her teeth. Her head half turns as she HEARS 
	VOICES.

	 

				LYDIA'S VOICE
		Mitch! Mitch! Mitch, I'm going to 
		drop Cathy off now.

				MITCH'S VOICE
		Okay.

				LYDIA'S VOICE
		I'll probably drive over to the 
		Fawcett farm. Do you need anything 
		in town?

				MITCH'S VOICE
		No.

	Melanie finished brushing her teeth. She goes to the window 
	and looks out. Outside, we HEAR the SOUND of the pickup truck 
	starting.

	FULL SHOT - THE YARD BELOW - MELANIE'S P.O.V.

	as Cathy, carrying her schoolbooks, runs to the pickup truck 
	and climbs in. The truck moves out of the yard and down the 
	road. It turns the bend, and moves out of sight.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	turning from the window. She goes to the bedroom door, CAMERA 
	FOLLOWING. She opens the door.

				MELANIE
		Mitch?

	There is no answer.

				MELANIE
		Mitch?

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	coming down the steps from the attic room. The house is empty. 
	The CAMERA FOLLOWS her into the dining room, where she stops 
	at the cage of lovebirds, bends down to them with a smile on 
	her face.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE AND THE BIRDS

	She smiles and pokes her finger into the cage. The birds 
	TWEET at her.

				MELANIE

		Chee-chee-chee-chee-chee.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	leaving the cage. She walks to the sideboard upon which is 
	an electric coffee percolator which is plugged into the wall.  
	She feels it with her hand. It is hot. She pours a cup, then 
	peers out of the side window.

	LONG SHOT - MELANIE'S P.O.V.

	Mitch on the shore, working with a rake in his hands. A thin 
	column of smoke is climbing the sky.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	carrying the cup of coffee. She sets it down for a moment to 
	put on her fur coat, which is hanging on the hall stand. She 
	picks up the cup again, walks to the front door and EXITS.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	coming out of the house and into the garden, carrying the 
	cup of coffee. It is a beautiful day. She sips at her coffee 
	and then breathes deeply of the air.

	CLOSE SHOT - HER FACE

	fresh, rested. There is a contentment in her which we have 
	not seen before. She looks off toward the shore.

	LONG SHOT - MITCH

	on the shore, working with the rake. The thin column of smoke 
	is climbing the sky.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	She turns her attention away from Mitch, and walks to the 
	end of the garden toward the shore. A wind is blowing off 
	the water, moving white puffs of cloud swiftly across the 
	sky, whipping the full short shirt of muumuu about her legs 
	as she walks. She stands there silhouetted against the sky 
	for a moment.

	SLOW PAN

	as Melanie scans the horizon. There isn't a bird anywhere in 
	sight. The day is still and clear, but somehow ominous in 
	its silence. Her gaze comes to rest on Mitch and the thin 
	column of smoke again. In the distance, Mitch sees her and 
	raises his arm in greeting. She waves back at him. He puts 
	the rake down and begins walking toward the house.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	There is anticipation on her face now. She watches Mitch 
	coming toward her, her eyes glowing.

	FULL SHOT - MITCH

	closer to the house now.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	waiting, anticipating.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	He stops, looks at her, and then turns toward the house.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	as first surprised, and then puzzled. The back screen DOOR 
	CLATTERS shut off screen. A small hurt look crosses her face.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	as she turns away from the house and begins walking in the 
	garden, sipping idly at her coffee. A screen DOOR CLATTERS 
	again. She turns.

	Mitch is coming out of the house, from the front door, wearing 
	a different shirt, buttoning it as he walks to her.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

				MITCH
		I wanted to change my shirt.

	Melanie is uncomprehending.

				MITCH
		It smelled of the fire.

				MELANIE
			(nodding)
		It's hard to believe anything at all 
		happened yesterday, isn't it? It's 
		so beautiful and still now.
			(pause; then sagely)
		I think I've got it all figured out, 
		by the way.

				MITCH
		Really? Tell me about it.

				MELANIE
			(secretively)
		It's an uprising.

				MITCH
		Of birds?

				MELANIE
		Certainly, of birds.

	Mitch grins.

				MELANIE
		It all started several months ago 
		with a peasant sparrow up in the 
		hills, a malcontent. He went around 
		telling all the other sparrows that 
		human beings weren't fit to rule 
		this planet, preaching wherever anyone 
		would listen...

				MITCH
		Growing a beard...

				MELANIE
			(delighted)
		Yes, of course, he had to have a 
		beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' 
		he kept saying, over and over...

				MITCH
		So they united.

				MELANIE
		Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows 
		out for kicks...

				MITCH
		Well, they'll go along with anything.

				MELANIE
		Sure. But eventually, even the more 
		serious-minded birds began to listen.  
		"Why should humans rule?" they asked
		 themselves.

				MITCH
		Hear!

				MELANIE
		Why should we submit ourselves to 
		their domination?

				MITCH
		Hear, hear!

				MELANIE
		And all the while, that sparrow was 
		getting in his little messages.  
		Birds of the world, unite!

				MITCH
		Take wing!

				MELANIE
		You have nothing to lose but your 
		feathers.

	They both burst out laughing, then fall into silence, then 
	laugh again and finally are silent. The garden is deathly 
	still.

				MITCH
			(attempting to be 
			serious)
		What it was, probably...

				MELANIE
		Mmm?

				MITCH
		They're probably hungry, that's all.  
		This was a bad summer. They eat 
		berries and... and nuts, you know, 
		and the hills are all burned out, so 
		they're probably searching for food 
		wherever they can get it.

				MELANIE
		With my little sparrow leading team.

	She laughs, and Mitch joins her, but it is hollow this time.  
	Like children who have told themselves a too realistic horror 
	story, they are becoming a little frightened.

				MITCH
		It's so damn quiet out there.

				MELANIE
		It was like that yesterday.

				MITCH
		What do you mean?

				MELANIE
		After the gulls attacked.

				MITCH
		I hadn't thought of that.
			(pause)
		And then the swifts came.

				MELANIE
		It makes you feel as if they're... 
		they're waiting or... resting... 
		or....

				MITCH
			(trying to make it 
			light again)
		No, they're having a meeting, Melanie. 
		Your sparrow is standing on a soap 
		box and...

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	her face dead serious.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

				MITCH
		...waving his little wings...

	His voice trails. His face becomes serious, too. Again, the 
	garden is silent.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	her face set and grim, her eyes serious, her words coming 
	slowly and with the chill of horror on them.

				MELANIE
		They were angry, Mitch. They came 
		out of the chimney in fury.
			(pause)
		I had the feeling they wanted each 
		and every one of us dead.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	He takes her in his arms suddenly, to comfort her. She goes 
	to him longingly.

				MITCH
		Melanie, Melanie...

				MELANIE
		I'm frightened, Mitch.

				MITCH
		No, no...

				MELANIE
		I'm frightened and confused and I... 
		I think I want to go back to San 
		Francisco where there are buildings 
		and... and concrete and...

				MITCH
		Melanie...

				MELANIE
		...everything I know.

	She looks up at him suddenly.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

				MELANIE
		Oh damn it, why did you have to walk 
		into that shop?

	They kiss suddenly and fiercely. On their kiss,

	MED. SHOT - LYDIA

	reaching into the bag of feed. She scatters some on the 
	ground.

				LYDIA
		Here, chick, chick, chick, chick.  
		Here, chick, chick, chick, chick.

	CLOSE SHOT - A CHICKEN

	He struts up to the scattered grain.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	watching him.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE CHICKEN

	He seems to be examining the feed. Then he turns away from 
	it and struts off.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	a small knowledgeable nod of her head. The chicken's reaction 
	strengthens her determination to talk to Fawcett.  She turns.

	FULL SHOT - LYDIA

	approaching the front door again. She knocks. No answer.

				LYDIA
		Dan?

	She backs away from the house again. The barnyard is silent.  
	In the distance, we can HEAR the SOUND of the tractor.

				LYDIA
		Dan? Are you home?

	No answer.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	a little annoyed. She glances at the ground floor window 
	closest to the door.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE WINDOW

	A small pane of glass is broken.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	puzzled.

	FULL SHOT - LYDIA

	going to the front door, trying the knob.

	MED. SHOT - LYDIA

	The door opening ahead of her as she pokes her head into the 
	house.

				LYDIA
		Dan?

	The house is still and silent.

	INT. THE ENTRY HALL - FULL SHOT

	as Lydia comes in. We can see the living room off to the 
	right, but it looks normal and untouched. Lydia turns to her 
	left and looks down a long corridor.

	FULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR - LYDIA'S P.O.V.

	a door at the end of it is partially ajar, spilling artificial 
	light into the corridor.

				LYDIA
		Dan?

	No answer.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	a little troubled. She seems deciding whether or not she 
	should leave. A determined look comes over her face.

	FULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR - LYDIA'S P.O.V.

	as she walks down it slowly toward the open door at the 
	opposite end. Outside the door, she pauses.

				LYDIA
		Dan? Are you in there?

	No answer. Lydia puts out her hand, slowly begins showing 
	the door open.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	coming into the room. Her eyes begin to take in the room.

	SLOW PAN OF THE ROOM - LYDIA'S P.O.V.

	starting to the right of the doorway as she enters and 
	continuing a little below eye level, the CAMERA PICKS OUT: A 
	standing floor lamp, the shade dangling, but the light still 
	burning; a picture hanging askew on the wall, its glass 
	shattered; the window to the left of the picture, every pane 
	of glass shattered; a dresser with two stuffed birds on its 
	top; both birds have been badly damaged, the stuffing ripped 
	out of them, the head of one hanging at a crooked near 
	decapitated angle; the window to the left of the dresser, 
	all the panes shattered. The level of the CAMERA DESCENDS, 
	and begins a SLOW PAN of the floor. It PICKS OUT broken glass, 
	continues its PAN to SHOW scattered feathers, continues its 
	PAN to SHOW a broom, feathers caught in the straw, a single 
	bedroom slipper, continues to SHOW a pair of legs in pajamas, 
	one foot bare, the other slippered, and then immediately 

							  CUTS TO:

	CLOSE SHOT - DAN FAWCETT

	His face. Covered with blood, the eyes missing from their 
	empty staring sockets.  Immediately

							   CUT TO:

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	a terrified scream erupting from her mouth.

	FULL SHOT - LYDIA

	turning and running for the door. The CAMERA FOLLOWS her in 
	an unbroken headlong flight, the scream continuing as if she 
	is incapable of stopping it, as she stumbles, runs, trips 
	her way down the corridor and bursts out of the house, still 
	screaming, into the pickup truck. The engine starts, she 
	backs the truck out at breakneck speed and hits the highway,

	CAMERA FOLLOWING.  CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	at the wheel, her face stamped with terror, her eyes wide.

	FULL SHOT - THE TRUCK

	at breakneck speed, negotiating the severe curves on the 
	highway. It almost hits a small car coming from the opposite 
	direction, swerves, screeches around the curve.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	behind the wheel, unmindful of anything but flight.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROAD - LYDIA'S POV

	through the windshield, blurring past. She turns the bend 
	leading to the house. For an instant, through the windshield, 
	there is a quick glimpse of Melanie and Mitch in embrace in 
	the garden. Then the tires shriek, and the truck turns and 
	barrels into the front yard.

	FULL SHOT - MITCH

	alarmed as he runs out of the garden and toward the truck 
	just as it jerks to a stop.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	through the truck as he pulls open the door opposite Lydia.

				MITCH
			(alarmed)
		What is it?

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	as he sees his mother.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	slumped on the wheel of the car, her head on her arms, 
	sobbing. On her sobs...

							  DISSOLVE

	INT. BRENNER KITCHEN - MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	at the kitchen stove, taking a kettle of tea from the burner.  
	She pours it into a cup, puts the cup on a tray already set 
	with sugar and creamer. She looks up as Mitch comes into the 
	kitchen.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

				MITCH
		That was Al on the phone. He wants 
		me to meet him out at the Fawcett 
		place. Says some detectives from 
		Santa Rosa'll be there in a little 
		while.
			(pause)
		Will you be all right here?

				MELANIE
		Yes. I was just taking her in some 
		tea.

	He goes to her, puts his arms around her from behind, kisses 
	her hair. But she turns in his arms suddenly and clings to 
	him fiercely, and then buries her head in his shoulder.

				MELANIE
		Be careful. Please.

	She walks him to the door. At the door, they kiss -- a long, 
	full kiss.

	FULL SHOT -- THE KITCHEN

	as Mitch goes out. Melanie looks after him for a moment, and 
	then picks up the tray. Outside, we HEAR the SOUND of his 
	car starting. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Melanie out of the kitchen, 
	through the dining room, and to one of the bedroom doors on 
	the other side of the house. Gently, she KNOCKS.

				LYDIA (O.S.)
		Mitch?

	FULL SHOT - THE BEDROOM

	This is Lydia's room, and cluttered with the mementos of a 
	life no longer valid.  There are photographs of her dead 
	husband, souvenirs of trips taken together, bric-a-brac of 
	Mitch's childhood. Under it all, there is a distinct 
	femininity. She sits up in bed as Melanie enters, bearing 
	the tray.

				MELANIE
		No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought 
		you might like some tea.

	TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MELANIE

				LYDIA
		Oh, thank you.

	There is a long silence as Melanie puts the tray on the bed, 
	arranges the pillows behind Lydia.

				LYDIA
		Where's Mitch?

				MELANIE
		Al Malone wanted him out at the 
		Fawcett farm.

				LYDIA
		Why? Didn't Al believe my story?

				MELANIE
		He was calling from the farm, Mrs.  
		Brenner.

				LYDIA
		Then he saw.

				MELANIE
		He must have. He sent for the Santa 
		Rosa police.

				LYDIA
		What good will they do?

	She sips at the tea. There is a long awkward pause. Melanie 
	walks to the window and looks out over the bay.

				LYDIA
		Do you think Cathy's all right?

				MELANIE
		What?

				LYDIA
		Cathy. At the school.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	at the window, her face turned away from Lydia. Her expression 
	clearly shows that she doesn't know whether Cathy is all 
	right. But when she turns to Lydia, there is a comforting 
	smile on her face, and her voice is soothing.

				MELANIE
		Yes, I'm sure she's fine.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND LYDIA

				LYDIA
		Do I sound foolish to you?

				MELANIE
		No.

				LYDIA
		I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.
			(she shudders)
		They have such big windows at the 
		school.
			(pause)
		All the windows were broken. In Dan's 
		bedroom. All the windows.

				MELANIE
		Try not to think of that, Mrs.  
		Brenner.

				LYDIA
		I wish I were a stronger person.  
		There is a long awkward silence. She 
		sips at her tea reflectively.

				LYDIA
		I lost my husband four years ago, 
		you know.
			(pause)
		It's odd how you depend on someone 
		for strength, and then suddenly all 
		the strength is gone, and you're 
		alone.
			(pause)
		I'd love to relax some time. I'd 
		love to be able to sleep.
			(pause; the worried 
			look again)
		Do you think Cathy's all right?

				MELANIE
		Annie's there. She'll be all right.

				LYDIA
		I'm not this way, you know. Not 
		usually. I don't fuss and fret over 
		my children.
			(pause)
		When Frank died...
			(pause)
		You see, he knew the children, he 
		really knew them. He had the knack 
		of being able to enter into their 
		world, of becoming a part of them.  
		That's a rare talent.

				MELANIE
		Yes.

				LYDIA
		I wish I could be that way.

	There is another silence. A curious thing is happening in 
	this room. Lydia, for perhaps the first time since her 
	husband's death, is discussing it with another person.  
	Curiously, the person is Melanie.

				LYDIA
			(honestly and simply)
		I miss him.
			(pause)
		You know, sometimes I wake up in the 
		morning, and I think 'I have to make 
		Frank's breakfast,' and I... I get 
		up and there's a... a very good reason 
		for getting out of bed until... until, 
		of course, I remember.
			(pause)
		I miss talking to him.
			(pause)
		Cathy's a child, you know, and 
		Mitch...
			(she shrugs a little 
			sadly)
		...Mitch has his own life.
			(pause)
		I'm glad he stayed here today. I 
		feel safer with him here.
			(she sighs deeply)

				MELANIE
		Would you like to rest now, Mrs.  
		Brenner.

				LYDIA
		No.  No... don't go yet.
			(pause)
		I feel as if I... I don't understand 
		you. And I want so much to understand.

				MELANIE
		Why, Mrs. Brenner?

				LYDIA
		Because my son is...
			(pause)
		My son seems to be fond of you.
			(pause)
		And I...
			(pause)
		I'm not quite sure how I feel about 
		it. I really don't know if I... like 
		you or not.

				MELANIE
		Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner?  
		You liking me?

				LYDIA
		Yes, I think so. My son is important 
		to me. I want to like any girl he 
		chooses.

				MELANIE
		And if you don't?

				LYDIA
			(with a faint smile)
		Then I don't suppose it'll matter 
		much to anyone but me.

				MELANIE
		I think it might also matter to Mitch.

				LYDIA
			(shaking her head)
		Mitch has always done exactly what 
		he wanted to do.
			(pause)
		I'm not complaining. That's the mark 
		of a man.  But...
			(pause)
		You see, I... I wouldn't want to 
		be... be left alone. I don't think I 
		could bear being left alone.  I... 
		forgive me. This business with the 
		birds has me upset.  I... I don't 
		know what I'd do if Mitch weren't 
		here.

				MELANIE
			(going to the bed; 
			adjusting the pillow)
		Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs.  
		Brenner.

				LYDIA
			(sighing)
		I wish I were stronger.
			(she pauses and looks 
			toward the window.)
		Do you think she's all right? Do you 
		think she's safe at the school?

				MELANIE
		Would you like me to go for her?

				LYDIA
		I couldn't ask you to.

				MELANIE
		I don't mind, really.

				LYDIA
		Would you? I'd feel so much better.

				MELANIE
		I'll just clear up here, and then 
		dress.

	She picks up the tray and starts for the door.

				LYDIA
		Melanie?

	At the door, Melanie turns.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	her face soft.

				LYDIA
			(gently)
		Thank you for the tea.

	EXT. BODEGA BAY - DAY - LONG SHOT

	Melanie's car turns and goes up School Road.

	EXT. SCHOOL - DAY - MED. SHOT

	Closer shot of the car coming to a stop outside school.  
	Inside the school, we HEAR the children SINGING.

				CHILDREN (O.S.)
		I married my wife in the month of 
		June. Ristle-tee, rostle-tee, mo, mo 
		mo!

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	smiling as she gets out of the car and heads for the school.

				CHILDREN (O.S.)
		I carried her off in a silver spoon.  
		Ristle-tee, rostle-tee, hey bombosity,

		mo, mo!  Uality, willoby-wallaby, 
		quo-mo, mo, mo!

	The CAMERA FOLLOWS Melanie into the school and down the 
	corridor. The children's VOICES are LOUDER now.

				CHILDREN (O.S.)
		She combed her hair but once a year.  
		Ristle-tee, rostle-tee, Mo, mo, mo!  
		With every rake, she shed a tear.  
		Ristle-tee, rostle-tee, hey bombosity, 
		knickety-knackety, retro-quo-quality, 
		willoby-wallaby, Mo, mo, mo!

	Melanie is at the door to Annie's room now. She opens the 
	door and looks in.

	FULL SHOT - ANNIE - MELANIE'S P.O.V.

	leading the children in song. She catches sight of Melanie 
	at the door. Melanie wiggles her fingers. Annie points to 
	her wristwatch indicating that she'll be finished in a few 
	minutes and motions for her to wait in the play-yard outside.  
	Melanie turns and starts down the corridor again.

	EXT. SCHOOL - MED. PANNING SHOT

	Melanie emerges and strolls up street toward Annie's house.  
	Inside the children are still singing.

				CHILDREN (O.S.)
		She swept the floor but once a year.  
		Ristle-tee, rostle-tee, mo, mo, mo!  
		She swore her broom was much too 
		dear. Ristle-tee, rostle-tee, hey 
		bombosity, knickety-knackety, retro-
		quo-quality, willoby-wallaby, mo, 
		mo, mo!

	CLOSE SHOT

	Melanie turns back and seats herself on seat in front of 
	play yard.

				CHILDREN (O.S.)
		She churned the butter in Dad's old 
		boot. Ristle-tee, rostle-tee, mo, 
		mo, mo!  And for a dasher she used 
		her foot.  Ristle-tee, rostle-tee, 
		hey bombosity, knickety-knackety,

		mo, mo, mo!

	CLOSE UP - MELANIE

	A side profile of Melanie as she sits. Size of shot has seat 
	on bottom of screen. We are shooting three-quarter toward 
	the school.

				CHILDREN (O.S.)
		The butter came out a grizzle-y- 
		ygrey.  Ristle-tee, rostle-tee, grey.  
		Mo, mo, mo!  The cheese took legs 
		and ran away!  Ristle-tee, rostle-

	bust shot.

	MED. SHOT - PLAY YARD

	Again five more crows arrive.

	CLOSE UP - MELANIE

	head and shoulders of Melanie as she sits smoking. There is 
	no sound except for the faint voices of the children singing 
	inside the schoolhouse. Melanie is puffing away at her 
	cigarette and occasionally glances in the direction of the 
	school. We hold on this shot of Melanie for a very long time 
	so that we are able to express her ignorance of what is going 
	on behind her with the crows. After a wait of about what 
	seems to be a half a minute or more, Melanie's attention is 
	drawn to something above her.

	MED. SHOT - SKY

	A crows is coming down.

	CLOSE UP - MELANIE

	as her eyes follow the flight of the crow.

	MED. SHOT - SKY

	Crow moving down and LEFT to RIGHT, the sky and Annie's roof 
	in the background.

	CLOSE UP - MELANIE

	Her head has twisted around to follow the flight of the crow.  
	She is almost looking into the play yard.

	MED. SHOT - PLAY YARD

	A crow slowly descends to the play yard and as the CAMERA 
	FOLLOWS it down, we see for the first time that the number 
	of crows has increased to an alarming number - almost 200 or 
	even perhaps 250. This last crow settles down with the others.

				CHILDREN (O.S.)
			(throughout preceding)
		I asked my wife to wash the floor.  
		Ristle-tee, rostle-tee, mo, mo, mo!  
		She gave me my hat and showed me the 
		door! Ristle-tee, rostle-tee, hey 
		bombosity, knickety-knackety,
		Retro-quo-quality,
			(the song slows -- it 
			is near the end)
		Willoby-wallaby, mmmmmmmo, mmmmmmmoo,
		Mo!

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE The CAMERA WHIPS UP as she leaps to her 
	feet in alarm. Her body has turned, but we are now facing 
	the opposite side of the school yard.

	CLOSER SHOT - PLAY YARD

	The play yard is full of crows.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	Big head of horrified Melanie.

	MED. SHOT - PLAY YARD

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	Big profile of Melanie. She turns with back to CAMERA and 
	goes toward school looking at crows as she goes away. The 
	CAMERA FOLLOWS her for a few paces and then STOPS so that 
	her image becomes smaller as she goes up steps into

	EXT. PLAY YARD - DOLLY SHOT

	A side view of the crows as seen by Melanie.

	FULL SHOT - THE INTERIOR CORRIDOR

	Melanie in headlong flight toward Annie's room.

				ANNIE (O.S.)
		All right, children. Now please put 
		your books in your desks, and bring 
		the songsheets to the front of the 
		room. No one's going out to play 
		until I have all the songsheets.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

	Annie is lining the children up near the door leading to the 
	play yard.

				ANNIE
		We're not going outside until we 
		quiet down. Ralph? Did you hear me?

	The children mutter for a moment, and then are still.

				ANNIE
		All right now.

	She begins opening the play yard door. Suddenly, the door 
	from the corridor bursts open, and Melanie rushes wildly 
	INTO the room. She goes directly to Annie, shoves her out of 
	the way, and SLAMS shut the play yard door.

	CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE

				ANNIE
		wh...?

	TWO SHOT - ANNIE AND MELANIE

	against a background of children's VOICES, as they react to 
	this new excitement.

				MELANIE
		Outside.

	LONG SHOT - THE CROWS - THROUGH THE WINDOWS TWO SHOT - ANNIE 
	AND MELANIE

				MELANIE
		We've got to get the children out of 
		here. These big windows... there's 
		no way to board them up.

	Annie gives a quick nod, understanding immediately.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

	Through the windows, we can see the waiting crows. One moves 
	restlessly into flight, then settles on the equipment again.

				ANNIE
		Quiet down, children! Quiet down!

	The children modulate into silence.

				ANNIE
		Miss Daniels wants to see how we 
		conduct ourselves during a fire drill. 
		I'd like you to...

				CHILDREN
			(grumbling in Unison)
		A fire drill? This is our play period, 
		Miss Hayworth! Gee whiz!  Etc.

				ANNIE
		I'd like you to show her how quiet 
		and obedient you can be.

	The children again fall silent.

				ANNIE
		We're going to go out of the school 
		now. Those of you who live nearby 
		can go directly home. I want the 
		rest of you to go down the hill, all 
		the way to the hotel. Do you 
		understand?

				CHILDREN
		All the way down the hill? Gee, Miss 
		Hayworth, we never... Home? Why do 
		we...?

				ANNIE
			(shushing them)
		I want you to go as quietly as you 
		can, not a sound, until I tell you 
		to run. And then I want you to run 
		as fast as you can. Does everyone 
		understand?
			(pause - silence)
		All right. John, would you lead the 
		class, please?

	The children walk two-by-two to the corridor door. John opens 
	it, and they begin filing out. Melanie turns to look at the 
	play yard.

	CLOSE SHOT - A SINGLE CROW

	fluttering at the window, almost in exploration. He hangs 
	there for a moment, then wings back to the playground 
	equipment.

	PANS UP with them into the sky.

	children running by.

	EXT. SCHOOL ROAD (5) (L)

	Melanie drags Cathy and Michele to the station wagon. We see 
	the Bay in the distance and children running on the bottom 
	of the street.

	INT. STATION WAGON - CLOSE SHOT (8) (S)

	Shooting inside the wagon across the front seat. The three 
	scramble in, Cathy first, then Michele and Melanie last --

	the door SLAMS on crows swooping around. Cathy and Michele 
	are SCREAMING with fright.

	INT. STATION WAGON - P.O.V. (3) (FP)

	Through the windshield we see crows attacking. Bay and running 
	children in distance.

	Knob of wiper -- her hand comes in and pulls it out.

	Wipers starting. Crows retreat.

	Melanie looks out and sees:

	through windshield. Annie running back with stick. She beats 
	the last of the crows away.

	Melanie flops in exhaustion over the wheel as Annie comes 
	round to the side window and starts to open the door.

							  DISSOLVE

	INT. THE TIDES - FULL SHOT

	It is lunchtime and there is a busy bustle to the place as 
	DEKE CARTER officiates behind the bar and HELEN CARTER, his 
	wife, rushes back and forth between diners at the tables. A 
	DRUNK sits at the bar, old, grizzled, the weary wisdom of 
	booze in him. In one of the booths sits SEBASTIAN SHOLES in 
	his shirt sleeves, eating a hurried lunch quickly and 
	efficiently. A WOMAN and TWO CHILDREN are seated at another 
	table, about to order. A party of noisy SALESMAN is laughing 
	and clowning around throughout following at a table in the 
	rear. The phone from behind the bar has been placed on the 
	counter, and Melanie is speaking into it while Deke listens.  
	Over her head, the television set is blasting with its 
	perennial Western, the gun shots punctuating her conversation.

				MELANIE
		Daddy, there were hundreds of them.  
		No, I'm not hysterical, I'm trying 
		to tell you this as calmly as I know 
		how. All right, Daddy. Yes Daddy.
			(she takes a deep 
			breath)
		Just now.  Not... fifteen minutes 
		ago.

	The door to the Tides opens and MRS. BUNDY, sixtyish, wearing 
	walking shoes and a tweed suit, a very masculine-looking 
	woman with short clipped white hair, comes in, passes through 
	foreground, goes to bar, her attention slowly caught by what 
	Melanie is saying.

				MELANIE
		At the school. No, I don't. Just a 
		minute.
			(to Deke)
		What's the name of the school?

				DEKE
		Just the Bodega Bay School.
			(to Mrs. Bundy)
		Help you, Mrs. Bundy?

				MRS. BUNDY
		I need some change, Mr. Carter.

	As Deke opens cash register...

				MELANIE
		The Bodega Bay School.
			(to Deke)
		Could you turn that down, please?

	Deke gives Mrs. Bundy her change, turns off television.

				MELANIE
		I don't know how many children.
		Thirty or forty. Yes.

	Mrs. Bundy goes to cigarette machine, pauses to listen to 
	Melanie.

				MELANIE
		No, the birds didn't attack until 
		the children were outside the school. 
		Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. 
		Is there a difference between crows 
		and blackbirds?

				MRS. BUNDY
			(turning from machine)
		There is very definitely a difference, 
		Miss.

				MELANIE
		They're different, Daddy.
			(to Mrs. Bundy)
		Thank you.
			(into phone)
		I think these were crows. Yes, 
		hundreds of them. Yes, they attacked 
		the children, attacked them.
			(exasperated)
		Daddy, a little girl was sent to the 
		hospital in Santa Rosa. Well, all 
		right, but you act as if I'm... all 
		right, all right.
			(pause)
		No, I can't come home now. I just 
		can't, Daddy. How is it there? I 
		mean... are there birds? In the sky?  
		But no trouble. Well, I hope...
			(pause)
		I don't know when. I simply can't 
		leave now. Tell Mother not to worry.  
		All right, Daddy, good-by.

	She hangs up. Mrs. Bundy is at her elbow.

				MRS. BUNDY
		They're both perching birds, of 
		course, but of quite different 
		species. The crow is brachyrhynchos. 
		The blackbird is cyanocephalus.

				MELANIE
		Thank you.
			(to Deke)
		Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?

				DEKE
		In the book right here, Miss.

	As Melanie looks it up...

				DEKE
			(to Mrs. Bundy)
		I don't see what difference it makes, 
		Mrs. Bundy, crows or blackbirds. If 
		they attacked the school, that's 
		pretty serious.

				MRS. BUNDY
			(with a superior smile)
		I hardly think either species would 
		have the intelligence to launch a 
		massed attack. Their brain pans aren't 
		large enough for such...

				MELANIE
			(dialing)
		I just came from the school, madam.  
		I don't know about their brain pans 
		but...

				MRS. BUNDY
		Birds are not aggressive creatures, 
		Miss. They bring beauty to the world. 
		It is mankind, rather, who...

				HELEN
			(going to door leading 
			to kitchen)
		Three Southern fried chicken, Sam.  
		Baked potato on all of them.

	LAUGHTER from salesman at table.

				MELANIE
			(into phone)
		Hello, may I speak to Mitch Brenner, 
		please?
			(pause)
		Yes, I'll wait.

				MRS. BUNDY
			(continuing to Deke)
		...insist on making it difficult for 
		life to survive on this planet. If 
		it weren't for birds...

				DEKE
		Mrs. Bundy, you don't seem to 
		understand. This young lady says 
		there was an attack on the school.

				MRS. BUNDY
		Impossible.

				MELANIE
			(in background)
		Mitch? I'm glad I caught you.  
		Something terrible has happened.

	Her background conversation continues through following:

				DRUNK
			(suddenly)
		It's the end of the world!

				HELEN
		What's this about the school?

				DEKE
		Bunch of crows attacked the school, 
		Helen.

				DRUNK
		It's the end of the world.
			(suddenly quoting)
		"Thus saith the Lord God to the 
		mountains, and to the hills, to the 
		rivers and to the valleys; Behold, 
		I, even I, will bring a sword upon 
		you, and I will destroy your high 
		places.

				HELEN
		The Lord's not destroying anything, 
		Jason.

				DRUNK
		"In all your dwelling places, the 
		cities shall be laid waste, and the 
		high places shall be laid waste!"
			(he nods)
		Ezekiel, Chapter six.

				HELEN
			(quoting)
		"Woe unto them that rise up early in 
		the morning that they may follow 
		strong drink."

				DRUNK
			(nodding)
		Isaiah, Chapter 5. It's the end of 
		the world.

				MELANIE
		Yes, all right, I'll wait for you.  
		Good-by.
			(she hangs up)

				MRS. BUNDY
			(laughing)
		I hardly think a few birds are going 
		to bring about the end of the world.

				MELANIE
			(turning to her)
		These weren't a few birds.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE WOMAN AND THE CHILDREN

	waiting for their lunch, listening to the conversation; 
	becoming very nervous.

	BACK TO SCENE

				DEKE
		I didn't even know there were many 
		crows in Bodega Bay this time of 
		year.

				MRS. BUNDY
		The crow is a permanent resident 
		throughout its range. In fact, during 
		our Christmas Count, we recorded...

	CLOSE SHOT - SHOLES

	eating.

				SHOLES
			(suddenly, from his 
			table)
		How many gulls did you count, Mrs.  
		Bundy?

	BACK TO SCENE

				MRS. BUNDY
		Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are 
		several varieties.

				SHOLES
		The ones that've been raising the 
		devil with my fishing boats.

				MRS. BUNDY
		Probably herring gulls. They arrive 
		in November, you know, and don't 
		migrate North again until March or...

				MELANIE
			(leaping upon this)
		Have you had trouble with gulls?

				SHOLES
		One of my boats did last week.

				DEKE
			(making a connection)
		This young lady got hit by a gull 
		only Saturday.

				SAM'S VOICE
			(from kitchen)
		Pick up the chicken.

				HELEN
		Now it's gulls. A minute ago, it was 
		crows.
			(she picks up tray, 
			shrugs, goes to table)
		Deke, I'm still waiting for those 
		Bloody Marys!

				DEKE
		Coming right up!

	CLOSE SHOT - WOMAN

	as Helen brings food. She is beginning to get really 
	frightened.

				WOMAN
		Could you ask them to lower their 
		voices, please? They're frightening 
		the children.

				LITTLE GIRL
		Timmy has a canary.

				HELEN
		That's nice. Are you Timmy?

				LITTLE BOY
		My cousin is Timmy.

	BACK TO SCENE

				SAM'S VOICE
			(leaving table, coming 
			to bar)
		A whole flock of gulls nearby capsized 
		one of my boats.  Practically tore 
		of the skipper's arm.

				HELEN
			(coming back)
		You're scaring the kids. Keep it 
		low.

				DEKE
		You're scaring me, too. Are you trying 
		to say all these...
			(he shakes his head)
		That sounds impossible, Sebastian.

				SHOLES
		I'm only telling you what happened 
		to my boat.

				MRS. BUNDY
		The gulls were after your fish, Mr.  
		Sholes. Really, let's be logical 
		about this.

				MELANIE
		What were the crows after at the 
		school?

				MRS. BUNDY
		What do you think they were after, 
		Miss...?

				MELANIE
		Daniels. I think they were after the 
		children.

				MRS. BUNDY
		For what purpose?

				MELANIE
		To...
			(she hesitates)
		To kill them.

	There is a long silence.

				MRS. BUNDY
		Why?

	Another silence.

				MELANIE
		I don't know why.

				MRS. BUNDY
		I thought not. Birds have been on 
		this planet since archaeopteryx, 
		Miss Daniels; a hundred and twenty 
		million years ago!

	A TRAVELING SALESMAN ENTERS, goes to bar, listens.

				MRS. BUNDY
		Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait 
		all that time to start a... a war 
		against humanity?

				MELANIE
		No one called it a war!

				SALESMAN
		Scotch, light on the water.

				MRS. BUNDY
		You and Mr. Sholes seem to be implying 
		as much.

				HELEN
		Are you finished here, Sebastian?

				SHOLES
		Let me have some apple pie, Helen.
			(to Mrs. Bundy)
		Who said anything about war? All I 
		said was that some gulls...

				HELEN
			(yelling to kitchen)
		One apple pie! You want more coffee?

				SHOLES
		No. ...came down on one of my boats.  
		They could have been after the fish, 
		just as you said.

				SALESMAN
		Your captain should have shot at 
		them.

				SHOLES
		What?

				SALESMAN
		Gulls are scavengers, anyway. Most 
		birds are. If you ask me, we should 
		wipe them all out. World would be 
		better off without them.

				MRS. BUNDY
			(outraged)
		Birds?

				SALESMAN
		Yeah, birds. All they do is make a 
		mess of everything. Who needs them?

				MRS. BUNDY
		We need them.

				SALESMAN
		Not if they're starting a war.

				MRS. BUNDY
		They are incapable of organized 
		warfare!

				MELANIE
		Have you ever seen a jay protecting 
		a nest?

				MRS. BUNDY
		I have seen jays doing everything it 
		is conceivable for jays to do.  
		Ornithology happens to be my 
		avocation, Miss Daniels. You're 
		talking about preservation of the 
		species, a hen protecting her young.  
		There's a vast difference between...

				MELANIE
		Maybe they're all protecting the 
		species. Maybe they're tired of being 
		shot at and roasted in ovens and...

				MRS. BUNDY
		Are you discussing gamebirds now?  
		All birds are not gamebirds, you 
		know.

				MELANIE
		I don't know anything about birds 
		except that they're attacking this 
		town.

				SALESMAN
		Then fight back. Get yourselves guns 
		and wipe them off the face of the 
		earth.

				MRS. BUNDY
		That would hardly be possible.

				DEKE
		Why not, Mrs. Bundy?

				MRS. BUNDY
		Because there are 8,650 species of 
		birds in the world today, Mr. Carter. 
		It's estimated that five billion, 
		seven hundred and fifty million birds 
		live in the United States alone. The 
		five continents of the world...

				SALESMAN
			(muttering)
		Kill them all. Get rid of them.  
		Messy animals.

				MRS. BUNDY
		...probably contain more than a 
		hundred billion birds!

				DRUNK
		It's the end of the world!

				DEKE
		Well, we seem to have more than our 
		share of them right now, Mrs. Bundy.  
		Maybe this young lady's right.  Maybe 
		they've all gone crazy.

				HELEN
		Here's your pie, Sebastian. You want 
		it at the table?

				SHOLES
		No. Here's fine.
			(he begins eating)

				HELEN
		Where are the Bloody Marys, Deke?

				DEKE
		Coming.

				HELEN
			(angrily)
		Are we running a business here -- or 
		a bird sanctuary?

				SHOLES
			(beginning to change 
			his mind)
		Actually, those gulls must have been 
		after the fish.

				MRS. BUNDY
		Of course.

				SHOLES
		Makes a lot more sense than... well, 
		an attack.

				MRS. BUNDY
		Of course it does. If we believe 
		that birds are attacking, why... why 
		next we'll believe that grasshoppers 
		and cockroaches are capable of...

				DRUNK
		Cockroaches!  Urghh!

	CLOSE SHOT - WOMAN

	getting more and more anxious.

				WOMAN
		Hurry, children. Finish your lunch.

				BOY
		Are the birds gonna eat us, Mommy?

				SHOLES
		Maybe we're all getting a little 
		carried away by this. Admittedly, a 
		few birds acted strangely. That's no 
		reason to believe...

				MELANIE
		This isn't a few birds! I keep telling 
		you that! These are gulls and swifts 
		and crows and...

				MRS. BUNDY
		And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?

				MELANIE
		Maybe! Is it impossible?

				MRS. BUNDY
		Yes. I have never known birds of 
		different species to flock together.  
		The very concept is unimaginable.
			(laughing)
		Why if that happened, we wouldn't 
		have a chance. How could we possible 
		hope to fight them?

				SHOLES
		We couldn't. You're right, Mrs.  
		Bundy.

				WOMAN
			(calling from table)
		Excuse me, may I have a check, please?

				HELEN
			(concerned)
		Is everything all right, ma'am?

				WOMAN
		Yes, I... I'm anxious to get on the 
		road.

				SAM
			(coming from kitchen)
		What's the matter? Something wrong 
		out here?

				DEKE
		Nothing's wrong.

				SAM
		All this shouting.

				MRS. BUNDY
		We're fighting a war, Sam.

				SAM
		A war? Against who? Did the 
		Russians...?

				SHOLES
		Against birds.

				WOMAN
			(suddenly)
		I'm glad you all think this is so 
		amusing. You've frightened my children 
		half out of their wits.

				BOY
		I'm not scared, Mommy.

				WOMAN
		Keep quiet. If that young lady saw 
		an attack on the school, why won't 
		you believe her?

				SAM
		What attack? Who attacked the school?

				WOMAN
		Birds did. Crows! And you're all 
		sitting around here debating! What 
		do you want them to do next? Crash 
		through that window?

				LITTLE GIRL
			(frightened by her 
			mother)
		Mommy!

				WOMAN
		Quiet! Why don't you all get home?  
		Lock your doors and windows!
			(her hysteria rising)
		Put on your coats, children!
			(to Deke)
		What's the fastest road to San 
		Francisco?

				DEKE
		The freeway, ma'am.

				WOMAN
		Where do I get it?

				SALESMAN
		I'm going out that way, lady. You 
		can follow me.

				WOMAN
		Then let's go. Now!

				SALESMAN
		I haven't finished my drink.

				WOMAN
			(on edge of panic, 
			shouting at her 
			children)
		Put on your coats! Do you want to 
		get trapped here?

				BOY
		I can't find my scarf.

				WOMAN
		Look in your sleeve!

	The door opens. Mitch and Al Malone come in.

				MITCH
		Melanie?

	At the far table, the salesman begin singing, rowdily.

				MITCH
			(going to her)
		I got here as fast as I could.  
		Where's Cathy?

				MELANIE
		At Annie's house. She's all right.

				SAM
		Al, why aren't you over there where 
		the attack was?

				MALONE
		Because I just got back from Dan 
		Fawcett's place, that's why.

				MITCH
		He was killed last night. By birds.

				MALONE
		Now hold it, Mitch. You don't know 
		that for a fact.

				MRS. BUNDY
		What are the facts, Mr. Malone?

				MALONE
		Santa Rosa police think it was a 
		felony murder. They think a burglar 
		broke in and killed him.

				WOMAN
		Were the Santa Rosa police at your 
		school today?
			(impatiently, to 
			salesman)
		Are you coming?

				SALESMAN
		Take it easy, lady.
			(through window)
		There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.

				DRUNK
			(quoting)
		"Look at the birds of the air: they 
		do not sow or read, yet your heavenly 
		father feeds them."

				WOMAN
		I'll never feed another bird as long 
		as I live!

				SALESMAN
		Something like this happened in Santa 
		Cruz last year. The town was covered 
		with seagulls.

				WOMAN
		Can't you please finish your drink?

				MRS. BUNDY
		That's right, sir, I recall it. A 
		large flock of seagulls got lost in 
		a fog and headed in for the town, 
		where all the lights were.

				SALESMAN
		They made some mess, too, smashing 
		into houses and everything.
			(shaking his head)
		They always make a mess. We're better 
		off without them.

				MRS. BUNDY
		The point is that no one seemed to 
		get upset about it. They were gone 
		the next morning, just as if nothing 
		at all had happened. Poor things.

				WOMAN
		I'm leaving! Are you coming?

				SALESMAN
		All right, all right!
			(he downs his drink)
		Hope you figure this out, folks.

				DRUNK
		It's the end of the world.

	The Tides is silent for a moment.

				SHOLES
		Well, I'd better get back to the 
		cannery. What do I owe you, Deke?

				DEKE
		Let's see. Scallops and coffee...

				MITCH
		Hold it just a minute, Sebastian.

	Sholes turns to him.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	his face very serious.

				MITCH
		Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.

				SHOLES
		No one ever said you were, Mitch.

				MITCH
			(flatly)
		I think we're in trouble. I don't 
		know how or why this started, but I 
		know it's here and I know we'd be 
		crazy to ignore it.

				MRS. BUNDY
			(sarcastically)
		Ignore what? The bird war?

				MITCH
			(exploding)
		Yes, the bird war, the bird attack, 
		the bird plague, you can call it 
		what you want to, they're out there 
		massing someplace and they'll be 
		back, you can count on that!

				MRS. BUNDY
		Ridiculous!

				MITCH
		Mrs. Bundy, why don't you go home 
		and polish your binoculars?

				SAM
		Go on, Mitch.

				MITCH
		If we don't do something now, if we 
		don't get Bodega Bay on the move...

				SHOLES
		Look, Mitch, even if this is true, 
		even if all the birds...

				MITCH
		Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?

				SHOLES
			(after a long pause)
		No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't 
		see any reason for it.

				MITCH
		It's happening. Isn't that a good 
		enough reason?

				SHOLES
			(thoughtfully)
		I like Bodega Bay as well as any 
		man. If I thought...
			(he shakes his head)

				MITCH
		Then help me, Sebastian. You're an 
		important man in this town. If you'll 
		help, the rest will.

				SHOLES
		Help how? What do you want to do?

				MITCH
		I'm not sure, but...

				SHOLES
		If you don't even know what you want 
		to do...

				MELANIE
		Listen to him, please.

				SAM
			(taking position beside 
			Melanie)
		You listen to him, Sebastian!

				MITCH
		I only know we've got to drive them 
		away from town -- before they drive 
		us away.

				SHOLES
		How?

				MITCH
		Mrs. Bundy, you said something about 
		Santa Cruz. About seagulls getting 
		lost in the fog, and heading in for 
		the lights.

				DEKE
		We don't have any fog this time of 
		year, Mitch.

				MITCH
		We'll make our own fog.

				SHOLES
		How do you plan to do that?

				MITCH
		With smoke.

				MALONE
		There's an ordinance against burning 
		anything in this town, unless it's...

				MITCH
		We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army 
		uses.

				DEKE
		What good'll that do? Smoke's as bad 
		as birds.

				MRS. BUNDY
		Birds are not bad!

				SHOLES
		How can we go on living here if we 
		blanket the town with smoke?

				MITCH
		Can we go on living here otherwise?

	Pause. They are silent.

				SAM
			(slowly)
		It's worth a try, Sebastian.

	There is more silence as they all consider. And then suddenly:

				MELANIE
		Look!

	They turn toward the window.

	TIDES CAR PARK - FULL SHOT

	Viewed from the side window inside the Tides we see three or 
	four gulls diving down toward the highway over the roof of 
	the Tides Office. Two more swoop into the foreground of the 
	window and out to the left.

				DEKE
			(alarmed)
		Gulls!

				MITCH
		They're back!

				SHOLES
		They're only the usual... What are 
		you...

	TIDES TOWN - LONG SHOT

	The first gull reaches the gas station but misses the 
	attendant who is in the act of filling the car. The owner is 
	seen disappearing into the men's room.

	INT. TIDES

	A quick flash of the group of faces at the window of the 
	Tides Restaurant.

	TIDES TOWN - MED. SHOT

	A nearer view of the gas station. A second gull hits the man 
	on the back -- he falls -- hits his head on the pump and 
	then collapses over the gasoline hose pipe, pulling it out 
	and causing it to spill. The third and fourth gulls sweep 
	by.  The gas begins to flow away.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	inside the Tides. Mitch dashes toward the door -- Melanie 
	after him. Through the glass windows into the street we see 
	people dashing off to the right, in the direction of the gas 
	station. At the door, Mitch turns.

				MITCH
			(to Melanie)
		Stay back in here.

	Deke Carter comes running from behind the bar to join Mitch.  
	They both EXIT. Melanie dashes back to her original place at 
	the window. The CAMERA RETREATING with her, we come to the 
	window and over Melanie's shoulder we see the men arrive to 
	rescue the attacked gas station attendant.

	Three or four gulls are still attacking and they flutter 
	away as the men appear to beat them off. Suddenly Melanie in 
	the foreground turns in full profile to her right and looks 
	down.

	TIDES CAR PARK - MED. SHOT

	on the sloping pavement before her a stream of gasoline is 
	flowing to the right into the car park.

	CLOSE SHOT - GASOLINE

	flowing down to the car park.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	through the window. She suddenly looks toward the gas station.

	MED. SHOT - THE CAMERA PANS

	along the flowing gas back to the station.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	She turns back to the car park.

	FROM MELANIE'S VIEWPOINT

	We see the flow of gasoline trickling toward the car parked 
	below her. At this particular moment, a car has pulled up, 
	has come to a stop and a man emerges. He is in the act of 
	lighting his dead cigar, but his attention is drawn to the 
	happenings around the gas station. With this half-drawn 
	attention, he strikes the match and holds it to the cigar.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	She quickly slides the window open and yells down to the 
	man.

	FROM MELANIE'S VIEWPOINT

	The man looks about him, holding the match I his fingers. As 
	he catches sight of Melanie, the match burns his finger and 
	he drops it.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	Her horror-stricken face.

	FULL SHOT - THE PARKING AREA

	Three fast explosions in a row as the man's car, Mitch's 
	car, and the one next to it go up in flames.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE HORRIFIED FACE OF MELANIE

	TURNING TO SEE

	FULL SHOT - THE GAS STATION

	The line of flame running swiftly from the burning cars, 
	following the gasoline on the ground, directly to the pump, 
	which blows up as the men are jumping away with the injured 
	attendant.

	EXT. TIDES TOWN AND CAR PARK - MATTE SHOT

	A very high shot shows the beginning of the people of the 
	town rushing around the car park and the streets across the 
	highway, endeavoring to put out the two fires. We see 
	automobiles coming to a stop on Highway One, and the oil 
	smoke beginning to rise from the burning gas station and the 
	parked cars. Some men have managed to start a fire hose and 
	have trained it on the burning cars. Suddenly but slowly the 
	foreground in the sky just below the CAMERA begins to fill 
	with wheeling gulls. The whole picture below becomes 
	obliterated by the foreground birds who now begin to swoop 
	down on the town.

	EXT. TIDES TOWN

	A raking shot outside the Tides Restaurant showing the phone 
	booth and motel off in the background. People are rushing 
	out from the restaurant and look up in the sky. Gulls begin 
	to descend into the scene, driving the people back into the 
	restaurant. Melanie is seen in the distance calling for Mitch:

				MELANIE
		Mitch...! Mitch!

	We see her look up to the sky.

	LONG SHOT - THE SKY

	The sky is full of seagulls.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	Looking about her frantically. She turns her face up again 
	to see the descending gulls. She is driven to take refuge in 
	the phone booth.

	CLOSEUP - INSIDE THE PHONE BOOTH - MELANIE

	slams the door shut. Gulls are now beating at the glass all 
	around her.

	EXT. TIDES TOWN

	From Melanie's viewpoint inside the booth we see the people 
	who have been rushing to put out the fire now faced with 
	clouds of birds coming on them.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	looking out in terrified alarm but still searching with her 
	eyes for Mitch.

	MED. SHOT - PEOPLE RUSHING FROM THE TIDES

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	in the phone booth. She turns and looks swiftly in the 
	direction of the car park.

	EXT. TIDES CAR PARK

	Some men have secured a hose and are obviously getting water 
	from the bay. They are turning the stream onto the burning 
	cars. At this time, the birds are filling the area around 
	them. They suddenly turn the hose up into the birds.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	Her eyes turn up quickly.

	LONG SHOT - FROM HER VIEWPOINT

	We see the stream of water swing to and from among the birds.  
	Melanie turns back from this at the sound of a roaring car.

	EXT. TIDES TOWN - FROM HER VIEWPOINT

	We see a car zig zag down from the town in a drunken manner 
	coming toward her in the phone booth.  We can see birds flying 
	in and out of the windows of the car.  We can see the arm 
	and hand of the driver trying to beat them away. In the 
	background of this scene we see the fire truck arrive.

	CLOSEUP - THE HORRIFIED FACE OF MELANIE

	as the car comes toward her in the booth.

	EXT. TIDES TOWN

	At the last minute, the car swerves away from the booth.

	CLOSER SHOT

	A side view of the car after practically scraping the side 
	of the booth. We see that it's full of birds attacking the 
	driver. As it goes by, it near tilts over to inadvertently 
	give us a view of its interior.

	FLASH CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	watching the car.

	EXT. TIDES CAR PARK

	The car goes on and smashes into the other burning cars. It 
	explodes.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	Suddenly she hears the firing of a gun. She turns.

	TIDES TOWN - LONG SHOT

	She sees a man with a gun shooting up at birds but to no 
	avail. One or two descend upon him. He throws the gun down 
	and rushes back into the Tides Office. Melanie, with a slight 
	turn, now sees:

	THE TIDES TOWN

	The fire volunteers with birds descending around them drop 
	their hose.

	CLOSER SHOT

	shows the hose snaking wildly and jumping. At one moment the 
	water turns and comes in a powerful stream hitting the windows 
	of the phone booth.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	recoils from this water attack. Through the streaming window 
	she sees the fire volunteers rushing away for cover. To the 
	left we see a horse with its head covered with gulls; its 
	palomino-colored body covered with crows. It is bucking and 
	leaping and kicking its van to pieces.

	At this moment the scene is obliterated by the appearance of 
	a man groping his way closely past the phone booth windows.  
	His face is poring with blood: his head and shoulders are 
	covered with attacking birds. He disappears from sight.  
	Melanie, now almost in a faint, opens her eyes to see Tides 
	Town. Through the booth window she sees Mitch and Deke Carter, 
	the owner of the Tides, coming down toward the CAMERA and 
	waving the birds away from them with flailing arms.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	opens the booth doors and starts out with a cry of 
	recognition, but she has barely stepped out when more gulls 
	crash around the booth causing her to go back.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE IN PROFILE

	looking out again toward Mitch.

	EXT. TIDES TOWN

	Through window she sees Deke Carter run off in one direction 
	while Mitch suddenly sees a child at the window of the burning 
	building adjacent to the flaming and smoking gas station. 
	Mitch dashes across and goes up the short staircase into the 
	smoking building.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	looking across in horror.

	LONG SHOT - THE BURNING BUILDING

	For a moment there is no sign of anyone about, then suddenly 
	Mitch appears with the small child at the window. He calls 
	down. One man dashes from the direction of the Tides Office, 
	another from the Tides Restaurant. They both wait below the 
	window as Mitch drops the child.

	FLASH - MELANIE

	watching this breathlessly.

	CLOSER SHOT

	The moment the child has dropped, Mitch suddenly looks up.  
	He slams the window as two or three birds crash into the 
	windows. They disappear into the building.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	holding her breath.

	LONG SHOT - THE BURNING BUILDING

	No sign of Mitch.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	getting more desperate.

	CLOSEUP - BUILDING

	No sign of Mitch. Suddenly a chair flies through the window 
	and Mitch climbs OUT and drops to the ground.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	opening the door of the booth, yells out to him.

	LONG SHOT - MITCH

	sees her and starts running toward the booth.

	HIGH SHOT - MITCH

	beating his way through the birds. He reaches the booth.

	LOW SHOT

	close to the Tides Restaurant entrance. We see Mitch drag 
	Melanie from the phone booth and run with her toward the 
	CAMERA through the birds into the restaurant.

	INT. THE TIDES

	There must be at least twenty people all looking toward the 
	windows. It is as though they are hiding from a storm. The 
	CAMERA is high enough to see Melanie and Mitch COME IN, very 
	hurriedly close the door. We see the gulls wheeling outside.  
	There is a kind of stunned silence among the people. We can 
	hear the sound of the screaming gulls outside. Suddenly a 
	woman's voice SCREAMS out:

				WOMAN
		Why are they doing it?! Why are they 
		doing it...?!

	Some of the heads of the group turn.

	CLOSE SHOT

	It is the woman who had the two children screaming at Mrs.  
	Bundy who is seated in a booth table staring numb and 
	helpless. Mrs. Bundy turns and looks at her and mutters some 
	words.

				MRS. BUNDY
			([Mrs. Bundy offers a 
			weak explanation of 
			why the birds could 
			have gone berserk 
			like this. This 
			information should 
			be obtained from Dr. 
			Stager.])

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	looking across at this slight scene. They turn back and over 
	their shoulders the gulls seem to be in much less quantity.

				MITCH
			(looking up)
		I think they're going.

	Melanie follows his look. At this moment there is a loud 
	CRASH OF GLASS. They turn their heads suddenly.

	MED. SHOT - FROM MITCH'S AND MELANIE'S VIEWPOINT

	And past the heads of the other people who have also turned, 
	we see one of the back windows of the Tides Restaurant has 
	gone and gulls are coming in. Two or three of the men who 
	are on the edge of the crowd turn and go back toward the 
	window, beating them out. They succeed in doing this.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	They turn from the gulls in the restaurant to look to the 
	street.

				MITCH
		I think it's safe to get out now.

				MELANIE
		Don't let's take any chances.

				MITCH
		We've got to get Cathy.

	They open the door and make their way out into the street, 
	running and looking about them desperately.

	EXT. BODIGA STREET

	There are one or two gulls flying around. Others are perched 
	on roofs as we see Mitch and Melanie dashing along the 
	sidewalk.

	EXT. BODIGA STREET

	There are still one or two gulls or crows in evidence as 
	they move along past the last street and come into the more 
	countrified part of the town.

	LONG SHOT - THE SCHOOL YARD

	We see them turn and dash up the road toward the school which 
	we see in the distance. There are some birds perched on the 
	school roof.

	SIDE-ON DOLLY SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	going up the school road. He stops for a moment and looks 
	up, Melanie following his look.

	SKY SHOT - FULL

	of wheeling gulls.

	SIDE-ON CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO

	They move on and go past Melanie's waiting car outside the 
	school. Suddenly Melanie brings him to a halt.

	LONG SHOT - ANNIE'S HOUSE - FROM THEIR VIEWPOINT

	There are a few blackbirds on it.

				MELANIE'S VOICE
		Look... the crows again.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO

	Mitch starts off. Melanie restrains him.

				MELANIE
		Careful, Mitch. The crows may be 
		back in the play yard.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO

	They advance cautiously. When they are level with the play 
	yard, we see what they see.

	MED. SHOT

	THE CAMERA DOLLIES along the play yard. It is again full of 
	crows.

	CLOSE SHOT

	They walk stealthily past.

	CLOSE SHOT

	CAMERA PANNING ALONG the waiting crows.

	CLOSE SHOT

	Shooting over the shoulders of Melanie and Mitch, they 
	approach Annie's house. Melanie glances apprehensively over 
	her shoulder toward the crows.

	EXT. ANNIE'S HOUSE

	Melanie and Mitch arrive. They come to a sudden stop.

	LONG SHOT - ANNIE'S HOUSE

	A woman is crumpled lifelessly on the front steps before the 
	door.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	He reaches the body. He rolls it over.

	QUICK CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE

	dead.

	QUICK CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	The shock registering on his face.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	realizing that Annie is dead, and wondering for a moment 
	what Mitch's reaction will be.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH - MELANIE'S P.O.V.

	He kneels silently by the body. Gently, he touches Annie's 
	face, and then gently and illogically takes off his jacket 
	and covers her, as if he is tucking a blanket around her to 
	keep her warm. He turns away then.

	MED. SHOT - THE WINDOW

	with its ROOM TO LET sign. Cathy is standing near the sign, 
	with her eyes peering at something outside.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	turning to follow Cathy's gaze.

	CLOSE SHOT - MIXED BIRDS

	Malevolent, sitting on the fence, the killers.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROAD

	As in fury, Mitch picks up stones and begins hurling them at 
	the birds. Melanie dashes forward.

				MELANIE
			(as the birds flutter 
			into the air)
		Mitch! Don't!

	She runs to him, grabs his arm, struggles with him as he 
	maniacally continues hurling stones at the birds, who are 
	now hovering flight.

				MELANIE
		Please! Get Cathy!  Let's get out of 
		here!

	Her words reach him. Breathing heavily, he goes INTO the 
	house and COMES OUT carrying Cathy, who is dazed and in a 
	state of shock. The CAMERA PANS him over to Melanie who holds 
	Cathy to her.

	CLOSER THREE SHOT

	as Melanie looks anxiously toward the house.

				MELANIE
		Mitch, you can't leave her out there.

	He GOES OUT OF PICTURE. Melanie watches him. Over her shoulder 
	is the white face of Cathy. We HEAR a DRAGGING SOUND and 
	then a door is CLOSED.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE'S P.O.V.

	We see Mitch EMERGING from the house. The body is no longer 
	in the pathway. He comes toward the CAMERA.

	MED. SHOT

	He joins Melanie and Cathy. The CAMERA MOVES AHEAD of the 
	three of them as they silently make their way past the crows 
	once more, Melanie holding Cathy close to her. They look out 
	cautiously to the right.

	MED. SHOT

	CAMERA DOLLYING PAST the crows again.

	BACK TO THE DOLLY SHOT OF THE THREE

	They move forward stealthily, CAMERA AHEAD of them.

	MED. SHOT

	Another DOLLY SHOT past the crows.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE THREE

	The CAMERA is now behind them. They move away from us and go 
	toward the waiting car.

	MED. SHOT

	They arrive at the car.

				MELANIE
		You drive, Mitch.

	She goes round the far side and gets into the car. Mitch 
	slips in behind the driver's seat. The car turns into the 
	CAMERA and goes down the school road.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR - INTERIOR

	Mitch, Cathy and Melanie facing the CAMERA, tensely. Melanie 
	looks over her shoulder.

				MELANIE
			(holding her breath)
		I don't think they're coming.

	Cathy does not turn: she is staring ahead of her, her eyes 
	wide, her lip trembling. They drive in silence, and then 
	suddenly, Cathy begins speaking, almost as if to herself, as 
	the CAMERA COMES IN TIGHT on her face in shock.

				CATHY
		On our way back from taking Michele 
		home... we... we heard the explosion 
		and went outside to... see what... 
		what it was.
			(pause)
		All at once the... the birds were 
		everywhere. All at once.  She... she 
		pushed me inside and... they covered 
		her.
			(pause)
		Annie.
			(pause)
		She pushed me inside.

	TWO SHOT - CATHY AND MELANIE

	as she takes the child in her arms to comfort her.

							  DISSOLVE

	CLOSE SHOT - A LONE GULL flying low over the water, the CAMERA 
	TRACKING it. The bay is silent. The gull spreads its wings 
	to brake, and then sits on the water. The CAMERA continues 
	low over the water, going through thousands of gulls sitting 
	there patiently, as if it is threading itself through a crowd, 
	not a sound, over the gulls, and then lifting to show the 
	Brenner house in the distance.

	FULL SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE

	Behind the panes of glass, we can see the boards Mitch nailed 
	across the windows. He is on the roof now, testing the two 
	attic dormer windows. He turns to look out over the bay.

	LONG SHOT - THE BAY

	covered with sitting gulls. In the distance, the town is 
	still smoldering. But the sky is clear of birds.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	picking up his hammer, sliding over the shingles to where 
	the ladder leans against the side of the house.

	FULL SHOT - THE HOUSE

	as Mitch comes down the ladder and Melanie turns the corner, 
	carrying a load of driftwood and old lumber.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	as she drops the wood outside the door and he joins her. She 
	is looking out over the bay when he comes to her. This is 
	not the Melanie we saw at the beginning of the picture. Her 
	hair is disarrayed, and her face and clothing are streaked 
	with soot. But beyond a surface physical appearance, there 
	is a weary wisdom in her eyes, and a strength to her as she 
	stands looking toward the distant smoldering town.

				MELANIE
		The town looks clear.

				MITCH
		The bay doesn't.

				MELANIE
		How long have they been gathering 
		there?

				MITCH
		The past fifteen minutes.
			(pause)
		It seems to be a pattern, doesn't 
		it? They strike and disappear, and 
		then they start massing again.

	Melanie nods. They are both silent, watching the bay.

				MELANIE
		I keep thinking of Annie.
			(she squeezes her 
			eyes shut)

				MITCH
			(after a long pause)
		It... it doesn't look very different, 
		does it? A little smoke over the 
		town, but otherwise...

				MELANIE
			(looking)
		Even the birds sitting out there.  
		It does look very much the same, 
		Mitch. This could be last week.

				MITCH
		It may not be last week again for a 
		long long time.

	They are both silent.

				MELANIE
		Look. They're still coming.

	Mitch nods. Silence.

				MITCH
		Do you want to try your father again?
			(Melanie shakes her 
			head.  Puzzled, Mitch 
			looks at her)

				MELANIE
		I tried a little while ago. The 
		phone's dead.

				MITCH
		Have we still got power?

				MELANIE
		Yes.
			(leaning against him)
		I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very 
		tired.

				LYDIA (O.S.)
		Mitch! I'm getting something on the 
		radio!

	INT. THE LIVING ROOM - FULL SHOT

	Lydia is hovering near the radio. Cathy is sitting on a 
	footstool. The windows are boarded, and the lights in the 
	room are on. A tremendous amount of static is coming from 
	the radio as Mitch and Melanie join them

				LYDIA
		I can't get any of the local stations.  
		I think this is San Francisco.

				ANNOUNCER
		...would include formulation of a 
		central financing committee to handle 
		credit and to allocate responsibility 
		for the various facets of the project. 
		A vote on the motion is expected 
		early tomorrow morning.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	listening.

				ANNOUNCER
		Continuing with the local news, police 
		are still investigating the series 
		of valuable jade burglaries in the 
		Chinatown area. The round-up of known 
		criminals has not as yet produced a 
		suspect, but Commissioner Nelson 
		said today he was certain the 
		burglaries were quote linked and the 
		work of the team of professionals 
		unquote.
			(pause)
		In Bodega Bay early this morning, a 
		large flock of crows attacked a group 
		of children who were leaving the 
		school during a fire drill. One little 
		girl was seriously injured and taken 
		to the hospital in Santa Rosa, but 
		the majority of children reached 
		safety in the town.
			(pause)
		On the national scene today, the 
		opening of the new session of Congress 
		was marked by a State of the Union 
		address that...

				MITCH
		Is that all?

				ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
		...drew a standing ovation for the 
		President. The Chief Executive, in 
		discussing our relation to Europe 
		and the rest of the world community 
		said: "These various elements of our 
		foreign policy lead as I have said 
		to a single goal --

				MITCH
			(sighing)
		We're going to need more wood for 
		the fire. We can't let it go out.

				ANNOUNCER
			(continuing as drone 
			in background)
		The goal of a peaceful world of free 
		and independent states.  This is our 
		guide for the present and our vision 
		for the future -- a free community 
		of nations, independent but 
		interdependent, uniting north and 
		south, east and west, in one great 
		family of man, outgrowing and 
		transcending the hates and fears 
		that rend our age.  We will not reach 
		that goal today or tomorrow.  We may 
		not reach it in our lifetime.  But 
		the quest is the great adventure of 
		our century.  We sometimes chafe at 
		the burdens of our obligations, the 
		complexity of our decisions, the 
		agony of our choices, but there is 
		no comfort or security for us in 
		evasion, no solution in abdication, 
		no relief in irresponsibility.
			(pause)
		In assuming the tasks of the 
		Presidency, I said that few 
		generations, in all history, had 
		been granted the role of being the 
		great defender of freedom in its 
		hour of maximum danger.  This is our 
		good fortune, and I welcome it now 
		as I did when I first took office.
			(pause)
		For it is the fate of this generation -- 
		Of you in the Congress and of me as 
		President -- to live with a struggle 
		we did not start, in a world we did -
		not make. But the pressures of life 
		are not always distributed by choice. 
		And while no nation has ever faced 
		such a challenge, no nation has ever 
		been ready to seize the burden and 
		the glory of...

				LYDIA
			(pause)
		Did you you get the windows in the 
		attic, Mitch?

				MITCH
		 I got them all, Mother.

				LYDIA
		When do you think they'll come?

				MITCH
		I don't know.

				LYDIA
		If there are... larger birds, Mitch... 
		they'll get into the house.

				MITCH
		That's a chance we have to take.

				LYDIA
		Maybe we ought to leave.

				MITCH
		Not now.  Not while they're massing 
		out there.

				LYDIA
		When? 

				MITCH
		I don't know when.  We'll see what...

				LYDIA
		Where will we go?

				MITCH
		I don't know yet.  I think we'll be 
		safe here.
			(Pause)
		Let's bring that wood in.

				LYDIA
		What happens when we run out of wood?

	Music begins to play.  The music is sweet, with violins and 
	long piano arpeggios, almost too much to bear against the 
	tension being played in front of it.

				MITCH
		I don't know. We'll break up the 
		furni...

				LYDIA
			(shouting)
		You don't know, you don't know!  
		When will you know? When we're all 
		dead? Like Annie?

				CATHY
			(shrieking it, her 
			face white)
		Mother!

				LYDIA
			(at Mitch)
		If your father were here...

				MITCH
			(sharply)
		Mother! I'm trying my best!
			(shaking his head)
		I'm... trying... my...

				LYDIA
			(trembling, nodding)
		I'm sorry, Mitch.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	the strain showing on his face. He nods briefly.

				MITCH
		Let's get the wood. Why don't you 
		make us all some coffee, Mother?

	FULL SHOT - HOUSE

	as Melanie and Mitch come out and head for the pile of wood.  
	There is a NOISE in the sky. Startled, glancing upward, they 
	begin to run back toward the house and then stop and slowly 
	scan the sky.

	FULL SHOT - ENORMOUS FLOCK OF BIRDS

	flying in tight formation.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

				MELANIE
		Where are they heading?

				MITCH
		Inland.

				MELANIE
		Santa Rosa?

				MITCH
		Maybe.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	watching the birds. A look of utter sadness crosses her face. 
	It is clear that she is thinking the birds will reach Santa 
	Rosa, and eventually San Francisco as well.

				MITCH (O.S.)
			(gently)
		Come on. Let's get this wood in.

	Melanie nods. But the look of sadness stays on her face, and 
	her eyes remain on the sky.

							  DISSOLVE

	FULL SHOT - THE LIVING ROOM

	Lydia is pouring coffee into cups. In the dining room, we 
	can HEAR the CHATTER of the lovebirds. As Lydia pours the 
	sound distracts her. Cathy is sorting candles at the couch.  
	There is evidence of preparation everywhere: flashlights, 
	kerosene lamps, a butane burner. Mitch is at the fireplace 
	putting more wood on the fire. Melanie comes into the room 
	and dumps another load.

				MELANIE
		That's the last of it.

				LYDIA
		Did you close the door?

				MELANIE
		And locked it.

				CATHY
		Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in 
		here?

				LYDIA
			(snapping it)
		No!

				CATHY
		Mom, they're in a cage!

				LYDIA
		They're birds!

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	studying his mother, realizing how close she is to breaking.

				MITCH
			(softly)
		Let them stay in the other room.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	her hand trembling as she pours the coffee.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

	as they all sit and accept their coffee. The room is silent 
	except for the CRACKLE of the fire. Mitch rises to put more 
	wood on the fire. In the dining room, the lovebirds still 
	are CHATTERING wildly. Their chirping is the only sound in 
	the house.

				CATHY
		Mitch? Why are they doing this?  The 
		birds.

				MITCH
			(putting wood on fire)
		I don't know, honey.

				CATHY
		Why are they trying to kill people?

				MITCH
		I wish I could say. But if I could 
		answer that, I could also tell you 
		why people are trying to kill people.

	The room is silent again except for the TWEETING of the 
	lovebirds offscreen. And then, suddenly, the lovebirds fall 
	silent.

	CLOSE SHOT - CATHY

	turning to look toward the other room, her face going white, 
	her eyes widening.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	waiting.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	waiting.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	waiting.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

	dead silent now. Each of them is sitting on the edges of 
	their chairs, waiting. There is the SUDDEN SOUND of 
	splintering glass.

				LYDIA
		Mitch...

				MITCH
		Shhh. Shhh.

	Silence. Into the silence, another pane of glass, SHATTERING, 
	the THUD of a bird against the boards. Silence.  More panes 
	of glass SHATTERING. The SOUND of birds striking the boards 
	and the outside of the house begins building, almost like 
	muffled drumbeats. THUD, THUD, with an irregularity of rhythm. 
	Interspersed, like the counterpoint in an alien orchestration, 
	is the FLUTTER of wings. And then, like another section 
	entering, we begin to hear the SCRATCHING and CLAWING at the 
	roof.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	looking up toward the roof, the SOUND getting louder. She 
	squeezes her eyes shut.

	TWO SHOT - CATHY AND MELANIE

	as the child cuddles up into her arms. Over the other sounds, 
	there comes a NEW SOUND, the unmistakable rat-tat-tat-tattat

	of a woodpecker. It stops. It begins again. Rat-tat-tat tattat-
	tat. Tat-

				CATHY
			(in terror)
		I'm... I'm sick, Melanie. I want.. I 
		want to throw...

	Her face pale, she rises suddenly and starts for the bathroom.

				MELANIE
		I'll go with you.

	They leave the room. Mitch and Lydia sit in silence. We HEAR 
	Cathy retching offscreen, almost drowned out by the shuffling 
	of wings and the rasping of claws, the incessant thudding of 
	birds striking the house.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

	Mitch rises and puts more wood on the fire. The SOUND of the 
	birds is still everywhere around the house. He looks at his 
	watch. He rises, walks into the kitchen to check the back 
	door. It seems all right. The CAMERA FOLLOWS him into the 
	dining room. He stops at the cage with the lovebirds.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS

	watching him. Is there menace or innocence in their eyes?  
	He cannot tell.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	looking at the lovebirds in puzzlement. There is suddenly a 
	NEW SOUND offscreen, the splintering of wood, the tearing 
	sound of bigger beaks. Alarmed, he turns.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	coming into the entry hall.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE FRONT DOOR

	The wood is beginning to splinter as the bigger birds outside 
	assail the door.

	FULL SHOT - MITCH

	turning quickly, the CAMERA FOLLOWING him into the dining 
	room. He pulls the cloth off the table, begins moving it 
	toward the door. In the entry, he lifts the table on end and 
	piles it against the door. He goes into the kitchen again, 
	CAMERA FOLLOWING. He upends the enamel-topped table, drags 
	it to the back door. He is piling chairs against the table 
	when Melanie COMES IN. She looks at what he is doing with 
	alarm. Mitch looks in the direction of where his mother is 
	and then back to Melanie, with an expression almost of 
	desperation. Both turn back to the barricaded door. The 
	CLAWING and the PECKING fills the void. The noise is a din 
	now, insidious and increasingly more frightening.

				MELANIE
		When will they stop?

				MITCH
		I thought they'd have stopped by 
		now.

				MELANIE
		What time is it?

				MITCH
		Almost two a.m.

				MELANIE
		You must be exhausted.

				MITCH
		How about you?

	She shakes her head. They both move into the dining room, 
	the CAMERA FOLLOWING THEM. The lovebirds are sitting in their 
	cage, close together, silent. Mitch picks up a chair, ready 
	to carry it to the front door. He hesitates, puts down the 
	chair, goes to the cage.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	looking at the birds, wondering.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE BIRDS

	looking back at him. Again, it is impossible to read their 
	expressions. Malice or benevolence?

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	He raises his hand, brings it toward the bars of the cage.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE BIRDS

	watching, unmoving.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH'S FINGER

	as he thrusts it through the bars. The birds sit unmoving.  
	One of them tweets.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

				MITCH
		I wonder if Cathy fed them.

	He turns away from her, goes to the cupboard, opens the door, 
	takes out a small box of bird feed.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE CAGE

	as his hand approaches the door. The birds are watching him.  
	His hand hesitates. Then his thumb and forefinger lift the 
	small catch on the cage door. His fingers open the door.  
	Cautiously, in TIGHT CLOSEUP, his hand goes into the cage.  
	The birds sit and watch. One of them tweets. He removes the 
	small feeding tray, puts the bird seed into it, replaces it 
	in the cage. The birds hesitate another moment. Then, 
	tweeting, they begin to eat.

	FULL SHOT - THE DINING ROOM

	as Mitch closes the door to the cage. Melanie is slumped 
	against the wall. He goes to her and takes her in his arms.  
	Wearily, she raises her head. The SOUND of the shuffling, 
	pecking, clawing birds is everywhere around them.

				MITCH
			(holding her)
		You should have left when you wanted 
		to.

	She shakes her head.

				MITCH
		You'd have been safe in San Francisco.

				MELANIE
		I don't want to be safe. I want to 
		be with you.

	There is something pathetically comic about her voice, like 
	a small child's, confused but defiant. Holding her close, 
	Mitch laughs, and she laughs with him. Exhausted, they stand 
	in each other's arms, laughing in that weary, silly, dead of 
	night sort of way. And suddenly... The lights go out.

				MITCH
			(in the darkness)
		The power.

				MELANIE
		Mitch...

				MITCH
		Wait here. Don't move.

	The screen is totally black for perhaps five seconds. In the 
	blackness, we HEAR the birds clawing and ripping, and the 
	SOUND is enormously MAGNIFIED. A flashlight suddenly goes 
	on.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	as he comes to her with the flash. We see them only dimly as 
	he directs the beam upwards.

				MITCH
		We'd better light some of those lamps.

				MELANIE
		No... wait.
			(pause)
		Hold me.

	In the near darkness, we see them embrace and kiss. It is 
	almost black in the room except for the strange effect of 
	the flashlight as he holds it behind her.

				MITCH
		I think they're easing off.

							  DISSOLVE

	FULL SHOT - THE LIVING ROOM

	A kerosene lamp is burning. Melanie is awake, watching the 
	fire. Lydia has fallen into a semi-recumbent position asleep 
	on the couch. Cathy is curled up in one of the easy chairs.  
	Mitch is asleep by the fire. The fire is burning brightly 
	and steadily. The house is almost still. There is no longer 
	the sound of the clawing and pecking, but there is another 
	SOUND now: the sound of SOMETHING FALLING, or dropping in a 
	steady dribbling, difficult to place.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	listening to the curious sound, trying to fathom its meaning.

				MELANIE
			(whispering)
		Mitch?

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	as she turns toward him.

				MELANIE
			(still whispering)
		Mitch?

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	asleep.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	seeing this, making her decision. The SOUND is still coming 
	from somewhere in the house. She decides to let Mitch sleep, 
	picks up a very long flashlight.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	as she goes through the house, checking. She stops in the 
	entry hall, plays the flashlight over the furniture piled 
	against the door. Everything seems all right. She goes into 
	the kitchen, again, checks the door, and then plays the beam 
	on the boarded windows. Satisfied, she goes down the corridor 
	outside the bedroom. She opens the first bedroom door, enters, 
	goes to the windows, plays the beam on them.  Everything's 
	all right. She comes into the corridor again, opens the second 
	bedroom door, again checks windows, and leaves.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	climbing the steps to the attic. She stops outside the first 
	door upstairs, opens it, goes into the room, plays the light 
	on the windows. Nothing. She comes out into the corridor, 
	goes to the second bedroom, opens the door, enters, walks to 
	the windows. They are boarded securely. She is starting back 
	toward the door when she stops.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	looking.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE FLOOR

	a pile of chipped and broken plaster.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	turning the flashlight up toward the ceiling.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE CEILING

	A huge hole in it, showing moonlit sky outside.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	turning her eyes from the ceiling, determination on her face, 
	and suddenly, her eyes open wide.

	CLOSE SHOT - AN OWL

	sitting in the darkness, staring at her.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	reacting.

	QUICK MED. SHOT - THE OWL

	wings spread in the beam of light.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	backing to the door. The owl hits her, sends her staggering 
	back, causing the door to slam shut. She looks up at the

	FULL SHOT - THE CEILING

	a swarm of mixed birds coming through the hole and down toward 
	her.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	in the room swinging the lighted flashlight as the birds 
	attack her.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	in the room, as the owl hits her full in the face.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	swinging the flashlight as the birds attack her.

				MITCH (O.S.)
		Melanie!

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE AND THE BIRDS

	grotesque and silent as she struggles with them. The room is 
	a crossing cacophony of mixed light beams and fluttering 
	wings.

				MITCH (O.S.)
		Melanie, open the door!

	He hurls himself against it. Inside the room, where Melanie 
	struggles, we HEAR his hammering on it. Melanie is overwhelmed 
	by the birds.

	She falls to the floor, the flashlight beside her. In the 
	spreading rays of the light, we see the frantic fluttering 
	of wings as the birds cover her. There is a stronger assault 
	on the door by Mitch outside.

				LYDIA (O.S.)
			(screaming)
		Mitch, get her out of there!

	MED. SHOT - THE ROOM

	Melanie, collapsed at the base of the door, is no longer in 
	view. Neither are the birds, whose fluttering shadows we see 
	on the door as Mitch again hits it from outside.

				MITCH (O.S.)
		Melanie!

	The door begins to open.

	FULL SHOT - MITCH

	as the door bursts inward and he stumbles into the room.  He 
	begins swinging at the birds immediately, reaching down for 
	Melanie, fighting off the attack at the same time. He begins 
	dragging her out of the room. Her clothes have almost been 
	shredded from her body, and her face is torn and bleeding.  
	We catch only quick glimpses of her near-nudity, as Mitch 
	pulls her into the corridor and then, holding the door shut 
	behind him with one hand, delivers swinging furious blows at 
	the few birds that have escaped into the corridor.

				MITCH
		Mother, get a rope!

				LYDIA
		Oh, my God, look at her!

				MITCH
			(shouting)
		Get a rope!

	She rushes off. He struggles grotesquely with the birds.  
	There is a wild fury in him, and a methodical dedication. He 
	will not allow them to defeat him. A large bird strikes his 
	hand, knocking the club from it.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	as the bird strikes at his face. He reaches out with his 
	hands, grasping the bird, letting go of the door knob.  
	Another bird flutters into the corridor.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	in anger and desperation as he throttles the bird with his 
	hands. He reaches behind him to grab the doorknob again, and 
	is immediately attacked by the other bird.

				MITCH
			(yelling)
		Mother! Hurry!

	TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH

	as she runs up the steps and into the corridor, carrying a 
	heavy piece of rope. Mitch grabs the bird and hurls it angrily 
	to the floor. Lydia is staring down at Melanie in terror and 
	compassion. He takes the rope from her, loops it over the 
	doorknob, pulls it taut across the hallway, and ties it to 
	the bannister, sealing the door. He turns immediately to 
	Melanie, picks her up and carries her to the steps, Lydia 
	following. As they go downstairs:

				MITCH
		Cathy! Get a blanket and some 
		bandages!

				CATHY
			(at the foot of the 
			stars, on the verge 
			of tears)
		Is she all right?

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	cradled against Mitch's shoulder, her face bleeding profusely.

				MELANIE
		I'm... I'm....

	FULL SHOT - MITCH

	as he carries her into the living room, but her down on the 
	couch.

				MITCH
		Just lie there and keep still.

	Cathy rushes to them with a roll of bandages and a blanket.  
	By the light of the lantern, Mitch drapes the blanket over 
	Melanie and then begins unrolling the bandage. But his hands 
	are trembling, and he drops it.

				LYDIA
		Let me do that, Mitch.

	She picks up the bandage.

				MITCH
		I can handle it.

				LYDIA
		I know you can.
			(her eyes meet his)
		But I'd like to.

	He nods. Silently, she begins working on Melanie.

				MELANIE
			(weakly)
		Please don't mess me up with bandages, 
		Mrs. Brenner.

				LYDIA
		Shhhh. Shhhh.

				MELANIE
		Please.

	But she begins cleaning the wounds, taping bandages over the 
	cuts. The house is still. She works silently and quickly.

				LYDIA
			(as she works)
		I'm not very good at this, Mitch.

				MITCH
		You're doing fine.

				LYDIA
			(Apologizing)
		I mean. I want to...

	Pause.

				CATHY
		Listen!

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	raising her eyes. The room is silent. There is nothing to 
	hear.

				LYDIA
		They're gone. God have mercy, they're 
		gone.

	FULL SHOT - MITCH

	as he goes to the front door, and cautiously moves away the 
	table and chair. He opens the door a crack.

	FULL SHOT - THE YARD

	through the crack. Daylight is almost here. There are no 
	birds visible.

	FULL SHOT - THE DOOR

	from outside as Mitch opens it wider. The door is scarred 
	and splintered. As he opens the door, one or two dead birds 
	spill into the room. He steps out into the yard. Lydia is 
	directly behind him.

	FULL SHOT - THE HOUSE

	a shambles, all the windows broken.

	TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH

				MITCH
		They're gone. The same pattern.

				LYDIA
		But they'll be back.

				MITCH
		We won't be here.

				LYDIA
		Where can we go, Mitch? There's no 
		place to go.

				MITCH
		I want to try for San Francisco.  
		There are buildings there. Steel and 
		concrete!

				LYDIA
			(shaking her head)
		We'd never make it. They're probably 
		all over the road.

				MITCH
		We have to try it.
			(a long silence)
		We can't stay here.
			(silence)
		Melanie needs help.
			(silence)
		Mother, the house won't take another 
		attack.

				LYDIA
		If...
			(pause)
		If... when we get to San Francisco...
			(pause)
		If they're already there?

				MITCH
		They won't be.

				LYDIA
		If they are?

				MITCH
		We'll worry about that when we get 
		there.

				LYDIA
		I'm frightened, terribly frightened.  
		I... I don't know what's out there, 
		Mitch.

				MITCH
		What do we have to know, Mother?  
		We're all together, we all love each 
		other, we all need each other. What 
		else is there? Mother, I want us to 
		stay alive!

				LYDIA
			(nodding; then after 
			a pause)
		I started to say... inside...

				MITCH
		You don't have to.

	He holds out his hand to her.

				MITCH
		I think we'd better get started.

							  DISSOLVE

	FULL SHOT - THE BRENNER YARD

	It is covered with the eerie half-light that comes just before 
	dawn, a light that persists throughout all of the following 
	until the penultimate shot in the picture. The silence is 
	deafening. There is not a bird in sight. The door to Melanie's 
	convertible are open as she and Mitch come out of the house 
	together and he helps her to the car. He puts her in the 
	back seat, tucks the blanket around her. In the background 
	is the pickup truck, too small to hold all of them. Lydia 
	comes to the door and quickly crosses the yard, not looking 
	down at the dead birds. Cathy appears in the doorway to the 
	house.

	CLOSE SHOT - CATHY

	She is carrying the cage of lovebirds. She hesitates just 
	outside the doorway. She looks at Mitch.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	looking back at her.

	FULL SHOT - CATHY, MITCH, AND LYDIA

	Across the expanse of the desolated yard.

				CATHY
		May I take them, Mitch?

	He does not answer. She continues looking at him.

				CATHY
		They haven't harmed anyone.

				LYDIA
		Take them.

				MITCH
			(with a slow nod)
		We'll put them in the trunk, Cathy.

	He takes the birds from her and goes to the back of the car.  
	The CAMERA STAYS on Cathy who gets into the car on the front 
	seat. Mitch comes around the other side of the car, stops, 
	and looks toward the trees.

	MED. SHOT - THE TREES

	covered with waiting birds.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	getting into car.

				MITCH
		Be careful with that door.

	Cathy closes the door gently, and almost soundlessly. Mitch 
	does the same with his door.

				MELANIE
			(weakly)
		Mitch, if they hear the car 
		starting... if they see movement...

				MITCH
		We'll take it slow until we get to 
		the main road.
			(pause)
		Are you ready?

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH'S HAND

	turning the key. The motor springs to life.

	FULL SHOT - INT. THE CAR

	anticipation on all the faces.

				MITCH
		All right.
			(he takes a deep breath)
		Here we go.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR

	from the outside, as it creeps out of the yard. The bay is 
	still, the road is still, the car makes barely a sound as it 
	passes the gate and starts down the road.

	MED. SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

	as they begin driving slowly. The wires are down. A small 
	fire is burning in the brush, where the wires made contact.  
	The car continues to move. It turns the first bend in the 
	road.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE - LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOW

	She gasps quickly.

	MED. SHOT - A GROUP OF HERONS - AT WATER'S EDGE

	standing, waiting silently.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR - INTERIOR

	as the tension begins to starts.

				MITCH
		Shhh.  Shhhh.

	MED. SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

	as they approach the derelict barge. It is covered with 
	waiting seagulls.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	seeing them. Her lip begins to tremble.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	turning toward the side of the road ahead.

	FULL SHOT - AN OVERTURNED SCHOOL BUS - MITCH'S P.O.V.

	covered with waiting birds.

				CATHY
			(whispering)
		Mitch, let's turn back.

				MITCH
		Shhh. Shhhhh.

	MED. SHOT - A ROADSIDE HOUSE

	as the car passes. A barricade has been set up on the front 
	porch, and a man is leaning over it, dead, a shotgun in his 
	hands. The porch is covered with waiting birds. At the boarded 
	window, we see a woman and child peering from a gap.

	CLOSE SHOT - CATHY

	reacting.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR - BIRD'S P.O.V.

	as it threads its way slowly and cautiously along the winding 
	road to town. The birds are sitting on some of the still-
	standing wires, watching, waiting.

	FULL SHOT - THE TOWN APPROACH - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD as 
	the car turns a bend in the road. There are thousands of 
	birds ahead, on every gutted and smoldering rooftop, on every 
	pole, on every fence.

				LYDIA
		Mitch!

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	as he stops the car and looks ahead.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR

	in the middle of the road, stopped. Ahead are the birds.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	frightened, try not to reveal her fear.

				MELANIE
		Can we turn back?

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

				MITCH
		I... I don't think so. If we get 
		through town, I think we'll be all 
		right.

	FULL SHOT - INT. THE CAR

	There is a long silence. It is Melanie who has the strongest 
	reason for fearing the birds. It is Melanie, her fear growing, 
	who makes the decision.

				MELANIE
		Then go ahead, Mitch.

	FULL SHOT - EXT. THE CAR

	as it begins moving forward again at an excruciatingly slow 
	rate of speed, into the town and the waiting birds.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	as she turns to look out the window on her side.

	CLOSE SHOT - A LINE OF BIRDS

	as the car moves past them slowly.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	closing her eyes.

	FULL SHOT - BRINKMEYER'S GENERAL STORE

	through the windshield. The roof and sills are covered with 
	birds. The window is smashed in, canned goods are strewn all 
	over the sidewalk, bolts of cloth run in a riot from the 
	open door and across the road, dead people are lying in the 
	gutter. But in the hotel, we see some faces behind broken 
	windows.

	TWO SHOT - CATHY, MITCH

	The tension on their faces,

	MED. SHOT - THE STORES OPPOSITE THE TIDES

	as the car approaches them. The windows are all broken, and 
	merchandise is lying on the sidewalk. Birds are everywhere, 
	waiting.

	CLOSE SHOT - A DEAD MAN

	lying on the sidewalk, clutching a television set in his 
	arms.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	strained, looking at the road ahead.

	LONG SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD

	a clear sky, a bird-free stretch,

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

				MITCH

		Here we go.

			accelerator)

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR - EXTERIOR

	as Mitch rams the accelerator to the floor and it zooms ahead 
	in a burst of speed.

	FULL SHOT - THOUSANDS OF BIRDS

	taking wing.

	MED. SHOT - MORE BIRDS

	taking wing.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	screaming.

				MELANIE

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	wrenching at the wheel as the car turns a bend.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD

	through the windshield, as a flock of birds take wing 
	immediately ahead.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE WINDSHIELD

	from the inside, as birds flutter against it.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE ROOF OF THE CAR

	from the inside, as a beak slashes it, letting in a thin 
	line of light.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	wrenching at the wheel again, another bend.

	HELICOPTER SHOT - THE CAR

	navigating the sharp bends in the road as birds streak at it 
	in straight lines.

	TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MELANIE

	in the back seat as several slashes appear in the roof over 
	their heads, letting in more light.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE ROOF

	More slashes, more light in scattered beams.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	her fear growing as the scattered light beams bring back the 
	memory of the attic room and her flashlight battle with the 
	owl.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE ROOF

	more slashes, building, the beak thrusts combining with the 
	incoming beams of light in a weirdly horrifying way.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

				LYDIA
			(almost a prayer)
		Dear God... dear God... please, 
		please, what have we done? Please.
			(and then in anger at 
			the roof and the 
			birds)
		Can't they leave us alone?
			(shrieking it)
		LEAVE US ALONE!

	MED. SHOT - THE CAR INTERIOR all the passengers, as the roof 
	suddenly rips back.

	FULL SHOT - BIRDS

	from inside the car, hovering over it the moment the roof 
	tears back.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	This is too much for her. She screams at sight of the birds, 
	and then turns her face into Lydia's shoulder.

	TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MELANIE

	as Lydia recognizes Melanie's need. She puts her arm around 
	Melanie's shoulder and gently, soothingly, holds her close.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR

	racing along as the birds hover over it.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	his face screwed in anguish, tears rolling down his cheeks 
	as he grips the wheel and hits the gas pedal.

	FULL SHOT - THE OPEN CAR

	streaming canvas ribbons behind it. It turns another bend in 
	the road.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD - (THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD)

	It is arrow-straight, no curves.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR

	in a burst of speed as it hits the straightaway. It begins 
	to outdistance the birds. The gap widens. A flock of birds 
	attacks it from the side of the road, but it speeds into 
	them and through them. The gap grows wider and wider. They 
	are well ahead of the birds now.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

				LYDIA
		We're losing them.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	only a nod, his face streaming tears.

	LONG SHOT - THE CAR (BIRDS' P.O.V.)

	as they fall way behind now, the car moving swiftly into the 
	distance.

	TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MELANIE

	on the back seat. Melanie begins sobbing in a sudden release 
	of tension. Lydia, in compassion, and tenderly, cradles 
	Melanie's head on her shoulder. Melanie, her eyes glistening, 
	looks ahead through the windshield.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR INTERIOR

	all their faces visible.

				CATHY
		Mitch?  Do... do you think they'll 
		be all right? In the trunk? Can they 
		breath?

				MITCH
			(with the faintest 
			smile)
		I think they'll be all right, honey.

	There is hope on their faces as the car streaks into the 
	wind. Not a wild exuberance, but a relaxation of tension.  
	They stare ahead through the windshield, and then they squint 
	their eyes against the sudden sunrise ahead, and Mitch reaches 
	up to turn down the sun visor.

				MITCH
		It looks... it looks clear up ahead.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR

	moving AWAY FROM THE CAMERA FAST into magnificent sunrise 
	over the crest of the hills. Further and further into the 
	distance it goes.

                     FINAL DRAFT 2nd Revision March 2, 1962

                

	FADE IN:

	FULL SHOT - GRANT STREET - SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

	It is mid-afternoon, and there is a tempo and pace to the 
	people walking, the doorman HOOTING for taxicabs, the 
	policemen directing traffic.

	PAN SHOT - PEDESTRIANS

	waiting at street corner for light to change.

	CLOSE SHOT - MAN

	at the end of line of pedestrians. He is looking up at the 
	sky.

	TWO SHOT - MAN AND WOMAN NEXT TO HIM

	as she follows his gaze upward.

	LONG SHOT - THE SKY

	with hundreds of gulls in it, wheeling.

	MED. SHOT - THE STREET CORNER

	as the light changes and people begin to cross. In the crowd 
	walking the other way, a man turns to look up at the wheeling 
	gulls in the sky overhead. The CAMERA LOCATES:

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE DANIELS

	in the crowd of pedestrians, approaching Davidson's Pet Shop.  
	She is a young woman in her mid-twenties, sleekly groomed, 
	exquisitely dressed, though hatless. She walks with the quick 
	sureness of the city dweller, a purposefulness in her stride, 
	a mischievous grin on her face. She continues toward the 
	front door of a pet shop and enters.

	INT. BIRD SHOP - MED. SHOT

	Melanie opens the door and comes through, still looking back 
	toward the street and skywards. The proprietor, a MRS.  
	MacGRUDER, comes toward her.

				MELANIE
		Hello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever 
		seen so many gulls?

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		Hello, Miss Daniels.

				MELANIE
		What do you suppose it is?

	MED. SHOT

	Mrs. MacGruder takes a look out at the sky. A puppy is 
	BARKING, o.s.

				MRS. MACGRUDER
			(shaking her head)
		There must be a storm at sea. That 
		can drive them inland, you know.

	They are climbing the short flight of steps into the bird 
	department now. The BARKING of the dog SEGUES into the clamor 
	of innumerable birds, TWEETING, TWITTERING, CAWING as Melanie 
	and Mrs. MacGruder go to the counter at the far end.  There 
	is a circular cage in the center of the room, and the walls 
	are lined with wire-mesh cages and smaller wooden cages so 
	that the effect is one of being surrounded by birds, contained 
	birds to be sure. The birds are quite beautiful, mostly exotic 
	birds, small splashes of color behind the wire-mesh cages, 
	larger bursts of brilliant hue on the parrots and parakeets 
	in the bigger cages. As they walk:

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		I was hoping you'd be a little late, 
		Miss Daniels.
			(apologetically)
		You see, he hasn't arrived yet.

				MELANIE
		You said three o'clock.

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		I know. Oh, I know.
			(she is more distressed 
			now)
		I've been calling all morning. Oh, 
		you have no idea. Miss Daniels, 
		they're so difficult to get, really 
		they are. We get them from India, 
		you know, when they're just little 
		chicks, and then we have to...

				MELANIE
		Well, this one won't be a chick, 
		will he?

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly 
		not. This will be a full grown myna 
		bird. Full grown.

				MELANIE
		And he'll talk?

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. 
		You'll have to teach him to talk.

				MELANIE
		Yes.

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		Yes.
			(pause)
		Oh my, I suppose I should call them 
		again. They said three o'clock.
			(pause)
		Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call.  
		Would you mind waiting?

				MELANIE
			(judiciously)
		I think maybe you'd better deliver 
		him. Let me give you my address.
			(she begins taking 
			off her gloves)

				MRS. MACGRUDER
			(producing pencil and 
			pad)
		Oh. Oh, well, all right.

	As Melanie starts writing:

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		I'm sure they're on the way, though.  
		Could I just call?

				MELANIE
			(with a resigned sigh)
		Well, all right, but...

	She scurries out behind the counter and out of sight.  Melanie 
	finishes writing her address and stands impatiently by the 
	counter. She taps her teeth with the pencil.

				MRS. MACGRUDER (O.S.)
		Hello, this is Betty MacGruder at 
		Davidson's.
			(pause; accusingly)
		It's past three, you know.
			(pause)
		Well, how long do you think...? All 
		right, would you check it please?  
		Yes, I'll wait.

	Melanie sighs. Leaving her gloves and purse on the counter, 
	she begins wandering around the shop, still tapping her lips 
	with the pencil. There is no menace in the birds surrounding 
	her. They are active and beautiful as they dart behind the 
	bars and mesh of their cages. Off screen, the puppy begins 
	BARKING again as the front door opens. Melanie looks up.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH BRENNER

	as he closes the entrance door behind him and starts up the 
	steps to the bird department. He is a handsome man, about 
	twenty-nine or thirty, well-dressed, and carrying a felt 
	hat.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	seeing him, and then turning away to bend before the cage of 
	strawberry finches. She pokes the pencil through the mesh.  
	The birds are startled into scarlet flight.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	as they pass each other in the aisle. He gives a polite little 
	nod, and she gives a polite little smile. But as he passes 
	her, and unknown to her, he turns for a second look -- and 
	then vanishes behind the circular cage as he turns he corner.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	looking at her watch as she wanders around the other side of 
	the cage and then comes face to face with Mitch again.

				MITCH
		I wonder if you could help me.

				MELANIE
		What?

				MITCH
			(deliberately, and 
			with a touch of 
			hauteur)
		I said I wonder if you could help 
		me.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	a trifle annoyed by his manner at first. She is about to 
	inform him, if you please, that she is not a shopgirl. But 
	then something rebellious flashes in her eyes and an idea 
	comes to her.

				MELANIE
			(solicitously)
		Yes, what was it you were looking 
		for, sir?

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

				MITCH
			(deadpan)
		Lovebirds.

				MELANIE
		Lovebirds, sir?

				MITCH
		Yes. I understand there are different 
		varieties, it that true?

				MELANIE
		Well... yes, sir, there are.

				MITCH
		These are for my sister... her 
		birthday you see. As she'll be eleven 
		and... well, frankly, I wouldn't 
		want a pair of birds that were too 
		demonstrative.

				MELANIE
		I understand completely, sir.

				MITCH
		As the same time, I wouldn't want 
		birds that were aloof, either.

				MELANIE
			(leading him around 
			shop)
		No, of course not.

				MITCH
		Do you have a pair that are just 
		friendly?

				MELANIE
		I think so, sir.
			(she looks around)
		Now then, let me see.

				MITCH
			(at the finches)
		Aren't these lovebirds?

				MELANIE
		No, sir, those are... redbirds.

				MITCH
		The sign says strawberry finches.

				MELANIE
			(airily)
		Yes, we call them that too.
			(she moves away)
		Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds...
			(and stops before a 
			cage of canaries)

				MITCH
		Those are canaries, Miss.
			(pause)
		Doesn't this make you feel awful?

				MELANIE
			(baffled)
		Doesn't what make me...?

				MITCH
		All these innocent little creatures 
		caged up like this?

				MELANIE
		Well, we can't just let them fly 
		around the shop, you know.

				MITCH
		I suppose not. Is there an 
		ornithological reason for keeping 
		them in separate cages?

				MELANIE
		Oh, certainly. It's to protect the 
		species.

				MITCH
		I imagine that's very important.  
		Especially during the moulting season.

				MELANIE
		Yes, that's a particularly dangerous 
		time.

				MITCH
		Are they moulting now?

				MELANIE
		Some of them are.

				MITCH
		How can you tell?

				MELANIE
		Well... they get a sort of hangdog 
		expression.

	CLOSE SHOT - A CAGED BIRD - MITCH'S P.O.V.

	The bird is wearing a distinctly hangdog expression.

				MITCH
		Yes, I see.
			(pause)
		About those lovebirds, Miss...

				MELANIE
		Are you sure you wouldn't like to 
		see a canary instead? We have some 
		very nice canaries this week.

				MITCH
		All right.
			(he smiles)
		She smiles back.

				MITCH
			(he waits)
		All right, may I see one, please?

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	as she realizes she is expected to take one of the canaries 
	out of the cage. She smiles feebly, glances toward the counter 
	where she expects Mrs. MacGruder to reappear momentarily, 
	and then takes a deep breath. She opens the door to the canary 
	cage, and cautiously puts her hand into it.

				MELANIE
			(feebly)
		Here, birdie. Here, birdie, birdie.

	One of the canaries suddenly flutters out of the cage and 
	into the room. Melanie leaps back, startled.

				MELANIE
		Oh!  Ohhhhh!

	FULL SHOT - THE BIRD DEPARTMENT

	as the canary flies frantically about the room, Melanie and 
	Mitch in pursuit. Mrs. MacGruder appears at the counter, 
	finally confronted with the chaos she's been expecting all 
	day.

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		What is it? Oh! Oh my, one of the 
		birds is loose!

	She joins in the chase around the room. The bird flutters up 
	to the ceiling, and then lands on the counter and watches 
	them suspiciously.

				MITCH
		Shhh! Shhhh!

	He tiptoes up to the bird, hat in hand. Quickly, he covers 
	the bird with his hat, then reaches under to grab it.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	the canary in his hand.

				MELANIE
		There we are!

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.

	FULL SHOT - THE BIRD DEPARTMENT

	as Mitch carries the canary back to the cage. He opens the 
	door.

				MITCH
			(putting the canary 
			in)
		Back into your gilded cage, Melanie 
		Daniels.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	startled.

				MELANIE
		What did you say?

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

				MITCH
			(savoring this)
		I was merely drawing a parallel, 
		Miss Daniels.

				MELANIE
		But how... how do you know my name?

				MITCH
			(secretly)
		A little birdie told me.
			(he smiles politely)
		Good day, Miss Daniels.
			(he bows to Mrs.  
			MacGruder)
		Madam.
			(he starts out)

				MELANIE
		Hey, wait a minute!

	She goes after him. Mitch turns, stops, smiles, enjoying her 
	bafflement immensely. Melanie studies him. Then:

				MELANIE
		I don't know you.

				MITCH
		Ahhh, but I know you.

				MELANIE
		How?

				MITCH
		We met in court.

				MELANIE
		We never met in court or anyplace 
		else.

				MITCH
		That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw 
		you in court.

				MELANIE
		When?

				MITCH
		Do you remember one of your practical 
		jokes that resulted in the smashing 
		of a plate glass window?

				MELANIE
		I didn't break that window!

				MITCH
		No, but your little prank did. The 
		judge should have put you behind 
		bars!

				MELANIE
		What are you? A policeman?

				MITCH
		I simply believe in the law, Miss 
		Daniels, and I'm not too keen on 
		practical jokers.

				MELANIE
		What do you call your lovebird story 
		if not a practical...

				MITCH
		Ahhh, but I really do want those 
		birds.

				MELANIE
		You knew I didn't work here. You 
		deliberately...

				MITCH
		Right. I recognized you when I came 
		in. I thought you might like to know 
		what it felt like to be on the other 
		end of a gag. What do you think of 
		that, Miss Daniels?

				MELANIE
		I think you're a louse.

				MITCH
		I am.
			(he tips his hat)
		Good day.
			(to Mrs. MacGruder)
		Madam.
			(and he goes down the 
			steps)

				MELANIE
		And I'm glad you didn't get your 
		lovebirds!

				MITCH
			(breezily, as he goes 
			out)
		I'll find something else.
			(he gives a slight 
			bow)
		See you in court some day.

	The door closes. The puppy begins BARKING.

				MELANIE
			(angrily)
		That... that... who was that?

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		I have no idea.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	seething as she stares after him. Suddenly, she gets an idea.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	going down the steps and to the front door of the shop. She 
	looks through the glass.

	LONG SHOT - MITCH - MELANIE'S P.O.V.

	getting into his car at the curb.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	looking after the car at the curb.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE LICENSE PLATE CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	seeing the plate, giving a brief, determined, angry nod. She 
	begins to repeat the numbers to herself as she turns.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	as she comes up the steps again and walks toward the counter.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE - MRS. MACGRUDER'S P.O.V.

	as she comes up to the counter.

				MELANIE
		Have you got a pencil?

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		What? Oh, yes, certainly.

	As Melanie begins writing:

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		They said the myna bird would be 
		here later this afternoon. If you'd 
		care to come back...

				MELANIE
		No, you'd better send him. May I use 
		your phone?

				MRS. MACGRUDER
			(bewildered by 
			everything)
		Yes, certainly.
			(she puts phone on 
			counter)

				MELANIE
			(as she dials)
		Do you have any lovebirds?

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		No, not in the shop. But I can order 
		them for you.

				MELANIE
		How soon?

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		Well... well, how soon would you 
		want them?

				MELANIE
		Immediately.
			(into phone)
		Is this the Daily News? Melanie 
		Daniels. Would you get me the city 
		desk, please?

				MRS. MACGRUDER
		I might be able to have them by 
		tomorrow morning. Would that be all 
		right?

				MELANIE
			(with an edged anger)
		That would be just fine.
			(into phone)
		Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I 
		want you to do a favor for me.
			(pause)
		No, this is a small one.
			(pause)
		Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling, 
		would I try to pressure you?  Will 
		you call the Department of Motor 
		Vehicles for me and find out who 
		owns this license plate? DKQ dash 
		one seven six.
			(pause)
		Yes, a California plate.
			(pause)
		No, I'll stop up there in a little 
		while. Is daddy in his office?
			(pause)
		Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in 
		on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see 
		him later. Thank you, Charlie.
			(she hangs up)

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE ICY DETERMINATION ON HER FACE.

				MELANIE
		Now. What time tomorrow morning?

	FADE IN:

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE'S SPORTS CAR

	pulling up in front of Mitch's building, the top down. She 
	glances up at the address, gets out of the car, comes around 
	to the other side, and opens the door.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS

	in a cage as Melanie reaches for them.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	turning from the car and going into the building. She pauses 
	in the lobby, studies the names alongside the bell buttons.

	CLOSE SHOT - HER GLOVED HAND

	running down the list of names slowly. It stops.

	INSERT - THE CARD

	her finger beside it.

	BRENNER, M. 3B

	CLOSE SHOT - HER GLOVED HAND the forefinger extended as she 
	runs it down over every bell button in one column, and then 
	does the same for the next column.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	as she turns from the bells to the inner door of the lobby, 
	grabbing the knob. A BUZZ SOUNDS. She opens the door.

	REVERSE SHOT - MELANIE

	coming through the door and into the lobby. She walks swiftly 
	toward the elevator where a well-dressed man is standing, 
	waiting. Behind her, the inner door is BUZZING wildly with 
	answering BUZZES. Melanie and the man stand waiting for the 
	elevator, silently. Behind her, the BUZZING STOPS. The 
	elevator doors open. The man smiles pleasantly and allows 
	her to enter first. She does so with a small nod.  The 
	elevator doors close.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND THE MAN - IN THE ELEVATOR

	The birds are CHIRPING wildly in their cage. The man and 
	Melanie stand silently side by side. The man's eyes wander 
	down to the bird-cage. Melanie's eyes move toward him.  Self-
	consciously, she stands with the cage of CHATTERING birds. 
	The man is dead-panned, unsmiling. The elevator stops. The 
	doors begin to open.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	stepping out of the elevator as the doors open. The man is 
	right behind her. She begins looking for apartment 3B. The 
	man is walking down the corridor beside her. She stops in 
	front of the apartment, hesitates, hoping the man will turn 
	the corner in the corridor. Instead, he stops at the apartment 
	just opposite. He begins fumbling in his pocket for his key. 
	He looks at Melanie.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	smiling at him feebly.

	FULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR

	The man spread change and an assortment of junk on the palm 
	of his hand as he searches for his key. Impatiently, Melanie 
	watches him. Making a decision, she puts the birdcage down 
	before the door to apartment 3B, and then opens her purse.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE'S GLOVED HAND

	reaching into the purse for a white envelope.

	INSERT - THE FACE OF THE ENVELOPE

	written there in Melanie's handwriting: MR. MITCHELL BRENNER.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	as she props the envelope against the cage, and then hurriedly 
	goes down the hallway, intent on retreat.

				MAN'S VOICE
		Miss...?  She stops, distressed.

	FULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR

	the man at the one end, key in his hand; Melanie at the other 
	end, near the elevator.

				MAN
		Is that for Mitch Brenner?

				MELANIE
			(curtly)
		Yes.

				MAN
		He's not home.

				MELANIE
		That's all right.

	She presses button for the elevator.

				MAN
		He won't be back until Monday. I 
		mean, if those birds are for him....

				MELANIE
		Monday?

				MAN
		Yes. I don't think you should leave 
		them in the hall, do you?

				MELANIE
			(trapped)
		Well, I...

	The elevator doors open.

				MELANIE
		Well, where did he go?

				MAN
		Bodega Bay. He goes up there every 
		weekend.

				MELANIE
		Bodega Bay? Where's that?

				MAN
		Up on the coast. About sixty miles 
		north of here.

				MELANIE
		Sixty...
			(her face falls)
		Oh.

				MAN
		About an hour and a half on the 
		freeway. Or two if you take the coast 
		highway.

				MELANIE
		Oh.

				MAN
		I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm 
		going away myself. Someone's got to 
		feed them, I suppose.

				MELANIE
			(in utter despair now)
		Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.

				MAN
			(apologetically)
		I'm awfully sorry.

	He puts the key into his lock, opens the door, and goes 
	inside. The door closes. Melanie is alone in the hallway.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	exasperated. She looks at the open elevator. She turns to 
	look at the birds.

	LONG SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS

	in their cage outside the apartment door, CHATTERING.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	surrendering with a gesture of resignation. She walks down 
	the hall, picks up envelope and puts it in her purse, picks 
	up the bird cage, carries it back to the elevator. The birds 
	are COOING and CHIRPING madly.

				MELANIE
		Oh, shut up!

	And she steps into the elevator.

							  DISSOLVE

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE'S OPEN CAR - (MATTE)

	on the coast highway. It is a spectacularly beautiful day, 
	with a cloudless blue sky. The montage of SHOTS that follow 
	should alternate between the winding, twisting road and the 
	ocean below, and CLOSEUPS of Melanie driving with the caged 
	birds on the seat beside her. The last shot should be a FULL 
	SHOT of the car rounding a particularly sharp curve.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	She turns wheel forcefully.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS

	in the cage as the car rounds the bend. They lean to one 
	side as the car turns, come up straight again as the car 
	rounds the curve.

	FULL SHOT - (MATTE)

	Car approaching Bodega Bay seen high up.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	at the wheel, she glances out toward the bay.

	FULL SHOT - A CLUSTER OF BUILDINGS AT WATERFRONT

	ahead, through the windshield as the car approaches.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	behind the wheel, leaning forward slightly for a look at the 
	town.

	LONG SHOT - DOCKS ON LEFT

	through the windshield as Melanie slows her speed.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	behind wheel.

	LONG SHOT - STORES

	on right of the road as Melanie enters the town. SLOW PAN 
	matching car's cruise past BAKERY, SHOE REPAIR, CLEANERS, 
	RADIO AND TELEVISION.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	behind wheel.

	LONG SHOT - THE TIDES

	past the gas station and beyond to the parking area and the 
	docks, continuing Melanie's slow observation of the place.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE - (PROCESS)

	studying the town. The car turns into road by gas station.

	FULL SHOT - THE TOWN

	through the windshield. The car turns right. There is life 
	in the town now, fishermen crossing the road, women with 
	their hair in curlers, old ladies carrying shopping bags.  
	This is Saturday morning, and the town -- such as it is -- 
	is alive with its inhabitants. We see them from Melanie's

	P.O.V. AS SHE SCANS THE PLACE FOR ITS POST OFFICE. (THIS TO 
	BE TAKEN ON BACK LOT.)

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR

	pulling in, in front of the post office. Melanie opens the 
	door and steps out. She is smartly dressed in a traveling 
	suit and sweater. She looks up at the sign, and then walks 
	quickly toward the front door.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	enters post office.

	CLOSE SHOT - POSTAL CLERK

	behind cage as Melanie approaches it. He is busy filling out 
	a form of some kind, affixing stamps to it, etc. He does not 
	look up as she approaches.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	through the bars of the cage.

				MELANIE
		Good morning.

	CLOSE SHOT - POSTAL CLERK

				CLERK
			(without looking up)
		Morning.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND THE CLERK

				MELANIE
		I wonder if you could help me.

				CLERK
		Try my best.

				MELANIE
		I'm looking for a man named Mitchell 
		Brenner.

				CLERK
		Yep.

	He is still busy with his form, still does not look up.

				MELANIE
		Do you know him?

				CLERK
		Yep.

				MELANIE
		Where does he live?

				CLERK
		Right here. Bodega Bay.

				MELANIE
		Yes, but where?

				CLERK
		Right across the bay there.

				MELANIE
		Where?

	It seems as if the Clerk will not answer her. Suddenly, he 
	leaves the window.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	through the bars, exasperated.

	REVERSE SHOT - FULL - MELANIE

	as she tries to peek through the bars to see where he's 
	vanished. A door to the left of the window opens, and the 
	Clerk steps out. He walks a little distance as Melanie watches 
	him, then stops, turns and looks at her surprised, as if 
	he'd expected her to be right behind him. He stands stock 
	still, looking at her, saying nothing. She understands then 
	that he wants her to follow him, and she catches up, neither 
	speaking. They go to the front door. He opens it, looks at 
	her, then looks out across the town and the bay. He extends 
	his arm and points.

				CLERK
		See where I'm pointing?

				MELANIE
		Yes?

	FULL SHOT - THE BAY - THEIR P.O.V. - (MATTE)

				CLERK (O.S.)
		See them two big trees across there?

				MELANIE (O.S.)
		Yes?

				CLERK (O.S.)
		And the white house?

				MELANIE (O.S.)
		That's where the Brenners live.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND THE CLERK

				MELANIE
		The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?

				CLERK
		Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.

				MELANIE
		The two kids?

				CLERK
		Yep. Mitch and the little girl.

				MELANIE
		I see. How do I get down there?

				CLERK
		Follow the road straight through 
		town 'til it curves off on the left.  
		That'll take you right around the 
		bay to their front door.

				MELANIE
		The front door.
			(pause)
		Isn't there a back road I can take?

				CLERK
		Nope. That's the road. Straight 
		through town, stay on your left, 
		right around the bay to the front 
		door.

				MELANIE
		You see, I wanted to surprise them.

				CLERK
		Mmmm.

				MELANIE
		I didn't want to come right down the 
		road, where they could see me.

				CLERK
		Mmmm.

				MELANIE
		It's a surprise, you see.

				CLERK
		Mmmmmm.
			(long pause)
		'Course, you could get yourself a 
		boat, cut right across the bay with 
		it. The Brenners got a little dock 
		there you could tie up at. If that's 
		what you wanted to do.

				MELANIE
		Where would I get a boat?

				CLERK
		Down at the dock by the Tides 
		Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard 
		boat?

				MELANIE
			(looking at him)
		Of course.

				CLERK
			(looks back at her)
		D'you want me to order one for you?

				MELANIE
			(surprised)
		Thank you.

				CLERK
		What name?

				MELANIE
		Daniels.

				CLERK
		Okay.

	He nods briefly and goes inside. Melanie looks across the 
	bay.

	FULL SHOT - THE BAY - MELANIE'S P.O.V. - (MATTE)

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	smiling. She gets a new idea. She reaches into her purse for 
	the envelope. She looks at the envelope, then tears it up 
	and stuffs the torn envelope into her handbag. She turns 
	back toward the post office.

	INT. THE POST OFFICE - FULL SHOT

	as Melanie approaches the Clerk's window. He is still busy, 
	still does not look up.

				MELANIE
		I wonder if you could tell me...

				CLERK
		Yep?

				MELANIE
		The little girl's name.

				CLERK
		The little Brenner girl?

				MELANIE
		Yes.

				CLERK
		Alice, I think.
			(he turns, shouts to 
			someone in rear)
		Harry, what's the little Brenner 
		girl's name?

				HARRY'S VOICE
			(shouting)
		What?

				CLERK
			(shouting)
		The little Brenner girl.

				HARRY'S VOICE
			(shouting)
		Lois!

				CLERK
			(shouting)
		It's Alice, ain't it?

				HARRY'S VOICE
			(shouting)
		No, it's Lois!

				CLERK
			(to Melanie)
		It's Alice.

				MELANIE
		Are you sure?

				CLERK
		Well, I ain't positive, if that's 
		what you mean.

				MELANIE
		I need her exact name, you see.

				CLERK
		That case, I tell you what you do.  
		You go straight through town 'til 
		you see a little hotel on your left 
		there. Not the motel, that's the 
		other end of town. This is the hotel. 
		Now you take a right turn there, you 
		got that?

				MELANIE
		Yes?

				CLERK
		Near the top of the hill, you'll see 
		the school and right behind it, the 
		church. You head for the school.  
		Now just past the school, you'll see 
		a little house with a red mail box.  
		That's where Annie Hayworth lives, 
		she's the school teacher. You ask 
		her about the little Brenner girl.

				MELANIE
		Thank you.

				CLERK
		Yep.
			(pause)
		Could save yourself a lot of trouble. 
		Her name's Alice for sure.

				MELANIE
		Can I have the boat in about twenty 
		minutes?

	The Clerk nods.

				MELANIE
		How much for the phone calls?

				CLERK
			(brushing this aside)
		It's nothing.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	grinning, as she makes for the door and EXITS.

	LONG SHOT (MATTE) - MELANIE'S CAR turning in school road.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE'S CAR

	passing the school and pulling up outside the teacher's house.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE RED MAIL BOX

	with the name "Hayworth" on it. PULL BACK to reveal:

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	passing the mail box and going up the walk to the front door.  
	The house is a two-story frame with steps leading to the 
	front door. There are white curtains in every window of the 
	house, and a sign in the window to the left of the doorway 
	advises, ROOM TO LET. Melanie rings the doorbell.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	waiting. She RINGS the bell again:

				ANNIE'S VOICE
			(shouting)
		Yes? Who is it?

				MELANIE
		Me!

				ANNIE'S VOICE
		Who's me?

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	walking along the porch of the house. The walk in front of 
	the house is lined with beautifully planted and cared-for 
	flowers. ANNIE HAYWORTH comes round from the back of the 
	house as Melanie reaches the corner. She is a woman of thirty-
	two, tall, big-boned, with a strong beautiful face.  Her 
	hair is disarrayed at the moment, and she is dressed for the 
	garden, wearing slacks and a loose-fitting sweater, and earth-
	stained gloves. But there is something about her, a feeling 
	of expansive comfort, rather than sloppiness.

				MELANIE
		Miss Hayworth?

				ANNIE
		Yes?

				MELANIE
		I'm Melanie Daniels. I'm sorry to 
		bother you, but...

	CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE

	She is puzzled by Melanie who, exquisitely dressed and 
	groomed, seems singularly out of place in Bodega Bay. She 
	studies her openly.

				ANNIE
		Yes?

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE

				MELANIE
		The man at the post office sent me.  
		He said you'd know the name of the 
		little Brenner girl.

				ANNIE
		Cathy?

				MELANIE
		The one who lives in the white house 
		across the bay?

				ANNIE
		That's the one. Cathy Brenner.

				MELANIE
			(smiling)
		They seemed sure it was either Alice 
		or Lois.

				ANNIE
		Which is why the mail in this town 
		never gets delivered to the right 
		place.
			(She takes out package 
			of cigarettes, offers 
			one to Melanie)
		Did you want to see Cathy about 
		something?

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	taking cigarette, hesitating.

				MELANIE
		Well... not exactly.

	CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE

	studying her, thinking she understands.

				ANNIE
		Are you a friend of Mitch's?

				MELANIE
		No, not really.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE

	There is an awkwardness here. Annie wants to know more. She 
	puffs on the cigarette, smiles, tries a friendly approach.

				ANNIE
		I've been wanting a cigarette for 
		the past twenty minutes, but I 
		couldn't convince myself to stop.  
		This 'tilling of the soil' can get a 
		little compulsive, you know.

				MELANIE
		It's a lovely garden.

				ANNIE
		Thank you. It gives me something to 
		do with my spare time.
			(pause)
		There's a lot of spare time in Bodega 
		Bay.
			(another pause)
		Did you plan on staying long?

				MELANIE
		No. Just a few hours.

				ANNIE
		You're leaving after you see Cathy?

				MELANIE
		Well... something like that.
			(pause)
		I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so 
		mysterious.

				ANNIE
		Actually, it's none of my business.

	There is a pause. Melanie, by her silence, affirms that it 
	is none of Annie's business.

				ANNIE
			(putting out cigarette)
		I'd better get on my way. Thank you 
		very much.

				ANNIE
		Not at all.

	They begin walking toward the car.

				ANNIE
			(still curious)
		Did you drive up from San Francisco?

				MELANIE
		Yes.

				ANNIE
		It's a nice drive.
			(pause)
		Is that where you met Mitch?

				MELANIE
			(hesitating, then)
		Yes.

				ANNIE
		I guess that's where everyone meets 
		him.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	as she gets in behind the wheel. Annie's remark is not lost 
	on her, and a quick look of sudden understanding crosses her 
	face.

				MELANIE
		Now you sound a bit mysterious, Miss 
		Hayworth.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE

	as Annie leans over the seat.

				ANNIE
		Do I?
			(she shakes her head, 
			smiles wistfully)
		No, I'm an open book, I'm afraid.
			(pause)
		Or maybe a closed one.
			(she smiles again, 
			sees the lovebirds)
		Pretty. What are they?

				MELANIE
		Lovebirds.

	Taking this as a further indication of Melanie's relationship 
	with Mitch:

				ANNIE
		Mmm.
			(pause)
		Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.

				MELANIE
		Thank you.

	She nods pleasantly, starts the car, pulls away.

	CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE

	watching the car, a look of sad resignation on her face.

	She gets out of the car and walks onto one of the docks, the 
	bird cage in her hand. Melanie approaches a waiting fisherman. 
	She asks for her boat. The fisherman nods. He leads her to

	except for the cry of the gulls.

	LONG SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE - MELANIE'S P.O.V.

	There is not a sign of activity as the boat drifts just a 
	little closer. As Melanie watches, the front door opens and 
	a woman comes out, walks to a red pickup truck, starts the 
	engine. A little girl comes out of the house, goes to the 
	truck, gets in. The woman shouts something to a man -- Mitch 
	Brenner, probably, though it is difficult to tell from this 
	distance -- and he comes over to the truck.

	The truck grinds into gear, goes around the turnabout, and 
	heads down the road away from the farm, a huge cloud of dust 
	behind it. The farm is still again. Mitch stands looking 
	after the truck for a moment, and then begins walking up 
	toward the barn in the distance.

	for her, and they ENTER.

	INT. THE TIDES - FULL SHOT

	This is a small neighborhood restaurant, with the feeling of 
	a local hangout. There are fishermen lounging at the bar, 
	and a teenage boy playing one of the pinball machines. Two 
	ladies in housedresses, with their hair in curlers, are 
	sitting at one of the booths, having coffee. The rear wall 
	of the restaurant is almost all window, looking out over the 
	bay and the parking area below. A television set over the 
	bar is going. The shots and horsehoof beats of an old Western 
	movie should be HEARD muted throughout following.  DEKE 
	CARTER, who owns the restaurant with his wife, alternates 
	his attention between serving his customers and watching the 
	Western. He looks up immediately when Mitch and Melanie ENTER.

	MED. SHOT - THE BAR

	Mitch and Melanie coming over to it.

				MITCH
		Deke, have you got a first aid kit 
		back there?

				DEKE
			(instantly alarmed)
		What happened?

				MITCH
		Young woman cut herself.

				DEKE
		Shall I call the doctor?

				MITCH
			(accepting the first 
			aid kit)
		I don't think it's that serious.  
		You want to sit up here?

	Melanie climbs onto the stool.

				DEKE
		You cut yourself outside, Miss?

				MITCH
		Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a 
		boat.

	He is rummaging around in the kit.

				DEKE
		I had a man trip and fall in the 
		parking lot once, sued me before I 
		could bat an eyelash.

				MITCH
		I don't think Miss Daniels is going 
		to sue anybody.

				DEKE
			(doubtfully)
		Well, you're the lawyer.
			(goes to other end of 
			bar)

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	as he unscrews cap from bottle of peroxide.

				MELANIE
		What's that?

				MITCH
		Just some peroxide. I want to clean 
		out the cut.

	He pours peroxide onto a gauze pad and begins swabbing the 
	cut. They are silent for several seconds. Then:

				MELANIE
		So you're a lawyer.

				MITCH
		That's right. What are you doing in 
		Bodega Bay?

				MELANIE
		Do you practice here?

				MITCH
		No, San Francisco. What are you...?

				MELANIE
		What kind of law?

				MITCH
		Criminal.

				MELANIE
		Is that why you'd like to see everyone 
		behind bars?

				MITCH
		Not everyone, Miss Daniels.

				MELANIE
		Only violators and practical jokers.

				MELANIE
		That's right.

	As he swabs cut.

				MELANIE
		Ouch!

				MITCH
		I'm sorry.
			(pause)
		What are you doing up here?

				MELANIE
		Didn't you see the lovebirds?

				MITCH
		You came all the way up here to bring 
		me those birds?

				MELANIE
		To bring your sister those birds.  
		You said it was her birthday.  
		Besides, I was coming up anyway.

				MITCH
		What for?

				MELANIE
		To see a friend of mine.
			(she winces)
		Will you please be careful?

				MITCH
		I'm sorry.
			(pause)
		Who's your friend?

				MELANIE
		Why...
			(pause, stymied)

				MITCH
		Yes?

				MELANIE
			(blurting the only 
			name she knows)
		Annie. Annie Hayworth.

				MITCH
		Well, well, small world. Annie 
		Hayworth.

				MELANIE
			(realizing this was a 
			mistake)
		Yes.

				MITCH
		How do you know Annie?

				MELANIE
			(the lie getting deeper)
		We... we went to school together.  
		College.

				MITCH
		Did you! Imagine that! How long will 
		you be staying?

				MELANIE
		Just a few... just a day or two... 
		the weekend.

				MITCH
		I think we'll have to shave the hair. 
		Deke, have you got a razor?

				MELANIE
			(pulling away)
		Oh, no you don't!

				MITCH
		It's still bleeding a little. Here, 
		let me put this on.

	He takes up a tiny Band-Aid and, tearing the gauze off, says:

				MITCH
		Bend your head down. This little 
		Band-Aid won't show.

	He presses the tiny Band-Aid over the cut. Melanie takes a 
	mirror from her handbag and, bending her head down, looks at 
	it. She covers her hair over it as Mitch says:

				MITCH
		So you came up to see Annie, huh?

				MELANIE
		Yes.

				MITCH
		I don't believe you.
			(grins)
		I think you came up to see me.

				MELANIE
		Why would I want to see you, of all 
		people?

				MITCH
			(shrugging)
		I don't know. But it seems to me you 
		must have gone to a lot of trouble 
		to find out who I was, and where I 
		lived and...

				MELANIE
		It was no trouble at all. I simply 
		called my father's paper. Besides, I 
		was coming up here anyway, I already 
		told you...

				MITCH
			(grinning)
		You like me, huh?

				MELANIE
		I loathe you. You have no manners.  
		And you're arrogant and conceited 
		and... I wrote you a letter about 
		it, in fact, but I tore it up.

				MITCH
		What did it say?

				MELANIE
		None of your business.
			(pause)
		Am I still bleeding?

	She lowers her head.

				MITCH
		Can't see a thing.

				MELANIE
		I can't say I like your seagulls 
		much, either. I come all the way up 
		here to...

				MITCH
		But you were coming up anyway, 
		remember?

				MELANIE
		I was! And all I get for my pains is 
		a... a... a hole in the head!

				MITCH
			(grinning)
		Right next to the one you already 
		had.

				MELANIE
			(angrily)
		Look, Mr. Brenner...

				LYDIA (O.S.)
		Mitch?

	They turn toward the door.

	MED. SHOT - LYDIA BRENNER

	closing the door behind her, coming toward the bar. She is a 
	woman in her late forties, attractive, wearing shirt, blouse, 
	cardigan sweater, low heels. There is nothing agrarian-looking 
	about her. She speaks with the quick tempo of the city 
	dweller, and there is lively inquiry in her eyes.

				LYDIA
			(puzzled)
		I thought I saw your car. What are 
		you doing in town?

				MITCH
			(rising to greet her)
		I had to acknowledge a delivery.
			(grins)
		Mother, I'd like you to meet...

				LYDIA
		A what?

				MITCH
			(continuing)
		Melanie Daniels. Melanie, my mother.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	Her eyebrows raising ever so slightly, not in displeasure, 
	but simply in enormous curiosity as she acknowledge the 
	introduction.

				LYDIA
		How do you do, Miss Daniels?
			(to Mitch)
		Acknowledge a what?

	BACK TO SCENE

				MITCH
		A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels 
		brought some birds from San Francisco.

	Lydia thinks she understands. This is one of Mitch's San 
	Francisco chippies.

				LYDIA
		Oh. I see.

				MITCH
		For Cathy. For her birthday. By the 
		way, where is she?

				LYDIA
		Across at Brinkmeyer's.

				MITCH
		Miss Daniels is staying for the 
		weekend. In fact, I've already invited 
		her to dinner tonight.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	turning to him in surprise, beginning to shake her head.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

				MITCH
		After all, you did go to the trouble 
		of bringing up those birds.

				MELANIE (O.S.)
		I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly...

	BACK TO SCENE

				LYDIA
		You did say birds?

				MITCH
		Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...

				LYDIA
			(understanding 
			completely now)
		Lovebirds, I see.

				MITCH
		...get away without thanking you in 
		some small way. After all, you haven't 
		even met Cathy and you are staying 
		for the weekend...

				MELANIE
		Yes, but...

				MITCH
		You are, aren't you?

				MELANIE
		Certainly, but...

				MITCH
		Then it's settled. What time is 
		dinner, Mother?

				LYDIA
		Seven o'clock, same as usual.

				MITCH
		I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels.  
		Where are you staying?

				MELANIE
		With... with Annie, of course.

				MITCH
		Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter 
		to seven, will that be all right?

				MELANIE
		Annie... Annie may have made other 
		plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I 
		can find my own way.

				MITCH
		You're sure now? You won't hire a 
		boat or anything?

				MELANIE
		I'm sure.

				MITCH
		Seven o'clock then.

				MELANIE
		Maybe.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	grinning.

				MITCH
		We'll be waiting. How's your head 
		now?

	MED. SHOT - THE GROUP

	Lydia looks at Mitch inquiringly.

				MELANIE
			(with an overwarm 
			smile)
		It's nothing, Mrs. Brenner. A gull 
		hit me, that's all.

	Lydia stares at her doubtfully.

	EXT. ANNIE HAYWORTH'S HOUSE - FULL SHOT

	Melanie is standing on the front steps, a paper bag in her 
	hands. She rings the doorbell. The ROOM TO LET sign is still 
	in the window. The door suddenly opens.

				ANNIE
			(surprised)
		Oh, hi!
			(pause)
		Did you find her all right?

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE

				MELANIE
		Yes, I did.

	There is a long awkward pause. Annie smiles expectantly at 
	Melanie. Melanie seems hesitant.

				MELANIE
		I was wondering...

				ANNIE
		Yes?

				MELANIE
		That sign.
			(pause)
		Do you think I could have the room 
		for a single night?

				ANNIE
		Well, I'd really hope to rent it 
		for...

				MELANIE
		I would appreciate it. I've tried 
		everywhere in town, and they're all 
		full.

				ANNIE
			(after a pause)
		Sure. You can have it.
			(smiles)
		Where's your bag? In the car?

	Melanie holds up the paper bag. Annie looks at it and then 
	smiles.

				ANNIE
		It's utilitarian, I'll say that for 
		it.

				MELANIE
			(smiling)
		I just picked up some things for the 
		night at the general store. You see, 
		I hadn't planned on spending much 
		time here.

				ANNIE
		Yes, I know. Did something unexpected 
		crop up?

	There is a moment where both women look at each other...  
	When Melanie answers, it is abrupt and a trifle cold -- she 
	is again telling Annie to mind her own business.

				MELANIE
		Yes.
			(pause)
		May I use your phone? I'd like to 
		call home.

	There is another moment where Annie appraises Melanie's 
	attitude, and then accepts it. She suddenly smiles warmly.

				ANNIE
		Why don't you come in then?  I was 
		just about to mix a martini.

	She is about to lead Melanie into the house when they both 
	hear a SOUND overhead. They turn to look skyward.

	LONG SHOT - A FLOCK OF LARGE BIRDS

	flying in beautiful precise formation against the sky.

	TWO SHOT - ANNIE AND MELANIE

				ANNIE
			(shaking her head)
		Don't they ever stop migrating?

	But Melanie is watching the sky and the birds with a curiously 
	serious expression.

	LONG SHOT - THE APPROACH ROAD to the Brenner house. Melanie's 
	car is driving along the shore. Behind her, the sky is stained 
	with sunset. There are gulls on the bay, cawing into the 
	silence.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR

	as it pulls into the Brenner yard.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	reaching up for the rear view mirror, tilting it to examine 
	her lipstick, touching the edge of her mouth with one hand.  
	She gets out of the car, CAMERA FOLLOWING her to the house.  
	She climbs the porch steps, KNOCKS on the door. There is no 
	answer. Puzzled, she begins walking back into the yard. In 
	the distance, she sees Mitch, Lydia and Cathy coming from 
	behind the chicken sheds. She raises her arm in greeting.

				MELANIE
			(calling)
		Hi!

	FULL SHOT - MITCH, CATHY, LYDIA

	in the distance. Mitch and Cathy raise their arms.

				CATHY
			(excitedly)
		Hi!
			(she breaks into a 
			trot toward Melanie)

	CLOSE SHOT - CATHY as she approaches. She is an eleven-year-
	old child, clear-eyed, bright, uninhibited, wearing a shirt 
	and blouse, her hair cropped close to her head. She hesitates 
	for just a moment.

				CATHY
		Miss Daniels?

				MELANIE
		Yes?

	And Cathy flings herself into Melanie's arms, almost knocking 
	her off her feet, hugging her fiercely.

				CATHY
		They're beautiful! They're just what 
		I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? 
		I can't tell which is which.

				MELANIE
		Well, I suppose...

	FULL SHOT - ALL OF THEM

				MITCH
			(coming up)
		Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm 
		glad you came. Are you hungry?

				MELANIE
		Famished.

				MITCH
		Dinner's just about ready.
			(explaining)
		We were out back looking at the 
		chickens. Something seems to be wrong 
		with them.

				LYDIA
			(going toward house)
		There's nothing wrong with those 
		chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call 
		Fred Brinkmeyer right now.

				MITCH
			(as they follow into 
			house)
		I don't know what good that'll do.
			(aside to Melanie)
		Chickens won't eat.

	FULL SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE

	as they ENTER, CAMERA FOLLOWING them throughout into dining 
	room where Lydia dials phone, talking to Mitch all along.

				LYDIA
		He sold the feed to me, didn't he?

				MITCH
		Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer 
		beware.

				LYDIA
		Whose side are you on?

				MITCH
		I'm simply quoting the law.

				LYDIA
		Never mind the law. Cathy, you can 
		start serving the soup.

	She has finished dialing now, is waiting while the phone 
	RINGS.

				LYDIA
		This won't take a minute, Miss Dan...
			(into phone)
		Hello, Fred? This is Lydia Brenner.  
		I didn't interrupt your dinner, did 
		I?
			(pause)
		Fred, that feed you sold me is no 
		good.
			(pause)
		The chicken feed. The three bags I 
		brought.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	holding the telephone.

				LYDIA
		Well, it's just no good. The chickens 
		won't eat it.
			(pause)
		They're always hungry, Fred. I opened 
		one of the sacks when I got home, 
		and I poured it out for them, and 
		they wouldn't touch it. Now you know 
		chickens as well as I do, and when 
		they won't eat, there's just something 
		wrong with what they're being fed, 
		that's all.
			(pause)
		No, they're not fussy chickens.
			(pause)
		Who? What's he got to do with it?
			(pause)
		Fred, I don't care how much feed you 
		sold him. My chickens...
			(pause)
		He did? Dan Fawcett?
			(pause)
		This afternoon?
			(pause)
		Well, that only proves what I'm 
		saying. The feed you sold us is...
			(pause)
		Oh. Oh, I see. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.  Uh-
		huh. Maybe I ought to go over to see 
		him. You don't think there's something 
		going around, do you?
			(pause)
		No, never.
			(pause)
		No, Fred, they don't seem sick at 
		all. They just won't eat.
			(pause)
		Mmmm. Mmmmm. Well, I'll try to get 
		over to Dan's farm.  Maybe he'll... 
		mmmmm... mmmmm... all right, Fred, 
		thanks.
			(she hangs up, puzzled)

	FULL SHOT - THE DINING ROOM

	as Lydia comes to the table. Mitch and Melanie are sitting 
	opposite each other in the center chairs. Cathy is serving 
	the last bowl of soup.

				LYDIA
			(as she sits)
		He got a call from Dan Fawcett a 
		little while ago. His chickens won't 
		eat, either.

				CATHY
		It's what you said, Mom. Mr.  
		Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.

				LYDIA
			(slowly)
		No, Cathy. He sold Mr. Fawcett a 
		different brand.
			(extremely worried)
		You don't think they're getting sick, 
		do you, Mitch?

	FULL SHOT - THE LIVING ROOM

	The meal is over. The lovebirds in their hanging cage have 
	been covered for the night. In the b.g. Mitch and Lydia are 
	carrying the stacked dishes to the kitchen. In the f.g.  
	Cathy and Melanie are by a small upright piano. Melanie is 
	playing a Debussy Arabesque: She picks up a cigarette from 
	the ashtray now and again to take a puff.

				CATHY
		I still don't understand how you 
		knew I wanted lovebirds.

				MELANIE
		Your brother told me.

				LYDIA
			(as she goes into 
			kitchen)
		Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, 
		is that right?

				MELANIE
		No, not exactly.

				CATHY
		Mitch knows lots of people in San 
		Francisco. Of course, they're mostly 
		hoods.

				LYDIA
			(from the kitchen)
		Cathy!

				CATHY
		Well, Mom, he's the first to admit 
		it.
			(to Melanie)
		He spends half his day in the 
		detention cells at the Hall of 
		Justice.

				LYDIA
			(coming from kitchen)
		In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is 
		entitled to a fair trial. Your 
		brother's practice...

				CATHY
		Mom, please, I know all the democracy 
		jazz. They're still hoods.
			(to Melanie)
		He's got a client now who shot his 
		wife in the head six times. Six times, 
		can you imagine it?
			(she starts for living 
			room)
		I mean, even twice would be overdoing 
		it, don't you think?

				MELANIE
			(to Mitch as he carries 
			load of dishes out)
		Why did he shoot her?

				MITCH
		He was watching a ball game on 
		television.

				MELANIE
		What?

				MITCH
		His wife changed the channel.

	He GOES INTO kitchen.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND CATHY

	Melanie interrupts her playing to take another puff at her 
	cigarette.

				CATHY
		Is smoking fun?

				MELANIE
		Oh, I suppose so.

				CATHY
		Could I have a puff?

				MELANIE
		I don't think your mother would like 
		that.

				CATHY (O.S.)
		Just a little one.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND CATHY

	They both glance conspiratorially toward the kitchen.  
	Quickly, Melanie extends the cigarette. Quickly, Cathy takes 
	a small puff.

				CATHY
			(delighted)
		Why, it's just like air, isn't it?
			(determined)
		When I grow up, I'm gonna smoke like 
		a chimney! I'll be eleven tomorrow, 
		you know.

				MELANIE
		I know.

				CATHY
		Are you coming to my party?

				MELANIE
		I don't think so.
			(seeing the child's 
			face)
		I have to get back to San Francisco.

				CATHY
		Don't you like us?

				MELANIE
			(touching her hair)
		Darling, of course I do!

				CATHY
		Don't you like Bodega Bay?

				MELANIE
		I don't know yet.

				CATHY
		Mitch likes it very much. He comes 
		up every weekend, you know, even 
		though he has his own apartment in 
		the city. He says San Francisco is 
		just an ant hill at the foot of a 
		bridge.

				MELANIE
			(smiling)
		I guess it does get a little hectic 
		at times.

				CATHY
		If you do decide to come, don't say 
		I told you about it. It's supposed 
		to be a surprise party.

	Melanie laughs.

				CATHY
		You see, they've got this whole 
		complicated thing figured out where 
		I'm going over to Michele's for the 
		afternoon, and Michele's mother is 
		going to say she has a headache and 
		would I mind very much if she took 
		me home. Then, when we get back here, 
		all of the kids'll jump out!
			(pause)
		Won't you come? Won't you please 
		come?

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	shaking her head, glancing toward the kitchen.

				MELANIE
		I don't think so, Cathy.

	INT. KITCHEN - TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH

	Mitch is helping her as she loads the dishwasher.

				LYDIA
		She's a charming girl, isn't she, 
		Mitch?

				MITCH
		Yes, very.

				LYDIA
		And certainly pretty.

				MITCH
		Yes.

				LYDIA
		How long have you known her?

				MITCH
		I told you. We met yesterday.

				LYDIA
		In a bird shop.

				MITCH
		Yes.

				LYDIA
		She was selling birds.

				MITCH
		No. I only led her into believing I 
		believed she was... Mother, it's 
		really very complicated.

				LYDIA
		But she did buy the lovebirds and 
		then brought them all the way...

				MITCH
		Mother, where did you go to law 
		school?

				LYDIA
			(laughing)
		Forgive me. I suppose I'm just 
		naturally curious about a girl like 
		that.
			(pause)
		She's very rich, isn't she?

				MITCH
		I suppose so. Her father owns a big 
		newspaper in San Francisco.

				LYDIA
		You'd think he could manage to keep 
		her name out of print. She's always 
		mentioned in the columns, Mitch.

				MITCH
		I know, Mother.

				LYDIA
		She is the one who jumped into that 
		fountain in Rome last summer, isn't 
		she?

				MITCH
		Yes, Mother.

				LYDIA
		Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.
			(pause)
		I know it was supposed to be very 
		warm there, Mitch, but... well...  
		actually... well, the newspaper said 
		she was naked.

				MITCH
		I know, Mother.

				LYDIA
		It's none of my business, of course, 
		but when you bring a girl like that 
		to...

				MITCH
		Mother?

				LYDIA
			(looking up)
		Yes?

				MITCH
		I think I can handle Melanie Daniels 
		by myself.

				LYDIA
		Well...

		So long as you know what you want,

				MITCH
		You'll be able to find your way back,

				MELANIE
		Oh, yes.

				MELANIE
		Will I be seeing you again?

				MELANIE
		San Francisco's a long way from here.

				MITCH
		I'm in San Francisco five days a 
		week. With a lot of time on my hands. 
		I'd like to see you.
			(he grins)
		Maybe we could go swimming or 
		something. Mother tells me you like 
		to swim.

				MELANIE
		How does Mother know what I like to 
		do?

				MITCH
		I guess she and I read the same gossip 
		columns.

				MELANIE
		Oh. That. Rome.

				MITCH
		Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get 
		along very...

				MELANIE
		In case you're interested, I was 
		pushed into that fountain.

				MELANIE
		Without any clothes on?

				MELANIE
		With all my clothes on!  The newspaper 
		that ran the story happens to be a 
		rival of my father's paper.  Anything 
		they said...

				MITCH
		You were just a poor, innocent victim 
		of circumstance, huh?

				MELANIE
		I'm neither poor nor innocent, but 
		the truth of that particular...

				MITCH
		The truth is you were running around 
		with a pretty wild crowd...

				MELANIE
		Yes, but...

				MITCH
		...who didn't much care for propriety 
		or convention or...

				MELANIE
		Yes.

				MITCH
		...the opinions of others, and you 
		went right along with them, isn't 
		that the truth?

				MELANIE
		Yes, that's the truth. But I was 
		pushed into that fountain, and that's 
		the truth, too.

				MITCH
		Sure. Do you really know Annie 
		Hayworth?

				MELANIE
		No.
			(pause)
		At least, I didn't until I came up 
		here.

				MITCH
		So you didn't go to school together.

				MELANIE
		No.

				MITCH
		And you didn't come up here to see 
		her.

				MELANIE
		No.

				MITCH
		You were lying.

				MELANIE
		Yes, I was lying.

				MITCH
		Did you really write a letter to me?  
		Or was that a lie, too?

				MELANIE
		I wrote the letter.

				MITCH
		What did it say?

				MELANIE
		It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think 
		you need those lovebirds, after all.  
		They may help your personality." 
		That's what it said.

				MITCH
		But you tore it up.

				MELANIE
		Yes.

				MITCH
		Why?

				MELANIE
		Because it seemed stupid and foolish.

				MITCH
		Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!

				MELANIE
		I told you what happened in Rome!

				MITCH
		Do you expect me to believe...?

				MELANIE
		I don't give a damn what you believe!

	Angrily she gets into the car, is about to slam the door

				MITCH
		I think it could be fun.

	INT. ANNIE HAYWORTH'S LIVING ROOM - MED. SHOT - ANNIE

	HAYWORTH

	In an easy chair, reading. She is wearing a robe and smoking, 
	absorbed in her book. She turns when she hears the front 
	DOOR OPENING.

				ANNIE
		Miss Daniels? Is that you?

				MELANIE (O.S.)
		Yes.

	Annie rises to greet her. As Melanie ENTERS THE SHOT:

				ANNIE
		Hi.
			(seeing her face)
		Is something wrong? Is that cut 
		beginning to bother you?

				MELANIE
			(touching her head)
		No, it's not the cut that's bothering 
		me.

				ANNIE
			(concerned)
		Would you like some brandy?

				MELANIE
		If you have some, I'd...

				ANNIE
		I'll get it, sit down, Miss Daniels.  
		Do you want a sweater or something?  
		A quilt?

	As Annie gets the brandy:

				MELANIE
		No, thank you.
			(pause)
		Won't you call me Melanie?

				ANNIE
		All right.
			(she smiles)

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE sitting, tucking her legs up under her. 
	She is disturbed by her conversation with Mitch and, in fact, 
	by the way this entire trip has worked out. Annie brings her 
	the glass of brandy, and she takes it gratefully.

				MELANIE
		Thank you.

				ANNIE
			(sitting opposite her)
		It gets a little chilly here at night 
		sometimes. Especially if you're over 
		near the bay.

	Melanie nods and sips at the brandy. There is a long pause.

				ANNIE
		Well, how'd your evening go?

	Melanie shrugs.

				ANNIE
		Did you meet Lydia?

	Melanie nods.

				ANNIE
		Or would you rather I changed the 
		subject?

				MELANIE
			(with a tired smile)
		I think so.

				ANNIE
			(nodding)
		How do you like our little hamlet?

				MELANIE
		I despise it.

				ANNIE
			(laughing)
		Well, I don't suppose it offers much 
		to the casual visitor. Unless you're 
		thrilled by a collection of shacks 
		on a hillside. It takes a while to 
		get used to.

				MELANIE
		Where are you from originally, Annie?

				ANNIE
		San Francisco.

				MELANIE
		How'd you happen to come here?

				ANNIE
		Oh, someone invited me up for the 
		weekend a long time ago.

	There is an awkward pause. Annie shrugs.

				ANNIE
		Look, I see no reason for being coy 
		about this. It was Mitch Brenner.

	Melanie nods.

				ANNIE
		I guess you knew that, anyway.

				MELANIE
		I suspected as much.

				ANNIE
		You needn't worry. It's over and 
		done with. A long time ago.

				MELANIE
		Annie -- there's nothing between 
		Mitch and me.

				ANNIE
		Isn't there?
			(she shrugs)
		Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's 
		never anything between Mitch and any 
		girl.

				MELANIE
		What do you mean?

				ANNIE
		I think I'll have some of that, too.
			(she pours brandy, 
			drinks, sighs)
		I was seeing quite a lot of him in 
		San Francisco, you know.
			(she smiles weakly)
		And then, one weekend, he asked me 
		up to meet Lydia.

				MELANIE
		When was this?

				ANNIE
		Four years ago. Of course, that was 
		shortly after his father died.  Things 
		may be different now.

				MELANIE
		Different?

				ANNIE
		With Lydia.
			(pause)
		Did she seem a trifle distant?

				MELANIE
			(smiling)
		A trifle.

				ANNIE
		Then maybe it isn't different at 
		all. You know, her attitude nearly 
		drove me crazy. I simply couldn't 
		understand it.

				ANNIE
		When I got back to San Francisco I 
		spent days trying to figure out just 
		what I'd done to displease her.

				MELANIE
		And what had you done?

				ANNIE
		Nothing! I simply existed. So what 
		was the answer? A jealous woman, 
		right? A clinging possessive mother.
			(she shakes her head)
		Wrong. With all due respect to 
		Oedipus, I don't think that was the 
		case at all.

				MELANIE
		Then what was it?

				ANNIE
		Lydia liked me, you see. That was 
		the strange part of it. In fact, now 
		that I'm no longer a threat, we're 
		very good friends.

				MELANIE
		Then why did she object to you?

				ANNIE
		Because she was afraid.

				MELANIE
		Afraid you'd take Mitch?

				ANNIE
		Afraid I'd give Mitch.

				MELANIE
		I don't understand.

				ANNIE
		Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch 
		the only thing Lydia can give him --
		love.

				MELANIE
		Annie, that adds up to a jealous, 
		possessive woman.

				ANNIE
		No, I don't think so. She's not afraid 
		of losing her son, you see.  She's 
		only afraid of being abandoned.

				MELANIE
		Someone ought to tell her she'd be 
		gaining a daughter.

				ANNIE
		She already has a daughter.

				MELANIE
		What about Mitch? Didn't he have 
		anything to say about this?

				ANNIE
			(apologetically)
		I can understand his position. He 
		went through a lot with Lydia after 
		his father died. He didn't want to 
		risk going through it all over again.

				MELANIE
		I see.

				ANNIE
		So it ended. Not immediately, of 
		course. I went back to San Francisco, 
		and I still saw Mitch every now and 
		then... but we both knew it was 
		finished.

				MELANIE
		Then what are you doing here in Bodega 
		Bay?

				ANNIE
		You get straight to the point, don't 
		you?

				MELANIE
		I'm sorry. Forgive me.

				ANNIE
		No, that's all right, I don't mind.  
		I came up here for two reasons. To 
		begin with, I was bored with my job 
		in San Francisco. I was teaching at 
		a private school there... well, you 
		know, you probably went to one 
		yourself.

				MELANIE
		I did.

				ANNIE
		Then you know. Little girls in brown 
		beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. 
		I'll go into that classroom on Monday 
		morning, and I'll look out at twenty-
		five upturned little faces, and each 
		of them will be saying, 'Yes, please 
		give me what you have.'
			(pause)
		And I'll give them what I have. I 
		haven't got very much, but I'll give 
		them every ounce of it. To me, that's 
		very important. It makes me want to 
		stay alive for a long long time.
			(she sighs)
		That's the first reason.

				MELANIE
		And the second?

				ANNIE
			(simply)
		I wanted to be near Mitch.
			(pause)
		It was over, and I knew it, but I 
		wanted to be near him, anyway.
			(she smiles)
		You see, I still like him a hell of 
		a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't 
		want to lose his friendship... ever.

	There is a moment of silence. Into the silence, the TELEPHONE 
	shrills. Annie hesitates a moment, and then goes to answer 
	it.

	CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE

	at the phone.

				ANNIE
		Hello?  Oh, hello. No, no, I wasn't 
		asleep. What is it?
			(pause)
		Yes, just a little while ago. Sure, 
		hold on.
			(she turns to Melanie)
		It's Mitch. For you.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE

	as they stare at each other across the room, Melanie 
	hesitating.

				ANNIE
		He's waiting.

	Melanie rises and goes to the phone. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Annie 
	to the wing chair in the foreground and stays on her 
	throughout following, recording her reactions as Melanie 
	talks to Mitch in the background.

	Annie is not devastated by this call, and yet there is a 
	wistfulness to her expression as she realizes she may finally 
	and irrevocably be losing Mitch to another girl.

				MELANIE
			(at phone; coolly)
		Hello? Yes, this is Melanie. Fine, 
		thank you. No, no trouble at all.  I 
		simply followed the road. It's a 
		very bright night.
			(pause)
		What?  Oh. Well, there's no need to 
		apologize. I can understand...
			(pause; she listens)
		Well...
			(she listens again)
		That's very kind of you. No, I'm not 
		angry.
			(she listens)
		I couldn't. I'm afraid I have to get 
		back to San Francisco.
			(pause)
		No, I wouldn't want to disappoint 
		Cathy, but...
			(pause)
		I see.
			(she is warming)
		I see. Well, if you really...
			(pause)
		All right. Yes, I'll be there.
			(pause)
		Good night, Mitch.

	She hangs up and looks at Annie in embarrassment.

				MELANIE
		He wants me to go to Cathy's party 
		tomorrow afternoon.
			(pause)
		I said I would.

				ANNIE
		I'll be going, too, to help out. It 
		should be fun, Melanie.

				MELANIE
		It seems so pointless.
			(she sighs)
		I think I'll go to sleep. This has 
		been a busy day.
			(picking up her paper 
			bag)
		My luggage.

	She smiles, takes out a flowered muumuu, holds it up to Annie.

				ANNIE
		Pretty. Did you get that at 
		Brinkmeyer's?

	Melanie nods and drapes the muumuu over her arm. She is silent 
	for a moment, pensive. Then:

				MELANIE
		Do you think I should go?

				ANNIE
		That's up to you.

				MELANIE
		It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?

				ANNIE
		Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?

				MELANIE
			(firmly)
		Yes.

				ANNIE
		Then go.

	The room is silent. Melanie nods, slowly, and then smiles.

				MELANIE
		Thank you, Annie.

	Suddenly, into the silence, comes a THUMP at the door, 
	startling them both.

				ANNIE
			(rising)
		Who can that be at this hour?
			(she walks to door)
		Who is it?
			(no answer)
		Is someone there?

	Melanie goes to stand beside Annie. Puzzled, Annie unlocks 
	the door, and then opens it. She looks out into the night.  
	There is nothing but the SOUND of the wind.

				ANNIE
			(to the emptiness 
			outside)
		Is anyone there?

				MELANIE
			(pointing to the ground)
		Look.

	CLOSE SHOT - A DEAD SEAGULL

	CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE

				ANNIE
			(sympathetically)
		Ohhh. Oh, the poor thing. He probably 
		lost his way in the dark.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	who stares at the dead bird as Annie stoops to pick it up.  
	And then, slowly:

				MELANIE
		But... it isn't dark, Annie.  There's 
		a full moon.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE

	as Annie, stooping, looks up at her. On their puzzlement and 
	consternation:

							  FADE OUT

	FADE IN

	HIGH SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE The place is decorated with 
	balloons strung from the house to various points on the lawn. 
	The children, in party clothes, with their parents, are 
	clustered around a long folding table upon which are 
	sandwiches, ice cream and soft drinks. The parents are either 
	helping the children to more or telling them they are having 
	too much. There is a general SOUND of kid's CHATTER and 
	LAUGHTER. Coming up the sloping path, away from the party, 
	are Melanie and Mitch. The CAMERA PANS them UP the slope and 
	away from the party in background. As they turn the hairpin 
	bend of the slope, and come up toward the CAMERA, we see the 
	entrance of the harbor and the Pacific in the background. 
	The CAMERA PANS them as they come near to us and, once more, 
	the party is in the background. Mitch and Melanie pass the 
	CAMERA out to the left.

	CLOSER SHOT - THE TOP OF THE DUNES

	Melanie and Mitch come INTO the picture from the right and 
	stand against the sky. Mitch takes a martini shaker from one 
	of his pockets, and two glasses from the other. He hands one 
	of the glasses to Melanie, and then pours.

				MELANIE
		I really shouldn't have any more.  
		I'm a little tipsy already.

				MITCH
		I'm trying to get you to stay for 
		dinner. We're going to have a lot of 
		roast left over.

				MELANIE
		I couldn't possibly. I have to get 
		back.

				MITCH
			(with a shrug)
		Cheers.

				MELANIE
		Cheers.

	They drink.

				MELANIE
		What's in this? Nitro-glycerin?

				MITCH
		Why do you have to rush off? What's 
		so important in San Francisco?

				MELANIE
		Well... I have to get to work tomorrow 
		morning, for one thing.

				MITCH
			(surprised)
		You have a job?

				MELANIE
			(sipping at the martini)
		I have several jobs.

				MITCH
		What do you do?

				MELANIE
		I do different things on different 
		days.

				MITCH
		Like what?

				MELANIE
			(hesitating)
		On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work 
		for the Travelers' Aid. At the 
		airport.

				MITCH
		Helping travelers.

				MELANIE
		Yes.

	She hesitates for a moment, thinking. She has never really 
	considered before what she does with her time, and now that 
	she is accounting for it, it sounds a little meaningless and 
	unimportant.

				MELANIE
		And on Tuesdays, I take a course in 
		General Semantics at Berkeley.  That's 
		not a job, of course. I just take it 
		because...

				MITCH
		What about Thursdays and Fridays?

				MELANIE
		On Thursdays I have my meeting and 
		lunch.
			(pause)
		I'm chairman of a group that's sending 
		a little Korean boy through school.  
		We plan how to raise funds and... 
		things like that.
			(she shrugs)

				MITCH
		And Fridays? What do you do then?

				MELANIE
		Nothing.
			(she smiles)
		I go to bird shops on Fridays.

				MITCH
		I'm glad you do.

				MELANIE
		Do you know what I was doing in that 
		shop?

				MITCH
		What?

				MELANIE
		I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. 
		She's seventy years old, and veddy 
		prim and strait-laced.
			(she does an imitation)
		She's coming back from Europe at the 
		end of the month, and I'm going to 
		give her a myna bird that'll talk to 
		her.

				MITCH
		What'll it say?

				MELANIE
			(facetiously)
		You'll think me very bold, sir.

				MITCH
		No, tell me.

	She leans over and whispers in his ear. They both burst out 
	LAUGHTER. But then suddenly, a very serious look comes into 
	Melanie's face.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	serious, introspective.

				MELANIE
		That's silly, isn't it?  Teaching a 
		bird to shock my aunt. That's just 
		silly and childish.
			(slight pause)
		Maybe I ought to go join the other 
		children.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	as she moves abruptly away from him, and starts toward where 
	the children have begun playing Blind Man's Bluff. Mitch 
	stares after her for a moment, moved by this sudden glimpse 
	of character, and then follows her down the dune. The children 
	are all in a circle. Annie is busy changing the blindfold 
	from Michele to Cathy.

	CAMERA PANS - MELANIE AND MITCH

	The CAMERA is now on the lawn POINTING UP toward dunes. We 
	see Mitch and Melanie descending. They are coming down by 
	way of a short cut and are not on the zig-zag path. As they 
	reach the lawn they move along the side of it at the foot of 
	the dunes. They are absorbed in each other. The CAMERA PANS 
	OFF them and BRING INTO the picture Annie, surrounded by the 
	children. She is in the act of changing the blindfold from 
	Michele to Cathy. She hands Michele her glasses back.  During 
	this, and while she is putting the blindfold round the eyes 
	of Cathy, she is looking to her right and obviously is 
	watching Mitch and Melanie.

	MITCH AND MELANIE - ANNIE'S P.O.V.

	MED. SHOT - ANNIE

	CAMERA MOVES A LITTLE to her left (CAMERA RIGHT). At this 
	moment, in the background, Lydia is emerging with the birthday 
	cake. The candles on it are unlit. Lydia immediately also 
	catches sight of Mitch and Melanie and she slows up somewhat 
	as she walks to the long table, her eyes still on the couple. 
	During this we see Annie in the foreground sending Cathy 
	off.

				ANNIE
		All right then, here we go.
			(she spins her)
		Once!
			(she spins her again)
		Twice!
			(she spins her again)
		Three! Go get 'em, Cathy!

	She says all this while still looking toward the couple. She 
	turns her head away from the couple with a new expression on 
	her face. She twists completely around to look at Lydia as 
	though she were wondering if Lydia sees what she sees.  
	Suddenly we HEAR a little boy's voice crying:

				LITTLE BOY (O.S.)
		Look! Look!

	Annie swings round and the CAMERA RUSHES INTO her face as 
	she looks up.

	LONG SHOT - ANNIE'S P.O.V.

	A gull is swooping down.

	CLOSE SHOT - CATHY

	as she changes her tactics, stops dead, and then cautiously 
	reaches out in front of her at the air. The gull suddenly 
	swoops at her, hitting her shoulder. She whirls.

				CATHY
		No touching allowed!

	She almost falls.

	FULL SHOT - THE GULL

	seen from Cathy's position. He flies off, cycles and then 
	returns.

	CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE

	reacting to gull. She turns her head back to Cathy.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	reacting to the gull hitting Cathy. They start towards Cathy.

	MED. SHOT - ANNIE

	with Cathy and the children around. The CAMERA PANS DOWN as 
	she ducks with two gulls swooping by.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	hurriedly putting the cake onto the table. She rushes round 
	to the front of it.

	FULL SHOT - ANNIE - LYDIA'S P.O.V.

	Annie rising from the ground. Cathy and the other children 
	are running in the background.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	reacting to two more gulls diving.

	FULL SHOT - TWO GULLS - LYDIA'S P.O.V.

	diving toward the children.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	She starts to run out CAMERA RIGHT.

	MED. SHOT - LYDIA REACHES CATHY

	She pushes her to the ground as a gull attacks.

	TWO SHOT - TWO MOTHERS

	as a gull swoops between them.

	FULL SHOT - MITCH

	coming out of the house with a broom.

	TWO GULLS

	swooping down at the children's heads.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	swinging at gull and missing.

	LONG SHOT - LITTLE BOY

	running toward bank. Gull swooping after him.

	CLOSE SHOT - LITTLE BOY

	falling forward against the bank as the gull smashes into 
	him.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	running to the injured boy, who is lying against the bank.

	THREE SHOT - MELANIE, MITCH AND LITTLE BOY

	They look up.

	LONG SHOT - THE GULLS

	against the sky, flying away in formation.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	about to swing with the broom again, but the birds are no 
	longer there. A puzzled look crosses his face. He turns to 
	Melanie.

				MITCH
		Are you all right?

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

				MELANIE
		Yes.

				ANNIE
			(coming over)
		That's the darnest thing thing I've 
		ever seen in my life.

	TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH

				LYDIA
		Are they gone?

				MITCH
		They're gone, Mother.

	FULL SHOT - THE LAWN

	as the children begin drifting back toward the table and the 
	cake. There is the curious feeling of lighting having struck 
	very close by without having injured anyone. All that 
	adrenaline has boiled up, and now it has no place to go.

				LYDIA
		Well... well, is everyone all right?

				MITCH
			(with a small boy)
		I think he got a little scratch, 
		Mother.

				GIRL #3
		Did you see them? They were hawks!

				GIRL #4
		They were bigger than hawks!

				ANNIE
		Children, they were only seagulls.

	And then the meaning of what she has just said strikes her, 
	and she remembers the bird hitting her door the night before.

	TWO SHOT - ANNIE AND MELANIE

	as Annie turns to look at her and they exchange a silent 
	meaningful glance.

	BACK TO SCENE

				CATHY
		They must have been after the food, 
		Mother.

	They all turn toward the table.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE TABLE AND THE REST OF THE FOOD ON THE TABLE, 
	UNDISTURBED CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	eyes narrowed.

				MITCH
		They didn't touch anything.

	BACK TO SCENE

				ANNIE
			(trying to restore 
			order)
		Well, they're gone now, so... so 
		let's...
			(pause)
		Who was 'it?' You were 'it,' weren't 
		you, Cathy?

				GIRL #2
		Can I be 'it,' Miss Hayworth?

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	as Annie and the children begin the game behind them.

				MITCH
		You look a little shaken.

				MELANIE
		I... I am.
			(pause)
		Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, 
		is it? The gull yesterday when I was 
		in the boat, and the one last night 
		at Annie's, and now...

				MITCH
		Last night? What do you mean?

				MELANIE
		A gull smashed into Annie's front 
		door.
			(pause)
		Mitch... what's happening?

				MITCH
			(concerned)
		I don't know, Melanie.
			(pause)
		Look, do you have to go back to 
		Annie's?

				MELANIE
		No, I have my things in the car.

				MITCH
			(gently)
		Then stay and have something to eat 
		before you start back. I'd feel a 
		lot better.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	She nods, and then looks up at the sky. Suddenly she shudders.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH'S HANDS - DINING ROOM INT. IN BACKGROUND 

	He is slicing the leftover roast beef.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	putting the meat onto plate, turning over his shoulder to 
	call into living room. The lovebirds in their cage are making 
	a terrible racket.

				MITCH
		Do you want some mustard with this?

				MELANIE (O.S.)
		No, thank you.

				CATHY
			(coming from kitchen)
		Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?

				MITCH
		She said something about having to 
		get home to take a call from her 
		mother back East.

				CATHY
		Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?

				MITCH
		Take it into the living room, would 
		you, hon?

				CATHY
			(seeing the birds)
		What's the matter with them?

	Lydia turns from a side table, where she is cutting some 
	French bread.

				LYDIA
		What's the matter with all the birds?

	She covers the cage. Under the cover, the birds are still 
	tweeting madly. Lydia stares at the covered cage for a moment, 
	and then signs heavily.

				LYDIA
		Hurry up with the rest, Mitch. I'm 
		sure Miss Daniels wants to get on 
		her way.

	As she moves into the living room.

				CATHY
		I think you ought to stay the night,

	INT. LIVING ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

				MITCH
			(coming in with two

		That road can be a bad one at night, 
		Melanie.
			(he picks up coffee 
			cup, hands it to 
			Melanie)

	They are now all eating with plates on their knees - buffet 
	style.

				MELANIE
		If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll 
		come onto the freeway much earlier.

				LYDIA
			(picking up a cup)
		Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted, 
		isn't it, Mitch?

				MITCH
		Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that 
		traffic going back to San Francisco.

				CATHY
		Did you put the cover on that cage, 
		Mom?

				LYDIA
		Yes, I did.

				CATHY
		Just listen to them!

				MITCH
			(to Melanie)
		Some cream?

				MELANIE
		I'll get it.

	She reaches over for the cream pitcher. Her eye is caught by 
	something in the fireplace.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	looking curiously.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE FIREPLACE

	a single swift is sitting on the hearth.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	INT. BRENNER LIVING ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - A HAND

	reaching down to pick up a dead bird.

	MED. SHOT - AL MALONE, THE DEPUTY

	a plain man with a limited intelligence, used to giving out 
	speeding tickets or warning drunks. He holds the bird on the 
	palm of his hand, looks at it steadily, nodding all the while.

				MALONE
		That's a chimney swift, all right.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

				MITCH
		We know what it is, Al.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

	Lydia is huddled in one of the easy chairs, still in shock.

				MALONE
		Well, these birds live in chimneys, 
		you know.

				MITCH
		Not by the thousands.

				MALONE
		No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.
			(pause)
		Did you have a light burning or 
		something.

				MITCH
		Yes, but the curtains were drawn.

				MALONE
		'Cause sometimes birds are attracted 
		by light, you know.
			(pause)
		Sure is a peculiar thing.

				MITCH
		What are we going to do about it, 
		Al?

				MALONE
		I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do 
		about what?

				MITCH
		Well...
			(he feels a little 
			foolish)
		Well... these birds attacked us.

	CLOSE SHOT - MALONE

	slight disbelief on his face.

				MALONE
		What's more likely, they got in the 
		room and was just panicked, that's 
		all.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

				MITCH
			(still a little 
			hesitant)
		All right, I'll grant you a bird'll 
		panic in an enclosed room. But, they 
		didn't just get in. They came in! 
		Right down that chimney.

	TWO SHOT - MITCH AND MALONE

				MALONE
			(trying to make sense 
			of this)
		My wife found a bird in the back 
		seat of her car once.

				MALONE
			(shrugs)
		Didn't know how he got in there.  
		Had a broken leg, turned out. Just 
		fluttering all around there.
			(he shrugs again)

				MITCH
		These birds were...

				MALONE
		What I'm trying to say, Mitch, is 
		these things happen sometimes, you 
		know? Ain't much we can do about it.
			(he shrugs)

				LYDIA
		Tell him about the party.

				MITCH
		That's right. We had a party here 
		this afternoon for Cathy. Her 
		birthday.

				MALONE
		Oh, yeah, yeah.
			(he grins)
		How old is she now?

				MITCH
		Eleven. In the middle of the party, 
		some gulls came down at the children. 
		And Miss Daniels was attacked by a 
		gull just yesterday after...

	CLOSE SHOT - MALONE

	considering this.

				MALONE
		Yeah.
			(thinking)
		Were the kids bothering them or 
		something? 'Cause sometimes they'll 
		do that, you know. If you make any 
		kind of disturbance near them, they'll 
		just come after you. I seen that 
		plenty of times myself.

	TWO SHOT - MALONE AND LYDIA

				LYDIA
		The children were playing a game, 
		Al. Those gulls attacked without...

				MALONE
		Now, Lydia, 'attack' is a pretty 
		strong word, don't you think? I mean, 
		birds just don't go around attacking 
		people without no reason, you know 
		what I mean? The kids just probably 
		scared them, that's all.

				LYDIA
		These birds attacked!

				MALONE
			(nodding)
		Well, what would you like me to do, 
		Lydia? Put out a pick up and hold on 
		any suspicious birds in the area?
			(he smiles)
		Now, that'd be pretty silly, wouldn't 
		it?

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

				MITCH
		Does this room look silly?

	TWO SHOT - MITCH AND MALONE

				MALONE
		No, you got quite a mess here, I'll 
		admit that.
			(pause)
		Maybe you oughta put some screening 
		on top of your chimney
			(pause)
		Seems a little pointless, though.  
		Freak accident like this wouldn't 
		happen again in a million years.
			(pause)
		You want some help cleaning up?

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	exasperated.

				MITCH
		I can handle it myself.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	giving a small moan.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

				MELANIE
		I'll take Cathy up to bed.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

				MITCH
		Are you staying?

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

				MELANIE
		I think I should, don't you?

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	observing, making no comment.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	putting her arm around Cathy's shoulders.

				MELANIE
		I'll get my things from the car. Do 
		you want to walk with me, Cathy?

	TWO SHOT - MITCH AND MALONE

	as Cathy and Melanie go out.

				MALONE
		Well, if there's anything else I can 
		do, Mitch...

				MITCH
		Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.

				MALONE
		Goodnight, Lydia.

	No answer.

				MALONE
		Sure is peculiar, I got to say that 
		for it.

	He exits.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

	It is silent. Mitch looks across at Lydia who sits as still 
	as a stone in her chair. The door closes gently on a note of 
	utter helplessness.

							  FADE OUT

	FADE IN

	INT. BEDROOM IN BRENNER HOUSE - MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	Melanie has just gotten out of bed. She is wearing the rather 
	unsophisticated nightdress she brought at the store.  Her 
	hair is loose. She wears no makeup. She is bent over a 
	lavatory which has been installed in the bedroom. She is 
	busily brushing her teeth. Her head half turns as she HEARS 
	VOICES.

	 

				LYDIA'S VOICE
		Mitch! Mitch! Mitch, I'm going to 
		drop Cathy off now.

				MITCH'S VOICE
		Okay.

				LYDIA'S VOICE
		I'll probably drive over to the 
		Fawcett farm. Do you need anything 
		in town?

				MITCH'S VOICE
		No.

	Melanie finished brushing her teeth. She goes to the window 
	and looks out. Outside, we HEAR the SOUND of the pickup truck 
	starting.

	FULL SHOT - THE YARD BELOW - MELANIE'S P.O.V.

	as Cathy, carrying her schoolbooks, runs to the pickup truck 
	and climbs in. The truck moves out of the yard and down the 
	road. It turns the bend, and moves out of sight.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	turning from the window. She goes to the bedroom door, CAMERA 
	FOLLOWING. She opens the door.

				MELANIE
		Mitch?

	There is no answer.

				MELANIE
		Mitch?

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	coming down the steps from the attic room. The house is empty. 
	The CAMERA FOLLOWS her into the dining room, where she stops 
	at the cage of lovebirds, bends down to them with a smile on 
	her face.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE AND THE BIRDS

	She smiles and pokes her finger into the cage. The birds 
	TWEET at her.

				MELANIE
			(imitating them)
		Chee-chee-chee-chee-chee.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	leaving the cage. She walks to the sideboard upon which is 
	an electric coffee percolator which is plugged into the wall.  
	She feels it with her hand. It is hot. She pours a cup, then 
	peers out of the side window.

	LONG SHOT - MELANIE'S P.O.V.

	Mitch on the shore, working with a rake in his hands. A thin 
	column of smoke is climbing the sky.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	carrying the cup of coffee. She sets it down for a moment to 
	put on her fur coat, which is hanging on the hall stand. She 
	picks up the cup again, walks to the front door and EXITS.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	coming out of the house and into the garden, carrying the 
	cup of coffee. It is a beautiful day. She sips at her coffee 
	and then breathes deeply of the air.

	CLOSE SHOT - HER FACE

	fresh, rested. There is a contentment in her which we have 
	not seen before. She looks off toward the shore.

	LONG SHOT - MITCH

	on the shore, working with the rake. The thin column of smoke 
	is climbing the sky.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	She turns her attention away from Mitch, and walks to the 
	end of the garden toward the shore. A wind is blowing off 
	the water, moving white puffs of cloud swiftly across the 
	sky, whipping the full short shirt of muumuu about her legs 
	as she walks. She stands there silhouetted against the sky 
	for a moment.

	SLOW PAN

	as Melanie scans the horizon. There isn't a bird anywhere in 
	sight. The day is still and clear, but somehow ominous in 
	its silence. Her gaze comes to rest on Mitch and the thin 
	column of smoke again. In the distance, Mitch sees her and 
	raises his arm in greeting. She waves back at him. He puts 
	the rake down and begins walking toward the house.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	There is anticipation on her face now. She watches Mitch 
	coming toward her, her eyes glowing.

	FULL SHOT - MITCH

	closer to the house now.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	waiting, anticipating.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	He stops, looks at her, and then turns toward the house.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	as first surprised, and then puzzled. The back screen DOOR 
	CLATTERS shut off screen. A small hurt look crosses her face.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	as she turns away from the house and begins walking in the 
	garden, sipping idly at her coffee. A screen DOOR CLATTERS 
	again. She turns.

	Mitch is coming out of the house, from the front door, wearing 
	a different shirt, buttoning it as he walks to her.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

				MITCH
		I wanted to change my shirt.

	Melanie is uncomprehending.

				MITCH
		It smelled of the fire.

				MELANIE
			(nodding)
		It's hard to believe anything at all 
		happened yesterday, isn't it? It's 
		so beautiful and still now.
			(pause; then sagely)
		I think I've got it all figured out, 
		by the way.

				MITCH
		Really? Tell me about it.

				MELANIE
			(secretively)
		It's an uprising.

				MITCH
		Of birds?

				MELANIE
		Certainly, of birds.

	Mitch grins.

				MELANIE
		It all started several months ago 
		with a peasant sparrow up in the 
		hills, a malcontent. He went around 
		telling all the other sparrows that 
		human beings weren't fit to rule 
		this planet, preaching wherever anyone 
		would listen...

				MITCH
		Growing a beard...

				MELANIE
			(delighted)
		Yes, of course, he had to have a 
		beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' 
		he kept saying, over and over...

				MITCH
		So they united.

				MELANIE
		Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows 
		out for kicks...

				MITCH
		Well, they'll go along with anything.

				MELANIE
		Sure. But eventually, even the more 
		serious-minded birds began to listen.  
		"Why should humans rule?" they asked
		 themselves.

				MITCH
		Hear!

				MELANIE
		Why should we submit ourselves to 
		their domination?

				MITCH
		Hear, hear!

				MELANIE
		And all the while, that sparrow was 
		getting in his little messages.  
		Birds of the world, unite!

				MITCH
		Take wing!

				MELANIE
		You have nothing to lose but your 
		feathers.

	They both burst out laughing, then fall into silence, then 
	laugh again and finally are silent. The garden is deathly 
	still.

				MITCH
			(attempting to be 
			serious)
		What it was, probably...

				MELANIE
		Mmm?

				MITCH
		They're probably hungry, that's all.  
		This was a bad summer. They eat 
		berries and... and nuts, you know, 
		and the hills are all burned out, so 
		they're probably searching for food 
		wherever they can get it.

				MELANIE
		With my little sparrow leading team.

	She laughs, and Mitch joins her, but it is hollow this time.  
	Like children who have told themselves a too realistic horror 
	story, they are becoming a little frightened.

				MITCH
		It's so damn quiet out there.

				MELANIE
		It was like that yesterday.

				MITCH
		What do you mean?

				MELANIE
		After the gulls attacked.

				MITCH
		I hadn't thought of that.
			(pause)
		And then the swifts came.

				MELANIE
		It makes you feel as if they're... 
		they're waiting or... resting... 
		or....

				MITCH
			(trying to make it 
			light again)
		No, they're having a meeting, Melanie. 
		Your sparrow is standing on a soap 
		box and...

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	her face dead serious.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

				MITCH
		...waving his little wings...

	His voice trails. His face becomes serious, too. Again, the 
	garden is silent.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	her face set and grim, her eyes serious, her words coming 
	slowly and with the chill of horror on them.

				MELANIE
		They were angry, Mitch. They came 
		out of the chimney in fury.
			(pause)
		I had the feeling they wanted each 
		and every one of us dead.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	He takes her in his arms suddenly, to comfort her. She goes 
	to him longingly.

				MITCH
		Melanie, Melanie...

				MELANIE
		I'm frightened, Mitch.

				MITCH
		No, no...

				MELANIE
		I'm frightened and confused and I... 
		I think I want to go back to San 
		Francisco where there are buildings 
		and... and concrete and...

				MITCH
		Melanie...

				MELANIE
		...everything I know.

	She looks up at him suddenly.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

				MELANIE
		Oh damn it, why did you have to walk 
		into that shop?

	They kiss suddenly and fiercely. On their kiss,

	EXT. FAWCETT FARM - FULL SHOT - THE RED PICKUP TRUCK

	Lydia at the wheel, pulling into the Fawcett farm, the name 
	of the farm clearly visible on a painted arch over the gate.  
	Lydia gets out of the truck and walks to the front door. She 
	knocks. There is no answer.

	MED. SHOT - LYDIA

				LYDIA
		Dan?

	She comes down off the steps, the CAMERA FOLLOWING, back a 
	little away from the house.

				LYDIA
		Dan?

	There is no answer. She shades her eyes and looks out over 
	the fields.

	LONG SHOT - FARMHAND ON TRACTOR

	FULL SHOT - THE BARNYARD

	as Lydia crosses to a fence and cups her hands to her mouth.

				LYDIA
			(shouting)
		Hi, there!

	LONG SHOT - THE FARMHAND

	He stops the tractor, turns toward Lydia, shading his eyes.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

				LYDIA
			(shouting)
		Is Mr. Fawcett home?

	LONG SHOT - THE FARMHAND

				FARMHAND
			(shouting back)
		I think so, ma'm. His missus is in

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

				LYDIA
		Have you seen him this morning?

	LONG SHOT - THE FARMHAND FARMHAND

	No, ma'm. I reckon he's in there, though.

	MED. SHOT - LYDIA

				LYDIA
			(shouting it)
		Thank you!

	FULL SHOT - LYDIA

	as she crosses the barnyard again. There are several chickens 
	scurrying about. She walks closer to them, sees an open bag 
	of feed lying against the fence.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	getting an idea.

	MED. SHOT - LYDIA

	reaching into the bag of feed. She scatters some on the 
	ground.

				LYDIA
		Here, chick, chick, chick, chick.  
		Here, chick, chick, chick, chick.

	CLOSE SHOT - A CHICKEN

	He struts up to the scattered grain.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	watching him.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE CHICKEN

	He seems to be examining the feed. Then he turns away from 
	it and struts off.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	a small knowledgeable nod of her head. The chicken's reaction 
	strengthens her determination to talk to Fawcett.  She turns.

	FULL SHOT - LYDIA

	approaching the front door again. She knocks. No answer.

				LYDIA
		Dan?

	She backs away from the house again. The barnyard is silent.  
	In the distance, we can HEAR the SOUND of the tractor.

				LYDIA
		Dan? Are you home?

	No answer.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	a little annoyed. She glances at the ground floor window 
	closest to the door.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE WINDOW

	A small pane of glass is broken.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	puzzled.

	FULL SHOT - LYDIA

	going to the front door, trying the knob.

	MED. SHOT - LYDIA

	The door opening ahead of her as she pokes her head into the 
	house.

				LYDIA
		Dan?

	The house is still and silent.

	INT. THE ENTRY HALL - FULL SHOT

	as Lydia comes in. We can see the living room off to the 
	right, but it looks normal and untouched. Lydia turns to her 
	left and looks down a long corridor.

	FULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR - LYDIA'S P.O.V.

	a door at the end of it is partially ajar, spilling artificial 
	light into the corridor.

				LYDIA
		Dan?

	No answer.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	a little troubled. She seems deciding whether or not she 
	should leave. A determined look comes over her face.

	FULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR - LYDIA'S P.O.V.

	as she walks down it slowly toward the open door at the 
	opposite end. Outside the door, she pauses.

				LYDIA
		Dan? Are you in there?

	No answer. Lydia puts out her hand, slowly begins showing 
	the door open.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	coming into the room. Her eyes begin to take in the room.

	SLOW PAN OF THE ROOM - LYDIA'S P.O.V.

	starting to the right of the doorway as she enters and 
	continuing a little below eye level, the CAMERA PICKS OUT: A 
	standing floor lamp, the shade dangling, but the light still 
	burning; a picture hanging askew on the wall, its glass 
	shattered; the window to the left of the picture, every pane 
	of glass shattered; a dresser with two stuffed birds on its 
	top; both birds have been badly damaged, the stuffing ripped 
	out of them, the head of one hanging at a crooked near 
	decapitated angle; the window to the left of the dresser, 
	all the panes shattered. The level of the CAMERA DESCENDS, 
	and begins a SLOW PAN of the floor. It PICKS OUT broken glass, 
	continues its PAN to SHOW scattered feathers, continues its 
	PAN to SHOW a broom, feathers caught in the straw, a single 
	bedroom slipper, continues to SHOW a pair of legs in pajamas, 
	one foot bare, the other slippered, and then immediately

	CLOSE SHOT - DAN FAWCETT

	His face. Covered with blood, the eyes missing from their 
	empty staring sockets.  Immediately

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	a terrified scream erupting from her mouth.

	FULL SHOT - LYDIA

	turning and running for the door. The CAMERA FOLLOWS her in 
	an unbroken headlong flight, the scream continuing as if she 
	is incapable of stopping it, as she stumbles, runs, trips 
	her way down the corridor and bursts out of the house, still 
	screaming, into the pickup truck. The engine starts, she 
	backs the truck out at breakneck speed and hits the highway,

	CAMERA FOLLOWING.  CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	at the wheel, her face stamped with terror, her eyes wide.

	FULL SHOT - THE TRUCK

	at breakneck speed, negotiating the severe curves on the 
	highway. It almost hits a small car coming from the opposite 
	direction, swerves, screeches around the curve.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	behind the wheel, unmindful of anything but flight.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROAD - LYDIA'S POV

	through the windshield, blurring past. She turns the bend 
	leading to the house. For an instant, through the windshield, 
	there is a quick glimpse of Melanie and Mitch in embrace in 
	the garden. Then the tires shriek, and the truck turns and 
	barrels into the front yard.

	FULL SHOT - MITCH

	alarmed as he runs out of the garden and toward the truck 
	just as it jerks to a stop.

	INT. BRENNER KITCHEN - MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	at the kitchen stove, taking a kettle of tea from the burner.  
	She pours it into a cup, puts the cup on a tray already set 
	with sugar and creamer. She looks up as Mitch comes into the 
	kitchen.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

				MITCH
		That was Al on the phone. He wants 
		me to meet him out at the Fawcett 
		place. Says some detectives from 
		Santa Rosa'll be there in a little 
		while.
			(pause)
		Will you be all right here?

				MELANIE
		Yes. I was just taking her in some 
		tea.

	He goes to her, puts his arms around her from behind, kisses 
	her hair. But she turns in his arms suddenly and clings to 
	him fiercely, and then buries her head in his shoulder.

				MELANIE
		Be careful. Please.

	She walks him to the door. At the door, they kiss -- a long, 
	full kiss.

	FULL SHOT -- THE KITCHEN

	as Mitch goes out. Melanie looks after him for a moment, and 
	then picks up the tray. Outside, we HEAR the SOUND of his 
	car starting. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Melanie out of the kitchen, 
	through the dining room, and to one of the bedroom doors on 
	the other side of the house. Gently, she KNOCKS.

				LYDIA (O.S.)
		Mitch?

	FULL SHOT - THE BEDROOM

	This is Lydia's room, and cluttered with the mementos of a 
	life no longer valid.  There are photographs of her dead 
	husband, souvenirs of trips taken together, bric-a-brac of 
	Mitch's childhood. Under it all, there is a distinct 
	femininity. She sits up in bed as Melanie enters, bearing 
	the tray.

				MELANIE
		No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought 
		you might like some tea.

	TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MELANIE

				LYDIA
		Oh, thank you.

	There is a long silence as Melanie puts the tray on the bed, 
	arranges the pillows behind Lydia.

				LYDIA
		Where's Mitch?

				MELANIE
		Al Malone wanted him out at the 
		Fawcett farm.

				LYDIA
		Why? Didn't Al believe my story?

				MELANIE
		He was calling from the farm, Mrs.  
		Brenner.

				LYDIA
		Then he saw.

				MELANIE
		He must have. He sent for the Santa 
		Rosa police.

				LYDIA
		What good will they do?

	She sips at the tea. There is a long awkward pause. Melanie 
	walks to the window and looks out over the bay.

				LYDIA
		Do you think Cathy's all right?

				MELANIE
		What?

				LYDIA
		Cathy. At the school.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	at the window, her face turned away from Lydia. Her expression 
	clearly shows that she doesn't know whether Cathy is all 
	right. But when she turns to Lydia, there is a comforting 
	smile on her face, and her voice is soothing.

				MELANIE
		Yes, I'm sure she's fine.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND LYDIA

				LYDIA
		Do I sound foolish to you?

				MELANIE
		No.

				LYDIA
		I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.
			(she shudders)
		They have such big windows at the 
		school.
			(pause)
		All the windows were broken. In Dan's 
		bedroom. All the windows.

				MELANIE
		Try not to think of that, Mrs.  
		Brenner.

				LYDIA
		I wish I were a stronger person.  
		There is a long awkward silence. She 
		sips at her tea reflectively.

				LYDIA
		I lost my husband four years ago, 
		you know.
			(pause)
		It's odd how you depend on someone 
		for strength, and then suddenly all 
		the strength is gone, and you're 
		alone.
			(pause)
		I'd love to relax some time. I'd 
		love to be able to sleep.
			(pause; the worried 
			look again)
		Do you think Cathy's all right?

				MELANIE
		Annie's there. She'll be all right.

				LYDIA
		I'm not this way, you know. Not 
		usually. I don't fuss and fret over 
		my children.
			(pause)
		When Frank died...
			(pause)
		You see, he knew the children, he 
		really knew them. He had the knack 
		of being able to enter into their 
		world, of becoming a part of them.  
		That's a rare talent.

				MELANIE
		Yes.

				LYDIA
		I wish I could be that way.

	There is another silence. A curious thing is happening in 
	this room. Lydia, for perhaps the first time since her 
	husband's death, is discussing it with another person.  
	Curiously, the person is Melanie.

				LYDIA
			(honestly and simply)
		I miss him.
			(pause)
		You know, sometimes I wake up in the 
		morning, and I think 'I have to make 
		Frank's breakfast,' and I... I get 
		up and there's a... a very good reason 
		for getting out of bed until... until, 
		of course, I remember.
			(pause)
		I miss talking to him.
			(pause)
		Cathy's a child, you know, and 
		Mitch...
			(she shrugs a little 
			sadly)
		...Mitch has his own life.
			(pause)
		I'm glad he stayed here today. I 
		feel safer with him here.
			(she sighs deeply)

				MELANIE
		Would you like to rest now, Mrs.  
		Brenner.

				LYDIA
		No.  No... don't go yet.
			(pause)
		I feel as if I... I don't understand 
		you. And I want so much to understand.

				MELANIE
		Why, Mrs. Brenner?

				LYDIA
		Because my son is...
			(pause)
		My son seems to be fond of you.
			(pause)
		And I...
			(pause)
		I'm not quite sure how I feel about 
		it. I really don't know if I... like 
		you or not.

				MELANIE
		Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner?  
		You liking me?

				LYDIA
		Yes, I think so. My son is important 
		to me. I want to like any girl he 
		chooses.

				MELANIE
		And if you don't?

				LYDIA
			(with a faint smile)
		Then I don't suppose it'll matter 
		much to anyone but me.

				MELANIE
		I think it might also matter to Mitch.

				LYDIA
			(shaking her head)
		Mitch has always done exactly what 
		he wanted to do.
			(pause)
		I'm not complaining. That's the mark 
		of a man.  But...
			(pause)
		You see, I... I wouldn't want to 
		be... be left alone. I don't think I 
		could bear being left alone.  I... 
		forgive me. This business with the 
		birds has me upset.  I... I don't 
		know what I'd do if Mitch weren't 
		here.

				MELANIE
			(going to the bed; 
			adjusting the pillow)
		Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs.  
		Brenner.

				LYDIA
			(sighing)
		I wish I were stronger.
			(she pauses and looks 
			toward the window.)
		Do you think she's all right? Do you 
		think she's safe at the school?

				MELANIE
		Would you like me to go for her?

				LYDIA
		I couldn't ask you to.

				MELANIE
		I don't mind, really.

				LYDIA
		Would you? I'd feel so much better.

				MELANIE
		I'll just clear up here, and then 
		dress.

	She picks up the tray and starts for the door.

				LYDIA
		Melanie?

	At the door, Melanie turns.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	her face soft.

				LYDIA

	her wristwatch indicating that she'll be finished in a few 
	minutes and motions for her to wait in the play-yard outside.  
	Melanie turns and starts down the corridor again.

	EXT. SCHOOL - MED. PANNING SHOT

	Melanie emerges and strolls up street toward Annie's house.  
	Inside the children are still singing.

				CHILDREN (O.S.)
		She swept the floor but once a year.  
		Ristle-tee, rostle-tee, mo, mo, mo!  
		She swore her broom was much too 
		dear. Ristle-tee, rostle-tee, hey 
		bombosity, knickety-knackety, retro-
		quo-quality, willoby-wallaby, mo, 
		mo, mo!

	CLOSE SHOT

	Melanie turns back and seats herself on seat in front of 
	play yard.

				CHILDREN (O.S.)
		She churned the butter in Dad's old 
		boot. Ristle-tee, rostle-tee, mo, 
		mo, mo!  And for a dasher she used 
		her foot.  Ristle-tee, rostle-tee, 
		hey bombosity, knickety-knackety, 
		retro-quo-quality, willoby-wallaby, 
		mo, mo, mo!

	CLOSE UP - MELANIE

	A side profile of Melanie as she sits. Size of shot has seat 
	on bottom of screen. We are shooting three-quarter toward 
	the school.

				CHILDREN (O.S.)
		The butter came out a grizzle-y- 
		ygrey.  Ristle-tee, rostle-tee, grey.  
		Mo, mo, mo!  The cheese took legs 
		and ran away!  Ristle-tee, rostle-
		tee, hey bombosity, knickety-knackety, 
		retro-quo-quality, willoby-wallaby, 
		mo, mo, mo!

	MED. SHOT - PLAY YARD

	Three-quarter angle on play yard behind Melanie. A CROW 
	alights on the Jungle Jim.

				CHILDREN (O.S.)
		I brought my wife a horse one day.  
		Ristle-tee, rostle-tee, mo, mo, mo!  
		She let the critter get away.  Ristle-
		tee, rostle-tee, hey bombosity, 
		knickety-knackety, retro-quo-quality, 
		willoby-wallaby, mo, mo, mo!

	CLOSER SHOT - MELANIE

	a nearer cut of Melanie same angle as previous. Waist shot.

	MED. SHOT - PLAY YARD

	again four more crows arrive.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	Nearer shot of Melanie smoking. Same angle. Just above waist - 
	bust shot.

	MED. SHOT - PLAY YARD

	Again five more crows arrive.

	CLOSE UP - MELANIE

	head and shoulders of Melanie as she sits smoking. There is 
	no sound except for the faint voices of the children singing 
	inside the schoolhouse. Melanie is puffing away at her 
	cigarette and occasionally glances in the direction of the 
	school. We hold on this shot of Melanie for a very long time 
	so that we are able to express her ignorance of what is going 
	on behind her with the crows. After a wait of about what 
	seems to be a half a minute or more, Melanie's attention is 
	drawn to something above her.

	MED. SHOT - SKY

	A crows is coming down.

	CLOSE UP - MELANIE

	as her eyes follow the flight of the crow.

	MED. SHOT - SKY

	Crow moving down and LEFT to RIGHT, the sky and Annie's roof 
	in the background.

	CLOSE UP - MELANIE

	Her head has twisted around to follow the flight of the crow.  
	She is almost looking into the play yard.

	MED. SHOT - PLAY YARD

	A crow slowly descends to the play yard and as the CAMERA 
	FOLLOWS it down, we see for the first time that the number 
	of crows has increased to an alarming number - almost 200 or 
	even perhaps 250. This last crow settles down with the others.

				CHILDREN (O.S.)
			(throughout preceding)
		I asked my wife to wash the floor.  
		Ristle-tee, rostle-tee, mo, mo, mo!  
		She gave me my hat and showed me the 
		door! Ristle-tee, rostle-tee, hey 
		bombosity, knickety-knackety,
		Retro-quo-quality,
			(the song slows -- it 
			is near the end)
		Willoby-wallaby, mmmmmmmo, mmmmmmmoo,
		Mo!

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE The CAMERA WHIPS UP as she leaps to her 
	feet in alarm. Her body has turned, but we are now facing 
	the opposite side of the school yard.

	CLOSER SHOT - PLAY YARD

	The play yard is full of crows.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	Big head of horrified Melanie.

	MED. SHOT - PLAY YARD

	A closer view of the menacing birds.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	Big profile of Melanie. She turns with back to CAMERA and 
	goes toward school looking at crows as she goes away. The 
	CAMERA FOLLOWS her for a few paces and then STOPS so that 
	her image becomes smaller as she goes up steps into

	EXT. PLAY YARD - DOLLY SHOT

	A side view of the crows as seen by Melanie.

	FULL SHOT - THE INTERIOR CORRIDOR

	Melanie in headlong flight toward Annie's room.

				ANNIE (O.S.)
		All right, children. Now please put 
		your books in your desks, and bring 
		the songsheets to the front of the 
		room. No one's going out to play 
		until I have all the songsheets.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

	Annie is lining the children up near the door leading to the 
	play yard.

				ANNIE
		We're not going outside until we 
		quiet down. Ralph? Did you hear me?

	The children mutter for a moment, and then are still.

				ANNIE
		All right now.

	She begins opening the play yard door. Suddenly, the door 
	from the corridor bursts open, and Melanie rushes wildly 
	INTO the room. She goes directly to Annie, shoves her out of 
	the way, and SLAMS shut the play yard door.

	CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE

				ANNIE
		wh...?

	TWO SHOT - ANNIE AND MELANIE

	against a background of children's VOICES, as they react to 
	this new excitement.

				MELANIE
		Outside.

	LONG SHOT - THE CROWS - THROUGH THE WINDOWS TWO SHOT - ANNIE 
	AND MELANIE

				MELANIE
		We've got to get the children out of 
		here. These big windows... there's 
		no way to board them up.

	Annie gives a quick nod, understanding immediately.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

	Through the windows, we can see the waiting crows. One moves 
	restlessly into flight, then settles on the equipment again.

				ANNIE
		Quiet down, children! Quiet down!

	The children modulate into silence.

				ANNIE
		Miss Daniels wants to see how we 
		conduct ourselves during a fire drill. 
		I'd like you to...

				CHILDREN
			(grumbling in Unison)
		A fire drill? This is our play period, 
		Miss Hayworth! Gee whiz!  Etc.

				ANNIE
		I'd like you to show her how quiet 
		and obedient you can be.

	The children again fall silent.

				ANNIE
		We're going to go out of the school 
		now. Those of you who live nearby 
		can go directly home. I want the 
		rest of you to go down the hill, all 
		the way to the hotel. Do you 
		understand?

				CHILDREN
		All the way down the hill? Gee, Miss 
		Hayworth, we never... Home? Why do 
		we...?

				ANNIE
			(shushing them)
		I want you to go as quietly as you 
		can, not a sound, until I tell you 
		to run. And then I want you to run 
		as fast as you can. Does everyone 
		understand?
			(pause - silence)
		All right. John, would you lead the 
		class, please?

	The children walk two-by-two to the corridor door. John opens 
	it, and they begin filing out. Melanie turns to look at the 
	play yard.

	CLOSE SHOT - A SINGLE CROW

	fluttering at the window, almost in exploration. He hangs 
	there for a moment, then wings back to the playground 
	equipment.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

				MELANIE
			(whispering)
		Hurry!

	CLOSE SHOT - (12)

	A low angle of five or six crows filling the screen.

	EXT. PLAY YARD

	The screen is filled with crows. About fifty or more. All of 
	a sudden we HEAR the distant PATTERING of children's feet as 
	they start running. Immediately the crows rise and the CAMERA 
	PANS UP with them into the sky.

							  DISSOLVE

	INT. THE TIDES - FULL SHOT

	It is lunchtime and there is a busy bustle to the place as 
	DEKE CARTER officiates behind the bar and HELEN CARTER, his 
	wife, rushes back and forth between diners at the tables. A 
	DRUNK sits at the bar, old, grizzled, the weary wisdom of 
	booze in him. In one of the booths sits SEBASTIAN SHOLES in 
	his shirt sleeves, eating a hurried lunch quickly and 
	efficiently. A WOMAN and TWO CHILDREN are seated at another 
	table, about to order. A party of noisy SALESMAN is laughing 
	and clowning around throughout following at a table in the 
	rear. The phone from behind the bar has been placed on the 
	counter, and Melanie is speaking into it while Deke listens.  
	Over her head, the television set is blasting with its 
	perennial Western, the gun shots punctuating her conversation.

				MELANIE
		Daddy, there were hundreds of them.  
		No, I'm not hysterical, I'm trying 
		to tell you this as calmly as I know 
		how. All right, Daddy. Yes Daddy.
			(she takes a deep 
			breath)
		Just now.  Not... fifteen minutes 
		ago.

	The door to the Tides opens and MRS. BUNDY, sixtyish, wearing 
	walking shoes and a tweed suit, a very masculine-looking 
	woman with short clipped white hair, comes in, passes through 
	foreground, goes to bar, her attention slowly caught by what 
	Melanie is saying.

				MELANIE
		At the school. No, I don't. Just a 
		minute.
			(to Deke)
		What's the name of the school?

				DEKE
		Just the Bodega Bay School.
			(to Mrs. Bundy)
		Help you, Mrs. Bundy?

				MRS. BUNDY
		I need some change, Mr. Carter.

	As Deke opens cash register...

				MELANIE
		The Bodega Bay School.
			(to Deke)
		Could you turn that down, please?

	Deke gives Mrs. Bundy her change, turns off television.

				MELANIE
		I don't know how many children.
		Thirty or forty. Yes.

	Mrs. Bundy goes to cigarette machine, pauses to listen to 
	Melanie.

				MELANIE
		No, the birds didn't attack until 
		the children were outside the school. 
		Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. 
		Is there a difference between crows 
		and blackbirds?

				MRS. BUNDY
			(turning from machine)
		There is very definitely a difference, 
		Miss.

				MELANIE
		They're different, Daddy.
			(to Mrs. Bundy)
		Thank you.
			(into phone)
		I think these were crows. Yes, 
		hundreds of them. Yes, they attacked 
		the children, attacked them.
			(exasperated)
		Daddy, a little girl was sent to the 
		hospital in Santa Rosa. Well, all 
		right, but you act as if I'm... all 
		right, all right.
			(pause)
		No, I can't come home now. I just 
		can't, Daddy. How is it there? I 
		mean... are there birds? In the sky?  
		But no trouble. Well, I hope...
			(pause)
		I don't know when. I simply can't 
		leave now. Tell Mother not to worry.  
		All right, Daddy, good-by.

	She hangs up. Mrs. Bundy is at her elbow.

				MRS. BUNDY
		They're both perching birds, of 
		course, but of quite different 
		species. The crow is brachyrhynchos. 
		The blackbird is cyanocephalus.

				MELANIE
		Thank you.
			(to Deke)
		Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?

				DEKE
		In the book right here, Miss.

	As Melanie looks it up...

				DEKE
			(to Mrs. Bundy)
		I don't see what difference it makes, 
		Mrs. Bundy, crows or blackbirds. If 
		they attacked the school, that's 
		pretty serious.

				MRS. BUNDY
			(with a superior smile)
		I hardly think either species would 
		have the intelligence to launch a 
		massed attack. Their brain pans aren't 
		large enough for such...

				MELANIE
			(dialing)
		I just came from the school, madam.  
		I don't know about their brain pans 
		but...

				MRS. BUNDY
		Birds are not aggressive creatures, 
		Miss. They bring beauty to the world. 
		It is mankind, rather, who...

				HELEN
			(going to door leading 
			to kitchen)
		Three Southern fried chicken, Sam.  
		Baked potato on all of them.

	LAUGHTER from salesman at table.

				MELANIE
			(into phone)
		Hello, may I speak to Mitch Brenner, 
		please?
			(pause)
		Yes, I'll wait.

				MRS. BUNDY
			(continuing to Deke)
		...insist on making it difficult for 
		life to survive on this planet. If 
		it weren't for birds...

				DEKE
		Mrs. Bundy, you don't seem to 
		understand. This young lady says 
		there was an attack on the school.

				MRS. BUNDY
		Impossible.

				MELANIE
			(in background)
		Mitch? I'm glad I caught you.  
		Something terrible has happened.

	Her background conversation continues through following:

				DRUNK
			(suddenly)
		It's the end of the world!

				HELEN
		What's this about the school?

				DEKE
		Bunch of crows attacked the school, 
		Helen.

				DRUNK
		It's the end of the world.
			(suddenly quoting)
		"Thus saith the Lord God to the 
		mountains, and to the hills, to the 
		rivers and to the valleys; Behold, 
		I, even I, will bring a sword upon 
		you, and I will destroy your high 
		places.

				HELEN
		The Lord's not destroying anything, 
		Jason.

				DRUNK
		"In all your dwelling places, the 
		cities shall be laid waste, and the 
		high places shall be laid waste!"
			(he nods)
		Ezekiel, Chapter six.

				HELEN
			(quoting)
		"Woe unto them that rise up early in 
		the morning that they may follow 
		strong drink."

				DRUNK
			(nodding)
		Isaiah, Chapter 5. It's the end of 
		the world.

				MELANIE
		Yes, all right, I'll wait for you.  
		Good-by.
			(she hangs up)

				MRS. BUNDY
			(laughing)
		I hardly think a few birds are going 
		to bring about the end of the world.

				MELANIE
			(turning to her)
		These weren't a few birds.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE WOMAN AND THE CHILDREN

	waiting for their lunch, listening to the conversation; 
	becoming very nervous.

	BACK TO SCENE

				DEKE
		I didn't even know there were many 
		crows in Bodega Bay this time of 
		year.

				MRS. BUNDY
		The crow is a permanent resident 
		throughout its range. In fact, during 
		our Christmas Count, we recorded...

	CLOSE SHOT - SHOLES

	eating.

				SHOLES
			(suddenly, from his 
			table)
		How many gulls did you count, Mrs.  
		Bundy?

	BACK TO SCENE

				MRS. BUNDY
		Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are 
		several varieties.

				SHOLES
		The ones that've been raising the 
		devil with my fishing boats.

				MRS. BUNDY
		Probably herring gulls. They arrive 
		in November, you know, and don't 
		migrate North again until March or...

				MELANIE
			(leaping upon this)
		Have you had trouble with gulls?

				SHOLES
		One of my boats did last week.

				DEKE
			(making a connection)
		This young lady got hit by a gull 
		only Saturday.

				SAM'S VOICE
			(from kitchen)
		Pick up the chicken.

				HELEN
		Now it's gulls. A minute ago, it was 
		crows.
			(she picks up tray, 
			shrugs, goes to table)
		Deke, I'm still waiting for those 
		Bloody Marys!

				DEKE
		Coming right up!

	CLOSE SHOT - WOMAN

	as Helen brings food. She is beginning to get really 
	frightened.

				WOMAN
		Could you ask them to lower their 
		voices, please? They're frightening 
		the children.

				LITTLE GIRL
		Timmy has a canary.

				HELEN
		That's nice. Are you Timmy?

				LITTLE BOY
		My cousin is Timmy.

	BACK TO SCENE

				SAM'S VOICE
			(leaving table, coming 
			to bar)
		A whole flock of gulls nearby capsized 
		one of my boats.  Practically tore 
		of the skipper's arm.

				HELEN
			(coming back)
		You're scaring the kids. Keep it 
		low.

				DEKE
		You're scaring me, too. Are you trying 
		to say all these...
			(he shakes his head)
		That sounds impossible, Sebastian.

				SHOLES
		I'm only telling you what happened 
		to my boat.

				MRS. BUNDY
		The gulls were after your fish, Mr.  
		Sholes. Really, let's be logical 
		about this.

				MELANIE
		What were the crows after at the 
		school?

				MRS. BUNDY
		What do you think they were after, 
		Miss...?

				MELANIE
		Daniels. I think they were after the 
		children.

				MRS. BUNDY
		For what purpose?

				MELANIE
		To...
			(she hesitates)
		To kill them.

	There is a long silence.

				MRS. BUNDY
		Why?

	Another silence.

				MELANIE
		I don't know why.

				MRS. BUNDY
		I thought not. Birds have been on 
		this planet since archaeopteryx, 
		Miss Daniels; a hundred and twenty 
		million years ago!

	A TRAVELING SALESMAN ENTERS, goes to bar, listens.

				MRS. BUNDY
		Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait 
		all that time to start a... a war 
		against humanity?

				MELANIE
		No one called it a war!

				SALESMAN
		Scotch, light on the water.

				MRS. BUNDY
		You and Mr. Sholes seem to be implying 
		as much.

				HELEN
		Are you finished here, Sebastian?

				SHOLES
		Let me have some apple pie, Helen.
			(to Mrs. Bundy)
		Who said anything about war? All I 
		said was that some gulls...

				HELEN
			(yelling to kitchen)
		One apple pie! You want more coffee?

				SHOLES
		No. ...came down on one of my boats.  
		They could have been after the fish, 
		just as you said.

				SALESMAN
		Your captain should have shot at 
		them.

				SHOLES
		What?

				SALESMAN
		Gulls are scavengers, anyway. Most 
		birds are. If you ask me, we should 
		wipe them all out. World would be 
		better off without them.

				MRS. BUNDY
			(outraged)
		Birds?

				SALESMAN
		Yeah, birds. All they do is make a 
		mess of everything. Who needs them?

				MRS. BUNDY
		We need them.

				SALESMAN
		Not if they're starting a war.

				MRS. BUNDY
		They are incapable of organized 
		warfare!

				MELANIE
		Have you ever seen a jay protecting 
		a nest?

				MRS. BUNDY
		I have seen jays doing everything it 
		is conceivable for jays to do.  
		Ornithology happens to be my 
		avocation, Miss Daniels. You're 
		talking about preservation of the 
		species, a hen protecting her young.  
		There's a vast difference between...

				MELANIE
		Maybe they're all protecting the 
		species. Maybe they're tired of being 
		shot at and roasted in ovens and...

				MRS. BUNDY
		Are you discussing gamebirds now?  
		All birds are not gamebirds, you 
		know.

				MELANIE
		I don't know anything about birds 
		except that they're attacking this 
		town.

				SALESMAN
		Then fight back. Get yourselves guns 
		and wipe them off the face of the 
		earth.

				MRS. BUNDY
		That would hardly be possible.

				DEKE
		Why not, Mrs. Bundy?

				MRS. BUNDY
		Because there are 8,650 species of 
		birds in the world today, Mr. Carter. 
		It's estimated that five billion, 
		seven hundred and fifty million birds 
		live in the United States alone. The 
		five continents of the world...

				SALESMAN
			(muttering)
		Kill them all. Get rid of them.  
		Messy animals.

				MRS. BUNDY
		...probably contain more than a 
		hundred billion birds!

				DRUNK
		It's the end of the world!

				DEKE
		Well, we seem to have more than our 
		share of them right now, Mrs. Bundy.  
		Maybe this young lady's right.  Maybe 
		they've all gone crazy.

				HELEN
		Here's your pie, Sebastian. You want 
		it at the table?

				SHOLES
		No. Here's fine.
			(he begins eating)

				HELEN
		Where are the Bloody Marys, Deke?

				DEKE
		Coming.

				HELEN
			(angrily)
		Are we running a business here -- or 
		a bird sanctuary?

				SHOLES
			(beginning to change 
			his mind)
		Actually, those gulls must have been 
		after the fish.

				MRS. BUNDY
		Of course.

				SHOLES
		Makes a lot more sense than... well, 
		an attack.

				MRS. BUNDY
		Of course it does. If we believe 
		that birds are attacking, why... why 
		next we'll believe that grasshoppers 
		and cockroaches are capable of...

				DRUNK
		Cockroaches!  Urghh!

	CLOSE SHOT - WOMAN

	getting more and more anxious.

				WOMAN
		Hurry, children. Finish your lunch.

				BOY
		Are the birds gonna eat us, Mommy?

				SHOLES
		Maybe we're all getting a little 
		carried away by this. Admittedly, a 
		few birds acted strangely. That's no 
		reason to believe...

				MELANIE
		This isn't a few birds! I keep telling 
		you that! These are gulls and swifts 
		and crows and...

				MRS. BUNDY
		And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?

				MELANIE
		Maybe! Is it impossible?

				MRS. BUNDY
		Yes. I have never known birds of 
		different species to flock together.  
		The very concept is unimaginable.
			(laughing)
		Why if that happened, we wouldn't 
		have a chance. How could we possible 
		hope to fight them?

				SHOLES
		We couldn't. You're right, Mrs.  
		Bundy.

				WOMAN
			(calling from table)
		Excuse me, may I have a check, please?

				HELEN
			(concerned)
		Is everything all right, ma'am?

				WOMAN
		Yes, I... I'm anxious to get on the 
		road.

				SAM
			(coming from kitchen)
		What's the matter? Something wrong 
		out here?

				DEKE
		Nothing's wrong.

				SAM
		All this shouting.

				MRS. BUNDY
		We're fighting a war, Sam.

				SAM
		A war? Against who? Did the 
		Russians...?

				SHOLES
		Against birds.

				WOMAN
			(suddenly)
		I'm glad you all think this is so 
		amusing. You've frightened my children 
		half out of their wits.

				BOY
		I'm not scared, Mommy.

				WOMAN
		Keep quiet. If that young lady saw 
		an attack on the school, why won't 
		you believe her?

				SAM
		What attack? Who attacked the school?

				WOMAN
		Birds did. Crows! And you're all 
		sitting around here debating! What 
		do you want them to do next? Crash 
		through that window?

				LITTLE GIRL
			(frightened by her 
			mother)
		Mommy!

				WOMAN
		Quiet! Why don't you all get home?  
		Lock your doors and windows!
			(her hysteria rising)
		Put on your coats, children!
			(to Deke)
		What's the fastest road to San 
		Francisco?

				DEKE
		The freeway, ma'am.

				WOMAN
		Where do I get it?

				SALESMAN
		I'm going out that way, lady. You 
		can follow me.

				WOMAN
		Then let's go. Now!

				SALESMAN
		I haven't finished my drink.

				WOMAN
			(on edge of panic, 
			shouting at her 
			children)
		Put on your coats! Do you want to 
		get trapped here?

				BOY
		I can't find my scarf.

				WOMAN
		Look in your sleeve!

	The door opens. Mitch and Al Malone come in.

				MITCH
		Melanie?

	At the far table, the salesman begin singing, rowdily.

				MITCH
			(going to her)
		I got here as fast as I could.  
		Where's Cathy?

				MELANIE
		At Annie's house. She's all right.

				SAM
		Al, why aren't you over there where 
		the attack was?

				MALONE
		Because I just got back from Dan 
		Fawcett's place, that's why.

				MITCH
		He was killed last night. By birds.

				MALONE
		Now hold it, Mitch. You don't know 
		that for a fact.

				MRS. BUNDY
		What are the facts, Mr. Malone?

				MALONE
		Santa Rosa police think it was a 
		felony murder. They think a burglar 
		broke in and killed him.

				WOMAN
		Were the Santa Rosa police at your 
		school today?
			(impatiently, to 
			salesman)
		Are you coming?

				SALESMAN
		Take it easy, lady.
			(through window)
		There isn't a bird anywhere in sight.

				DRUNK
			(quoting)
		"Look at the birds of the air: they 
		do not sow or read, yet your heavenly 
		father feeds them."

				WOMAN
		I'll never feed another bird as long 
		as I live!

				SALESMAN
		Something like this happened in Santa 
		Cruz last year. The town was covered 
		with seagulls.

				WOMAN
		Can't you please finish your drink?

				MRS. BUNDY
		That's right, sir, I recall it. A 
		large flock of seagulls got lost in 
		a fog and headed in for the town, 
		where all the lights were.

				SALESMAN
		They made some mess, too, smashing 
		into houses and everything.
			(shaking his head)
		They always make a mess. We're better 
		off without them.

				MRS. BUNDY
		The point is that no one seemed to 
		get upset about it. They were gone 
		the next morning, just as if nothing 
		at all had happened. Poor things.

				WOMAN
		I'm leaving! Are you coming?

				SALESMAN
		All right, all right!
			(he downs his drink)
		Hope you figure this out, folks.

				DRUNK
		It's the end of the world.

	The Tides is silent for a moment.

				SHOLES
		Well, I'd better get back to the 
		cannery. What do I owe you, Deke?

				DEKE
		Let's see. Scallops and coffee...

				MITCH
		Hold it just a minute, Sebastian.

	Sholes turns to him.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	his face very serious.

				MITCH
		Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.

				SHOLES
		No one ever said you were, Mitch.

				MITCH
			(flatly)
		I think we're in trouble. I don't 
		know how or why this started, but I 
		know it's here and I know we'd be 
		crazy to ignore it.

				MRS. BUNDY
			(sarcastically)
		Ignore what? The bird war?

				MITCH
			(exploding)
		Yes, the bird war, the bird attack, 
		the bird plague, you can call it 
		what you want to, they're out there 
		massing someplace and they'll be 
		back, you can count on that!

				MRS. BUNDY
		Ridiculous!

				MITCH
		Mrs. Bundy, why don't you go home 
		and polish your binoculars?

				SAM
		Go on, Mitch.

				MITCH
		If we don't do something now, if we 
		don't get Bodega Bay on the move...

				SHOLES
		Look, Mitch, even if this is true, 
		even if all the birds...

				MITCH
		Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?

				SHOLES
			(after a long pause)
		No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't 
		see any reason for it.

				MITCH
		It's happening. Isn't that a good 
		enough reason?

				SHOLES
			(thoughtfully)
		I like Bodega Bay as well as any 
		man. If I thought...
			(he shakes his head)

				MITCH
		Then help me, Sebastian. You're an 
		important man in this town. If you'll 
		help, the rest will.

				SHOLES
		Help how? What do you want to do?

				MITCH
		I'm not sure, but...

				SHOLES
		If you don't even know what you want 
		to do...

				MELANIE
		Listen to him, please.

				SAM
			(taking position beside 
			Melanie)
		You listen to him, Sebastian!

				MITCH
		I only know we've got to drive them 
		away from town -- before they drive 
		us away.

				SHOLES
		How?

				MITCH
		Mrs. Bundy, you said something about 
		Santa Cruz. About seagulls getting 
		lost in the fog, and heading in for 
		the lights.

				DEKE
		We don't have any fog this time of 
		year, Mitch.

				MITCH
		We'll make our own fog.

				SHOLES
		How do you plan to do that?

				MITCH
		With smoke.

				MALONE
		There's an ordinance against burning 
		anything in this town, unless it's...

				MITCH
		We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army 
		uses.

				DEKE
		What good'll that do? Smoke's as bad 
		as birds.

				MRS. BUNDY
		Birds are not bad!

				SHOLES
		How can we go on living here if we 
		blanket the town with smoke?

				MITCH
		Can we go on living here otherwise?

	Pause. They are silent.

				SAM
			(slowly)
		It's worth a try, Sebastian.

	There is more silence as they all consider. And then suddenly:

				MELANIE
		Look!

	They turn toward the window.

	TIDES CAR PARK - FULL SHOT

	Viewed from the side window inside the Tides we see three or 
	four gulls diving down toward the highway over the roof of 
	the Tides Office. Two more swoop into the foreground of the 
	window and out to the left.

				DEKE
			(alarmed)
		Gulls!

				MITCH
		They're back!

				SHOLES
		They're only the usual... What are 
		you...

	TIDES TOWN - LONG SHOT

	The first gull reaches the gas station but misses the 
	attendant who is in the act of filling the car. The owner is 
	seen disappearing into the men's room.

	INT. TIDES

	A quick flash of the group of faces at the window of the 
	Tides Restaurant.

	TIDES TOWN - MED. SHOT

	A nearer view of the gas station. A second gull hits the man 
	on the back -- he falls -- hits his head on the pump and 
	then collapses over the gasoline hose pipe, pulling it out 
	and causing it to spill. The third and fourth gulls sweep 
	by.  The gas begins to flow away.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	inside the Tides. Mitch dashes toward the door -- Melanie 
	after him. Through the glass windows into the street we see 
	people dashing off to the right, in the direction of the gas 
	station. At the door, Mitch turns.

				MITCH
			(to Melanie)
		Stay back in here.

	Deke Carter comes running from behind the bar to join Mitch.  
	They both EXIT. Melanie dashes back to her original place at 
	the window. The CAMERA RETREATING with her, we come to the 
	window and over Melanie's shoulder we see the men arrive to 
	rescue the attacked gas station attendant.

	Three or four gulls are still attacking and they flutter 
	away as the men appear to beat them off. Suddenly Melanie in 
	the foreground turns in full profile to her right and looks 
	down.

	TIDES CAR PARK - MED. SHOT

	on the sloping pavement before her a stream of gasoline is 
	flowing to the right into the car park.

	CLOSE SHOT - GASOLINE

	flowing down to the car park.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	through the window. She suddenly looks toward the gas station.

	MED. SHOT - THE CAMERA PANS

	along the flowing gas back to the station.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	She turns back to the car park.

	FROM MELANIE'S VIEWPOINT

	We see the flow of gasoline trickling toward the car parked 
	below her. At this particular moment, a car has pulled up, 
	has come to a stop and a man emerges. He is in the act of 
	lighting his dead cigar, but his attention is drawn to the 
	happenings around the gas station. With this half-drawn 
	attention, he strikes the match and holds it to the cigar.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	She quickly slides the window open and yells down to the 
	man.

	FROM MELANIE'S VIEWPOINT

	The man looks about him, holding the match I his fingers. As 
	he catches sight of Melanie, the match burns his finger and 
	he drops it.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	Her horror-stricken face.

	FULL SHOT - THE PARKING AREA

	Three fast explosions in a row as the man's car, Mitch's 
	car, and the one next to it go up in flames.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE HORRIFIED FACE OF MELANIE

	TURNING TO SEE

	FULL SHOT - THE GAS STATION

	The line of flame running swiftly from the burning cars, 
	following the gasoline on the ground, directly to the pump, 
	which blows up as the men are jumping away with the injured 
	attendant.

	EXT. TIDES TOWN AND CAR PARK - MATTE SHOT

	A very high shot shows the beginning of the people of the 
	town rushing around the car park and the streets across the 
	highway, endeavoring to put out the two fires. We see 
	automobiles coming to a stop on Highway One, and the oil 
	smoke beginning to rise from the burning gas station and the 
	parked cars. Some men have managed to start a fire hose and 
	have trained it on the burning cars. Suddenly but slowly the 
	foreground in the sky just below the CAMERA begins to fill 
	with wheeling gulls. The whole picture below becomes 
	obliterated by the foreground birds who now begin to swoop 
	down on the town.

	EXT. TIDES TOWN

	A raking shot outside the Tides Restaurant showing the phone 
	booth and motel off in the background. People are rushing 
	out from the restaurant and look up in the sky. Gulls begin 
	to descend into the scene, driving the people back into the 
	restaurant. Melanie is seen in the distance calling for Mitch:

				MELANIE
		Mitch...! Mitch!

	We see her look up to the sky.

	LONG SHOT - THE SKY

	The sky is full of seagulls.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	Looking about her frantically. She turns her face up again 
	to see the descending gulls. She is driven to take refuge in 
	the phone booth.

	CLOSEUP - INSIDE THE PHONE BOOTH - MELANIE

	slams the door shut. Gulls are now beating at the glass all 
	around her.

	EXT. TIDES TOWN

	From Melanie's viewpoint inside the booth we see the people 
	who have been rushing to put out the fire now faced with 
	clouds of birds coming on them.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	looking out in terrified alarm but still searching with her 
	eyes for Mitch.

	MED. SHOT - PEOPLE RUSHING FROM THE TIDES

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	in the phone booth. She turns and looks swiftly in the 
	direction of the car park.

	EXT. TIDES CAR PARK

	Some men have secured a hose and are obviously getting water 
	from the bay. They are turning the stream onto the burning 
	cars. At this time, the birds are filling the area around 
	them. They suddenly turn the hose up into the birds.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	Her eyes turn up quickly.

	LONG SHOT - FROM HER VIEWPOINT

	We see the stream of water swing to and from among the birds.  
	Melanie turns back from this at the sound of a roaring car.

	EXT. TIDES TOWN - FROM HER VIEWPOINT

	We see a car zig zag down from the town in a drunken manner 
	coming toward her in the phone booth.  We can see birds flying 
	in and out of the windows of the car.  We can see the arm 
	and hand of the driver trying to beat them away. In the 
	background of this scene we see the fire truck arrive.

	CLOSEUP - THE HORRIFIED FACE OF MELANIE

	as the car comes toward her in the booth.

	EXT. TIDES TOWN

	At the last minute, the car swerves away from the booth.

	CLOSER SHOT

	A side view of the car after practically scraping the side 
	of the booth. We see that it's full of birds attacking the 
	driver. As it goes by, it near tilts over to inadvertently 
	give us a view of its interior.

	FLASH CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	watching the car.

	EXT. TIDES CAR PARK

	The car goes on and smashes into the other burning cars. It 
	explodes.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	Suddenly she hears the firing of a gun. She turns.

	TIDES TOWN - LONG SHOT

	She sees a man with a gun shooting up at birds but to no 
	avail. One or two descend upon him. He throws the gun down 
	and rushes back into the Tides Office. Melanie, with a slight 
	turn, now sees:

	THE TIDES TOWN

	The fire volunteers with birds descending around them drop 
	their hose.

	CLOSER SHOT

	shows the hose snaking wildly and jumping. At one moment the 
	water turns and comes in a powerful stream hitting the windows 
	of the phone booth.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	recoils from this water attack. Through the streaming window 
	she sees the fire volunteers rushing away for cover. To the 
	left we see a horse with its head covered with gulls; its 
	palomino-colored body covered with crows. It is bucking and 
	leaping and kicking its van to pieces.

	At this moment the scene is obliterated by the appearance of 
	a man groping his way closely past the phone booth windows.  
	His face is poring with blood: his head and shoulders are 
	covered with attacking birds. He disappears from sight.  
	Melanie, now almost in a faint, opens her eyes to see Tides 
	Town. Through the booth window she sees Mitch and Deke Carter, 
	the owner of the Tides, coming down toward the CAMERA and 
	waving the birds away from them with flailing arms.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	opens the booth doors and starts out with a cry of 
	recognition, but she has barely stepped out when more gulls 
	crash around the booth causing her to go back.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE IN PROFILE

	looking out again toward Mitch.

	EXT. TIDES TOWN

	Through window she sees Deke Carter run off in one direction 
	while Mitch suddenly sees a child at the window of the burning 
	building adjacent to the flaming and smoking gas station. 
	Mitch dashes across and goes up the short staircase into the 
	smoking building.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	looking across in horror.

	LONG SHOT - THE BURNING BUILDING

	For a moment there is no sign of anyone about, then suddenly 
	Mitch appears with the small child at the window. He calls 
	down. One man dashes from the direction of the Tides Office, 
	another from the Tides Restaurant. They both wait below the 
	window as Mitch drops the child.

	FLASH - MELANIE

	watching this breathlessly.

	CLOSER SHOT

	The moment the child has dropped, Mitch suddenly looks up.  
	He slams the window as two or three birds crash into the 
	windows. They disappear into the building.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	holding her breath.

	LONG SHOT - THE BURNING BUILDING

	No sign of Mitch.

	CLOSEUP - MELANIE

	getting more desperate.

	CLOSEUP - BUILDING

	No sign of Mitch. Suddenly a chair flies through the window 
	and Mitch climbs OUT and drops to the ground.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	opening the door of the booth, yells out to him.

	LONG SHOT - MITCH

	sees her and starts running toward the booth.

	HIGH SHOT - MITCH

	beating his way through the birds. He reaches the booth.

	LOW SHOT

	close to the Tides Restaurant entrance. We see Mitch drag 
	Melanie from the phone booth and run with her toward the 
	CAMERA through the birds into the restaurant.

	INT. THE TIDES

	There must be at least twenty people all looking toward the 
	windows. It is as though they are hiding from a storm. The 
	CAMERA is high enough to see Melanie and Mitch COME IN, very 
	hurriedly close the door. We see the gulls wheeling outside.  
	There is a kind of stunned silence among the people. We can 
	hear the sound of the screaming gulls outside. Suddenly a 
	woman's voice SCREAMS out:

				WOMAN
		Why are they doing it?! Why are they 
		doing it...?!

	Some of the heads of the group turn.

	CLOSE SHOT

	It is the woman who had the two children screaming at Mrs.  
	Bundy who is seated in a booth table staring numb and 
	helpless. Mrs. Bundy turns and looks at her and mutters some 
	words.

				MRS. BUNDY
			([Mrs. Bundy offers a 
			weak explanation of 
			why the birds could 
			have gone berserk 
			like this. This 
			information should 
			be obtained from Dr. 
			Stager.])

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	looking across at this slight scene. They turn back and over 
	their shoulders the gulls seem to be in much less quantity.

				MITCH
			(looking up)
		I think they're going.

	Melanie follows his look. At this moment there is a loud 
	CRASH OF GLASS. They turn their heads suddenly.

	MED. SHOT - FROM MITCH'S AND MELANIE'S VIEWPOINT

	And past the heads of the other people who have also turned, 
	we see one of the back windows of the Tides Restaurant has 
	gone and gulls are coming in. Two or three of the men who 
	are on the edge of the crowd turn and go back toward the 
	window, beating them out. They succeed in doing this.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	They turn from the gulls in the restaurant to look to the 
	street.

				MITCH
		I think it's safe to get out now.

				MELANIE
		Don't let's take any chances.

				MITCH
		We've got to get Cathy.

	They open the door and make their way out into the street, 
	running and looking about them desperately.

	EXT. BODIGA STREET

	There are one or two gulls flying around. Others are perched 
	on roofs as we see Mitch and Melanie dashing along the 
	sidewalk.

	EXT. BODIGA STREET

	There are still one or two gulls or crows in evidence as 
	they move along past the last street and come into the more 
	countrified part of the town.

	LONG SHOT - THE SCHOOL YARD

	We see them turn and dash up the road toward the school which 
	we see in the distance. There are some birds perched on the 
	school roof.

	SIDE-ON DOLLY SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	going up the school road. He stops for a moment and looks 
	up, Melanie following his look.

	SKY SHOT - FULL

	of wheeling gulls.

	SIDE-ON CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO

	They move on and go past Melanie's waiting car outside the 
	school. Suddenly Melanie brings him to a halt.

	LONG SHOT - ANNIE'S HOUSE - FROM THEIR VIEWPOINT

	There are a few blackbirds on it.

				MELANIE'S VOICE
		Look... the crows again.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO

	Mitch starts off. Melanie restrains him.

				MELANIE
		Careful, Mitch. The crows may be 
		back in the play yard.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO

	They advance cautiously. When they are level with the play 
	yard, we see what they see.

	MED. SHOT

	THE CAMERA DOLLIES along the play yard. It is again full of 
	crows.

	CLOSE SHOT

	They walk stealthily past.

	CLOSE SHOT

	CAMERA PANNING ALONG the waiting crows.

	CLOSE SHOT

	Shooting over the shoulders of Melanie and Mitch, they 
	approach Annie's house. Melanie glances apprehensively over 
	her shoulder toward the crows.

	EXT. ANNIE'S HOUSE

	Melanie and Mitch arrive. They come to a sudden stop.

	LONG SHOT - ANNIE'S HOUSE

	A woman is crumpled lifelessly on the front steps before the 
	door.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	He reaches the body. He rolls it over.

	QUICK CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE

	dead.

	QUICK CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	The shock registering on his face.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	realizing that Annie is dead, and wondering for a moment 
	what Mitch's reaction will be.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH - MELANIE'S P.O.V.

	He kneels silently by the body. Gently, he touches Annie's 
	face, and then gently and illogically takes off his jacket 
	and covers her, as if he is tucking a blanket around her to 
	keep her warm. He turns away then.

	MED. SHOT - THE WINDOW

	with its ROOM TO LET sign. Cathy is standing near the sign, 
	with her eyes peering at something outside.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	turning to follow Cathy's gaze.

	CLOSE SHOT - MIXED BIRDS

	Malevolent, sitting on the fence, the killers.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROAD

	As in fury, Mitch picks up stones and begins hurling them at 
	the birds. Melanie dashes forward.

				MELANIE
			(as the birds flutter 
			into the air)
		Mitch! Don't!

	She runs to him, grabs his arm, struggles with him as he 
	maniacally continues hurling stones at the birds, who are 
	now hovering flight.

				MELANIE
		Please! Get Cathy!  Let's get out of 
		here!

	Her words reach him. Breathing heavily, he goes INTO the 
	house and COMES OUT carrying Cathy, who is dazed and in a 
	state of shock. The CAMERA PANS him over to Melanie who holds 
	Cathy to her.

	CLOSER THREE SHOT

	as Melanie looks anxiously toward the house.

				MELANIE
		Mitch, you can't leave her out there.

	He GOES OUT OF PICTURE. Melanie watches him. Over her shoulder 
	is the white face of Cathy. We HEAR a DRAGGING SOUND and 
	then a door is CLOSED.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE'S P.O.V.

	We see Mitch EMERGING from the house. The body is no longer 
	in the pathway. He comes toward the CAMERA.

	MED. SHOT

	He joins Melanie and Cathy. The CAMERA MOVES AHEAD of the 
	three of them as they silently make their way past the crows 
	once more, Melanie holding Cathy close to her. They look out 
	cautiously to the right.

	MED. SHOT

	CAMERA DOLLYING PAST the crows again.

	BACK TO THE DOLLY SHOT OF THE THREE

	They move forward stealthily, CAMERA AHEAD of them.

	MED. SHOT

	Another DOLLY SHOT past the crows.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE THREE

	The CAMERA is now behind them. They move away from us and go 
	toward the waiting car.

	MED. SHOT

	They arrive at the car.

				MELANIE
		You drive, Mitch.

	She goes round the far side and gets into the car. Mitch 
	slips in behind the driver's seat. The car turns into the 
	CAMERA and goes down the school road.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR - INTERIOR

	Mitch, Cathy and Melanie facing the CAMERA, tensely. Melanie 
	looks over her shoulder.

				MELANIE
			(holding her breath)
		I don't think they're coming.

	Cathy does not turn: she is staring ahead of her, her eyes 
	wide, her lip trembling. They drive in silence, and then 
	suddenly, Cathy begins speaking, almost as if to herself, as 
	the CAMERA COMES IN TIGHT on her face in shock.

				CATHY
		On our way back from taking Michele 
		home... we... we heard the explosion 
		and went outside to... see what... 
		what it was.

		All at once the... the birds were 
		everywhere. All at once.  She... she 
		pushed me inside and... they covered 
		her.
			(pause)
		Annie.

		She pushed me inside.

	TWO SHOT - CATHY AND MELANIE

	as she takes the child in her arms to comfort her.

	CLOSE SHOT - A LONE GULL flying low over the water, the CAMERA 
	TRACKING it. The bay is silent. The gull spreads its wings 
	to brake, and then sits on the water. The CAMERA continues 
	low over the water, going through thousands of gulls sitting 
	there patiently, as if it is threading itself through a crowd, 
	not a sound, over the gulls, and then lifting to show the 
	Brenner house in the distance.

	FULL SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE

	Behind the panes of glass, we can see the boards Mitch nailed 
	across the windows. He is on the roof now, testing the two 
	attic dormer windows. He turns to look out over the bay.

	LONG SHOT - THE BAY

	covered with sitting gulls. In the distance, the town is 
	still smoldering. But the sky is clear of birds.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	picking up his hammer, sliding over the shingles to where 
	the ladder leans against the side of the house.

	FULL SHOT - THE HOUSE

	as Mitch comes down the ladder and Melanie turns the corner, 
	carrying a load of driftwood and old lumber.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	as she drops the wood outside the door and he joins her. She 
	is looking out over the bay when he comes to her. This is 
	not the Melanie we saw at the beginning of the picture. Her 
	hair is disarrayed, and her face and clothing are streaked 
	with soot. But beyond a surface physical appearance, there 
	is a weary wisdom in her eyes, and a strength to her as she 
	stands looking toward the distant smoldering town.

				MELANIE
		The town looks clear.

				MITCH
		The bay doesn't.

				MELANIE
		How long have they been gathering 
		there?

				MITCH
		The past fifteen minutes.
			(pause)
		It seems to be a pattern, doesn't 
		it? They strike and disappear, and 
		then they start massing again.

	Melanie nods. They are both silent, watching the bay.

				MELANIE
		I keep thinking of Annie.
			(she squeezes her 
			eyes shut)

				MITCH
			(after a long pause)
		It... it doesn't look very different, 
		does it? A little smoke over the 
		town, but otherwise...

				MELANIE
			(looking)
		Even the birds sitting out there.  
		It does look very much the same, 
		Mitch. This could be last week.

				MITCH
		It may not be last week again for a 
		long long time.

	They are both silent.

				MELANIE
		Look. They're still coming.

	Mitch nods. Silence.

				MITCH
		Do you want to try your father again?
			(Melanie shakes her 
			head.  Puzzled, Mitch 
			looks at her)

				MELANIE
		I tried a little while ago. The 
		phone's dead.

				MITCH
		Have we still got power?

				MELANIE
		Yes.
			(leaning against him)
		I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very 
		tired.

				LYDIA (O.S.)
		Mitch! I'm getting something on the 
		radio!

	INT. THE LIVING ROOM - FULL SHOT

	Lydia is hovering near the radio. Cathy is sitting on a 
	footstool. The windows are boarded, and the lights in the 
	room are on. A tremendous amount of static is coming from 
	the radio as Mitch and Melanie join them

				LYDIA
		I can't get any of the local stations.  
		I think this is San Francisco.

				ANNOUNCER
		...would include formulation of a 
		central financing committee to handle 
		credit and to allocate responsibility 
		for the various facets of the project. 
		A vote on the motion is expected 
		early tomorrow morning.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	listening.

				ANNOUNCER
		Continuing with the local news, police 
		are still investigating the series 
		of valuable jade burglaries in the 
		Chinatown area. The round-up of known 
		criminals has not as yet produced a 
		suspect, but Commissioner Nelson 
		said today he was certain the 
		burglaries were quote linked and the 
		work of the team of professionals 
		unquote.
			(pause)
		In Bodega Bay early this morning, a 
		large flock of crows attacked a group 
		of children who were leaving the 
		school during a fire drill. One little 
		girl was seriously injured and taken 
		to the hospital in Santa Rosa, but 
		the majority of children reached 
		safety in the town.
			(pause)
		On the national scene today, the 
		opening of the new session of Congress 
		was marked by a State of the Union 
		address that...

				MITCH
		Is that all?

				ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
		...drew a standing ovation for the 
		President. The Chief Executive, in 
		discussing our relation to Europe 
		and the rest of the world community 
		said: "These various elements of our 
		foreign policy lead as I have said 
		to a single goal --

				MITCH
			(sighing)
		We're going to need more wood for 
		the fire. We can't let it go out.

				ANNOUNCER
			(continuing as drone 
			in background)
		The goal of a peaceful world of free 
		and independent states.  This is our 
		guide for the present and our vision 
		for the future -- a free community 
		of nations, independent but 
		interdependent, uniting north and 
		south, east and west, in one great 
		family of man, outgrowing and 
		transcending the hates and fears 
		that rend our age.  We will not reach 
		that goal today or tomorrow.  We may 
		not reach it in our lifetime.  But 
		the quest is the great adventure of 
		our century.  We sometimes chafe at 
		the burdens of our obligations, the 
		complexity of our decisions, the 
		agony of our choices, but there is 
		no comfort or security for us in 
		evasion, no solution in abdication, 
		no relief in irresponsibility.
			(pause)
		In assuming the tasks of the 
		Presidency, I said that few 
		generations, in all history, had 
		been granted the role of being the 
		great defender of freedom in its 
		hour of maximum danger.  This is our 
		good fortune, and I welcome it now 
		as I did when I first took office.
			(pause)
		For it is the fate of this generation -- 
		Of you in the Congress and of me as 
		President -- to live with a struggle 
		we did not start, in a world we did -
		not make. But the pressures of life 
		are not always distributed by choice. 
		And while no nation has ever faced 
		such a challenge, no nation has ever 
		been ready to seize the burden and 
		the glory of...

				LYDIA
			(pause)
		Did you you get the windows in the 
		attic, Mitch?

				MITCH
		 I got them all, Mother.

				LYDIA
		When do you think they'll come?

				MITCH
		I don't know.

				LYDIA
		If there are... larger birds, Mitch... 
		they'll get into the house.

				MITCH
		That's a chance we have to take.

				LYDIA
		Maybe we ought to leave.

				MITCH
		Not now.  Not while they're massing 
		out there.

				LYDIA
		When? 

				MITCH
		I don't know when.  We'll see what...

				LYDIA
		Where will we go?

				MITCH
		I don't know yet.  I think we'll be 
		safe here.
			(Pause)
		Let's bring that wood in.

				LYDIA
		What happens when we run out of wood?

	Music begins to play.  The music is sweet, with violins and 
	long piano arpeggios, almost too much to bear against the 
	tension being played in front of it.

				MITCH
		I don't know. We'll break up the 
		furni...

				LYDIA
			(shouting)
		You don't know, you don't know!  
		When will you know? When we're all 
		dead? Like Annie?

				CATHY
			(shrieking it, her 
			face white)
		Mother!

				LYDIA
			(at Mitch)
		If your father were here...

				MITCH
			(sharply)
		Mother! I'm trying my best!
			(shaking his head)
		I'm... trying... my...

				LYDIA
			(trembling, nodding)
		I'm sorry, Mitch.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	the strain showing on his face. He nods briefly.

				MITCH
		Let's get the wood. Why don't you 
		make us all some coffee, Mother?

	FULL SHOT - HOUSE

	as Melanie and Mitch come out and head for the pile of wood.  
	There is a NOISE in the sky. Startled, glancing upward, they 
	begin to run back toward the house and then stop and slowly 
	scan the sky.

	FULL SHOT - ENORMOUS FLOCK OF BIRDS

	flying in tight formation.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

				MELANIE
		Where are they heading?

				MITCH
		Inland.

				MELANIE
		Santa Rosa?

				MITCH
		Maybe.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	watching the birds. A look of utter sadness crosses her face. 
	It is clear that she is thinking the birds will reach Santa 
	Rosa, and eventually San Francisco as well.

				MITCH (O.S.)
			(gently)
		Come on. Let's get this wood in.

	Melanie nods. But the look of sadness stays on her face, and 
	her eyes remain on the sky.

							  DISSOLVE

	FULL SHOT - THE LIVING ROOM

	Lydia is pouring coffee into cups. In the dining room, we 
	can HEAR the CHATTER of the lovebirds. As Lydia pours the 
	sound distracts her. Cathy is sorting candles at the couch.  
	There is evidence of preparation everywhere: flashlights, 
	kerosene lamps, a butane burner. Mitch is at the fireplace 
	putting more wood on the fire. Melanie comes into the room 
	and dumps another load.

				MELANIE
		That's the last of it.

				LYDIA
		Did you close the door?

				MELANIE
		And locked it.

				CATHY
		Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in 
		here?

				LYDIA
			(snapping it)
		No!

				CATHY
		Mom, they're in a cage!

				LYDIA
		They're birds!

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	studying his mother, realizing how close she is to breaking.

				MITCH
			(softly)
		Let them stay in the other room.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	her hand trembling as she pours the coffee.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

	as they all sit and accept their coffee. The room is silent 
	except for the CRACKLE of the fire. Mitch rises to put more 
	wood on the fire. In the dining room, the lovebirds still 
	are CHATTERING wildly. Their chirping is the only sound in 
	the house.

				CATHY
		Mitch? Why are they doing this?  The 
		birds.

				MITCH
			(putting wood on fire)
		I don't know, honey.

				CATHY
		Why are they trying to kill people?

				MITCH
		I wish I could say. But if I could 
		answer that, I could also tell you 
		why people are trying to kill people.

	The room is silent again except for the TWEETING of the 
	lovebirds offscreen. And then, suddenly, the lovebirds fall 
	silent.

	CLOSE SHOT - CATHY

	turning to look toward the other room, her face going white, 
	her eyes widening.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	waiting.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	waiting.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	waiting.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

	dead silent now. Each of them is sitting on the edges of 
	their chairs, waiting. There is the SUDDEN SOUND of 
	splintering glass.

				LYDIA
		Mitch...

				MITCH
		Shhh. Shhh.

	Silence. Into the silence, another pane of glass, SHATTERING, 
	the THUD of a bird against the boards. Silence.  More panes 
	of glass SHATTERING. The SOUND of birds striking the boards 
	and the outside of the house begins building, almost like 
	muffled drumbeats. THUD, THUD, with an irregularity of rhythm. 
	Interspersed, like the counterpoint in an alien orchestration, 
	is the FLUTTER of wings. And then, like another section 
	entering, we begin to hear the SCRATCHING and CLAWING at the 
	roof.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	looking up toward the roof, the SOUND getting louder. She 
	squeezes her eyes shut.

	TWO SHOT - CATHY AND MELANIE

	as the child cuddles up into her arms. Over the other sounds, 
	there comes a NEW SOUND, the unmistakable rat-tat-tat-tattat

	of a woodpecker. It stops. It begins again. Rat-tat-tat tattat-
	tat. Tat-

				CATHY
			(in terror)
		I'm... I'm sick, Melanie. I want.. I 
		want to throw...

	Her face pale, she rises suddenly and starts for the bathroom.

				MELANIE
		I'll go with you.

	They leave the room. Mitch and Lydia sit in silence. We HEAR 
	Cathy retching offscreen, almost drowned out by the shuffling 
	of wings and the rasping of claws, the incessant thudding of 
	birds striking the house.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

	Mitch rises and puts more wood on the fire. The SOUND of the 
	birds is still everywhere around the house. He looks at his 
	watch. He rises, walks into the kitchen to check the back 
	door. It seems all right. The CAMERA FOLLOWS him into the 
	dining room. He stops at the cage with the lovebirds.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS

	watching him. Is there menace or innocence in their eyes?  
	He cannot tell.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	looking at the lovebirds in puzzlement. There is suddenly a 
	NEW SOUND offscreen, the splintering of wood, the tearing 
	sound of bigger beaks. Alarmed, he turns.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	coming into the entry hall.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE FRONT DOOR

	The wood is beginning to splinter as the bigger birds outside 
	assail the door.

	FULL SHOT - MITCH

	turning quickly, the CAMERA FOLLOWING him into the dining 
	room. He pulls the cloth off the table, begins moving it 
	toward the door. In the entry, he lifts the table on end and 
	piles it against the door. He goes into the kitchen again, 
	CAMERA FOLLOWING. He upends the enamel-topped table, drags 
	it to the back door. He is piling chairs against the table 
	when Melanie COMES IN. She looks at what he is doing with 
	alarm. Mitch looks in the direction of where his mother is 
	and then back to Melanie, with an expression almost of 
	desperation. Both turn back to the barricaded door. The 
	CLAWING and the PECKING fills the void. The noise is a din 
	now, insidious and increasingly more frightening.

				MELANIE
		When will they stop?

				MITCH
		I thought they'd have stopped by 
		now.

				MELANIE
		What time is it?

				MITCH
		Almost two a.m.

				MELANIE
		You must be exhausted.

				MITCH
		How about you?

	She shakes her head. They both move into the dining room, 
	the CAMERA FOLLOWING THEM. The lovebirds are sitting in their 
	cage, close together, silent. Mitch picks up a chair, ready 
	to carry it to the front door. He hesitates, puts down the 
	chair, goes to the cage.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	looking at the birds, wondering.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE BIRDS

	looking back at him. Again, it is impossible to read their 
	expressions. Malice or benevolence?

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	He raises his hand, brings it toward the bars of the cage.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE BIRDS

	watching, unmoving.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH'S FINGER

	as he thrusts it through the bars. The birds sit unmoving.  
	One of them tweets.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

				MITCH
		I wonder if Cathy fed them.

	He turns away from her, goes to the cupboard, opens the door, 
	takes out a small box of bird feed.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE CAGE

	as his hand approaches the door. The birds are watching him.  
	His hand hesitates. Then his thumb and forefinger lift the 
	small catch on the cage door. His fingers open the door.  
	Cautiously, in TIGHT CLOSEUP, his hand goes into the cage.  
	The birds sit and watch. One of them tweets. He removes the 
	small feeding tray, puts the bird seed into it, replaces it 
	in the cage. The birds hesitate another moment. Then, 
	tweeting, they begin to eat.

	FULL SHOT - THE DINING ROOM

	as Mitch closes the door to the cage. Melanie is slumped 
	against the wall. He goes to her and takes her in his arms.  
	Wearily, she raises her head. The SOUND of the shuffling, 
	pecking, clawing birds is everywhere around them.

				MITCH
			(holding her)
		You should have left when you wanted 
		to.

	She shakes her head.

				MITCH
		You'd have been safe in San Francisco.

				MELANIE
		I don't want to be safe. I want to 
		be with you.

	There is something pathetically comic about her voice, like 
	a small child's, confused but defiant. Holding her close, 
	Mitch laughs, and she laughs with him. Exhausted, they stand 
	in each other's arms, laughing in that weary, silly, dead of 
	night sort of way. And suddenly... The lights go out.

				MITCH
			(in the darkness)
		The power.

				MELANIE
		Mitch...

				MITCH
		Wait here. Don't move.

	The screen is totally black for perhaps five seconds. In the 
	blackness, we HEAR the birds clawing and ripping, and the 
	SOUND is enormously MAGNIFIED. A flashlight suddenly goes 
	on.

	TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

	as he comes to her with the flash. We see them only dimly as 
	he directs the beam upwards.

				MITCH
		We'd better light some of those lamps.

				MELANIE
		No... wait.
			(pause)
		Hold me.

	In the near darkness, we see them embrace and kiss. It is 
	almost black in the room except for the strange effect of 
	the flashlight as he holds it behind her.

				MITCH
		I think they're easing off.

							  DISSOLVE

	FULL SHOT - THE LIVING ROOM

	A kerosene lamp is burning. Melanie is awake, watching the 
	fire. Lydia has fallen into a semi-recumbent position asleep 
	on the couch. Cathy is curled up in one of the easy chairs.  
	Mitch is asleep by the fire. The fire is burning brightly 
	and steadily. The house is almost still. There is no longer 
	the sound of the clawing and pecking, but there is another 
	SOUND now: the sound of SOMETHING FALLING, or dropping in a 
	steady dribbling, difficult to place.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	listening to the curious sound, trying to fathom its meaning.

				MELANIE
			(whispering)
		Mitch?

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	as she turns toward him.

				MELANIE
			(still whispering)
		Mitch?

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	asleep.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	seeing this, making her decision. The SOUND is still coming 
	from somewhere in the house. She decides to let Mitch sleep, 
	picks up a very long flashlight.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	as she goes through the house, checking. She stops in the 
	entry hall, plays the flashlight over the furniture piled 
	against the door. Everything seems all right. She goes into 
	the kitchen, again, checks the door, and then plays the beam 
	on the boarded windows. Satisfied, she goes down the corridor 
	outside the bedroom. She opens the first bedroom door, enters, 
	goes to the windows, plays the beam on them.  Everything's 
	all right. She comes into the corridor again, opens the second 
	bedroom door, again checks windows, and leaves.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	climbing the steps to the attic. She stops outside the first 
	door upstairs, opens it, goes into the room, plays the light 
	on the windows. Nothing. She comes out into the corridor, 
	goes to the second bedroom, opens the door, enters, walks to 
	the windows. They are boarded securely. She is starting back 
	toward the door when she stops.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	looking.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE FLOOR

	a pile of chipped and broken plaster.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	turning the flashlight up toward the ceiling.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE CEILING

	A huge hole in it, showing moonlit sky outside.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	turning her eyes from the ceiling, determination on her face, 
	and suddenly, her eyes open wide.

	CLOSE SHOT - AN OWL

	sitting in the darkness, staring at her.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	reacting.

	QUICK MED. SHOT - THE OWL

	wings spread in the beam of light.

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE

	backing to the door. The owl hits her, sends her staggering 
	back, causing the door to slam shut. She looks up at the

	FULL SHOT - THE CEILING

	a swarm of mixed birds coming through the hole and down toward 
	her.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	in the room swinging the lighted flashlight as the birds 
	attack her.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	in the room, as the owl hits her full in the face.

	MED. SHOT - MELANIE

	swinging the flashlight as the birds attack her.

				MITCH (O.S.)
		Melanie!

	FULL SHOT - MELANIE AND THE BIRDS

	grotesque and silent as she struggles with them. The room is 
	a crossing cacophony of mixed light beams and fluttering 
	wings.

				MITCH (O.S.)
		Melanie, open the door!

	He hurls himself against it. Inside the room, where Melanie 
	struggles, we HEAR his hammering on it. Melanie is overwhelmed 
	by the birds.

	She falls to the floor, the flashlight beside her. In the 
	spreading rays of the light, we see the frantic fluttering 
	of wings as the birds cover her. There is a stronger assault 
	on the door by Mitch outside.

				LYDIA (O.S.)
			(screaming)
		Mitch, get her out of there!

	MED. SHOT - THE ROOM

	Melanie, collapsed at the base of the door, is no longer in 
	view. Neither are the birds, whose fluttering shadows we see 
	on the door as Mitch again hits it from outside.

				MITCH (O.S.)
		Melanie!

	The door begins to open.

	FULL SHOT - MITCH

	as the door bursts inward and he stumbles into the room.  He 
	begins swinging at the birds immediately, reaching down for 
	Melanie, fighting off the attack at the same time. He begins 
	dragging her out of the room. Her clothes have almost been 
	shredded from her body, and her face is torn and bleeding.  
	We catch only quick glimpses of her near-nudity, as Mitch 
	pulls her into the corridor and then, holding the door shut 
	behind him with one hand, delivers swinging furious blows at 
	the few birds that have escaped into the corridor.

				MITCH
		Mother, get a rope!

				LYDIA
		Oh, my God, look at her!

				MITCH
			(shouting)
		Get a rope!

	She rushes off. He struggles grotesquely with the birds.  
	There is a wild fury in him, and a methodical dedication. He 
	will not allow them to defeat him. A large bird strikes his 
	hand, knocking the club from it.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	as the bird strikes at his face. He reaches out with his 
	hands, grasping the bird, letting go of the door knob.  
	Another bird flutters into the corridor.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	in anger and desperation as he throttles the bird with his 
	hands. He reaches behind him to grab the doorknob again, and 
	is immediately attacked by the other bird.

				MITCH
			(yelling)
		Mother! Hurry!

	TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH

	as she runs up the steps and into the corridor, carrying a 
	heavy piece of rope. Mitch grabs the bird and hurls it angrily 
	to the floor. Lydia is staring down at Melanie in terror and 
	compassion. He takes the rope from her, loops it over the 
	doorknob, pulls it taut across the hallway, and ties it to 
	the bannister, sealing the door. He turns immediately to 
	Melanie, picks her up and carries her to the steps, Lydia 
	following. As they go downstairs:

				MITCH
		Cathy! Get a blanket and some 
		bandages!

				CATHY
			(at the foot of the 
			stars, on the verge 
			of tears)
		Is she all right?

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	cradled against Mitch's shoulder, her face bleeding profusely.

				MELANIE
		I'm... I'm....

	FULL SHOT - MITCH

	as he carries her into the living room, but her down on the 
	couch.

				MITCH
		Just lie there and keep still.

	Cathy rushes to them with a roll of bandages and a blanket.  
	By the light of the lantern, Mitch drapes the blanket over 
	Melanie and then begins unrolling the bandage. But his hands 
	are trembling, and he drops it.

				LYDIA
		Let me do that, Mitch.

	She picks up the bandage.

				MITCH
		I can handle it.

				LYDIA
		I know you can.
			(her eyes meet his)
		But I'd like to.

	He nods. Silently, she begins working on Melanie.

				MELANIE
			(weakly)
		Please don't mess me up with bandages, 
		Mrs. Brenner.

				LYDIA
		Shhhh. Shhhh.

				MELANIE
		Please.

	But she begins cleaning the wounds, taping bandages over the 
	cuts. The house is still. She works silently and quickly.

				LYDIA
			(as she works)
		I'm not very good at this, Mitch.

				MITCH
		You're doing fine.

				LYDIA
			(Apologizing)
		I mean. I want to...

	Pause.

				CATHY
		Listen!

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	raising her eyes. The room is silent. There is nothing to 
	hear.

				LYDIA
		They're gone. God have mercy, they're 
		gone.

	FULL SHOT - MITCH

	as he goes to the front door, and cautiously moves away the 
	table and chair. He opens the door a crack.

	FULL SHOT - THE YARD

	through the crack. Daylight is almost here. There are no 
	birds visible.

	FULL SHOT - THE DOOR

	from outside as Mitch opens it wider. The door is scarred 
	and splintered. As he opens the door, one or two dead birds 
	spill into the room. He steps out into the yard. Lydia is 
	directly behind him.

	FULL SHOT - THE HOUSE

	a shambles, all the windows broken.

	TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH

				MITCH
		They're gone. The same pattern.

				LYDIA
		But they'll be back.

				MITCH
		We won't be here.

				LYDIA
		Where can we go, Mitch? There's no 
		place to go.

				MITCH
		I want to try for San Francisco.  
		There are buildings there. Steel and 
		concrete!

				LYDIA
			(shaking her head)
		We'd never make it. They're probably 
		all over the road.

				MITCH
		We have to try it.
			(a long silence)
		We can't stay here.
			(silence)
		Melanie needs help.
			(silence)
		Mother, the house won't take another 
		attack.

				LYDIA
		If...
			(pause)
		If... when we get to San Francisco...
			(pause)
		If they're already there?

				MITCH
		They won't be.

				LYDIA
		If they are?

				MITCH
		We'll worry about that when we get 
		there.

				LYDIA
		I'm frightened, terribly frightened.  
		I... I don't know what's out there, 
		Mitch.

				MITCH
		What do we have to know, Mother?  
		We're all together, we all love each 
		other, we all need each other. What 
		else is there? Mother, I want us to 
		stay alive!

				LYDIA
			(nodding; then after 
			a pause)
		I started to say... inside...

				MITCH
		You don't have to.

	He holds out his hand to her.

				MITCH
		I think we'd better get started.

							  DISSOLVE

	FULL SHOT - THE BRENNER YARD

	It is covered with the eerie half-light that comes just before 
	dawn, a light that persists throughout all of the following 
	until the penultimate shot in the picture. The silence is 
	deafening. There is not a bird in sight. The door to Melanie's 
	convertible are open as she and Mitch come out of the house 
	together and he helps her to the car. He puts her in the 
	back seat, tucks the blanket around her. In the background 
	is the pickup truck, too small to hold all of them. Lydia 
	comes to the door and quickly crosses the yard, not looking 
	down at the dead birds. Cathy appears in the doorway to the 
	house.

	CLOSE SHOT - CATHY

	She is carrying the cage of lovebirds. She hesitates just 
	outside the doorway. She looks at Mitch.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	looking back at her.

	FULL SHOT - CATHY, MITCH, AND LYDIA

	Across the expanse of the desolated yard.

				CATHY
		May I take them, Mitch?

	He does not answer. She continues looking at him.

				CATHY
		They haven't harmed anyone.

				LYDIA
		Take them.

				MITCH
			(with a slow nod)
		We'll put them in the trunk, Cathy.

	He takes the birds from her and goes to the back of the car.  
	The CAMERA STAYS on Cathy who gets into the car on the front 
	seat. Mitch comes around the other side of the car, stops, 
	and looks toward the trees.

	MED. SHOT - THE TREES

	covered with waiting birds.

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	getting into car.

				MITCH
		Be careful with that door.

	Cathy closes the door gently, and almost soundlessly. Mitch 
	does the same with his door.

				MELANIE
			(weakly)
		Mitch, if they hear the car 
		starting... if they see movement...

				MITCH
		We'll take it slow until we get to 
		the main road.
			(pause)
		Are you ready?

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH'S HAND

	turning the key. The motor springs to life.

	FULL SHOT - INT. THE CAR

	anticipation on all the faces.

				MITCH
		All right.
			(he takes a deep breath)
		Here we go.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR

	from the outside, as it creeps out of the yard. The bay is 
	still, the road is still, the car makes barely a sound as it 
	passes the gate and starts down the road.

	MED. SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

	as they begin driving slowly. The wires are down. A small 
	fire is burning in the brush, where the wires made contact.  
	The car continues to move. It turns the first bend in the 
	road.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE - LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOW

	She gasps quickly.

	MED. SHOT - A GROUP OF HERONS - AT WATER'S EDGE

	standing, waiting silently.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR - INTERIOR

	as the tension begins to starts.

				MITCH
		Shhh.  Shhhh.

	MED. SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

	as they approach the derelict barge. It is covered with 
	waiting seagulls.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	seeing them. Her lip begins to tremble.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	turning toward the side of the road ahead.

	FULL SHOT - AN OVERTURNED SCHOOL BUS - MITCH'S P.O.V.

	covered with waiting birds.

				CATHY
			(whispering)
		Mitch, let's turn back.

				MITCH
		Shhh. Shhhhh.

	MED. SHOT - A ROADSIDE HOUSE

	as the car passes. A barricade has been set up on the front 
	porch, and a man is leaning over it, dead, a shotgun in his 
	hands. The porch is covered with waiting birds. At the boarded 
	window, we see a woman and child peering from a gap.

	CLOSE SHOT - CATHY

	reacting.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR - BIRD'S P.O.V.

	as it threads its way slowly and cautiously along the winding 
	road to town. The birds are sitting on some of the still-
	standing wires, watching, waiting.

	FULL SHOT - THE TOWN APPROACH - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD as 
	the car turns a bend in the road. There are thousands of 
	birds ahead, on every gutted and smoldering rooftop, on every 
	pole, on every fence.

				LYDIA
		Mitch!

	MED. SHOT - MITCH

	as he stops the car and looks ahead.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR

	in the middle of the road, stopped. Ahead are the birds.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	frightened, try not to reveal her fear.

				MELANIE
		Can we turn back?

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

				MITCH
		I... I don't think so. If we get 
		through town, I think we'll be all 
		right.

	FULL SHOT - INT. THE CAR

	There is a long silence. It is Melanie who has the strongest 
	reason for fearing the birds. It is Melanie, her fear growing, 
	who makes the decision.

				MELANIE
		Then go ahead, Mitch.

	FULL SHOT - EXT. THE CAR

	as it begins moving forward again at an excruciatingly slow 
	rate of speed, into the town and the waiting birds.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	as she turns to look out the window on her side.

	CLOSE SHOT - A LINE OF BIRDS

	as the car moves past them slowly.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

	closing her eyes.

	FULL SHOT - BRINKMEYER'S GENERAL STORE

	through the windshield. The roof and sills are covered with 
	birds. The window is smashed in, canned goods are strewn all 
	over the sidewalk, bolts of cloth run in a riot from the 
	open door and across the road, dead people are lying in the 
	gutter. But in the hotel, we see some faces behind broken 
	windows.

	TWO SHOT - CATHY, MITCH

	The tension on their faces,

	MED. SHOT - THE STORES OPPOSITE THE TIDES

	as the car approaches them. The windows are all broken, and 
	merchandise is lying on the sidewalk. Birds are everywhere, 
	waiting.

	CLOSE SHOT - A DEAD MAN

	lying on the sidewalk, clutching a television set in his 
	arms.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	strained, looking at the road ahead.

	LONG SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD

	a clear sky, a bird-free stretch,

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

				MITCH
			(almost as a prayer)
		Here we go.
			(he rams down on the 
			accelerator)

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR - EXTERIOR

	as Mitch rams the accelerator to the floor and it zooms ahead 
	in a burst of speed.

	FULL SHOT - THOUSANDS OF BIRDS

	taking wing.

	MED. SHOT - MORE BIRDS

	taking wing.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	screaming.

				MELANIE
		Mitch!

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	wrenching at the wheel as the car turns a bend.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD

	through the windshield, as a flock of birds take wing 
	immediately ahead.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE WINDSHIELD

	from the inside, as birds flutter against it.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE ROOF OF THE CAR

	from the inside, as a beak slashes it, letting in a thin 
	line of light.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	wrenching at the wheel again, another bend.

	HELICOPTER SHOT - THE CAR

	navigating the sharp bends in the road as birds streak at it 
	in straight lines.

	TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MELANIE

	in the back seat as several slashes appear in the roof over 
	their heads, letting in more light.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE ROOF

	More slashes, more light in scattered beams.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	her fear growing as the scattered light beams bring back the 
	memory of the attic room and her flashlight battle with the 
	owl.

	CLOSE SHOT - THE ROOF

	more slashes, building, the beak thrusts combining with the 
	incoming beams of light in a weirdly horrifying way.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

				LYDIA
			(almost a prayer)
		Dear God... dear God... please, 
		please, what have we done? Please.
			(and then in anger at 
			the roof and the 
			birds)
		Can't they leave us alone?
			(shrieking it)
		LEAVE US ALONE!

	MED. SHOT - THE CAR INTERIOR all the passengers, as the roof 
	suddenly rips back.

	FULL SHOT - BIRDS

	from inside the car, hovering over it the moment the roof 
	tears back.

	CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

	This is too much for her. She screams at sight of the birds, 
	and then turns her face into Lydia's shoulder.

	TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MELANIE

	as Lydia recognizes Melanie's need. She puts her arm around 
	Melanie's shoulder and gently, soothingly, holds her close.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR

	racing along as the birds hover over it.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	his face screwed in anguish, tears rolling down his cheeks 
	as he grips the wheel and hits the gas pedal.

	FULL SHOT - THE OPEN CAR

	streaming canvas ribbons behind it. It turns another bend in 
	the road.

	FULL SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD - (THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD)

	It is arrow-straight, no curves.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR

	in a burst of speed as it hits the straightaway. It begins 
	to outdistance the birds. The gap widens. A flock of birds 
	attacks it from the side of the road, but it speeds into 
	them and through them. The gap grows wider and wider. They 
	are well ahead of the birds now.

	CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

				LYDIA
		We're losing them.

	CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

	only a nod, his face streaming tears.

	LONG SHOT - THE CAR (BIRDS' P.O.V.)

	as they fall way behind now, the car moving swiftly into the 
	distance.

	TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MELANIE

	on the back seat. Melanie begins sobbing in a sudden release 
	of tension. Lydia, in compassion, and tenderly, cradles 
	Melanie's head on her shoulder. Melanie, her eyes glistening, 
	looks ahead through the windshield.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR INTERIOR

	all their faces visible.

				CATHY
		Mitch?  Do... do you think they'll 
		be all right? In the trunk? Can they 
		breath?

				MITCH
			(with the faintest 
			smile)
		I think they'll be all right, honey.

	There is hope on their faces as the car streaks into the 
	wind. Not a wild exuberance, but a relaxation of tension.  
	They stare ahead through the windshield, and then they squint 
	their eyes against the sudden sunrise ahead, and Mitch reaches 
	up to turn down the sun visor.

				MITCH
		It looks... it looks clear up ahead.

	FULL SHOT - THE CAR

	moving AWAY FROM THE CAMERA FAST into magnificent sunrise 
	over the crest of the hills. Further and further into the 
	distance it goes.

					 THE END
"BIRTHDAY GIRL"

                                      Screenplay by

                           Tom Butterworth and Jez Butterworth

                

               FADE IN:

               In a Russian summer meadow, a young girl spins around and 
               around. A simple guitar theme plays as the low sun catches 
               her hair. Around her neck is a pair of field binoculars, and 
               she runs through the meadow with them pressed to her face, 
               spying butterflies, birds, rabbits. She reaches the top of a 
               hillock, and jumps into the air, and flies up into the sky. 
               We float up and up with her as she aims the binoculars up, 
               up, into the sun.

                                                       FADE THROUGH SUN TO:

               An aerial shot of the rolling English countryside. Nothing 
               but fields and trees for miles. The shot describes a panorama 
               before looking directly down, at the earth, and we begin to 
               move.

               We fly low over a field, a ditch and straight out over six 
               lanes of motorway. Cars and lorries tear below at a hundred 
               miles an hour. We fly over the hard shoulder to another field 
               beyond.

               We descend on two young boys in the field. A pornographic 
               magazine is spread out of the flattened grass. One of the 
               boys puts a match to the centre page and as the flames lick 
               up, we begin to move again, across the field, over a path 
               and into a suburban garden.

               We fly over five or six gardens, over a barbecue, over 
               children splashing in a pool, over a woman sunbathing, a man 
               mowing his lawn, a young boy bouncing up and down on a garden 
               trampoline, to arrive on the patio of John Buckingham. He 
               walks out onto the patio, where he sits in a chair, facing 
               his house, setting down a mug of tea.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A blurred face sharpening into focus, John Buckingham, about 
               thirty-two, sitting on his patio, his garden behind, fields 
               beyond.

                                     JOHN
                         Hello.

               His hand adjusts a microphone on his lapel.

                                     JOHN
                         Hello, hello. Hello...

               He shifts in his chair. Coughs. He looks straight at us.

                                     JOHN
                         I don't believe in perfect love. You 
                         know, love that comes out of the sky 
                         like a thunderbolt and uh... This is 
                         ridiculous.

               He removes the microphone. He sits there, thinking very hard.

                                     JOHN
                         No. No no no. Nope.

               He stands, turns and stretches.

                                                                  BLACKOUT:

               FADE UP:

               He is sitting as before, looking at us.

                                     JOHN
                         Running. Reading. Going out. Staying 
                         in. The countryside. Films, if they're 
                         good.

                                                                  BLACKOUT:

               FADE UP:

                                     JOHN
                         Thoughtful. Outgoing. Ambitious. 
                         Well-read. Reasonably popular. 
                         Balanced. Trusting. Quite attractive. 
                         Outgoing.

                                                                  BLACKOUT:

               FADE UP:

                                     JOHN
                         Someone intelligent, of course. Kind. 
                         Pretty I suppose. But its not 
                         critical.

               EXT. JOHN'S STREET - DAY

               John watches while two removal men lift a new double bed 
               from the back of a van.

                                     JOHN (V.O.)
                         Someone with a sense of humour. 
                         Someone you can communicate with on 
                         the same level. Someone you can really 
                         talk to. I think communication is 
                         key.

               INT. BEDROOM - DAY

               John's hands smooth a crisp white sheet over the double 
               mattress. An ant runs across the sheet. John squashes it and 
               picks it carefully off.

                                     JOHN (V.O.)
                         I think that by the time most people 
                         turn thirty they know where they're 
                         going.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. GARDEN - DAY

               John encircles his house, leaving a thick trail of yellow 
               powder behind him.

                                     JOHN (V.O.)
                         And where they've been. I suppose 
                         they have some baggage stroke history.

               EXT. THE GARDEN RECORDING - DAY

               We see that John is talking to his PC. It has a small digital 
               camera on the side.

                                     JOHN
                         We all have someone in our past who 
                         uh... one skeleton, if you like. 
                         We've all got at least one person, 
                         as it were, under the patio. Not 
                         literally of course. I suppose I 
                         only say this because I always thought 
                         people who did this sort of thing 
                         were... I had an image that they 
                         were losers. Not losers. A bit sad. 
                         But I think this is the modern world. 
                         And I think really it's quite a brave 
                         move. Quite a brave, reasonable thing 
                         to do.

               He smiles.

                                     JOHN
                         Sorry can we start again?

               SINGLE CARD ON BLACK:

                                      BIRTHDAY GIRL

               John's fingers in close-up, type JOHN BUCKINGHAM, and his 
               AMEX number into his PC. Finished, he stops, and rests his 
               face on his hands.

               He hits SEND. That instant, a worry of black crows bursts up 
               in the field behind him and takes to the swirling air.

               Blackout. Music. Titles.

               The titles pop and slide over footage of Russian women, on 
               computer video, advertising themselves. They mostly speak in 
               Russian, some of which is subtitled, some speak in English. 
               The women slide on and off the screen, overlap and collide, 
               as the titles appear. Close-ups on mouths and eyes, tight 
               and pixellated. It becomes a wall of image and sound.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The GIGANTIC UNDERSIDE of a Boeing 747 TEARS down the screen.

               INT. AIRPORT TRAVELATOR - DAY

               John slides across the screen, motionless, towards Arrivals.

               INT. AIRPORT - DAY.

               Last calls for flights leaving for the other side of the 
               world.

               INT. AIRPORT MAIN ARRIVALS BOARD - DAY

               He dries his face with a paper towel, then checks himself in 
               the mirror. He looks okay, a little white.

               INT. ARRIVALS GATE - DAY

               The Arrivals gate slides open and passengers flood through. 
               John stands among the chauffeurs and cab drivers, as the 
               passengers trundle by.

               We follow one young woman long enough to think this must be 
               her, but it's a false alarm, she's lifted up and spun around 
               by someone else.

               They've all passed. That's that. She wasn't on the flight.

               John wanders away from the gate. He stands about in the swirl 
               in the middle of the airport. People bustle by. Everyone 
               going somewhere.

               Gradually, we get the sense we are being watched. A woman 
               stands nearby. She is about twenty, very beautiful, tired 
               and laden with luggage.

                                     JOHN
                         Nadia?

               She nods.

                                     JOHN
                         I'm John.

               They shake hands.

                                     JOHN
                         Welcome.
                              (pause)
                         Well. Look I didn't have a speech 
                         but...

               A distorted passenger announcement breaks above us. It's too 
               loud to talk. It ends and they stand there in silence. He 
               points to her luggage.

                                     JOHN
                         Is that everything?

                                     NADIA
                         Yes.

                                     JOHN
                         Right. Okay. Good.

               They stand there.

               INT. AIRPORT LIFT - DAY

               Nadia and John stand side by side in a huge lift.

                                     JOHN
                         We can talk in the car.

               A deafening roll of thunder.

               EXT. AIRPORT CAR PARK - DAY

               It's pouring with rain as they cross the car park towards a 
               patched up yellow Rover. John stows the suitcase in the boot 
               and opens the passenger door for her.

               INT. / EXT. JOHN'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

               John turns the key in the ignition. The MG wheezes and coughs. 
               He tries again. Nothing. The third time it just catches and 
               he coaxes it to life. The colour's drained from his cheeks.

               They head for the motorway. The silence in the car lasts 
               just long enough for John to feel he is breaking it.

                                     JOHN
                         It's about forty miles from here. I 
                         don't know if you've looked at a 
                         map, it's close to London but it's a 
                         city in itself. A Roman city. It's a 
                         nice house. I'm having a problem 
                         with ants. I uh... It's the warmer 
                         weather. I can't seem to find the 
                         nest. Sorry, do you understand "ants"?

                                     NADIA
                         Yes.

                                     JOHN
                         I just can't find a nest. The root 
                         of the problem. I've looked 
                         everywhere. What's the Russian for 
                         ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. 
                         This is strange isn't it.

                                     NADIA
                         Yes.

                                     JOHN
                         I'm pretty nervous. Are you?

                                     NADIA
                         Yes.

                                     JOHN
                         I mean... "Ants." "I've got a problem 
                         with ants."

               He shakes his head.

                                     JOHN
                         I had this...

               He pulls a sign from his jacket which says "Nadia!"

                                     JOHN
                         As a joke but uh...

               He tosses it onto the back seat.

               They drive. He sees Nadia looking at England.

                                     JOHN
                         So. Is it different to how you 
                         imagined it?

                                     NADIA
                         Yes.

                                     JOHN
                         I bet.
                              (pause)
                         What about me? Am I how you imagined?

                                     NADIA
                         Yes.

               He double-takes, changes lanes.

                                     JOHN
                         And how was the flight. Sorry, am I 
                         speaking too fast for you?

                                     NADIA
                         Yes.

               John looks across.

                                     JOHN
                         Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? 
                         Do you understand what I'm saying?

                                     NADIA
                         Yes.

                                     JOHN
                         Good. Or should I speak slower?

                                     NADIA
                         Yes.

                                     JOHN
                         Do you follow or should I speak 
                         slower?

                                     NADIA
                         Yes.

               He looks across. Back at the road. He changes gear.

                                     JOHN
                         Uh... Are you a giraffe?

                                     NADIA
                         Yes.

               John turns to face the road ahead.

                                     JOHN
                              (to himself)
                         Oh Jesus.

               He drives in silence.

                                     JOHN
                         Oh Jesus.

               Suddenly she winds the window down and vomits out of the 
               speeding car. John panics and swerves onto the hard shoulder 
               amidst loud horn blasts.

               EXT. HARD SHOULDER - DAY

               John navigates his way round the Rover in the rain to find 
               her kneeling on the verge, throwing up. He puts a hand on 
               her shoulder, but she stands up quickly, maintaining an icy 
               dignity considering what has just happened.

               EXT. JOHN'S CLOSE - DAY

               It has stopped raining and a group of young boys are playing 
               cricket in the road. They clear as a Yellow Rover pulls into 
               the Close, and into the drive of the little house at the 
               end.

               As John climbs out of his car he eyes the boys. The boys eye 
               him, and his new friend.

               INT. JOHN'S HOUSE - DAY

               The front door closes behind them. John and Nadia stand in 
               the silence of his hallway. There is a small banner hanging 
               there: "Welcome Nadia". They study the banner together, 
               gravely.

               Eventually he opens a door.

                                     JOHN
                              (quietly)
                         Lounge.

               She peers round him and looks inside. He leads her down 
               towards the kitchen.

                                     JOHN
                         Kitchen.

               She glances around it. Then back at John. He nods to himself, 
               looking tense and pale.

               INT. JOHN'S UPSTAIRS LANDING - DAY

               He puts her suitcase down on the landing, and opens a door. 
               Without looking inside:

                                     JOHN
                         Bathroom.

               He closes it.

               INT. MAIN BEDROOM - DAY

               Standing in the doorway of John's bedroom.

                                     JOHN
                         Bedroom.

               There it is. The Double Bed. John frowns gravely.

               Without warning, he marches out. She comes out onto the 
               landing to catch John plus suitcase kicking open another 
               door and vanishing inside.

               INT. SPARE BEDROOM - DAY

               Nadia peers around the door to find John standing next to a 
               narrow monk-like single bed.

                                     JOHN
                         The uh... the other bedroom...

               She looks at it, then up at John. She turns and walks out.

               Now she's back, with her camouflaged hold-all, dumps it onto 
               the floor, heaves the suitcase onto the bed and smoking no-
               hands, starts unpacking. John plugs in the lamp by the bed. 
               To show Nadia how it works he switches it on, off, on, off, 
               and then feels stupid.

                                     JOHN
                         I'll get an ashtray.

               With John gone, Nadia stops unpacking. She walks to the window 
               and stares out over the rooftops of the estate.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LOUNGE - DAY

               John on the phone.

                                     ANSWER MACHINE
                         You have reached From Russia with 
                         Love. Our office reopens on Monday. 
                         If you are interested in our 
                         services...
                              (etc. etc.)
                         Thank You.

                                     JOHN
                         This is John Buckingham from St 
                         Albans. I need to speak to you 
                         urgently. There's a critical problem. 
                         It's... Call me back as soon as 
                         possible. It's critical.

               INT. STAIRS / LANDING - DAY

               John climbs the stairs holding a saucer for an ashtray. He 
               knocks lightly on the spare room door.

               INT. SPARE ROOM / LANDING - DAY

               Nadia is lying asleep on the bed in only her black underwear. 
               We duck straight back out.

               John composes himself. He puts his head back round the door 
               as if there's a real chance it will be shot off. She's facing 
               away, arms folded, still holding the cigarette. It has burnt 
               out, leaving a long curl of ash on her bare hip.

               He approaches the bed with immense trepidation, eases the 
               cigarette from between her fingers and drops it in the bin. 
               He stares at her bare hip, with the ash on it. Holding the 
               saucer under the ash, he blows on it gently. It takes three 
               careful breaths before it drops in the saucer. Unseen by 
               John, her eyes are wide open as he steals out onto the 
               landing. We stay with her a moment.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A pot of stew, bubbling on the hob.

               INT. KITCHEN - DAY

               John is stirring a pot on the hob. By his expression he might 
               be defusing a bomb.

               His head cocks, he stiffens. Nadia walks right into the 
               kitchen. She's changed, jeans and a tee shirt. Nadia takes 
               the spoon from him, says something in Russian, gestures for 
               him to sit.

               She tastes the stew. Now she stirs the pot. He watches her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KITCHEN - DAY

               John and Nadia sit opposite each other. She takes a mouthful. 
               They catch one another's eye. And again.

               On the wall across, six ants careen in crazy circles. John 
               can see them, but doesn't move.

               He puts his fork down.

                                     JOHN
                         I don't know what to say. Your letters 
                         were in English. Good English. You 
                         said you'd studied English.

               Nadia reaches down into her bag and pulls out a small box 
               wrapped in brown paper. She places it in front of him.

               He warily unwraps a little wooden box. He opens the lid and 
               fishes out a simple gold ring. He holds it in his palm.

                                     JOHN
                         I can't take this.

               He puts it back in the box, hoping it will disappear.

               She fishes it out again and holds it on her palm for him to 
               take.

                                     JOHN
                         I can't take it. I'm not really a 
                         ring guy.

               She takes his hand. He automatically yanks it away like he's 
               been burned. She takes his hand again and to stop it becoming 
               unbearable, he allows Nadia to push the ring onto his ring 
               finger. It goes on easily.

                                     JOHN
                         Okay. No big deal. Thank you. Yes 
                         thanks. Thank you.

               INT. LOUNGE - NIGHT

               John and Nadia sit next to each other on the couch watching 
               T.V. John's gaze seems to go through the T.V. and a thousand 
               yards beyond. Nadia is knitting a half-finished jumper, blood 
               red.

               John stands and disappears out of shot.

                                     JOHN (O.S.)
                         If anyone gets this message please 
                         call as soon as possible. It's an 
                         emergency.

               John sits back down. He steals side-glances at her. Her mouth. 
               Her red-painted fingers knitting fast.

               John flips through the channels --

               The Money Programme. 
               Antique's Roadshow. 
               Cup Rugby.

               Eventually he offers Nadia the remote control. She takes, 
               aims it at the T.V. but doesn't press it. Just as it seems 
               she won't, she does: University Challenge.

               They watch University Challenge with Nadia still aiming the 
               control and smoking. After another long pause she flips the 
               button --

               The Money Programme. 
               Antiques Roadshow. 
               Rugby.

               She flips again then hands the controls back to John and 
               they watch University Challenge.

               Nadia puts down her knitting, stretches and yawns.

               INT. LOUNGE / STAIRS - NIGHT

               Nadia climbs the stairs. John watches her, hovering in the 
               doorway of the darkened lounge.

               He hears the bathroom door close before venturing up.

               INT. BEDROOM - DAY

               John sits on the edge of his bed. He cocks his head:

               Door opening and shutting; feet padding along landing; door 
               closing. Silence. He squeezes his door open and peers down 
               the dark landing. The coast is clear.

               INT. BATHROOM - DAY

               Brushing his teeth, staring accusingly at his reflection. 
               Spits. Finished, he takes a deep breath and opens the door, 
               and gives a small shout.

               Nadia is standing right outside the door; Nightshirt, damp 
               hair, toothbrush in her mouth.

                                     JOHN
                         Good night.

               He squeezes past and quick-steps down the landing.

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               He climbs into the big bed, fully clothed, turns off the 
               light and lies there in the moonlight.

               After twenty seconds, the bedroom door clicks open. John 
               climbs out of bed as casually as possible and stands around.

                                     JOHN
                         You should go now. We'll talk in the 
                         morning.

               His eyes widen but he can't speak. He wants to but she's 
               placed her hand across his mouth. She reaches down and takes 
               his hand, and draws it towards her, slowly tracing his fingers 
               across her breasts. She unbuttons her shirt and pulls his 
               hand inside.

               He's breathing hard, her right hand still clasped over his 
               mouth. Her free hand lowers to press against him, and unzip 
               his fly. He lets out a moan.

               We concentrate on their faces. Above the silence all we can 
               hear is John's breathing -- Before long Nadia looks down -- 
               He's come.

               Nadia turns and walks out, leaving John marooned, gasping in 
               and blowing out, angry almost, buttoning his trousers.

               EXT. JOHN'S CLOSE - NIGHT

               Exterior view of John's darkened house. A fox trots across 
               the Cul-De-Sac and sits under John's car, where it curls up.

               INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               John lying in bed staring out at a streetlight.

               INT. NADIA'S ROOM - DAY

               The morning. Nadia opens her eyes in the sun-filled room.

               INT. LANDING - DAY

               She pads down the hall in her nightshirt and opens the door 
               to the bathroom. There on the toilet, naked, is John. He 
               gives another short shout. Nadia holds his eye for a couple 
               of seconds too long, before shutting us inside with him.

               EXT. JOHN'S GARDEN - DAY

               John sprints down his lawn, scattering the big black crows 
               eating his garden. He jumps the fence, and across the fields.

               EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

               John jogs along by a river in the countryside behind his 
               house, wearing shorts and a tee shirt. His breath billows 
               around him in the sharp morning air.

               He stops running by a gate overlooking a small hill. He 
               doubles up to recover, panting hard.

               INT. JOHN'S GARDEN - DAY

               Two wild rabbits are nibbling the remains of a big breakfast 
               left on the lawn. John climbs heavily back over his fence.

               There's a deck chair out there, surrounded by the remains of 
               breakfast. Some glossy Russian magazines, a full ashtray, 
               Nadia's knitting.

               The patio door is ajar, the net curtain billowing. He scans 
               the garden jumpily. The boy next door is on his trampoline, 
               bouncing up and down, watching John at the top of each bounce.

               INT. JOHN'S HOUSE - DAY

               Sweating from the run, John peers up the stairs. The house 
               is silent. In the lounge he picks up the phone and dials a 
               number.

                                     ANSWER MACHINE
                         You have reached From Russia With 
                         Love. If you are interested...

               He hangs up.

               INT. LANDING - DAY

               John stands with his ear to the bathroom door. The shower's 
               on.

               INT. NADIA'S BEDROOM - DAY

               It's empty. He slips inside.

               Stuff everywhere. Cigarette cartons, several lighters, spare 
               wool, suitcase, rucksack. Huge poster of Bruce Springsteen 
               on wall.

               Warily, he opens the bedside drawer: Different coloured bras 
               and knickers.

               In her open suitcase lies a small wooden chest. He lifts it 
               out and puts it on the bed, hesitates, then opens it.

               A pair of Russian Army field binoculars. He puts them on the 
               bed beside him. A small silver pistol, the size of a 
               Derringer. He studies it, and pulls the trigger. It's a 
               cigarette lighter.

               A brochure of prospective husbands provided by the marriage 
               agency. After a dozen or so photos he comes across his page 
               but the photo has been cut out. He sees his name in the 
               strange lettering, under the hole.

               INT. BATHROOM - DAY

               Nadia in the shower, eyes shut, water pouring over her face.

               INT. NADIA'S ROOM - DAY

               John flicks through a stack of photographs. One of Nadia as 
               a young girl in a meadow, with binoculars around her neck -- 
               John looks at the same binoculars on the bed next to him. He 
               turns them over in his hands.

               He looks through them. He slowly lowers them. He's seen 
               something. He stands and crosses the room.

               On the mantelpiece, in a silver frame, is his picture, cut 
               from the brochure. He holds it in his hands.

               The shower has stopped. In a panic he replaces the picture, 
               the photographs, the gun lighter, the brochure, and the 
               binoculars.

               INT. LANDING - DAY

               Nadia leaves the bathroom, hair wrapped in a towel, and heads 
               straight towards us.

               INT. NADIA'S BEDROOM - DAY

               John shuts the chest, drops it back into the suitcase.

               The photo of the binoculars girl is on the pillow. He whips 
               it under the bed just as Nadia enters.

               She doesn't seem surprised to see him standing there, in her 
               room, in his tee shirt and running shorts.

                                     JOHN
                         Nadia. This isn't going to work. I'm 
                         sorry. It's been a terrible mistake. 
                         You must go.

               He takes the ring off and holds it out to her. She doesn't 
               take it. He puts it on the bed.

                                     JOHN
                         I'm booking a flight for tomorrow. 
                         I'm sorry.

               John and Nadia on her bed, Nadia tearing off his tee shirt. 
               She gets on top.

               EXT. JOHN'S CLOSE - DAY

               The milkman hops a low fence between two houses. He waves to 
               a man watering his rose trees.

               INT. NADIA'S ROOM - DAY

               John and Nadia having sex. They don't take their eyes off 
               each other.

               EXT. JOHN'S CLOSE - DAY

               A mother corrals her school children into a Volvo. They don't 
               want to go.

               INT. NADIA'S ROOM - DAY

               John sits on the edge of the bed, holding his head in his 
               hands. The door has just shut behind him. He looks at his 
               left hand. He has the ring on.

               We move fast through the banking hall to the furthest counter. 
               The blind snaps up to reveal John, wearing a smart suit.

                                     VOICE OVER

                         larger problems...

               INT. BEHIND THE GLASS - DAY

               John's skilled hands loading a stack of banknotes into a 
               drawer. The cashier next along, Clare, smiles at him.

                                     CLARE
                         Good weekend?

               INT. BRANCH MANAGER'S OFFICE - DAY

               John sits in front of a large desk, hands on knees.

                                     BRANCH MANAGER (O.S.)
                         When communicating he is good at 
                         selecting the most efficient methods 
                         and displays effective verbal 
                         communication skills...

               Across the desk the Branch Manager reads a report out loud 
               in an impersonal, flat manner.

                         On one occasion John showed first

                         delicate customer situation.

               INT. JOHN'S KITCHEN - DAY

               Nadia opens a kitchen cupboard and stares inside at John's 
               groceries.

                         to volunteer whenever others need 
                         help. Although he is sometimes 
                         reluctant and or unwilling to ask 
                         for it himself...

               She opens some pickled onions and pops one in her mouth.

               Cradling the jar of onions, she scans his bookshelf.

                         John still has some reluctance to / 
                         or has problems in, carving out new 
                         relationships face to face.

               There is a photo of John, about three years ago, arm in arm 
               with a plain, thin-looking girl, with small eyes. Another of 
               him kissing her on the cheek.

               INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - DAY

               Nadia sees something at the bottom of the cupboard. She bends 
               down to retrieve a black dustbin liner. She reaches in and 
               pulls out a small stack of hardcore pornographic magazines.

                         conscientiously and responds well to 
                         personal directions.

               She upends the bag and a half dozen videos fall out. She 
               picks up a magazine and begins flicking through it 
               impassively.

               INT. LOUNGE - DAY

               Nadia downstairs kneels in front of the T.V. and slips a 
               video into the machine. Nadia's face is lit up by the screen. 
               The sound of sex.

                         John is normally very punctual and 
                         in most situations assumes 
                         responsibility for his own actions 
                         and outcomes.

               She pops a pickled onion in her mouth, and watches. We see 
               the images close and pixellated, as we did the marriage videos 
               in the titles. It's a bondage scene, the woman wears a gag.

               INT. BRANCH MANAGER'S OFFICE - DAY

               John back in the room. The report has finished and the manager 
               is scrutinising him in silence.

                                     JOHN
                         Thank you -- I think that's very 
                         fair.

               INT. / EXT. JOHN'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

               John drives his Rover through the centre of town, the low 
               orange sun on his face.

               EXT. JOHN'S CLOSE - DAY

               The Rover pulls into the driveway. John opens the glove 
               compartment and removes the ring Nadia gave him, and puts it 
               back on. He collects a brown paper package from the passenger 
               seat.

               INT. JOHN'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

               John and Nadia at the supper table. She is knitting the 
               jumper. Despite the silence, John seems more relaxed, in 
               shirtsleeves and loosened tie. He puts his fork down, and 
               places the brown bag on the table, pushing it across to Nadia. 
               She opens it and removes a big hardback Russian - English 
               dictionary. John smiles and nods "open it". She flicks through 
               it.

               She turns it over in her hands, nods, puts the book down, 
               reaches under the table and surfaces with the stack of porn 
               magazines. She puts them on the table next to the dictionary.

               John beholds the pile. "Wet N' Wild" is on top.

               He rises slowly from the table and sleepwalks from the 
               kitchen.

               INT. JOHN'S HALL / STAIRS / LANDING / BATHROOM - DAY

               John, frozen-headed, floats down the hall, up the stairs 
               into the bathroom, locks the door, sits on the toilet.

               INT. JOHN'S KITCHEN - DAY

               Downstairs Nadia clears, the dishes. The porn stack still 
               sits on the table, beside the dictionary.

               INT. BATHROOM - DAY

               Still on the toilet. He hasn't moved. He closes his eyes.

               INT. LANDING - NIGHT

               It's dark. The bathroom door opens a crack. The coast clear, 
               he dashes for the cover of his bedroom.

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               John rests his head against the doorframe and heaves a sigh 
               of relief. He turns and freezes. Nadia is there next to him.

               She slowly loosens his tie. Holding it in her hands she 
               examines the strange little bank logo on it, before 
               deliberately tying the tie over her mouth like a gag.

               A second tie is pulled from a hanger in the cupboard. Quickly 
               and skillfully she ties her hands together, pulling it tight 
               with her teeth. Finished, she flicks her hair back, and gives 
               him a long, level look.

                                     VOICE OVER
                         It will feel very strange at first 
                         but then you get used to it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ROOM IN THE BANK - DAY

               A close up of John's face. He closes his eyes, falls 
               backwards, and is caught in the arms of a colleague.

                                     TRAINER
                         Good. Again.

               John stands again and closes his eyes. After a short wait he 
               falls back and again his colleague catches him just before 
               he hits the ground.

                                     TRAINER
                         Very good. How does that feel John?

                                     JOHN
                         It feels good. Weird.

                                     TRAINER
                         It's called Trust and Letting Go.

               John nods.

                                     TRAINER
                         Trust and Letting Go.

               A simple guitar theme begins, and plays over the following 
               sequence:

               Kids playing cricket in John's Close. A boy hits the ball 
               and others chase it as it bounces off cars.

               John at dusk tied to the bed with his two bank ties. Nadia 
               is on top. They are having sex.

               Hands stacking bank notes into the back of a cash machine. 
               Fast, mechanical.

               At the bank, John walks to his desk. His phone rings. He 
               answers it.

               Silence. Then soft breathing. John listens intently and looks 
               around.

               "Nadia...?" -- John sits there, surrounded by his colleagues, 
               listening to Nadia breathe.

               Close up on a man's hands tying a tie tight a-round a woman's 
               wrist. Pull back to a close up of Nadia's face, her eyes 
               fixed on John.

               John running by the river.

               John watches Nadia rise from his bed after sex and leave the 
               room. He stares out the window.

               Nadia's fingers, knitting skillfully.

               Nadia sits on her bed alone, pulling on black stockings and 
               attaching them to suspenders.

               The street cricketers run for cover as a thunder storm breaks 
               over the close.

               Rain coming down in John's garden. The pair sit under the 
               shelter of the back porch. John has his hands out as Nadia 
               is winding red wool it into a ball. The jumper is half 
               finished.

               The rabbits shelter from the rain under broad leaves.

               John in a pub with a four colleagues from the bank. He sips 
               his half, half listening to the conversation. It all seems 
               so dull. He finishes his drink and looks at his watch. They 
               ask him if he's staying for another.

               A knitting needle is drawn from a row of red stitches on the 
               nearly-finished jumper.

               Nadia kneels over John holding the knitting needles. She 
               presses one to his skin and we watch it drawn across his 
               chest in close up, up to his neck.

               His eyes are fixed on hers.

               Close up on Nadia's face. Her mouth is gagged and she's lying 
               on her front, head half-buried in a pillow. We can just make 
               out John behind, on top of her. Both are lying still and 
               breathing hard, covered in sweat. Catching her breath Nadia 
               yanks the gag off and wriggles out from underneath him. She 
               snatches up a towel and covering herself hurries to the 
               bathroom.

               The guitar theme ends.

               INT. LANDING - NIGHT

               John presses his ear to the bathroom door. The sound of 
               retching.

               The toilet flushes. John pads back to his bedroom. Through 
               the gap in the door he sees Nadia coming out, go to her room, 
               and shut the door. He rests his head against the door frame.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LOUNGE - DAY

               A beautiful morning. Through the patio window, John watches 
               Nadia in the garden, sitting on the lawn reading her 
               dictionary in the sunlight. In dungarees with her hair up, 
               she looks very young.

               EXT. GARDEN - DAY

               He walks warily out into the sunlight. She looks up, then 
               back to the big book in her lap. He places the tea next to 
               her on the grass.

                                     JOHN
                         Are you O.K.?

               She looks at him, then down at her tome. She speaks slowly, 
               in a heavy accent:

                                     NADIA
                         Today is bath day.

                                     JOHN
                         Sorry?

               She studies her book. Looks up.

                                     NADIA
                         Today is bath day.

               He shakes his head.

                                     JOHN
                         Bath day?

               She nods.

                                     JOHN
                         I don't understand.

                                     NADIA
                         Happy bath day.

               The penny drops.

                                     JOHN
                         Today?

               She frowns. John leafs through the dictionary.

                                     JOHN
                         Syevodnya?

                                     NADIA
                         Syevodnya

                                     JOHN
                         Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday.

               He puts his hand on her shoulder.

                                     NADIA
                         Party.
                              (pause)
                         Party. Syevodnya.

               John nods, smiling.

                                     JOHN
                         Yes. Party. Party syevodnya.

               She lights a cigarette from the butt of her last. Blows smoke. 
               She holds the jumper up to John, as if to try it for size, 
               and the theme returns.

               INT. KITCHEN - DAY

               John is on the telephone.

                                     JOHN
                         ...It might just be a twenty-four 
                         hour bug...

               INT. BANK - DAY

               Clare listens, concerned.

                                     CLARE
                         Well you just get better. I'll tell 
                         Beaky. You just get some rest, ok?

               INT. KITCHEN - DAY

               John puts the phone down. He looks down the hall, where Nadia 
               is killing ants on the table, with her dictionary. He smiles.

               EXT. JOHN'S CAR - DAY

               A shot from above, of the Rover's windscreen, reflecting the 
               passing trees.

               The roof is down. We glide up the windscreen, up Nadia's 
               body, in the passenger seat. Her face is upturned slightly, 
               she's wearing sunglasses, which reflect the passing trees.

               INT. JOHN'S LOUNGE - NIGHT

               Nadia sits alone at the dining room table. Suddenly the lights 
               go out. John enters, carrying a small birthday cake glowing 
               with candles.

               The light throws huge shadows on the walls and flickers across 
               their faces.

               He sets the cake down on the table and sits down opposite 
               Nadia

                                     JOHN
                         Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday 
                         to you. Happy Birthday dear Nadia...

               The front doorbell rings. A loud long burst. Nadia's face 
               transforms into a big grin. She hurries out into the hall, 
               leaving John alone with the cake. Nadia whooping and shouting 
               excitedly. Other voices. Shouting. Shouting in Russian.

               A man bursts in carrying Nadia in his arms. He spins her 
               round in the candlelight, kisses her, puts her down and goes 
               to the table where he blows out the candles. They are plunged 
               into darkness.

               Lots of whooping and laughing. A Zippo flares up and 
               illuminates some faces, all laughing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               John's hand groping along the wall. It finds the light switch.

               There are two men here. One small and wiry, one big and dark, 
               like Rasputin. They each carry rucksacks and a guitar case.

                                     YURI
                         You must be John. You seem very nice. 
                         Excuse me.

               In Russian, the first man introduces Nadia to the other man, 
               who is relighting the candles with a Zippo. It seems they 
               haven't met before.

               The first man, Yuri, pulls out a bottle of vodka and hands 
               it to John.

                                     YURI
                         How's that? We can't drink our piss 
                         can we?

                                     JOHN
                         Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, 
                         who are you?

                                     YURI
                         You must find some glasses, small, 
                         for the toast, and some plates.

                                     JOHN
                         What are you doing here?

               Yuri stops.

                                     YURI
                         Sorry. You've lost me...

                                     JOHN
                         I'm asking what you're here for.

                                     YURI
                         What?

               Yuri speaks to Nadia in fast Russian.

                                     YURI
                              (to John)
                         You don't speak Russian? Pratsteetye! 
                         This explains your cold eyes.

               Nadia begins gabbling to Yuri in Russian. Yuri says the 
               English word -- "Friends".

                                     NADIA
                              (to John)
                         "Frenzy".

                                     JOHN
                         Yes I know.

                                     YURI
                              (himself)
                         Yuri.
                              (Rasputin)
                         Alexei. Alexei and Yuri.

               Alexei speaks.

                                     JOHN
                         What did he say?

                                     YURI
                         He says he feels safe here.

               Nadia talks fast to Yuri.

                                     YURI
                         She says she wanted to tell you but 
                         her English is shit. And no one speaks 
                         Russian, it's very hard for her. The 
                         light please.

               Alexei turns off the light again. Nadia blows out her candles. 
               They are plunged back into darkness. John turns the light on 
               again. Yuri is already sitting down.

                                     JOHN
                         I need to know who you are first 
                         please.

                                     YURI
                         Oh.
                              (Yuri stands)
                         We are Russian.

                                     JOHN
                         Yes. I know.

                                     YURI
                         Good.
                              (he sits down)

                                     JOHN
                         And...

                                     YURI
                         And what? You mean from the beginning? 
                         Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in 
                         Russia can I cut a long story short. 
                         Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. 
                         Except she's not. But we say cousin. 
                         This is for you.

               He hands John another bottle of vodka.

                                     JOHN
                         Hold on.

                                     YURI
                         Toast first then we talk seriously, 
                         I can see you are serious about us.

               Vodka is splashed into their glasses. Yuri raises his glass 
               and shouts a toast in Russian: "Vashe Zdarovye!". They down 
               their vodka, John sips at his, then realises he must finish 
               it. Yuri makes as if to throw his in the fireplace.

                                     YURI
                         Just kidding.

               Sausages, cheese, bread and pickle bottles rain onto the 
               table from Yuri's rucksack.

                                     JOHN
                              (to Yuri)
                         So hang on. You're both Nadia's 
                         cousins?

                                     YURI
                              (shaking his head)
                         Of course not. Alexei, he's is my 
                         problem.

                                     JOHN
                         Right.

                                     YURI
                         We better watch him. He's crazy.

                                     JOHN
                         Right.

                                     YURI
                         I am actor, he is actor, although he 
                         is an actor stroke musician. I just 
                         noodle along, I'm not so good. He 
                         makes me look like a retard -- He 
                         smokes me. I don't mean he smokes 
                         me.

               Yuri mimes giving a blow-job.

                                     YURI
                         I mean he smokes me. Do you say 
                         "smoke" in U.K.?

               He mimes the blowjob again.

                                     JOHN
                         No.

                                     YURI
                         Right. So I can say he smokes me. 
                         So.

               Pause.

                                     JOHN
                         So?

                                     YURI
                         So I come to England with other actors 
                         to make shows, I meet this freak 
                         from Novgorod I tell him of you and 
                         Chicken and the birthday here we 
                         are.

               Yuri speaks to Nadia in Russian, she replies looking at John.

                                     JOHN
                         What was that?

                                     YURI
                         I asked her if you were happy to see 
                         us. I find it hard to tell with you.

                                     JOHN
                         Yes it's okay. Thank you for the 
                         food.

               Nadia lights a cigarette. John notices that on both wrists 
               she has bold red marks from the ties. He freezes.

                                     YURI
                         She says you are a little shy. I 
                         think I know this.

               John is thrown, panicking that one of them will notice the 
               marks.

                                     JOHN
                         So how long will you be in England?

                                     YURI
                         Plans are for the architects, 
                         politicians and so forth.

                                     JOHN
                         You must have a visa or something...

                                     YURI
                         You're asking for my documents?

                                     JOHN
                         No, no...

               Yuri laughs, translates for Alexei and they both get a big 
               laugh out of this. Yuri gets his passport out and makes a 
               big show of presenting it to John. But John keeps glancing 
               at the marks on Nadia's wrists. We see a close up of her 
               neck. There is the tiniest blood mark. John sees it and starts 
               to sweat.

                                     YURI
                         We are all Europeans here. Europe, 
                         Tony Blair and Maggie Thatcher!

               Yuri raises his glass and they all drink to Tony Blair and 
               Margaret Thatcher. John drinks his vodka in two hot gulps.

                                     YURI
                         So. You have nothing to say to your 
                         Fiancee? Maybe to wife of forty years 
                         it's understandable. Come on. You 
                         speak and I will translate.

               John looks glazed. The room falls silent.

                                     JOHN
                         Hello.

               Yuri translates -- She replies.

                                     YURI
                         She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it 
                         John!

                                     JOHN
                         Uh. Do you like England?

                                     YURI
                         Classic!
                              (he translates)
                         Thank God. She says 'Yes!'

               John nods. He watches Nadia tap ash. The wrist again.

                                     JOHN
                         Uh...

               They all wait. Yuri nods encouragingly.

                                     JOHN
                         I can't think of anything. Hang on.

               Nadia speaks in Russian to Yuri.

                                     YURI
                         She says she has a secret to tell.

                                     JOHN
                         What?

               Nadia speaks. John waits uncomfortably. Silence.

                                     YURI
                         She says she watched you at the 
                         airport.

               John stops.

                                     JOHN
                         When?

                                     YURI
                              (translating)
                         "I saw you waiting there, by the 
                         gate."

                                     JOHN
                         I...

                                     YURI
                         "I have these uh..." She explains to 
                         you... "When I was a little girl my 
                         father had these beautiful old 
                         glasses." Like... I don't know the 
                         word. Like for watching uh... for 
                         watching the birds.

               We see John's face.

                                     JOHN
                         Binoculars.

                                     YURI
                         Binoculars. He had these Binoculars 
                         he has kept from the war.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Scene 1 reprise.

               EXT. SUMMER MEADOW - DAY

               A young girl runs through a summer meadow with a pair of 
               Russian Army field binoculars, around her neck.

                                     YURI (V.O.)
                         I would run around with them taking 
                         pictures of things I liked with my 
                         mind. If I saw something beautiful I 
                         would take a picture.

               With the binoculars pressed to her face, she spies 
               butterflies, birds, a rabbit. She stops running and aims the 
               binoculars up, up, into the sun

               INT. JOHN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Yuri translates.

                                     YURI
                         The day before I left Russia my father 
                         gave me the old binoculars. He said 
                         that when I saw you I was to stand 
                         far away and look at you with these, 
                         and to examine your face closely. 
                         And if you were a bad person I could 
                         run away.

               Nadia looks at the table.

                                     YURI
                         She says she took a picture.

               John watches Nadia looking at the table. She glances up once 
               and catches his eye.

               Alexei suddenly slams his hand down on the table. He raises 
               his palm. There is an ant squashed there. He shows Yuri.

                                     ALEXEI
                         Nasyekski.

               EXT. JOHN'S GARDEN - NIGHT

               The small party has moved outside to the patio, where they 
               sit around a low wooden table in the mellow candlelight. A 
               huge late Summer moon hangs over the fields. Alexei tinkles 
               beautifully on his guitar.

               He stops asks a question in Russian.

                                     JOHN
                         What was that?

                                     YURI
                         Oh nothing.

                                     JOHN
                         Tell me.

                                     YURI
                         No. It is too judgmental.

                                     JOHN
                         Tell me what he said.

                                     YURI
                         He says why did you send to Russia 
                         for a wife.

               Silence. John suddenly looks sick.

                                     YURI
                         You are not ashamed of it? It's no 
                         surprise to want to love.

                                     JOHN
                         No. It's not that.

                                     YURI
                         Do you believe in love?

                                     JOHN
                         I suppose it's... I mean define your 
                         terms.

                                     YURI
                         It's very strange. How many people 
                         are truly themselves with their love? 
                         It is the greatest human disaster 
                         and it is never in the newspapers. 
                         There are no Marches Against 
                         Heartache, no Ministries Against 
                         Loneliness, no Concerts Against 
                         Disappointment. We look away. And 
                         still we know in secret that nothing 
                         is more important to us. The one 
                         thing we all share but don't say. 
                         Look John I will show you something.

               He takes a plate and starts reaching for the food.

                                     YURI
                         Here look, something beautiful from 
                         Russia. Here is Life, there, take 
                         it.

               John accepts the plate.

                                     YURI
                         Here is bread. Khylep. This is work. 
                         We all need this, here eat.

               John eats.

                                     YURI
                         Good. But we cannot survive with 
                         just work, so here is meat and blood. 
                         Myasa. This is family and country, 
                         flesh, strength, eat.

               John bites the sausage.

                                     YURI
                         But again this is not life. Here is 
                         joy and pain. Chyesnok. Without these 
                         life has no flavour, is too serious. 
                         Eat.

               John nibbles some pickled garlic.

                                     YURI
                         But this vodka.
                              (pause)
                         Is love. Only this magic changes you 
                         inside. The moon and the stars and 
                         the sun.

               Yuri offers John the glass. He looks at Nadia, takes it and 
               swigs it down in one. He looks across at Nadia, wiping his 
               mouth, his eyes watering. She looks back at him.

               Alexei begins softly singing a song. As he sings:

                                     YURI
                         This is a love song, a soldier's 
                         song to his beloved -- Alexei, he's 
                         Afghanstya, a veteran of Afghanistan. 
                         He saw terrible things.

               They listen to the beautiful, sad voice. For the second verse 
               Yuri joins in, a slow stirring lament. For the end Nadia 
               joins in too and the three of them begin harmonising 
               beautifully. John watches in the candlelight.

               John, Nadia and Alexei pose with the cake. Nadia puts her 
               arm round John and Alexei. With a FLASH! Yuri takes a 
               Polaroid.

               The guitar theme returns as we see the Polaroid on the table 
               in close up, developing speeded up. John comes into focus, 
               beaming.

               INT. LOUNGE - NIGHT

               We track across the sleeping faces of Yuri and Alexei tucked 
               into their sleeping bags with guitar cases for pillows. John 
               switches the light off and closes the door.

               INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               John and Nadia seen from above lying asleep, with their heads 
               together, in the moonlight. Nadia whispers something in her 
               sleep, in Russian. Fast asleep John mutters something in 
               English. Their sleeping, unintelligible conversation, drifts 
               on in the night.

               INT. BANK - DAY

               John sits at his desk in the open plan office. He looks 
               nervous.

               This is because he is wearing Nadia's ring. People pass his 
               desk, a couple say hello, but they don't notice. He rubs his 
               chin. Nobody notices.

               Eventually his manager approaches.

                                     BRANCH MANAGER
                         Quick word John?

               He leans over the desk.

                                     BRANCH MANAGER
                         This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely 
                         car. Doesn't necessarily give the 
                         right impression.

                                     JOHN
                         Ch...

                                     BRANCH MANAGER
                         To customers approaching the bank 
                         from the rear

                                     JOHN
                              (thrown)
                         Right.

                                     BRANCH MANAGER
                         You can see why it's sensitive?

                                     JOHN
                         Uh... Yes.

               The manager smiles and taps the desk twice.

                                     BRANCH MANAGER
                         I'll leave it on your desk.

               John is left alone.

               INT. HALL / LIVING ROOM - DAY

               The front door opens and John walks into his hall. The two 
               rucksacks are still side by side where they were the night 
               before...

               INT. KITCHEN - DAY

               He opens the fridge and pours himself a glass of orange. He 
               stops -- There on the draining board lies the bloody skin of 
               a rabbit. John jumps out of his skin.

               Next to the rabbit skin is a hand-drawn map. A dotted line 
               winds around the map and ends with an X in a small wood.

               He looks at the rabbit skin, with its eyeless sockets.

               EXT. FOREST - DAY

               John follows a path through a big silent wood, the low sun 
               flaring and catching his white work shirt.

               P.O.V. OF JOHN

               through binoculars, a long way off and squinting into the 
               sun.

               Nadia lowers the binoculars and looks past us.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               John spots some figures lying on the grass in the distance. 
               He heads towards them, and watches them for a moment from 
               thirty yards away.

               Alexei, Yuri and Nadia sit in a small clearing. A blanket, 
               cushions, bread and vodka are scattered around. Yuri is 
               strumming a guitar. Alexei and Nadia are laughing and 
               chatting. He removes a small twig from her hair and flattens 
               it under his big hand. John watches the gesture. It's so 
               intimate they could be lovers.

                                     YURI
                              (calls)
                         John. We can see you hiding.

               John steps out of his hiding place and approaches the group. 
               Alexei has Nadia falling about laughing about something. He 
               smiles at her then nods to John.

               Pieces of cooked rabbit lie in tin foil. Alexei feeds a piece 
               to Nadia with a big hunting knife. Nadia smiles at John, and 
               starts knitting.

                                     YURI
                         How is bank?

                                     JOHN
                         Fine. I thought you were leaving 
                         today.

                                     YURI
                         To be indoors on such a day. It's 
                         crime.

               Nadia stops knitting and takes her shirt off and stretches 
               back to sunbathe in her black bra. Alexei takes the knife he 
               has just finished cleaning and holds the cold wide blade 
               flat above Nadia's bare stomach. Just before pressing it 
               down he looks across at John. Nadia yelps and sits up. They 
               laugh, and Yuri joins in. John laughs uneasily.

               Alexei notices marks on Nadia's midriff. He asks her about 
               them in Russian.

               John goes white, unable to understand Nadia's explanation. 
               He has no idea what she told him.

               EXT. LAKE IN FOREST - DAY

               At sunset, the four run towards a lake in their underwear. 
               They jump and dive in, and begin splashing each other.

               John duck-dives under the water and swims through the sunlit 
               streaked green water. We see him under the water, swimming 
               towards us, caught by the sun's rays.

               John surfaces, and wipes the water from his eyes. He spots 
               Alexei and Nadia playing in the water. Alexei grabs her and 
               throws her in the air and she comes down with a splash.

               John treads water nearby. He watches them both hold their 
               noses and disappear under the surface.

               They've both vanished. John ducks under the water.

               John's underwater P.O.V.: It's too murky to see anything.

               The two surface, breathing hard, laughing. John watches them.

               Alexei holds Nadia tight and looks like he might even kiss 
               her. But instead he ducks her and holds her under the water.

               John treads water nearby. She's been under a long time.

                                     JOHN
                         Hey.

               John begins to swim toward Alexei. Just as he gets near, 
               Alexei lets Nadia surface, coughing and spluttering -- she 
               shouts at Alexei in Russian, angry.

               Alexei makes for her again but she pushes him away, twice, 
               almost slapping him. She is very uncomfortable. She swims 
               away.

               Yuri admonishes his friend in Russian. Alexei stares at John, 
               then swims off powerfully back towards the shore.

                                     YURI
                         He's just having fun. He's maybe too 
                         strong you know...

               John watches Nadia walk out of the lake towards her clothes.

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               John walks into his bedroom. Nadia is on the bed with a 
               dictionary. She puts it down. She speaks very slowly.

                                     NADIA
                         They go. John. They go.

                                     JOHN
                         What's wrong?

                                     NADIA
                         They go.

                                     JOHN
                         Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.

                                     NADIA
                         They go.

               INT. JOHN'S SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

               John stands at the end of the two sleeping bags.

                                     YURI
                         I understand. I'm so sorry

                                     JOHN
                         You can stay tonight.

                                     YURI
                         I have brought you trouble. Maybe I 
                         should have come alone.

                                     JOHN
                         Good night.

               Alexei stares at John as he backs out of the room.

               INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               John closes his bedroom door and slips back into bed. Nadia 
               is already asleep. John lies back in the moonlight, and stares 
               at the ceiling.

               EXT. GARDEN - DAY

               A light summer rain. Drips fall from rose petals.

               INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - DAY

               John opens his eyes. He rolls over towards Nadia, but she's 
               already up and about.

               Alone in his bedroom, John holds the now-finished jumper up 
               to himself. He tries it on. It's a good four sizes too big, 
               the arms are too long and it hangs down to mid-thigh. He 
               looks at himself in the mirror and smiles.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STAIRS / HALL / KITCHEN - DAY

               He pads downstairs in his pants, picks up his mail from the 
               doormat and peers into the living room. The sleeping bags 
               and guitar cases have gone. About to peruse his mail, his 
               eye is caught by something else.

               There is a small wild deer standing in the living room. 
               Looking at him. John stares back at it transfixed, when he 
               hears a scream. The deer starts and bolts out of the patio 
               doors. John is thrown. It was a woman's scream. He goes back 
               out and looks down the hall.

               Twenty feet away, down the hall, is Yuri, sitting on the 
               kitchen floor, his back to the cooker. He's crying.

                                     YURI
                         John. You must call the Police.

               Suddenly Alexei steps between them in the doorway. As he 
               moves out of view, we see he is holding his hunting knife. 
               John hears Nadia cry out, from inside the kitchen. He drops 
               his mail and rushes forward.

               INT. KITCHEN - DAY

               Nadia is tied to a chair. Alexei pulls a gag tight around 
               her mouth and holds the knife to her throat.

                                     JOHN
                         What are you doing?

               Alexei shouts at Yuri in Russian.

                                     YURI
                         John, I'm sorry. It's my fault.

               Alexei shouts again. Nadia is frozen with terror.

                                     JOHN
                         What's he doing? What the fuck are 
                         you doing? Leave her alone.

               Alexei addresses John.

                                     YURI
                         He says sit down. Or he'll cut her.

               Alexei and Yuri shout at each other. Nadia begins crying.

                                     YURI
                         Sit down please.

               John sits across the table from Nadia.

                                     JOHN
                         Tell him to stop and let her go, and 
                         we'll talk.

               The kettle boils. Alexei takes the kettle and holds it over 
               Nadia's head.

               John springs up.

                                     JOHN
                         Put the fucking kettle down.

                                     YURI
                         John.

                                     JOHN
                         Put the fucking kettle down. Tell, 
                         Yuri, tell him put it down or I'm 
                         going to make him.

               Yuri translates -- Alexei replies.

                                     YURI
                         He says you scare him so much he 
                         must go to the toilet in his trousers. 
                         John, he is a soldier. A trained 
                         killer. We must do what he says.

                                     JOHN
                         What? What does he want?

               Alexei speaks.

                                     JOHN
                         What did he say? Tell me!

                                     YURI
                         He says you are very sad ridiculous 
                         man. I don't agree of course. And 
                         that you must pay someone to have 
                         sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a 
                         prostitute. I'm sorry.

                                     JOHN
                         What does he want. The Russian 
                         shithead. What do you want ?

                                     YURI
                         He wants money.

                                     JOHN
                         Tell him to put the kettle down and 
                         I'll give him money.

               Yuri translates this for Alexei. Alexei has a reply.

                                     YURI
                         He wants a lot of money.

                                     JOHN
                         I'll give him money. Tell him to put 
                         the...

                                     YURI
                         He wants the money from your bank.

                                     JOHN
                         I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll 
                         go down there.

                                     YURI
                         You don't understand. He wants all 
                         the money that is in your bank.

                                     JOHN
                         I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh 
                         Jesus.

               The penny drops.

                                     JOHN
                         Oh Jesus.

                                     YURI
                         He is sure you can do this. Of course 
                         you can not.

                                     JOHN
                         Oh Jesus. Of course I can't.

               Alexei doesn't need the translation he tilts the kettle, and 
               a small amount of boiling water trickles onto Nadia's hair. 
               She screams through the gag.

               John tries to reach across to her but Alexei draws the knife 
               and holds it to his face.

                                     JOHN
                         Just leave her alone.

                                     YURI
                         I'm so sorry.

                                     JOHN
                         Leave her alone.

               CLOSE UP On Nadia's terrified eyes, imploring John to help 
               her.

               INT. / EXT. JOHN'S CAR - DAY

               John drives grim-faced through the morning rain. Yuri is 
               next to him staring ahead at the road. Alexei is in the back 
               with Nadia who is still bound and gagged. He's holding his 
               knife to her ribs.

               INT. MULTI-STOREY CAR PARK - DAY

               The car parks on the top floor. John turns off the engine. 
               He looks at Nadia in his rear view mirror but she seems in 
               shock.

               INT. HIGH STREET - DAY

               John strides towards us down St. Albans High Street, carrying 
               the two guitar cases, his raincoat flapping. His eyes look 
               glazed, the busy street sounds around him muffled.

               INT. NATIONAL WESTMINSTER BANK - DAY

               The doors slide apart and John enters his branch. The place 
               is full of customers. He cheeks himself through the security 
               door and into the back.

               INT. OPEN-PLAN OFFICE - DAY

               John walks through the open plan office. His Branch Manager 
               is there with another bank official, and Clare.

                                     BRANCH MANAGER
                         Ah John. This is Robert Moseley, 
                         Head of South East New Business. 
                         Robert, this is John Buckingham.

                                     MOSELEY
                         Hello John.

                                     JOHN
                         Hello.

                                     BRANCH MANAGER
                         I thought you could give us the tour 
                         this morning. Sort of be our Indian 
                         Guide.

                                     JOHN
                         Right.

                                     MOSELEY
                              (i.e. the guitars)
                         Do you play?

                                     JOHN
                         Yes. I do.

                                     CLARE
                         That's John. He's always surprising 
                         you with hidden talents.

                                     MOSELEY
                         I used to be in a band. Keyboards. 
                         Sort of like very loud, uh -- very 
                         loud Marillion.

               They laugh. Pause.

                                     CLARE
                              (to John)
                         Well, Maestro, give us a tune.

               They laugh. Pause.

                                     JOHN
                         I'll give you a tune later.

               The Branch Manager takes John to one side and stage-whispers.

                                     BRANCH MANAGER
                         Take the ball and run with it John.

               INT. BANK CORRIDOR - DAY

               John leads the team down the corridor past the training room 
               where his colleagues are busy with Trust and Letting Go.

                                     JOHN
                         This is uh... This is the uh...

               A colleague passes carrying a file.

                                     PASSING COLLEAGUE
                         Morning John. Give us a tune.

                                     JOHN
                         I'll give you a tune later.

               INT. TRAINING ROOM - DAY

               They enter the training room.

                                     JOHN
                         This is where we're doing Trust and 
                         uh... Trust and Letting Go.

                                     MOSELEY
                         We're not doing this till the fourth 
                         quarter -- Has it, uh -- any results, 
                         has it been been beneficial?

                                     JOHN
                         Yes.

                                     CLARE
                         It's weird at first. Sort of exciting 
                         and frightening at the same time. 
                         Wouldn't you say John?

                                     JOHN
                         Yes.

                                     BRANCH MANAGER
                         We're starting to see results. This 
                         is Karen, who's uh... taking uh... 
                         it.

               They say hello to each other and MOSELEY asks her a couple 
               of questions.

                                     JOHN
                         Excuse me.

               INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

               John nips out and fetches his guitar cases. He rounds the 
               corner, down a couple of steps. He checks himself into the 
               Safe Area. A Colleague passes him.

                                     COLLEAGUE
                         Morning John. Hey, Moseley's here.

                                     JOHN
                         I'll give you a tune later.

               INT. SAFE ROOM DOOR - DAY

               John punches in the security code. He opens the safe door 
               and goes inside, closing it behind him. We see his stricken 
               face peering through the toughened glass.

               INT. TRAINING ROOM - DAY

               Robert Moseley falls backwards into the arms of an employee.

                                     MOSELEY
                         It's weird isn't it.

               A little bored perhaps, Moseley gazes out through the open 
               door. He sees...

               INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

               John bowling out of the safe-room backwards heaving two guitar 
               cases. One bursts open spilling bundles of fifties onto the 
               floor.

               INT. TRAINING ROOM - DAY

               Moseley, the Branch Manager, Clare, and five Trust and Letting 
               Go catchers all watch...

               INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

               John scoops up the money, refasten the case and stand to see 
               them all watching him, as the five Trust and Letting Go 
               fallers crash to the ground in unison.

               EXT. SIDE STREET - DAY

               John hauls ass towards us straight down the middle of the 
               road, a guitar case in either hand, footsteps clapping loudly 
               on the wet cobbles. Alarms sound, dogs bark.

               EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY

               He skis around a corner, and sprints up this other street. 
               We are close by his head, as he sprints one hundred metres.

               EXT. CAR PARK ROOF - DAY

               Running flat out across the car park. Yuri throws open the 
               car door and John hurls the guitar cases inside. He dives 
               in, turns the key in the ignition. The Rover coughs and 
               wheezes. He tries again. It spits and misfires. The third 
               time it catches and lives. John grinds the gears and lurches 
               off.

               INT. MULTI STOREY CAR PARK - DAY

               The Rover hurtles down the ramps.

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               It careens down a side-street.

               INT. / EXT. MOVING ROVER - DAY

               Alexei opens one of the cases and looks inside. He takes a 
               deep breath and swears in Russian.

               He shows what is in the case to Nadia. Her eyes widen.

               Alexei gently lowers the gag and kisses her on the mouth. 
               She returns the kiss hungrily.

               John spots them in the mirror and nearly crashes the car.

               He looks desperately across at Yuri. Yuri is now pointing 
               the big knife at John's ribs. The Russian shrugs almost 
               apologetically.

               In the back seat Nadia has freed herself and is beginning to 
               pull at Alexei's clothes. They begin making out passionately.

               John's eyes slowly lose focus. He turns grey, then white. He 
               drives and we watch the life seep out of him.

               EXT. DUAL CARRIAGEWAY - NIGHT

               Cars tear through the night along the carriage way, past a 
               Happy Eater. We pan round, across the motorway to a single 
               storey run-down Motel.

               INT. MOTEL CHALET 17 - NIGHT

               A crusty motel chalet. Yuri and Alexei are sitting on a double 
               bed counting the money. The T.V. is on in the corner with 
               the sound turned down and there are empty miniatures from 
               the mini-bar scattered around.

               Nadia appears from the kitchenette area. They all seem more 
               relaxed, more themselves, as if what we've seen before was 
               an act. For the first time in the film their conversation 
               appears as English subtitles.

                                     NADIA
                         So?

               Alexei says "SSShhh" He is counting in his head. He stops.

                                     ALEXEI
                              (to Yuri)
                         You first.

                                     YURI
                         Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.

                                     NADIA
                         Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.

                                     ALEXEI
                         There's over eighty thousand here.

               They look at each other, absorbing the moment.

                                     YURI
                         Sweet Jesus...

               He lies back on the bed and chuckles.

                                     ALEXEI
                         Put it in the cases. Split it up. 
                         And don't forget you owe me £150.

                                     YURI
                         What for?

                                     ALEXEI
                         You know what for.

                                     YURI
                         No I don't.

                                     ALEXEI
                         I got you those trousers from Paul 
                         Smith.

                                     YURI
                         I've been buying you stuff all week. 
                         I've been buying him stuff all week.

                                     ALEXEI
                         Such as?

               Nadia is smiling at them as they squabble.

                                     YURI
                         When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. 
                         Who paid? When we went to see 'Cats'. 
                         Who paid?

                                     ALEXEI
                         Those aren't presents. That's normal 
                         friendship stuff

                                     YURI
                         I paid for those guitar cases.

                                     NADIA
                         What was 'Cats' like?

                                     YURI
                         It was alright.

                                     ALEXEI
                         Yeah it was okay.

                                     YURI
                         Yeah. It was quite good actually. 
                         Some bits I really liked.

                                     ALEXEI
                         The sets were good.

                                     YURI
                         The sets were excellent. Everything 
                         was big, you know, all the rubbish, 
                         coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, 
                         so when you were watching it you 
                         felt cat size. It was really clever.

               Yuri goes into the bathroom, leaving Nadia and Alexei alone 
               on the bed.

               Alexei runs his hand across Nadia's cheek.

                                     ALEXEI
                              (softly)
                         So. How many times did you have to 
                         fuck him?

               INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Yuri in the bathroom, he undoes his flies pees. At the other 
               end of the bathroom, tied to the bidet, gagged, is John.

                                     YURI
                         How you doing?

               John refuses to meet his eye. Yuri flushes and wipes his 
               hands.

                                     YURI
                         I'll show you something. It should 
                         make all this easier I think.

               From his back pocket, Yuri takes out an old envelope. He 
               opens it and removes a dozen or so Polaroids.

               John looks down at the first Polaroid. Nadia, Alexei and a 
               man John doesn't recognise at a birthday party. There is a 
               cake with candles and everyone is smiling. The next picture 
               is the same. And the next.

               Sometimes Germany, sometimes France, but otherwise the 
               pictures are the same, each 'fiancee' beaming with his arm 
               round Nadia, Alexei looking on.

               John studies the faces of his fellow dupes and at last comes 
               to his own picture. Despite himself tears come to his eyes.

                                     YURI
                         Not all these bastards were like 
                         you, believe me. You should not too 
                         feel bad.

               Yuri takes John's left hand and pulls off Nadia's ring. He 
               puts it in his pocket.

               INT. MOTEL BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Alexei smokes on the bed. Nadia is lying the other way. She 
               holds her hand out for his cigarette and he passes it. They 
               have the relaxed air of longtime lovers.

               Subtitles again.

                                     NADIA
                         It's enough isn't it?

                                     ALEXEI
                         What do you mean?

                                     NADIA
                         You know what I mean babe, It's 
                         enough. We can stop.

                                     ALEXEI
                         Do you want to stop?

                                     NADIA
                         Yes.

                                     ALEXEI
                         We'll stop then.

               They kiss. He takes her hand, and notices the tie marks on 
               her wrists.

                                     ALEXEI
                         What's this?

                                     NADIA
                         It's nothing. I burnt myself.

                                     ALEXEI
                         That's not a burn.

                                     NADIA
                         It is. I did it cooking.

               They sit there looking at each other.

                                     ALEXEI
                         On both wrists?

               Nadia looks back at him. The seconds pass.

                                     NADIA
                         What? I did it cooking.

               Alexei studies her face. She pulls a face. He keeps staring.

                                     NADIA
                         What?

               They sit there in silence. Alexei is so big, and she is so 
               small.

                                     NADIA
                         Listen, I made you something.

               Nadia leans over the bed, and searches in her bag. Alexei 
               watches her closely. She comes back up with the jumper she 
               has knitted.

                                     NADIA
                         Put it on.

               He looks at the jumper, then back at her.

                                     NADIA
                         It's taken me weeks. I want to see 
                         you in it.

               She starts pulling at his shirt. Eventually he pulls the 
               jumper on. It fits perfectly.

                                     NADIA
                         Do you like it?

                                     ALEXEI
                         Yeah.

               He is still staring at her.

                                     NADIA
                         Say thank you.

                                     ALEXEI
                         Thank you.

               She takes his hands. He is still looking at her. He strokes 
               his hair. He places his big hand around her throat and holds 
               it there, holding her at arms length. She doesn't react, but 
               just looks levelly back at him. They sit like this for about 
               ten seconds, looking at each other.

                                     NADIA
                         We're going to have a baby.

               Alexei seems not to relax. He keeps his hand there.

                                     ALEXEI
                         What?

                                     NADIA
                         You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. 
                         I've been throwing up for weeks.

               Alexei removes his hand. Now he seems shocked. He lights a 
               cigarette.

                                     NADIA
                         We're having a baby.

               Pause.

                                     ALEXEI
                         A baby? What are we supposed to do 
                         with a baby?

                                     NADIA
                         Name it.

               She comes to him and holds him. He is still absorbing the 
               news.

               We see Alexei's face over her shoulder, behind her back, 
               unreadable. Behind his back she rubs her wrists.

               INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Some hours later, it's dark outside. John still tied to the 
               bidet. The door opens a crack and somebody slips inside. We 
               hear the toilet seat go down. As his eyes adjust he can dimly 
               see Nadia sitting on the toilet. She doesn't look at him. As 
               she finishes she finally turns and holds his eye. She stands 
               and slips out the door, leaving him alone.

               EXT. DUAL CARRIAGEWAY - NIGHT

               Cars crawl by on the road outside, their tail-lights 
               stretching over the hill.

               The shot processes and fades into dawn and light.

               The early morning commuters now use the carriageway.

               INT. BATHROOM - DAY

               Bright sunlight pours through a high window. John is still 
               on the toilet. He begins to try to struggle free.

               After a great deal of fierce deadpan shimmying and pulling, 
               he succeeds in loosening his bindings. Freeing an arm, he 
               yanks the duct tape from his mouth and sits there panting.

               The first thing he does is take a pee, then he drinks handfuls 
               of water. He catches his reflection but can't look at himself.

               INT. MAIN ROOM - DAY

               John collapses in an armchair, rubbing his eyes. He looks 
               shattered.

               The Russians have gone.

               INT. MOTEL BATHROOM - DAY

               John in the shower, just standing there, letting the water 
               hit him.

               INT. MOTEL MAIN SUITE - DAY

               John dries himself in silence. He pulls on his trousers, 
               sits down to do his socks. One sock on, he walks to the 
               smaller bedroom. He opens the door and peers inside.

               INT. SMALLER MOTEL BEDROOM - DAY

               Tied to the radiator, gagged with duct tape, is Nadia.

               John looks down at her. She looks away as her eyes fill with 
               tears.

               He sits on the bed facing her. They stay like that for a 
               long moment before he reaches over and starts untying her 
               knots. He peels the tape off her mouth. Suddenly he slaps 
               her across the face.

               Her head hits the radiator. Nadia gasps hard from the shock 
               of the blow. Without warning she slaps his face, equally 
               hard.

               This starts a long silent fight; kicking, hitting, biting, a 
               real struggle.

               Its intensity is almost sexual, but has the edge of real 
               violence. They end up on opposite sides of the room, both 
               panting, hurt and beaten.

                                     NADIA
                              (in English)
                         Great. You've split my fuckin, lip.

               John lies there on the floor, panting, and he hears the 
               English words.

               Exhausted, John stands, wipes his mouth, and rushes her anew. 
               Nadia dodges out the way and cuffs him painfully on the ear. 
               The whole fight starts again and ends only when neither has 
               the strength to go on. Nadia staggers into the bathroom where 
               she shuts the door and begins to sob uncontrollably. John 
               lies on the bed listening to her cry.

               EXT. DUAL CARRIAGEWAY - DAY

               The mid morning traffic flows by on the dual carriageway.

               INT. HAPPY EATER - DAY

               Nadia and John sit in silence in the half empty diner. Nadia 
               has a cut lip and a graze on her chin. John has a Thousand 
               Yard Stare and a lesion over his left cheekbone.

               The Waitress comes over.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Good morning. What can I get you?

                                     NADIA
                         I'll have an espresso, with a small 
                         pastry, a croissant or something.

                                     WAITRESS
                         We only do a croissant with the 
                         Continental breakfast.

                                     NADIA
                         Just get me a coffee.

                                     WAITRESS
                         One coffee. And for you Sir ?

               John doesn't answer.

                                     NADIA
                         He'll have a coffee.

               The waitress leaves them. Nadia lights a cigarette and they 
               sit in tense silence, the pain of betrayal, and recent 
               violence, thick in the air.

                                     JOHN
                         You can't smoke in here.

               Nadia ignores him. John bellows

                                     JOHN
                         YOU CAN'T SMOKE IN HERE!

               The diner falls silent, people stare. She takes a last drag 
               and crushes the butt on the floor. A waitress comes over and 
               puts down two coffees.

                                     NADIA
                         I don't expect you to understand.

               It seems as if John has no intention of replying. He sips 
               his coffee, and puts it down. He begins speaking very calmly.

                                     JOHN
                         Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy 
                         Assistant of New Business at the 
                         bank would have to listen to the 
                         problems of a great many individuals. 
                         This took a lot of understanding and 
                         sympathy, to try to work out solutions 
                         to their problems. But, you see, I'm 
                         not in that line of work anymore. 
                         Nowadays I'm a bank robber.

                                     NADIA
                         You don't understand anything.

                                     JOHN
                         I think that about covers it. I think 
                         I have grasped the part about you 
                         being dumped though. That's got to 
                         hurt, I imagine. That's got to smart 
                         a bit. I mean strictly in my 
                         observer's capacity it seemed you 
                         two were getting on Pretty Fucking 
                         Famously.

               He sips his coffee.

                                     JOHN
                         Unless. Unless this is part of the 
                         routine. You get tied up, stick 
                         around, distract me, they both bust 
                         in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.

                                     NADIA
                         It's makes it easier. Okay.

                                     JOHN
                         I don't want to know.

                                     NADIA
                         It makes it faster. If I don't speak 
                         to the men, they fall faster. It's 
                         pretty obvious why.

                                     JOHN
                         That's a relief. It's nice to know 
                         I'm a regular guy.

               Pause.

                                     NADIA
                         So what are you going to do?

                                     JOHN
                         I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, 
                         we're going to the police station. 
                         Where there will be lawyers, loss of 
                         job, house, humiliation, gutter press, 
                         and probably prison.

                                     NADIA
                         They don't blame you. When a bank 
                         employee does this they understand. 
                         You get your life back. Anyway I bet 
                         you hated that bank.

                                     JOHN
                         Even so I always felt the decision 
                         to burst in and rob it very much 
                         remained with me.

                                     NADIA
                         Why else would you send off for me? 
                         If you just wanted sex just go to a 
                         prostitute.

                                     JOHN
                         Well as it turns out I did.

               She slaps his face. He slaps hers back. The waitress comes 
               over.

                                     WAITRESS
                         More coffee?

                                     JOHN
                         Yes please.

                                     NADIA
                         No.

               She pours for John.

                                     JOHN
                         Splendid. Thank you.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Pleasure.

               She smiles and leaves them. John watches her walk away.

                                     NADIA
                         John, I need your help.

               This really tickles John. He has to put his coffee down.

                                     JOHN
                         You must think... I'm the biggest 
                         pillock... In the world.

                                     NADIA
                         No I don't.

                                     JOHN
                         In the world.

                                     NADIA
                         I know you just want to punish me --

                                     JOHN
                         I do. I want to very badly.

                                     NADIA
                         So you're just going to be vindictive

                                     JOHN
                         In every sense. If at all possible.

                                     NADIA
                         You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt 
                         already.

                                     JOHN
                         Well, Nadia, It it's all the same to 
                         you, I'd like to give it a bash.

               Pause.

                                     NADIA
                         My name isn't Nadia.

               John stares back at her.

               EXT. HAPPY EATER CAR PARK - DAY

               John drags her by the arm across the car-park towards the 
               Rover.

               EXT. OUTSIDE POLICE STATION

               John drags her out of the Rover. She wrestles her arm free 
               and walks up the steps on her own, with some dignity. John 
               follows her.

               INT. POLICE STATION DUTY DESK - DAY

               They sit side by side in the waiting room, not talking. Nadia 
               looks resigned to her fate. John is tight-jawed, unyielding.

               They wait as the the Duty Sergeant deals with a woman who's 
               lost her hat.

                                     NADIA
                              (quietly, to John)
                         Where's the restroom?

                                     JOHN
                         What?

                                     NADIA
                         I'm going to be sick. Where's the...

                                     JOHN
                         What? No you're not..

                                     NADIA
                         I'm going... I am... I'm going to be 
                         sick.

                                     JOHN
                              (overlapping)
                         No you're not. How... Nice one. How 
                         dumb do you think I am ?

               Nadia stands and addresses the Duty Sergeant.

                                     NADIA
                         Where's the restroom?

                                     SERGEANT
                         The what, love?

                                     NADIA
                         The toilet. Where's...

                                     SERGEANT
                         Down there on the left.

               She heads off. John springs up. He seizes her arm as casually 
               as possible.

               INT. POLICE STATION CORRIDOR - DAY

               John frog marches Nadia down the corridor to the Ladies. She 
               wrestles her arm free again and disappears inside.

               John lurks outside. He seems certain she's got one leg out 
               the window RIGHT NOW.

               He can't bear it any longer. He looks both ways and nips 
               inside.

               INT. LADIES - DAY

               Standing in the Ladies, John hears Nadia in a cubicle, 
               throwing up. He hears the toilet flush.

               Nadia comes out. He looks at her.

                                     JOHN
                         You're pregnant.

               Nadia looks at the floor.

               INT. POLICE CORRIDOR - DAY

               John walks out of the toilet and stands against the wall of 
               the corridor. He looks both ways. After a few seconds Nadia 
               appears in the corridor. They stand there. John isn't looking 
               at her.

               A policeman appears from round the corner, and walks towards 
               them. He stops, and addresses John.

                                     POLICEMAN
                         Can I help you?

               John looks at the Policeman, then at Nadia. The seconds pass.

                                     POLICEMAN
                         Sir? Can I help you?

               John is still looking at Nadia -- He closes his eyes.

                                     JOHN
                         No.

               EXT. OUTSIDE POLICE STATION - DAY

               John walks back to the Rover, Nadia behind. They reach the 
               car. Nadia looks at John over the roof of the car.

                                     NADIA
                         What are you doing?

               John looks sick. He speaks very quietly.

                                     JOHN
                         Get in the car.

               He gets inside. Nadia is left standing there. She gets in 
               too.

               INT. / EXT. JOHN'S CAR - DAY

               John driving with Nadia in the passenger seat. She is looking 
               across at him.

               He is taking no notice.

                                     NADIA
                         Plenty of women have babies in prison.

               John ignores her.

                                     NADIA
                              (tersely)
                         You don't have to do this. I can 
                         look after myself.

                                     JOHN
                              (flatly)
                         Have you got your passport?

                                     NADIA
                         What?

                                     JOHN
                         Shut up. Have you got your passport?

                                     NADIA
                         Yes.

               They drive along.

                                     JOHN
                         We've got to get off this motor-way.

               EXT. MOTORWAY JUNCTION - DAY

               From above we watch the car turn off the motorway, around a 
               roundabout and into a country B road.

               INT. CAR - DAY

               John is turning the pages in his Road Atlas. He is trying to 
               drive and map read at the same time. Nadia is looking out of 
               the window. Soon a big tear rolls down her cheek. She starts 
               to cry.

               John glances up from his map but ignores it. But she keeps 
               crying. He tosses the map in the back, pulls the car to the 
               side of the road and switches off the engine. As Nadia cries, 
               John gazes impassively out of the window. This goes on for 
               almost a minute, until Nadia pulls herself together, when 
               without looking across John restarts the engine and pulls 
               away.

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

               John's car pulling off a B road, into a slip road into a 
               garage.

               EXT. PETROL STATION - DAY

               Stern-faced, John fills the car up with petrol. He eyes the 
               Closed-Circuit.

                                     JOHN
                         Give me some money.

                                     NADIA
                         I don't have any money.

               John stops squeezing petrol.

                                     JOHN
                         What?

                                     NADIA
                         I said I don't have any.

               John stares at Nadia. He eyes the CCTV.

                                     JOHN
                         Give me your sunglasses.

               Nadia passes them and John puts them on,trying to look casual. 
               He gives the pump a couple more squirts, hangs it up, 
               nonchalantly sidles up to his door.

               In one move he opens it, dives in, turns the key in the 
               ignition. The Rover coughs. He tries it again. It howls, 
               barks and sneezes. The attendant comes out onto the forecourt 
               and starts approaching the yellow Rover.

               Miraculously it roars throatily to life, he floors it and 
               the Rover tears away from the station and off down the road

               INT. MOVING CAR - DAY

               We see John at the wheel of his Rover, sunglasses on, wind 
               in his hair, fleeing from the scene of the crime. Nadia 
               watches him in the late sunshine, but John is too busy making 
               a getaway to notice.

               EXT. COUNTRY LANE - DAY

               John's car shimmering as it comes over the brow of a remote 
               country lane, surrounded by fields and rolling hills.

               INT. / EXT. CAR (MOVING) - DAY

               Nadia puts a cigarette in her mouth and pops the dashboard 
               lighter. John takes the cigarette and throws it out the 
               window, followed by the lighter. Nadia just gazes out of the 
               window.

                                     JOHN
                         So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't 
                         his name...

                                     NADIA
                         I don't want to talk about him.

                                     JOHN
                         Fine.

                                     NADIA
                         It's none of your business.

                                     JOHN
                         Fine. Absolutely. Must be 
                         disappointing though. Must come as a 
                         hell of a shock.

               Nadia ignores him.

                                     JOHN
                         So uh...

                                     NADIA
                         Look, if you want to know is he better 
                         in bed than you then yes he is.

                                     JOHN
                         Oh Jesus.

                                     NADIA
                         If what you want to know is does he 
                         have a bigger cock than you, then 
                         yes he does.

                                     JOHN
                              (overlapping -- bigger)
                         Of course. Of course. Of course he 
                         does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.

                                     NADIA
                         But, you know, so what?

               They drive.

                                     JOHN
                         It's his baby I take it.

               She doesn't answer.

                                     JOHN
                         Not the kids type then is he? Not 
                         that broody. You must be pretty 
                         miffed.

                                     NADIA
                         He will come back.

                                     JOHN
                         Excuse me?

                                     NADIA
                         He left me my passport and ticket. 
                         It's pretty clear he wants to see me 
                         again.

                                     JOHN
                         Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon 
                         women I really want to see again 
                         too.

                                     NADIA
                         No. But you tend to tie them up.

               John freezes. He looks across. Nadia gives nothing back.

                                     JOHN
                         Fuck off.

               Nadia is just looking at him.

                                     JOHN
                         Fuck off. You started it.

               She is just looking at him.

                                     JOHN
                         I don't want to talk about it.

                                     NADIA
                         Why not?

                                     JOHN
                         Shut up. I'm not listening.

                                     NADIA
                         You don't want to talk about it.

                                     JOHN
                         No.

                                     NADIA
                         Okay we won't talk about it.

               Nadia looks out the window.

                                     NADIA
                         We'll pretend it never happened.

                                     JOHN
                         So. What's it like having to fuck 
                         men you hate?

                                     NADIA
                         I don't hate you.

                                     JOHN
                         Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have 
                         had sex with people you don't like 
                         haven't you? For money. To make money.

                                     NADIA
                         And? What are you saying?

                                     JOHN
                         And. It's wrong.

                                     NADIA
                         And who says what is wrong.

                                     JOHN
                         And that would be Morals. That would 
                         be one's own moral sense of decency.

                                     NADIA
                         What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me 
                         how it feels exactly.

                                     JOHN
                         So. What then? You just detach sex 
                         from everything..

                                     NADIA
                         Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional 
                         journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's 
                         pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.

                                     JOHN
                         Listen. I didn't go rooting around 
                         in your private stuff.

               John remembers he did. Nadia looks across knowingly.

                                     NADIA
                         Funny. Usually it's the first thing 
                         they do.

               Pause.

                                     JOHN
                         So what? Do you just switch off in 
                         your head or do you imagine you're 
                         with him, or what?

                                     NADIA
                         Sometimes.

                                     JOHN
                         Sometimes which?

                                     NADIA
                         Sometimes neither.

                                     JOHN
                         Some... What does that mean?

                                     NADIA
                         There's nothing wrong in liking sex, 
                         John.

                                     JOHN
                         I don't like sex. I don't think I'll 
                         be having sex ever again.

                                     NADIA
                         Why?

                                     JOHN
                         Well, it's just that the thought 
                         trying to charm up an erection in 
                         front of a woman, or alone for that 
                         matter, makes me want to die.

                                     NADIA
                         So now you hate all women?

                                     JOHN
                         I think it's my safest bet, don't 
                         you?

                                     NADIA
                         Oh. I think you will recover okay. I 
                         think you got what you paid for.

               John looks across.

                                     JOHN
                         What?

                                     NADIA
                         You...

                                     JOHN
                         I got what I paid for.

                                     NADIA
                         You didn't mind too much.

               Pause.

                                     JOHN
                              (quietly)
                         It wasn't what I wanted.

                                     NADIA
                         So what did you want? I think we 
                         understand each other, no?

                                     JOHN
                              (quietly)
                         You don't understand me.

                                     NADIA
                         You don't understand you either.

               John turns to her.

                                     NADIA
                         It's no big thing. You are the same 
                         as most men. You are a man so you 
                         are a savage. Not a monster, but 
                         half animal. You put on a tie and 
                         you go to the bank, but really you 
                         are a beast. But also you are from 
                         woman so you have a soul. Half beast, 
                         half soul. But you hide your beast 
                         in the bottom of the wardrobe. It's 
                         not so healthy. It's fucked you up, 
                         no?

               John stops the car.

                                     JOHN
                         Get out.

               She sits there.

                                     NADIA
                         Excuse me?

                                     JOHN
                         Get out

                                     NADIA
                         You are throwing me out.

                                     JOHN
                         Get out.

               She collects her bag from the back seat, her cigarettes, 
               gathers up her belongings, clicks open the door and gets 
               out, leaving the shot. John sits there staring ahead. We 
               hear her voice offscreen.

                                     NADIA (O.S.)
                         You prefer your women mute.

               John turns the key in the ignition. The engine bellows and 
               screams. Silence.

               He tries again. The engine shrieks and wails like a soul in 
               torment. A terrible, mournful grinding noise. Silence.

                                     NADIA (O.S.)
                         Car trouble?

               John tries to start it. It lets out a whimper, a crying, a 
               few juddering moving sobs, and dies.

               John sits in his dead car. He shakes his head. He rubs his 
               face. He sits there.

               EXT. ROADSIDE VERGE - DUSK

               The two of them on a verge ten feet apart. John stares into 
               the distance.

               Nadia studies the map.

                                     NADIA
                         It's another twenty miles. It's going 
                         dark.

               She gets her holdall from inside the car and stuffs the map 
               inside.

                                     NADIA
                         What now?

               Nadia scans the horizon with her binoculars. John watches 
               her.

                                     JOHN
                         Jesus. You weren't even on the plane.

               Nadia lowers her binoculars and looks at John.

               FLASHBACK - INT. AIRPORT - DAY

               John watches the passengers stream out of the arrivals gate. 
               A woman is greeted and spun around.

               Across the airport, Nadia lowers her binoculars. We pull 
               back to see she is standing next to Alexei.

               They say goodbye in Russian. Even though we don't see 
               subtitles, it's a telling exchange. She kisses him, and he 
               watches her leave him and walk across the floor.

               Alexei watches Nadia approach John, and see him shake her 
               hand.

               They walk away together.

               FLASHBACK - EXT. JOHN'S STREET - NIGHT

               Alexei, dressed in a suit, stands outside John's house, 
               looking up. Nadia is in the window, her lipstick smeared. 
               They gaze at each other.

               EXT. DIFFERENT FOREST - NIGHT

               In a clearing, John watches Nadia carry a pile of sticks to 
               a fire she is building. She lights it with her gun cigarette 
               lighter, and teases the flames to life.

               EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

               John and Nadia sit by the fire. She sits wrapped up to her 
               neck in a blanket.

                                     NADIA
                         You know, in Russia, there's no work 
                         for women. It's a different world.

                                     JOHN
                              (interrupting on 
                              "different")
                         You don't have to say anything

                                     NADIA
                              (overlapping on "say")
                         What? I... I wasn't saying...

                                     JOHN
                              (overlapping on 
                              "saying")
                         Please, there's no... Oh.

                                     NADIA
                         I wasn't saying anything.

                                     JOHN
                         Then okay.
                              (pause)
                         So how old were you when you met 
                         him?

               Pause.

                                     NADIA
                         Fifteen. You don't know him. He was 
                         very kind and strong.

                                     JOHN
                         Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.

                                     NADIA
                         The rest of the world, John, it's 
                         not all like St. Albans.

                                     JOHN
                         Thank Christ for that.

                                     NADIA
                         You are pretty naive if you think it 
                         is.

                                     JOHN
                         I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You 
                         have to do all this, and what have 
                         you got to show for it? Nothing.

                                     NADIA
                         I don't have nothing.

                                     JOHN
                         Well what have you got?

               Pause.

                                     NADIA
                         I have my baby.

               They sit there in the lapping firelight.

                                     JOHN
                         Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?

                                     NADIA
                         No.

                                     JOHN
                         Have you had any before?

                                     NADIA
                         No.

                                     JOHN
                         Are you scared?

                                     NADIA
                         Not really. Maybe a little.

               A fox cries out in the night.

                                     NADIA
                         Listen. I think it's a fox.

               She listens. It cries out again. She gets out her binoculars.

                                     NADIA
                         It sounds close.

               She looks through them and searches the brush. John watches 
               Nadia with her binoculars. He looks suddenly very sad.

                                     NADIA
                         I can't see anything. It's too dark.

               She puts them back in her bag. John watches her. He sees her 
               wrist again. She lights a cigarette, and blows the smoke 
               into the air.

                                     NADIA
                         What happened between you and the 
                         blonde?

                                     JOHN
                         What?

                                     NADIA
                         The thin... the girl with small eyes. 
                         The one in your cupboard.

                                     JOHN
                         It's none of your business. She didn't 
                         have small eyes.

                                     NADIA
                         Did she leave you? Come on. It's 
                         nothing to be ashamed of. Who did 
                         she leave you for? Your best friend? 
                         Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you 
                         for a woman, John?

                                     JOHN
                         She's dead.

               Pause.

                                     NADIA
                         I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt 
                         you. I'm sorry. That's awful. Forgive 
                         me.

               Pause.

                                     NADIA
                         I'm sorry.

                                     JOHN
                         I don't know why I said that. She's 
                         not dead at all.

               Nadia looks at John.

                                     NADIA
                         What?

                                     JOHN
                         I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.

                                     NADIA
                         She's alive?

               Nadia starts to laugh. Long and loud. We have never seen her 
               laugh before.

                                     NADIA
                         She's alive!! She is not dead?

                                     JOHN
                         Laugh it up.

               She starts to cough. She gets on her hands and knees and 
               coughs like fury.

                                     JOHN
                         You should stop smoking. You're 
                         pregnant. You smoke like a fucking 
                         lab dog.

                                     NADIA
                         I'm trying to quit.

                                     JOHN
                         I've got news for you. It's not 
                         working.

                                     NADIA
                         I smoke more these days. I smoke 
                         more when I'm unhappy.

                                     JOHN
                         Nobody's that unhappy.

                                     NADIA
                         Maybe I want to die. Don't you want 
                         me to die?

                                     JOHN
                         I don't want anyone to die.

                                     NADIA
                         Except for Small Eyes.

                                     JOHN
                         Except for Small Eyes.

               She laughs again.

                                     NADIA
                         So why did it end?

               John thinks. It looks as if he's going to tell the whole 
               story. In the end he shrugs.

                                     JOHN
                         I don't know.

                                     NADIA
                         What was her name?

                                     JOHN
                         What's your name?

               The fox cries out again.

                                     NADIA
                         Listen. It's definitely a fox. Now 
                         I'm scared.

               They listen to the fox crying in the night.

                                     NADIA
                         You know you can come under the 
                         blanket.

                                     JOHN
                         It's alright.

               The scene from bird's eye view. John lies back and stares at 
               the stars. Nadia curls up on the other side of the fire, and 
               hugs herself.

               We push down closer and closer until we are on John's face. 
               The theme returns.

               The cricket boys from John's Close stand in a line in the 
               middle of the street, bathed in flashing blue light. We pan 
               round and end on John's house.

               It is surrounded with Police.

               Police cars, Police Vans, plastic police tape "POLICE LINE. 
               DO NOT CROSS."

               John's neighbours press against the tape as officers come 
               and go.

               Inside the house is full of police, ransacking his possessions 
               and dusting fingerprints. A policeman is standing reading 
               The English-Russian Dictionary.

               We push on upstairs and along the landing to the spare room.

               An officer dumps a pile of porno magazines and videos on the 
               bed. He then spots the belts tied to the bedstead and points 
               them out to a detective. They exchange a knowing grin. A 
               photographer steps up and snaps the paraphernalia in a 
               blinding flash.

               The birthday cake is there, half eaten. A Policewoman puts 
               it in a baggy.

               We pan across the bed, across the magazines and underwear in 
               plastic bags, down below the bed, where we find the photograph 
               of Nadia with the binoculars.

               The young girl smiles hopefully out at us from the past.

               Early dawn. A woodpigeon coos. John wakes up next to the 
               dead fire. Nadia is gone.

               EXT. FOREST SLOPE / STREAM - DAY

               John slides down a rocky slope. He scans the forest, but 
               there's no-one around. He hurries through high bracken then 
               stops suddenly by a large oak.

               EXT. STREAM - DAY

               In a pool in a stream below, Nadia is washing herself. She 
               has her back to us.

               John watches her for a moment, before his eyes avert, and 
               his head bows.

               EXT. FIELD - DAY

               A shimmering sun. A giant combine harvester cuts a wide swathe 
               through a field of high corn. As it passes we find John and 
               Nadia coming towards us through the heat haze.

               They aren't speaking and both look tired. As they pass we 
               crane up out of the corn to catch an enormous 757 Jumbo Jet 
               just above us, coming into land. We pan round to see, half a 
               mile away, the massive airport beyond.

               They walk towards it, two tiny figures.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Aeroflot 1311. Boarding Gate 12.

               INT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

               An attendant pushes a train of trolleys past. Businessmen 
               talk into mobile phones.

                                     NADIA
                         I've got an hour. Can I buy you a 
                         coffee?

                                     JOHN
                         No. I think I better just go.

                                     NADIA
                         Okay. Thank you.

                                     JOHN
                         Whatever.

               Nadia hesitates. There's just a touch of regret in this 
               goodbye.

                                     NADIA
                         John. These are for you.

               She hands him the binoculars case.

                                     JOHN
                         Yeah. No thanks.

                                     NADIA
                         Please. Why not?

                                     JOHN
                         Because it was a lie.

               She smiles.

                                     NADIA
                         No it wasn't.

               John shrugs. He takes them.

                                     NADIA
                         Goodbye.

               John nods and turns. Nadia watches him walk away.

               INT. / EXT. AIRPORT EXIT - NIGHT

               On the other side of the airport, John stands in front of 
               the exit to the taxi ranks. He's got nowhere to go. Passengers 
               swirl around him.

               He looks at the binocular in his hands. He removes the 
               binoculars and looks at them. Suddenly he stops. In the case 
               is a folded note marked John. John holds it in his hands -- 
               Slowly, deliberately, he screws it up, and drops it in the 
               case like a bin.

               P.O.V. OF JOHN

               Through the binoculars. Passengers criss-cross, but we find 
               Nadia sitting alone, waiting for her call.

               John lowers the binoculars and gazes across the airport. He 
               raises them for one last look.

               Nadia, glimpsed through the crowd. We spy someone standing 
               about twenty feet behind her. It is Alexei.

               We watch Alexei approach her. She looks up and is completely 
               thrown.

               Yuri stands about ten feet away, in shades.

               John lowers the binoculars, horrified. He looks again.

               Nadia pulls her arm away. Alexei crouches down in front of 
               her and puts a hand on her knee, coaxing her.

               Alexei takes her by the arm and leads her away.

               EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

               John hurries out of the exit to catch the trio leaving a 
               different exit fifty yards away, where they get into a taxi.

               EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

               John runs across a car park and over a low fence.

               EXT. SLIP ROAD TO AIRPORT - NIGHT

               He chases down a slip road, as the taxi rounds the corner 
               behind us. He takes cover behind a van as they drive past, 
               and away.

               EXT. GRASS VERGE - NIGHT

               John runs across a grass verge and another car park. He sees 
               the taxi rounding the corner and head down the road in front 
               of him.

               John runs as fast as he can up this road, but the taxi is 
               getting away. Eventually he gives up, and he drives away.

               EXT. ROUNDABOUT - NIGHT

               At the roundabout it turns round and starts coming back up 
               the road. John hides behind a car, and watches the taxi pull 
               up outside a small hotel about fifty yards away. He watches 
               the trio head into the hotel.

               EXT. HOTEL PERIMETER - NIGHT

               John skirts around the edge of the hotel. He peers in through 
               one of the windows. It's the foyer. He heads around the back.

               EXT. BACK OF HOTEL - NIGHT

               At the back of the hotel he looks through another couple of 
               windows. Suddenly he drops like he's been shot, and sits on 
               the grass.

               Warily he looks again.

               EXT. / INT. THE VIEW THROUGH THE WINDOW

               Alexei stands smoking in the middle of the room. Nadia is 
               sitting in a chair crying.

               Alexei kneels again and appeals to her. Nadia is resisting 
               and yells back, but something Alexei says seems to melt her 
               resolve.

               He holds her face, and kisses it. She turns her face. He 
               tries again, and this time she accepts the kiss. Slowly she 
               kisses him back.

               EXT. OUTSIDE ALEXEI'S SUITE - NIGHT

               John stares through the window at the scene.

               INT. INSIDE ALEXEI'S SUITE - NIGHT

               In the room, Yuri pops his head round the door and says 
               something to Alexei.

               Alexei says he's coming. He kisses Nadia again and leaves.

               Nadia is alone. She looks very sad and confused. She moves 
               towards the window and stares out into the blackness.

               EXT. OUTSIDE ALEXEI'S SUITE - NIGHT

               John's face at the window. Almost cheek to cheek with Nadia.

               INT. INSIDE ALEXEI'S SUITE - NIGHT

               Inside the room, looking out. It is pitch black.

               EXT. OUTSIDE ALEXEI'S SUITE - NIGHT

               John watches Nadia walk over to the dresser and search the 
               drawers. She goes over to the bed and looks under the pillow. 
               There she finds what she is looking for. Alexei's hunting 
               knife.

               She hears Alexei coming and stands hard against the window. 
               the huge knife behind her back.

               EXT. OUTSIDE ALEXEI'S SUITE - NIGHT

               John outside. He is four inches from the knife.

                                     JOHN
                         Oh Jesus.

               John ducks down, panting, swallowing hard. At once he springs 
               up and skirts the building again. He finds a window to the 
               next suite.

               He tries to force it open. Suddenly Yuri's face appears in 
               the window, cupped by his hands peering out into the 
               blackness. John drops down holds his breath.

               John scrambles back to the previous window. With real effort 
               he presses it open. He pulls himself up and drops inside.

               INT. ALEXEI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Nadia still stands by the window, one hand behind her back. 
               Alexei sits on the bed. The scene is subtitled.

                                     ALEXEI
                         I love you. I don't need to tell you 
                         that.

               Nadia looks at the floor.

                                     ALEXEI
                         I wouldn't leave my child would I? 
                         You know that. I was confused. That's 
                         all.

               INT. ALEXEI'S BATHROOM / HALLWAY - NIGHT

               John opens the bathroom door a crack. He is at the opposite 
               end of a corridor from the bedroom. He can hear Alexei's 
               voice.

               Breathing hard, he tiptoes out and stands in the corridor, 
               his back pressed hard against the wall. He takes one step 
               down the hall. The floor creaks loudly.

               INT. ALEXEI'S SUITE - NIGHT

                                     ALEXEI
                         It wasn't easy for me. You know what 
                         I'm like. I needed to know what I 
                         wanted. Now I know. It's simple. I'm 
                         happy.

               INT. ALEXEI'S SUITE HALLWAY - NIGHT

               John takes another step down the hallway. There, by the door 
               are the two guitar cases full of money. Next to them is 
               Nadia's bag. Crouching, John opens the bag and searches 
               inside. He finds what he is looking for; the Silver Cigarette 
               Lighter-Pistol.

               We hear the Russian lovers' voices next door. John is 
               absolutely terrified, breathing hard and shaking, holding 
               the little gun.

               INT. ALEXEI'S SUITE - NIGHT

                                     ALEXEI
                         You still love me? Eh? Of course you 
                         do. Come here. Yuri won't be here 
                         for a while. Come on babe.

               He takes his shirt off -- Nadia glances up -- With horror, 
               she sees John in the doorway.

               Alexei turns to see John stand by the door, holding a little 
               silver gun.

                                     NADIA
                         What are you doing here?

               John and Nadia look at each other.

                                     ALEXEI
                         What the fuck is he doing here?

               He looks at the little gun.

                                     ALEXEI
                         That's that cigarette lighter I gave 
                         you isn't it?

               Alexei stands. John takes a step back. Alexei walks calmly 
               towards John and throws a punch. It catches John right on 
               the chin and he hits the wall and goes down very fast.

                                     NADIA
                         Stop.

               Alexei turns round to see Nadia holding the knife. He is 
               dumbstruck.

                                     ALEXEI
                         What? What are you doing?

                                     NADIA
                              (to John)
                         What are you doing here?

               Alexei kicks John in the ribs.

                                     NADIA
                              (in Russian)
                         Stop it!

               He looks at Nadia, the girl he came back for, angrily pointing 
               the knife at him. He suddenly looks completely punctured. 
               John has struggled up again and stands behind him. They are 
               both looking at Nadia.

                                     ALEXEI
                         What. You're what? You're with this 
                         creep now.

                                     NADIA
                         Leave him!

                                     ALEXEI
                         You have. You've actually fallen for 
                         this prick.

                                     NADIA
                         No I haven't.

               Alexei looks dumbstruck. He laughs emptily

                                     ALEXEI
                         Babe it's me. I won't let you get 
                         away.

               Nadia stares back at him. The seconds pass. She speaks in a 
               whisper.

                                     NADIA
                         I'll kill you if you try.

               In the impasse, John picks up a lamp and hurls it at Alexei's 
               head. It is going to hit him, but reaches the length of its 
               cord and stops six inches short. In the confusion. Alexei 
               grabs Nadia's wrist and forces her to the ground. He grabs 
               the knife, just as John brains him with one of the guitars. 
               It emits a fruity final chord.

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR / ALEXEI'S SUITE - NIGHT

               Whistling, Yuri comes out of his suite, knocks briskly on 
               the door of Alexei's and enters. We walk with him down the 
               hallway into the bedroom to find Alexei, heartbroken, tied 
               and bound to a desk chair.

               Yuri murmurs something in Russian.

                                     SUBTITLE
                         Fuck a duck.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ALEXEI'S SUITE - NIGHT

               Nadia stands at the window and stares at her reflection, or 
               past it into the blackness.

                                     NADIA
                         Get their passports.

               John finishes tying up Yuri, and removes his passport from 
               his jacket. Behind Nadia another plane arcs up into the night 
               sky.

               He takes Alexei's passport from his pocket, but Alexei is 
               only watching Nadia.

                                     ALEXEI
                         Don't do this.

               She carefully places tape across his mouth.

               Almost as if having second thoughts she bends down to kiss 
               his cheek. The 'kiss' suddenly makes Alexei's eyes widen in 
               pain. As she stands her lips are bloody. She's bitten him on 
               the cheek. A single streak of blood runs from the gash.

                                     NADIA
                              (to John)
                         Get your money.

               John collects the cases and they head for the door. Nadia 
               stops to look back at Alexei. A final look.

               EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

               The front of the terminal. Taxis pull up and idle at a rank, 
               bringing travelers to their flights. The automatic doors 
               slide back and forth.

               INT. AIRPORT CHECKING IN DESK - NIGHT

                                     ANNOUNCEMENT (V.O.)

                         Gate 12.

               John carries the guitar cases full of money. Nadia just has 
               her small camouflaged hold all. They walk quickly together 
               in silence and come to a stop at the departure lounge gate 
               12.

                                     JOHN
                         Are you okay?

               She nods.

                                     JOHN
                         Okay. Goodbye.

                                     NADIA
                         Goodbye.

               They shake.

                                     JOHN
                         What will you do now?

               Nadia shrugs.

                                     NADIA
                         Something else.

                                     JOHN
                         Okay. Promise?

               She looks at him.

                                     NADIA
                         Promise.

               They stand around. She takes the last cigarette from a pack.

                                     JOHN
                         You can probably buy them on the 
                         flight.

                                     NADIA
                         I'm quitting. This will be my last 
                         one. So. Goodbye.

                                     JOHN
                         Goodbye.

                                     NADIA
                         You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.

                                     JOHN
                         Whatever.

                                     NADIA
                         I'm sorry.

                                     JOHN
                         Please.

               Pause.

                                     NADIA
                         You prefer your women...

               She seems about to say something more when the tannoy 
               interrupts.

                                     ANNOUNCEMENT (V.O.)
                         Gate closing for Flight 1311 to

                         ready.

               She leans forward and kisses him. As they kiss, John puts a 
               guitar case in her hand. Nadia looks down at the case.

                                     NADIA
                         It's not mine.

                                     JOHN
                         It's not mine either.

                                     NADIA
                         It's what you came back for.

               John frowns and looks a little embarrassed.

               She speaks to him in Russian and we see the subtitles.

                                     NADIA
                              (in Russian)
                         You're a big surprise, you know.

               Pause.

                                     JOHN
                         Yeah, you see when I said I didn't 
                         speak Russian I wasn't actually just 
                         making it up.

               She leans forwards and whispers in his ear. John looks at 
               her. He looks to the four corners of the airport. And back 
               at her.

                                     JOHN
                         Why?

                                     NADIA
                         I'm not asking you to marry me.

                                     JOHN
                         No. What? No. I know.

                                     NADIA
                         It's more like a date.

                                     JOHN
                         It's a long way to go for a date.

                                     NADIA
                         Tell me about it.

               Pause. She speaks softly in Russian. We see the subtitle:

                                     NADIA
                         All that matters is to try...

               John frowns.

                                     NADIA
                              (in Russian)
                         We can only try. Say it.

               John repeats the phrase in Russian.

                                     JOHN
                         What does it mean?

                                     NADIA
                         Maybe you will find out.

               Pause. Nadia kneels and opens the guitar case. She stealthily 
               removes about five hundred.

                                     NADIA
                         Hurry. I'll wait for you here.

                                     JOHN
                         Right.

               INT. TICKET SALES - NIGHT

               John runs across the airport to the ticket desk. He joins a 
               queue of about three people. He works his way to the front.

                                     JOHN
                         Is the flight full?

                                     OFFICIAL
                         I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight 
                         is closed.

                                     JOHN
                         Please check. Is it full? Please 
                         could you check.

                                                                   BACK TO:

               INT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

               Nadia stands alone holding her unlit cigarette, thinking. 
               She looks at the two guitar cases at her feet. She looks 
               across at John, anxiously drumming on the ticket sales 
               counter. What is she thinking?

               INT. TICKET SALES - NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT on the photo of Yuri in his passport.

               The Aeroflot desk official holds the passport and studies at 
               John. With his four day beard there is a resemblance, but 
               it's far from perfect.

                                     OFFICIAL
                         You have excellent English.

                                     JOHN
                         Thanks.

                                     OFFICIAL
                         How do you want to pay?

                                     JOHN
                         Cash.

               John collects his ticket, turns and heads back to where he 
               left Nadia with the guitar cases. He suddenly stops.

               She's gone.

               He looks all around. People swirl about. She's nowhere to be 
               seen.

               John hangs his head. He turns, and walks away.

               INT. AIRPORT CAFE - NIGHT

               John sits at a cafe table, and watches the people come and 
               go. He looks strangely calm, resigned.

               CLOSE UP: John's fingers uncrumple the note from the 
               binoculars case. He smooths it on the table, then opens it.

               Inside is written a short phrase in Russian:

               Kam Kapsi Schta.

               John looks at the note. He folds it closed and surveys the 
               airport for an exit.

               Through the crowd, fifty feet away, getting a light off two 
               policeman; it's her.

               Nadia blows out smoke, and speaks to the policeman. John 
               watches her. He smiles.

               Suddenly she turns and points straight at John. The Policeman 
               look straight at him. As they head towards him, Nadia picks 
               up the cases and walks away.

               John sits frozen as the Police approach.

                                     POLICE 1
                         Excuse me Sir...

               He takes John by the arm. John stands.

                                     POLICE 2
                         Okay. Come with us now.

                                     POLICE 1
                         He doesn't speak English. He's 
                         epileptic or something.

                                     POLICE 2
                         Can he walk? Can you walk?

               The Policeman help John to the front of the gate, where he 
               is shown to the front of the queue. The Policeman explains 
               to the airline staff.

               We see that Nadia is one behind in the queue. The Police 
               turn and walk away.

               INT. AIRPORT BOARDING GATE - FLIGHT 1311 TO MOSCOW - DAY

               John pushes his passport and ticket under the perspex window. 
               He glances at Nadia, then looks at the young airport official, 
               the blood beating in his ears.

               For a few interminable seconds the official's eyes burn into 
               John. John turns to Nadia and holds her gaze.

                                     JOHN
                         Kam. Kapsi. Schta.

               The subtitle appears: You've saved me.

               Nadia looks down at the floor. She smiles.

               CLOSE SHOT: The passport is snapped shut and pushed back 
               through.

               INT. AIRPORT BOARDING CORRIDOR - DAY

               John walks without looking back. He turns to see Nadia is 
               behind him. As they round the corner, she hands him a case.

               They walk side by side without speaking.

               Both look forward, straight-faced, as it both are thinking 
               about what it is that they are actually doing. John looks 
               back once, but he keeps walking. He looks across at Nadia, 
               but she doesn't look back.

               They stop opposite the automatic boarding doors. Nadia turns 
               to John.

                                     NADIA
                         My name's Sophia.

                                     JOHN
                         Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still 
                         John.

                                     SOPHIA
                         Hello John.

               The doors slide open. John and Sophia walk through, and 
               disappear.

               SFX. The roar of Jet engines.

               EXT. AIRPORT RUNWAY - NIGHT

               With a deafening roar, an Aeroflot Boeing 757 lifts slowly 
               from the runway and climbs up into the night sky, where it 
               becomes a distant star.

               EXT. FIELD - DAY

               A distant aeroplane in a cobalt blue sky, through binoculars.

               The young girl from the very first scene lowers the binoculars 
               and lets them hang around her neck. She squints up at the 
               sun.

               A voice calls her.

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE
                         Nadia!

               The girl looks round.

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE
                         Nadia!

               She runs past us and we follow to see a couple sitting on 
               the grass having a picnic.

               The girl hurries towards them and we realise the couple are 
               John and Sophia, the girl her child. She sits down with them.

                                         THE END
BLAST FROM THE PAST - by Bill Kelly and Hugh Wilson





   


       FADE IN:



       SCENE 1 OMITTED

       EXT. SAN FERNANDO VALLEY - NIGHT

       OPEN on a MOVING WIDE SHOT of a mountain range with the
       distant lights of the San Fernando Valley behind it.
       BEGIN CREDITS as a NAVY JET drops down into the picture.
       PUSH IN on the jet's exhaust flame. Have the words "THE
       BLAST" come out of the flame. Then there is a SLIGHT
       EXPLOSION and the flame intensifies. The words "FROM THE
       PAST" jump out of the exhaust as the jet momentarily
       shakes.

       INT. JET

       The PILOT feels the jet shake. But he looks at his
       indicators and everything appears to be normal. He
       relaxes.

       EXT. JET

       We begin with a WIDER REAR SHOT of the jet and allow the
       plane to move away. Then SUPER: "LOS ANGELES, 1962"
       before continuing the main titles. A popular recording
       from that period has been playing throughout.

       EXT. CALVIN'S WORK SHOP - NIGHT

       Start on a CU of the HAM RADIO ANTENNA, WIND GAUGE and
       THERMOMETER attached to the roof of Calvin's shop. (We
       can hear military air traffic chatter on Calvin's
       Hallicrafter radio.) Then move down to the window where
       we see CALVIN Webber tinkering with a gadget at his work
       bench. Calvin's very pregnant wife HELEN appears. The
       music becomes source.

                           HELEN
                 For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got
                 guests!

                           CALVIN
                 Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling
                 with this darn rheostat.

                           HELEN
                 Well, put it down and come in!

                           CALVIN
                 You bet, hon!

       They exit the workshop for the house.  Calvin has left
       the ham radio on.




                           NAVY PILOT (ON
                           RADIO)
                 Tower, Wolf One is five miles from the
                 overhead.

                           TOWER (ON RADIO)
                 Wolf One, Tower. Report the numbers.
                 You're number one for the overhead.

                           NAVY PILOT (ON
                           RADIO)
                 Wolf one.


       INT. COCKPIT OF JET - SAME TIME

       The YOUNG PILOT looks down at the flashing red light on
       his control panel. He speaks into the oxygen mask that
       hangs loosely from his helmet.

                           PILOT
                 Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem
                 here.

                           TOWER (OC)
                 Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you
                 declaring an emergency?

                           PILOT
                 Stand by. One.

       INT. DINING ROOM

       DAVE, BETTY, BOB, and RUTH (30's) pass around the buffet
       table. Another period song is playing on the phonograph.

                           BETTY
                 Just remember: don't mention the
                 communists!

                           DAVE
                 Calvin's a great guy, but he's a
                 little, you know...

                           BETTY
                 Nutty.

                           RUTH
                 What's his wife like?

                           BETTY
                 Oh, you know, housewife.

                           DAVE
                 Likes to cook. Pregnant.

                           RUTH
                 Normal, then.

                           BETTY
                 Well, I wouldn't go that far.
                     (then)
                 Helen!

       Helen has entered from the kitchen with more food. She
       favors June Allison.

                           HELEN
                 Hi, Betty!  Dave!

                           BETTY
                 Just look at you!

                           HELEN
                 Any day now!

                           BETTY
                 This is my sister and her husband.

                           HELEN
                 Oh, hi! Welcome!

       INT. LIVING ROOM

       Calvin is using a cocktail shaker to very carefully make
       Rob Roys for the crowd at the bar. It's like watching a
       chemist at work. Calvin's a pipe-smoker.

                           CALVIN
                 So anyhow this duck says to the clerk,
                 "I'd like to buy this lip balm."  And
                 the clerk says, "Will that be cash or
                 a check?"  And the duck says, "Just
                 put it on my bill!"

       Polite laughter follows, but the guy out of Calvin's
       sight-line rolls his eyes.

       ANGLE - DAVE AND BOB

       with drinks. Helen is in the b.g., rushing around, over-
       serving everyone.

                           DAVE
                 He was the golden-boy professor at Cal
                 Tech.  But then he starts inventing
                 things.

                           BOB
                 What kind of things?

                           DAVE
                 You got me.  Some kind of special
                 synthetic rubber.  And some kind of
                 automated machine.  Anyhow, suddenly
                 he gets rich.  I mean rich!  And quits
                 teaching.

       ANGLE - CALVIN

       as his guests sample their Rob Roys.

                           CALVIN
                 How's that?

                           GUEST
                 Just what the doctor ordered!

       Calvin gives the man his patented thumbs-up sign.

       ANGLE - BETTY AND RUTH

       over by the patio doors. We can see Calvin's shop through
       the window.

                           BETTY
                 With all his money they could have
                 moved to Beverly Hills, but they
                 decided to stay in the Valley.  Calvin
                 spends all his time tinkering out
                 there in his workshop.  If you ask me
                 it's all very strange.

                           WOMAN GUEST #1
                     (chiming in)
                 He dug a huge hole out there for a
                 swimming pool. Then he decided he
                 didn't want it and filled the thing
                 in. And what's that big, high fence
                 for?

       The women look at Calvin.



       ANGLE - CALVIN

       with guests (one is called Harold) at the bar.

                           CALVIN
                 There currently exists a type of neon
                 light that lasts five years.  But you
                 won't see it on the market. Same is
                 true of batteries. I could take your
                 simple yacht battery and rig it to
                 last a decade, easily.

                           HAROLD
                 Well, what the heck kind of a
                 marketing system can't get great new
                 products like that out to the public?

                           CALVIN
                     (intense)
                 A veeeery good one, Harold. Free
                 market capitalism may not be a perfect
                 order, but it's the best we've got, or
                 will ever have.  And why?  Three
                 reasons!

       Poor Harold.

       INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

       Most of the guests are women, gabbing and helping Helen
       out as she removes a pot roast from the oven and busily
       jumps around the kitchen.

                           WOMAN GUEST #2
                 Say, Helen?  What does Calvin think
                 about this trouble down in Cuba?

                           HELEN
                     (rolling her eyes)
                 Oh, please don't bring that up!

       EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT, MOMENTS LATER

       A late guest named RON hurries up the walkway and into
       the house.





       SCENE 8 OMITTED

       INT. LIVING ROOM - A SECOND LATER

       Calvin is with another guest.

                           CALVIN
                 I'd say my baseball card collection is
                 as complete as any one I've ever seen.

       Ron pushes his way through the crowd.

                           RON
                 Calvin!  Hey, Calvin!
                 		(pointing over his shoulder)
                 Kennedy's going toe-to-toe with
                 Khrushchev on the television!

       Calvin immediately heads for the family room. Others
       follow.

       INT. FAMILY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

       Everyone is huddled around the JFK TV press conference.
       There seems to be a lot of smokers. Helen appears
       shortly, wearing a hot pad mitten on each hand.

                           JFK
                 ...this sudden, clandestine decision
                 to station strategic weapons for the
                 first time outside of Soviet soil, is
                 a deliberately provocative and
                 unjustified change in the status quo
                 which cannot be accepted by this
                 country.

       Calvin cuts a knowing look at Helen who dutifully returns
       it.

       EXT. JET - NIGHT

       The plane swoops over the Valley and we see the
       spectacular lights of L.A. sprawl.  There is a TRAIL OF
       SPARKS coming from the jet's engine.

       INT. JET COCKPIT

       The plane is shaking terribly and the pilot is having a
       very hard time controlling it.

                           TOWER
                 Wolf One -- say intentions.

                           PILOT
                 I've got secondaries of an engine fire
                 and I'll need to find a clear area to
                 eject.

                           TOWER
                 Roger, Wolf One. Can you make it to
                 the ocean?

       EXT. JET

       The trembling plane circles to the west.

       INT. FAMILY ROOM

       Return to TV.

                           JFK
                 ...we will not prematurely or
                 unnecessarily risk the cost of
                 worldwide nuclear war, in which even
                 the fruits of victory would be ashes
                 in our mouth.  But neither will we
                 shrink from the risk at any time it
                 must be faced.

       INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT/ EXT. HOUSE, MOMENTS LATER

       To Helen's embarrassment, Calvin is ushering  all the
       guests to the front door. Helen is passing out hats and
       purses. She and Calvin speak simultaneously - somewhere
       in the middle we cut outside.


                           CALVIN
                 I'm sorry everyone, but given this
                 extraordinary turn of events, I think
                 it's prudent that we cut the evening
                 short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will
                 resolve itself, but in the
                 meantime...I'd suggest taking a
                 prayerful watch-and-wait stance!

                           HELEN
                 We'll do this again! Maybe next week.
                 Here's your hat. Could I wrap
                 something up for you? Did you have a
                 coat?

       Helen can barely get a "good night" out before Calvin
       shuts the door.

       ANGLE - DAVE AND BOB

       Following their wives out.

                 			DAVE
                     (sotto to Bob)
                 What'd I tell ya?!

       Bob whistles softly. Calvin's a nut all right.

       INT. FRONT DOOR

       Calvin turns to Helen, a grave expression on his face.

                           CALVIN
                 It's time.

                           HELEN
                     (misinterpreting, holding her
                      stomach)
                 Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time
                 yet. I still have--

       He points down.

                           HELEN (cont'd)
                 Oh, that time! You know Calvin, I'm
                 not sure I'm really ready for this.

                           CALVIN
                 On the contrary, I think we're the
                 only ones who are.

       He leads her out of shot.

                           HELEN (OC)
                 Calvin I'm sure everything's going to
                 be all right. I just know it is!

       EXT. BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

       Calvin and Helen leave the house; cross the patio; and
       hurry to the shop. Back in the house, the record player
       has been left on:  "How Much Is That Doggie In The
       Window...?"  Helen is carrying the pot roast which is
       wrapped in foil.

                           HELEN
                 Well, I'm certainly not going to let
                 the pot roast go to waste. Could you
                 just put that seat cover back on that
                 lawn chair?

       He does.

                           HELEN (cont'd)
                 Shouldn't we at least turn off the
                 phonograph?

                           CALVIN
                 It shuts off automatically.

                           HELEN
                 Did you rig it to do that? You're so
                 clever.

                           CALVIN
                 No.  They all do.

                           HELEN
                 I never know anymore.

       The SOUND OF THE TRAINER JET makes a low pass over
       Calvin's house.  Calvin sticks his head out the door and
       looks up.

                           CALVIN
                 I bet that's a fighter jet on his way
                 to Key West!  Good luck, amigo!

       INT. WORKSHOP

       They enter. The place is full of tools and gadgets--
       mostly construction equipment. The ham radio is still on.

                           TOWER
                 An emergency has been declared. I
                 repeat, an emergency has been
                 declared.

       Calvin and Helen speak over the Tower who is telling
       other aircraft in the vicinity to clear the area.

                           CALVIN
                 You hear that?!

                           HELEN
                 Yes.

       Calvin unplugs the radio and quickly wraps the cord.

                           CALVIN
                 We can listen to the rest downstairs!

       He pushes aside a table that is hiding a hatch in the
       floor and unlocks it by turning the hatch's wheel.  Then
       he opens the hatch and reaches inside to turn on a light.
       Red submarine light shines up from below.  All the while
       he and Helen are chatting:

                           HELEN
                 Calvin, I wish you would have at least
                 let me do the dishes. It's not going
                 to be that easy getting all that dried-
                 on food off my nice plates.

                           CALVIN
                 I just hope those plates aren't
                 radioactive by tomorrow morning.

                           HELEN
                 Cheese is particularly troublesome.

                           CALVIN
                 Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?

                           HELEN
                 Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that
                 Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember
                 that?

                           CALVIN
                 Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast
                 and watch your step.  I'll come back
                 for the radio.

       She steps into the hatch and onto a ladder.


       INT. JET - NIGHT

       The young pilot is bouncing around the now smokey
       cockpit.

                           PILOT
                 Tower, say again!!

                           TOWER
                 The SAR HELO is airborne with you in
                 sight.

                           PILOT
                 I'm marking the 180 radial for five
                 and ejecting.

                           TOWER
                 Roger, Wolf One.




       The pilot rights the plane; points the joy stick; and
       reaches for the ejection handles between his legs.

       EXT. JET

       The pilot ejects.

       INT. EMPTY COCKPIT

       This is the pilot's POV (were there a pilot.)  We see the
       coastline and we notice that the plane is making a... U-
       turn, away from the water and back towards the Valley.

       EXT. JET

       Streaking back to the Valley with a dramatic tail of
       sparks.

       EXT. THE PARACHUTING PILOT

       He notices that his plane is headed directly at him.  It
       misses him by a matter of yards.

       INT. LADDER - CONTINUOUS

       Taking the liberty of a CUTAWAY SECTION, we follow them
       down the ladder which is inside a corrugated metal tube.
       On either side of the tube we see layers of dirt.

                           HELEN
                 How long will we have to stay down
                 here?

                           CALVIN
                 I don't know. For this thing to blow
                 over, it could take days.

                           HELEN
                 Days??

                           CALVIN
                 Rather safe than sorry. That's my
                 motto!

                           HELEN
                 But, what if I go into labor? That
                 could happen any time.

                           CALVIN
                 I've read up on it. I'll deliver the
                 baby myself if I have to.

                           HELEN
                 Now you listen to me Calvin Webber,
                 when this baby comes, you're going to
                 be out in the waiting
                 room smoking yourself to death with
                 all the other fathers.

                           CALVIN
                     (chuckling)
                 Yes, dear!

                           HELEN
                 As long as we've got that straight.

       EXT. JET - SAME TIME

       It COMPLETES ITS TURN and STREAKS SKYWARD at a 90 degree
       angle to the ground... until it SPUTTERS and the ENGINES
       STOP.  Then, after a Road Runner-like beat or two, it
       begins to FALL DIRECTLY BACK TO EARTH, tail first.

       INT. SMALL ANTEROOM - SAME TIME

       The Webbers step off a metal ladder and face a vault-like
       chrome hatchway.  Calvin opens the six-inch thick door by
       pushing another switch on his small box. Helen takes the
       roast.

       EXT. JET - NIGHT

       With only the sound of wind, the jet continues to fall as
       the lights of the Valley rush up to meet it.



       INT. SHELTER - CONTINUOUS

       They step into a darkened room.

                           CALVIN
                     (with arms spread)
                 Home sweet home!

                           HELEN
                 To you maybe.

       Calvin flicks a wall switch and we HEAR A SERIES OF
       LIGHTS COMING ON.  The echoes of the sounds suggest a
       large, cavernous space.  All we can see is the cinder
       block wall behind them and the hatch door, which Calvin
       begins to shut by putting his body into it.

       Just then there is a TREMENDOUS DOUBLE EXPLOSION FROM
       ABOVE which knocks them to the floor. (Note: Helen hangs
       on to the roast, trying her best not to drop it.) The
       LADDER, CORRUGATED TUBE, ROOF, AND LOTS OR DIRT AND ROCK
       BEGIN TO CRASH DOWN INTO THE ANTEROOM. Calvin struggles
       to his feet and gets the vault door shut just in the nick
       of time.

                           HELEN
                 What was that?!

                           CALVIN
                 Are you all right?!

       Hanging on to the roast she nods vigorously, trying to be
       brave.

                           HELEN
                 Yes, I think so.

       Calvin hurries to a bright RED METAL BOX on the wall.
       Next to the box is a LARGE THERMOMETER OR GAUGE that's
       labeled "Radiation Count."  There are OTHER GAUGES that
       are dropping to zero.

                           CALVIN
                 Oh, no!  It's happened!  Look at that
                 heat!!  All my surface indicators are
                 knocked out!  Oh, my Lord...it's
                 actually happened!!

       INTER CUT - CU OF BOX AND THERMOMETER

       The box has a dial on it, next to which is a large lever.
       A foreboding sign reads  HATCHWAY TIME LOCKS, USE EXTREME
       CAUTION.  Calvin pulls the lever.

       BACK TO SCENE

       The chrome and steel EXIT HATCHWAY AUTOMATICALLY LOCKS
       with great noise, precision and...finality. There is the
       SOUND OF A REAR DOOR doing the same thing.

                           HELEN
                 What's that noise?

                           CALVIN
                 The locks.

                           HELEN
                 The locks?

                           CALVIN
                 To keep us from trying to leave. After
                 an atomic blast there's a radiation
                 half-life that lasts thirty five
                 years.

                           HELEN
                 Thirty -five years!

                           CALVIN
                 Then after that it's safe.

                           HELEN
                 It's safe.

       She continues to stare at him.

                           CALVIN
                 To go up.

                           HELEN
                 To go up.

       She continues to stare at him.

                           CALVIN
                     (confidently)
                 Hey, honey. Don't you worry. We're
                 going to be just fine.

       Helen bursts into tears.

       EXT WEBBER PATIO - DAY

       Two police detectives, LEVY and ATKINSON, exit the house.
       Uniformed workers carefully carry small pieces of the jet
       from the crash site. The detectives lead us to what's
       left of Calvin's shop. It's mostly a charred crater.

                           LEVY
                 According to Caltech, this Webber guy
                 was a bonafide genius and a borderline
                 nutcase.

                           ATKINSON
                 Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have
                 been out here when the plane hit.

                           LEVY
                 Unless we get a postcard or somethin',
                 that's my guess.

                           ATKINSON
                 What about relatives?

                           LEVY
                 All back East.

                           ATKINSON
                 The neighbors over there said the guy
                 spent day and night out here. She'd
                 bring him sandwiches and hot Dr.
                 Pepper.

                           LEVY
                 He drank it hot?

                           ATKINSON
                 Yeah.

                           LEVY
                 Good god.

                           ATKINSON
                 Yeah.



       INT. MASTER BEDROOM - SAME TIME (12 HOURS AFTER BLAST)

       Helen awakes alone and still dressed. She sits up and
       trys the phone on the night table. It is dead. She hangs
       up and exits.

       INT. KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM/PATIO

       Calvin is making sandwiches from the pot roast. Two empty
       Doctor Pepper bottles sit next to the stove where Calvin
       is heating the soda. He sees Helen enter the livingroom.

                           CALVIN
                 Hi, honey! Feeling better?

                           HELEN
                 No.

                           CALVIN
                 We have to be strong, sweetheart. If
                 not for ourselves, for the child.

                           HELEN
                 All our friends...

       He enters with her sandwich and a cup of Dr. Pepper.

                           CALVIN
                 Burnt to a crisp.
                     (indicating sandwiches)
                 I've given you the most well-done cut.

                           HELEN
                 I'm not hungry.

                           CALVIN
                 Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!

                           HELEN
                     (leaving)
                 No, Calvin, you're favorite.

                           CALVIN
                 Really?

       She walks out onto the patio. She rubs her arms as if
       cold.

                           CALVIN
                 A bit chilly? Shouldn't be.
                 Temperature's a nice 73 degrees.



       He follows her out to the patio.

                           HELEN
                 Maybe I've just got the creeps.

                           CALVIN
                 How could you?! This is just like
                 home!

       A reverse angle shows for the first time the rest of the
       fallout shelter -- which looks very different from
       "home". Perhaps she starts to cry again.

                           HELEN
                 No. No! Calvin, this is different!
                 Believe me!

                           CALVIN
                 Would you like a tranquilizer?

                           HELEN
                 You have tranquilizers?

                           CALVIN
                 I told you! I've got everything!











        Helen groans in pain.

                           HELEN
                 Oh, no.

                           CALVIN
                 What?

                           HELEN
                 Uh, oh. Now it's time.

                           CALVIN
                 Honey?

       SCENE 29E OMITTED



       INT. VERY WIDE OF THE SHELTER - HOURS LATER

       We can only hear Adam's entrance into the world. There is
       Helen's pain, followed by Adam's cry, followed by
       Calvin's rejoicing.

                           CALVIN (OC)
                 The first child to be born on earth
                 after the annihilation!!



       INT. SHELTER - DAYS LATER

       SUPER: SEVERAL DAYS LATER

       Start on the record player in the living room. The
       country and western classic "Hey, Good Looking" is
       spinning.



       OMIT SCENE 30

       INT. SHELTER, BATTERY ROOM - SAME TIME

       Calvin walks through checking things over; pleased by
       what he sees.  He exits. ("Hey Good Looking" continues.)

       INT. SHELTER, FISH FARM - CONTINUOUS

       Calvin checks the switch he uses to control the lights.
       Then he checks out all the tiny fish swimming in the six
       feet by six feet tank.  When he hears a baby's cry he
       hurries away.(Music continues)

       INT. SHELTER, MASTER BEDROOM

       Calvin enters and smiles with great affection at his
       family:  Helen and a NEWBORN SON cradled next to her in
       bed.

                           CALVIN
                 Is there a problem?

                           HELEN
                 No, Calvin.  Babies cry.

                           CALVIN
                 I've noticed.

                           HELEN
                 What shall we call him?

       Calvin shrugs.

                           HELEN (cont'd)
                 Well, I was thinking...in light of the
                 situation...that we should call him
                 Adam.  That's not sacrilegious is it?

                           CALVIN
                 No.  I think it's just right.

                           HELEN
                 And I was wondering...if...if I could
                 have a...

                           CALVIN
                 Yes!

                           HELEN
                 If I...you know...

                           CALVIN
                 What? Whatever you want, Helen!

       She points upwards.

                           HELEN
                 I want a bedroom ceiling.

       They both look up. Then he tells her.

                           CALVIN
                 You've got it!

       Calvin happily gives her his patented thumbs-up sign.

       A MONTAGE:  1) CALVIN , IN A LARGE SUPPLY ROOM, PICKS OUT
       THE PLYWOOD HE'LL NEED FOR THE CEILINGS. ( 60'S HAPPY,
       BUSY SCORE COVERS ALL THIS.)

       2) HELEN, CARRIES LITTLE ADAM (THREE DAYS OLD) ONTO THE
       FAKE PATIO (WITH THE PLASTIC PLANTS AND THE PLASTIC
       GRASS). SHE LOOKS UP AT CALVIN WHO'S ON A LADDER
       INSTALLING A CEILING.

       SUPER: SEVERAL WEEKS LATER

       3) IN THE FAMILY ROOM, CALVIN SHOWS HELEN HOW HE'S RIGGED
       A PROJECTOR TO THROW A PICTURE ONTO THE TV SCREEN. SHE'S
       THRILLED TO SEE "THE HONEYMOONERS!" MAIN TITLES COME ON.
       ADAM, LYING ON A QUILT BY HELEN'S CHAIR, IS ABOUT FOUR
       WEEKS OLD. (IT'S IMPORTANT HERE THAT WE SEE A 8MM FILM
       BOX WITH THE "I LOVE LUCY" LOGO ON IT)

       SUPER: SEVERAL MONTHS LATER

       4) TOTAL DARKNESS. THEN CALVIN FLICKS A SWITCH AND A BANK
       OF OVERHEAD LIGHTS COMES ON TO SIMULATE SUNLIGHT. UNDER
       THE LIGHTS ARE SOIL BEDS ON WOODEN TABLES. CALVIN IS
       EXCITED TO SHOW HELEN THE TINY, YOUNG CARROTS COMING UP.
       HELEN HOLDS ADAM AT THREE MONTHS OLD.

       SUPER: A YEAR LATER

       5) IN THE DINING ROOM, HELEN IS SERVING POT ROAST AND
       SOME VERY NICE LOOKING CARROTS. ADAM IS SIX MONTHS OLD.
       HE WATCHES HIS PARENTS AS THEY SAY GRACE.

       6) HELEN "SHOPS" FOR SUPPLIES IN THE LARGE STOREROOM.
       ADAM, ONE YEAR OLD, RIDES IN THE SHOPPING CART.(1963)

       7) CALVIN NETS A WIGGLING, FULLY GROWN FISH.

       8) THE FAMILY WATCHES "THE HONEYMOONERS" TOGETHER. (ADAM
       IS STILL ONE YEAR OLD.)

       CALVIN ENJOYS HIS PIPE IN THE LIVINGROOM

       9) CALVIN EXAMINES THE REAR HATCHWAY AS HELEN APPROACHES
       WITH ADAM IN HER ARMS.

                           HELEN (OC)
                 Calvin?!

                           CALVIN
                 Right here!

                           HELEN
                     (arriving)
                 We looked all over for you. What are
                 you doing back here?

                           CALVIN
                 Oh, I was just examining this rear
                 hatchway.

                           HELEN
                 Why?

                           CALVIN
                 No reason.
                 		(then, off her look)
                 Well, it's pretty clear that the front
                 entrance caved in when the bomb went
                 off. So, you know, when the time is
                 up, we'll have to return to the
                 surface using, you know, this back
                 entrance.  Which is very nice because
                 it has the service elevator!

                           HELEN
                 Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.

                           CALVIN
                 Yes.  Well... yes.

       A sober beat, then:

                           CALVIN (cont'd)
                 You wanted to see me?

       Helen nods vigorously.

                           HELEN
                 Watch this!

                           CALVIN
                 What?

       She sets Adam (one year old) down on his wobbly little
       legs, steadying him at the shoulders.

                           HELEN
                 Go to Daddy, Adam. Go to Daddy.

       And Adam takes his first step. And then another! And
       another! It's a joyous event.

       CAMERA LEAVES THEM AND TRAVELS UPWARD THROUGH THE CEILING
       AND THEN, AGAIN USING THE DEVICE OF A CUTAWAY, IT
       CONTINUES THROUGH DIRT AND SEDIMENT ALL THE WAY UP TO THE
       SURFACE-- WHERE THE BACKYARD AVOCADO TREES ARE BEING
       BULLDOZED AND THE BACK FENCE HAS ALREADY BEEN TORN DOWN.
       THE WEBBER HOUSE FACED A QUIET RESIDENTIAL STREET, BUT IT
       BACKED ONTO VICTORY AVENUE (OR ONE OF THOSE VALLEY
       AVENUES) AND IN THE LATE FIFTIES AND EARLY SIXTIES THOSE
       MAIN THOROUGHFARES WENT COMMERCIAL.

       A SIGN tells us that this is the future site of MOM'S
       MALT SHOP."

       Some WORKMEN with shovels have discovered the REAR
       SHELTER DOORS where they have been digging.



                           WORKMAN #1
                 Hey, Boss!

       The construction BOSS comes over for a look.

                           WORKMAN #1
                 What do you make of this?

                           BOSS
                 Damn if I know.

                           WORKMAN #2
                 I bet it's some kinda septic tank.

                           WORKMAN #1
                 I've never seen a septic tank that
                 looked like that.

                           BOSS
                 Well, don't fool with it. If it is a
                 septic tank, I sure as hell don't want
                 to open it. We'll just lay the
                 foundation over it.

                           WORKMAN #1
                 Okay.

       EXT. WEBBER HOUSE, PATIO (THE REAL ONE) - DAY, SAME TIME

       A Realtor steps out with A COUPLE looking to buy the
       house.

                           REALTOR
                 ...and since it's almost certain that
                 the Webbers were killed, the bank is
                 selling the house and that back parcel
                 over there that's been re-zoned
                 commercial. It's right there on the
                 avenue.

                           WOMAN BUYER
                 Is that where the plane crashed?

       She points out to a LEVEL LAWN where the shop used to be.
       We can see the Malt Shop construction crew beyond that.

                           REALTOR
                 Yep, right there.

                           MAN BUYER
                 This place gives me the willies.

                           REALTOR
                 Yeah, I know what you mean. But the
                 price is right.

       EXT. BACK AT THE MALT SHOP CONSTRUCTION SIGHT -
       CONTINUOUS, DAY

       The guy driving the heavy front loader lets the bucket
       slam to the ground hard.

       INT. BACK AT THE SHELTER REAR DOOR - CONTINUOUS

       Calvin vaguely hears the noise made by the front loader.

       INT. SHELTER, LIVING ROOM - EVENING (1965-66)

       SUPER: 1965

       Calvin smokes his pipe and enjoys a Manhattan cocktail as
       Adam (three and a half) sits in his lap reading the title
       page from Alice in Wonderland.

                           ADAM
                 Al ice in won der lan.

       Calvin smiles pridefully over at Helen who works
       intensely on the couch making a coffee-can Santa from
       instructions in the The Redbook Crafts Collection.

                           CALVIN
                 Not bad for a three and a half year
                 old! I'd like to see the public school
                 system match that! I don't care how
                 terrific it is!

                           HELEN
                 Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like
                 his father. But you know, Calvin,
                 maybe he's a little...young for
                 school.

                           CALVIN
                 Nonsense. People have no idea what the
                 human mind is capable of. Look at us!

       Helen ponders that statement.


                           ADAM
                     (pointing to the book's art
                      work)
                 Look, Daddy. Alice went down a hole,
                 just like us.

       Calvin smiles and messes up Adam's hair.

                           ADAM (cont'd)
                 Will I ever get to go up on top?

                           CALVIN
                 Yes, you certainly will. And you'll
                 find a nice girl and rebuild America.
                 Just the way it used to be.

                           HELEN
                 Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be
                 making promises that perhaps can't be
                 kept.

                           CALVIN
                 I believe there will be other
                 survivors. In fact, I'm guessing
                 there's life on the surface, even now.
                 It's not life worth living perhaps,
                 but believe me, something's moving
                 around up there. And I don't just mean
                 the cockroaches.

       They both look nervously up at the ceiling.

       EXT. MOM'S MALT SHOP (NOW FINISHED) - DAY (1965-66)

       CARS PASS BY on the busy avenue.

       INT. MOM'S MALT SHOP - CONTINUOUS

       CLEAN CUT SURFER KIDS are being served their favorite ice-
       cream and malt treats by MOM herself and a young SODA
       JERK. Appropriate music comes from the jukebox.

                           MOM
                 I'm going to need two more banana-
                 splits and a cherry coke!

                           SODA JERK
                 You bet, Mom! Coming up!

       Two YOUNG MEN IN BEATLE HAIRCUTS enter. Everyone looks at
       them in amazement. (Perhaps there is also a record change
       here.)

       INT. SHELTER, CLASSROOM - DAY (65-66)

       Calvin is building and furnishing a classroom from
       materials available to him. He has had the forethought to
       bring down the books needed for his child's education.
       Little Adam is watching him.

                           CALVIN
                     (to Adam)
                 Nothing in the world is more fun than
                 learning new things.

       INT. FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

       The family watches the same "Honeymooner" clip they
       watched before. Calvin still finds it funny. Helen
       wonders about that.

       INT. BEDROOM - LATER

       Helen is pouring cooking sherry into an empty Listerine
       bottle.

       EXT. MALT SHOP - DAY (1970-71)

       SUPER: 1970

       Other buildings have been constructed around the malt
       shop. Foot and car traffic are heavier.

       INT. MALT SHOP - SAME TIME

       The clean-cut kids have been replaced by FLOWER CHILDREN.
       Mom hasn't put a lot back into the decor, but she has
       made concessions to the fashions of the time. The jukebox
       plays something appropriate. Mom and the Jerk are five
       years older.

                           MOM
                 I can't tell the boys from the girls
                 anymore!

                           SODA JERK
                     (stoned)
                 Uh...yeah. It's like hard.

       Mom gives the Jerk a suspicious look.

       INT. SHELTER - DAY (1970-71)

       Calvin (40) is giving Adam (8) a boxing lesson. They work
       from a "How To" book and use gloves made from living room
       pillows. Adam's pretty good. Helen appears and watches
       with pride. Then she interupts.

                           HELEN
                 Boys! Excuse me, but I believe it's my
                 turn.
                     (holding out her hand)
                 Adam?

       He goes to her.

       INT. SHELTER - MINUTES LATER

       The hydroponic garden area is empty. A Perry Como song
       begins and Adam and Helen enter waltzing. Adam has
       changed shirts and combed his hair. Somewhere, Calvin is
       watching with pride. After a while Calvin cuts in. He and
       Helen dance beautifully. Then they kiss. Somewhere, Adam
       is watching with pride.

       INT. MALT SHOP - DAY (1975-76)

       SUPER: 1975

       The place continues its decline. Acid rock plays loudly.
       Mom and the Jerk serve the smallish crowd.

                           MOM
                 I miss those nice flower-power kids.
                 How 'bout you?

                           SODA JERK
                     (after studying her for some
                      time)
                 Um...uh...

       The acid rock song ends and an early, bad disco hit comes
       on the jukebox.

                           MOM
                 What the hell kind of music is that?!

       The Jerk puts his hands to his ears, he so hates the new
       music.

                           SODA JERK
                 Oh, man. I'm like not sure I like
                 that.



       INT. SHELTER, CLASSROOM  (1975-76)

       The room looks like Ricky Nelson's class.  There are twin
       pictures of Ike and JFK on the wall.  Adam is eleven.

                           CALVIN
                 This is what money looks like.  It
                 comes like this, in coin, or like this
                 in paper.  Or you can have an
                 "investment."  These are stock
                 "certificates" that we bought in your
                 name.  Of course, they're worthless
                 now, but at one time they were quite
                 valuable.

                           ADAM
                 They're pretty.  Can I have them?

                           CALVIN
                 Sure. Now, let's move on to our French
                 exam.

                           ADAM
                 Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.

                           CALVIN
                 You're right!  It's Tuesday already!
                 By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!

                           ADAM
                 Tempus fugit!

                           CALVIN
                 En arte voluptus.
                 Que les bons temps roulÈ!

                           ADAM
                 Gerade aus dann links!

                           CALVIN

                           ADAM
                 Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!

                           CALVIN
                     (marveling)
                 You know, you have a wonderful sense
                 of humor, son!  I must say, the acorn
                 doesn't fall very far from the tree.
                 By the way, it's time I gave you
                 something. Come with me.

       Adam follows his dad out.

       INT. SHUFFLEBOARD COURT - CONTINUOUS

       They pass Helen who is absentmindedly poking at the puck
       with a stick. She's not having a very good day. She wears
       her hair dryer but it's not plugged in.

                           CALVIN
                 Hi, honey!

                           HELEN
                 Hi.

       INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

       Calvin hands Adam a cigar box. Adam opens it to see
       Calvin's remarkable baseball card collection.

                           ADAM
                 These are wonderful.

                           CALVIN
                 It's my entire baseball collection.
                 It's yours now.

                           ADAM
                 What's baseball?

                           CALVIN
                 It's a game, son. I can explain it
                 pretty easily. There's a pitcher.

                           ADAM
                 Like a painting?

                           CALVIN
                     (chuckling)
                 No, son. A pitcher.

                           ADAM
                 Like one of Mom's?

                           CALVIN
                 Uh, no. There's a man who throws the
                 ball -- to a man who has a bat.

                           ADAM
                 The nocturnal flying mammal?

                           CALVIN
                     (slightly pissed)
                 No. Sit down.

       They do.

       INT. SHELTER - NIGHT

       Start close on flashing roller skates. Then cut wider to
       show Adam roller skating. He passes Helen who has fallen
       asleep knitting in one of the lawn chairs. Then Adam
       passes Calvin who is on a ladder soldering a leaking
       ceiling pipe.

       EXT. MALT SHOP - DAY (1991)

       SUPER: 1991

       TWO PUNKS with spiked green hair enter to the strains of
       "My Sharona."


       INT. MALT SHOP - DAY (1991)

       Mom watches the punks enter. Then crosses to the Soda
       Jerk who now has a tattoo on his forehead.

                           MOM
                 I'm selling this place.  I want out of
                 this hell hole!

                           SODA JERK
                 Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...

                           MOM
                 Buy it from me?

                           SODA JERK
                 Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!

                           MOM
                 I'll give it to ya, no money down.
                 The neighborhood has gone to hell
                 anyway.

       She walks off.

                           SODA JERK
                 Cool.

       INT. KITCHEN  (1995)

       SUPER: 1995

       Helen has prepared a birthday cake. Having no birthday
       candles, she's used three votive candles. We can hear
       Calvin and Adam talking in the dining room. (She and
       Calvin are now in their 60's.)

                           CALVIN (OC)
                 No, no! The runner on second goes to
                 third! He's out there!

                           ADAM  (OC)
                 Why?

                           CALVIN (OC)
                 Because he's forced out at third! It's
                 a force!

                           ADAM  (OC)
                 Then why go there?

                           CALVIN  (OC)
                 Because he must!

                           HELEN
                 Calvin!

                           CALVIN  (OC)
                 Coming!

       Calvin enters.

                           CALVIN (cont'd)
                 Yes, dear?

                           HELEN
                 Get the presents and do the lights.

                           CALVIN
                 You bet.

       Calvin leaves while Helen lights the candles. The whole
       shelter goes dark. Calvin returns with two presents
       wrapped in whatever is available.

       INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS



       Helen and Calvin enter singing Happy Birthday. We see the
       ADULT ADAM for the first time in silhouette. His handsome
       face is revealed to us when the cake is placed before
       him.

                           ADAM
                 Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!

                           CALVIN
                 Blow out the candles!

                           HELEN
                 Make a wish!

       He does both. His parents clap. Helen takes one of the
       presents from Calvin and gives it to Adam. He unwraps it.
       It's a green coat.

                           ADAM
                 Oh, boy! A jacket!

                           CALVIN
                 Your mom made that all by herself.

                           ADAM
                 No kidding!

                           HELEN
                 No kidding.
                     (aside, to Calvin)
                 Who else would have done it?

                           CALVIN
                 And I made these!

       He gives Adam the second present. Adam tears off the
       paper to find a pair of roller-skates that Calvin has
       redesigned. The new skates look kind of like
       rollerblades.

                           ADAM
                 Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!

                           CALVIN
                 Your roller-skates! I redesigned them!
                 I think this new design will work even
                 better!

                           ADAM
                 These are really swell! I mean swell!

                           HELEN
                 What did you wish for, Adam?

                           CALVIN
                 If he tells, it won't come true!

                           HELEN
                 Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We
                 never believed that in my family!

                           CALVIN
                 Well, we did in my family!

                           ADAM
                 I wished I could meet a girl.

       His parents don't have a reply for that.

                           HELEN
                 Oh. A nice one, I hope.

                           ADAM
                 Yes, ma'am.

                           CALVIN
                 One who doesn't glow in the dark.

                           HELEN
                 Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!

                           CALVIN
                 Well, we'll be going up in two years.
                 We'll know then. I'm very hopeful.

                           ADAM
                     (ardently)
                 Me, too.

       His parents stare at him for a beat, then:

                           HELEN
                 Let's eat our cake.

                           CALVIN
                 Yeah. Let's dig in!

       They do.

                           HELEN
                 Elbows, Son.

                           ADAM
                 Sorry, Mom!

                           HELEN
                 You never know. You may someday dine
                 at the White House with the president.

                           CALVIN
                 If we still have one.

                           HELEN
                 Yes...

                           CALVIN
                 You know, when we do go up...I'm going
                 to miss this old place. How 'bout you,
                 hon?

                           HELEN
                     (after a beat)
                 Would you excuse me?

                           CALVIN
                 Sure.

       Helen rises and exits.

       INT. BATTERY ROOM- LATER, SAME NIGHT

       Helen enters and goes into the generator room. Through
       the glass we can see (and hear) her scream. Straightening
       her hair and feeling much better, she exits as Calvin
       strolls by wearing his tool belt. She's headed out.

                           CALVIN
                 In the generator room again?

                           HELEN
                 Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how
                 all    these things work.

                           CALVIN
                 I know exactly what you mean!
                     (then)
                 Hey, honey?

       She turns to him. He gives her his patented thumbs up
       sign.

                           CALVIN (cont'd)
                 Great cake!!

       She smiles wanely and leaves. He shuts the generator door
       she left open.

       SCENE 61 OMITTED

       INT.SHELTER, LIVING ROOM - VERY EARLY MORNING

       SUPER: THE PRESENT

       The room is quiet and empty.  The star-burst WALL CLOCK
       on the paneling says 6:15.

       INT. SHELTER, KITCHEN - SAME TIME

       Also empty.

       INT. STOREROOM - SAME TIME

       Also empty.  And with MEAGER SUPPLIES on the shelves.

       INT. POWER AND PUMP ROOM - SAME TIME

       The old pipes are rusted and patched. Some are leaking
       badly.

       INT. MASTER BEDROOM - SAME TIME

       Calvin wakes up. He looks over at Helen's bed.

       ANGLE - HELEN

       She wakes up. Then jumps out of bed.



       SCENE 67 OMITTED



       CLOSE ON THE RED METAL BOX

       that has been ticking on the wall for thirty-five years.
       Suddenly it STOPS TICKING and a rather annoying ALARM
       GOES OFF.  Calvin's hand reaches up and turns it off by
       throwing the lever up.

       ANOTHER ANGLE shows us the mechanism on the FRONT
       HATCHWAY switch to OPEN with a loud, vault-like move.

       ANOTHER ANGLE

       reveals the family in their pajamas standing in front of
       the front hatchway and red box.

                           ADAM
                 So...we just open this door and go up?



       Calvin grabs a handle and using all his strength, opens
       the front entrance hatch. And then must jump back when
       nothing but earth and rock pour into the room.

                           ADAM
                 Um...is that supposed to happen?

       His parents take a beat then race off like maniacs
       through the entire shelter to the back hatch door.  They
       knock over whatever gets in their way as they go. Adam
       follows.

                           ADAM
                 Hey, where are we going?!  Is
                 everything all right?!

       INT. BACK HATCHWAY - MOMENTS LATER

       Calvin and Helen arrive followed by Adam who can't
       possibly share his parent's deep concerns. Everyone is
       out of breath.

                           CALVIN
                 Should we say a little prayer first?

                           HELEN
                 Just open the door.

       Calvin attempts to open the big hatch, but can't.  Adam
       helps him.  Helen pitches in.  Slowly, with lots of
       squeaking, the DOOR OPENS. He steps through the hatch and
       flips a wall switch.  Red submarine LIGHTS COME ON....
       And the service elevator is intact.

       INT. ANTEROOM - CONTINUOUS

       Helen steps through and embraces Calvin joyfully.  The
       old folks break into a dance as Adam enters.

                           ADAM
                 Well, do we just go on up?!

                           CALVIN
                     (quickly back to business,
                      and way too dramatic)
                 No, son! We wait for night.  Now...is
                 precisely when... we must be at our...
                 most cautious.

                           HELEN
                     (barely a whisper, but
                      definitely tired of his
                      B.S.)
                 Oh, shit.

       Helen's eyes widen and her hand flies up to her mouth.
       She is just as shocked as Calvin.

                           CALVIN
                 Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have
                 been down here a little too long!
                     (to Adam)
                 Please excuse her French.

                           ADAM
                 Shit is a French word?

                           HELEN
                 Yes, yes it is!

                           CALVIN
                 It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly
                 meaning..."good".

                           HELEN
                 Yes! That's right!

                           ADAM
                 Oh.
                     (then)
                 Well...then...shit!

       There is a pause, then:

                           CALVIN
                 C'est bon, Monsieur.

                           ADAM
                 Merci!

       SCENE 71 OMITTED



       EXT. THE MALT SHOP - NIGHT

       Cars flash by in a rare L.A. DOWNPOUR.  All that's left
       of Mom's is an EMPTY BUILDING with a painted-out front
       window and a "For Sale or Rent" sign.  There's ANOTHER
       SHOP attached to it CAMERA RIGHT but we can't see what it
       is.  The alley way on the left has always been there.

       INT. MALT SHOP - CONTINUOUS

       TWO DRUNK BUMS are sharing a bottle. One of them is the
       Soda Jerk, now a  dissipated middle-aged man (with a
       tattoo on his forehead.)

                           SODA JERK
                 ...all of these things...Alcoholics
                 Anonymous...Cocaine Anonymous...Heroin
                 Anonymous.

                           OTHER BUM
                 There's a Heroin Anonymous?

                            SODA JERK
                 Shut up! All of these things... ask
                 you to believe in a power greater than
                 yourself! Some sort of God on High!
                 Well...I have lifted my eyes skyward a
                 time or two... and I have certainly
                 not seen anything coming from up there
                 except a goddamn airplane -- that I
                 can't afford to get on!

       The cement FLOOR of the old Malt Shop begins to QUIVER
       AND RUMBLE.

                           OTHER BUM
                 Earthquake!  Another earthquake!

                           SODA JERK
                 Let her come!  Let's get this over
                 with!  And please, if there is a God,
                 let it be worse in Bel Air!!

       The Other Bum staggers to his feet and SPLITS for a back
       window.  Soda Jerk is fearless.  Until finally the
       HYDRAULIC DOORS of the back entrance SPLIT THE FLOOR with
       an eerie, struggling whine and LARGE CHUNKS OF CEMENT GO
       FLYING.  Then up comes RED SUBMARINE LIGHT followed by
       Calvin in his BIG YELLOW SUIT with Geiger counter
       ticking.

                           SODA JERK
                 Oh, God!  Oh, God!!  Oh,God, save me!!
                 For I have seen the light!!

       Calvin raises his hand and yells through his mask.

                           CALVIN
                 I come in peace!!

       The Soda Jerk FAINTS. Calvin, sounding like a deep sea
       diver and having to walk like Frankenstein, goes over to
       the Soda Jerk and studies his face in the light of his
       flashlight.  He is horrified by what he sees.

                           CALVIN
                 My, gosh...

       Calvin looks around the room and heads for the back.  He
       moves his Geiger counter around and gets a quiet (safe)
       reading. Then he removes a KITCHEN MATCH from a plastic
       container and strikes it against the wall.  The MATCH
       BURNS, so Calvin takes off his hood and visor and
       breathes the air.  It stinks in there.

       EXT. MALT SHOP - MOMENTS LATER, RAINING

       Calvin (out of the head gear and top of the suit) slowly
       pushes the door open and steps out. He's surprised to
       find an empty BODY SHOP behind the Malt Shop, where the
       avocado trees should be.

                           CALVIN
                 Where is my backyard?

       He points his flashlight around and heads for the ALLEY
       to his left.

       EXT. ALLEY - A MOMENT LATER, RAINING

       DERELICT CARS left over from the Body Shop sit against a
       fence. Calvin marvels at the cars, even in their present
       condition.  In a TIGHTER SHOT he studies the chrome-
       plated word "Toyota."   A HOMELESS MAN arrives to search
       through the garbage. Calvin hurries back towards the
       avenue.

       SCENE 76 OMITTED

       EXT. MALT SHOP - TEN MINUTES LATER, RAIN

       Calvin emerges from the alley that separates the Malt
       Shop from another storefront (perhaps now a rundown Thai
       restaurant.)

       CLOSER ON HIM

       watching the cars fly by on the wet avenue.  Suddenly, a
       cross-dressing STREET WALKER steps up to him with a
       cigarette.

                           STREET WALKER
                 You got a light, honey?

                           CALVIN
                 What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a
                 light!

                           STREET WALKER
                 Good.

       Fumbling, he finally gets her little cigar lighted with
       one of his kitchen matches.

                           CALVIN
                 So...you...survived the blast, did
                 you?

                           STREET WALKER
                 The blast?  Honey, I have survived a
                 host of things. Like the song says: "A
                 country boy can survive!"

                           CALVIN
                 Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has
                 it been...hell up here?

                           STREET WALKER
                 "Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell
                 up here, down there and over yonder!
                 Hell everywhere.

                           CALVIN
                 Yes, I can tell that just looking
                 around.
                 		(then)
                 "Boy?"  Did you say you were a
                 "country boy?"

                           STREET WALKER
                 Cute Little Old Man, if you want a
                 boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want
                 a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be
                 anything you want me to be!

                           CALVIN
                 Really?

                           STREET WALKER
                 Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the
                 remarkably low price of only $200!
                 And if you act now, I might even throw
                 in some free lawn furniture.

                           CALVIN
                     (stumbling away from her)
                 No, I can't.  I'm sorry!  I have to
                 go!  I have to...

       He breaks into a trot, heading up the street past a seedy
       BAR (used to be the convenience store) just as a
       hopelessly DRUNK HAG of a woman is shoved out and told to
       stay out.  Calvin watches as the woman stumbles to the
       curb where she TOSSES her cookies.  TWO LOW RIDERS HOP BY
       full of TAUNTING YOUNG HISPANIC GANG MEMBERS, one of whom
       BRANDISHES A PISTOL and, just for fun, points it at
       Calvin.  When Calvin sees the pistol he ducks into the
       ADULT BOOKSTORE. The young gang member pulls the trigger
       and we (not Calvin) see that the realistic-looking pistol
       is really a water gun.

       INT. ADULT BOOK AND VIDEO STORE

       Calvin races in and, gathering himself, addresses the
       PAKISTANI MAN behind the counter.

                           CALVIN
                 Hello!  How are you this evening?!
                 Mind if I, you know, browse around?!

       The clerk just watches him.

                           CALVIN
                 Thank-Q very much!

       Then Calvin turns and has his first look at the
       material...and he GRABS HIS HEART and SCREAMS and FALLS
       back KNOCKING OVER a whole ROW OF VIDEOS AND MAGAZINES.

       INT. SHELTER, KITCHEN - AN HOUR LATER

       Calvin sits at the breakfast table, still breathing hard
       and holding his chest.  His family looks on with great
       concern.  The anti-radiation suit and gear is piled in
       the corner.

                           CALVIN
                 I'm going to give it to you straight.
                 There's no point in beating around the
                 bush. There were survivors.
                 Apparently,
                 the fallout has created....a
                 subspecies of mutants.

                           HELEN
                 Mutants?!

                           CALVIN
                 It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out
                 of garbage cans.  Others are...cover
                 your ears, Son, and hum.  I mean that
                 literally and I mean right now!

       ADAM covers his ears and hums.

                           CALVIN
                 Others are...multi-sexual.  It
                 seems...they can be both masculine and
                 feminine...simultaneously.

                           HELEN
                 No.

                           CALVIN
                 Yes.

                           HELEN
                 I don't believe it!

       Helen copes by moving around the kitchen doing things
       that don't need to be done.


                           CALVIN
                 Believe it. He tried to sell me his
                 body, Helen.
                 		(beat)
                 They offer lawn furniture as a come
                 on!

       She slumps, then resumes her needless activity.  Calvin
       takes Adam's arm and the son drops his hands and stops
       humming.

                           CALVIN
                 They've done a lot of re-building but
                 society, at least as we knew it, has
                 utterly collapsed. People throw up in
                 the streets. Others point guns.
                 There's something terribly wrong with
                 the automobiles and...and I...I can't
                 tell you the rest.  I just can't.

                           HELEN
                 Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So,
                 what do we do now?

                           CALVIN
                 We stay down here.

                           HELEN
                 We do?

                           CALVIN
                 Yes.

                           HELEN
                 Excuse me.

       She hurries into the living room.

       INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

       Helen let's out a silent scream, then hurries back into
       the kitchen.

       INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS



                           HELEN
                 For how long?  We've just about run
                 out of everything!

                           CALVIN
                 We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion
                 that these mutants will eventually
                 kill each other off and then--

                           HELEN
                     (rising)
                 No, Calvin.  We're not going to make
                 do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going
                 up no matter what!  We deserve it.
                 Even if it's terrible!

                           CALVIN
                 Well, I am the head of this household--

                           HELEN
                 I want him to at least see the sky!

                           CALVIN
                 --and we will--

                           HELEN
                 And the ocean!  A mountain range!

                           CALVIN
                 --do as I say!

       Breathing heavily, Calvin suddenly clutches at his chest
       in great pain and collapses.

                           ADAM
                 Dad!

                           HELEN
                 Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get
                 him into the bedroom.

       INT. HALLWAY - HOURS LATER

       Adam paces.  Then Helen comes out.  Behind her, we can
       see Calvin sleeping in his bed. She heads for the living
       room. He follows.

                           HELEN
                 He seems to be doing all right now.  I
                 don't know if he's had a heart attack
                 or just... a horrifying experience.
                 But we  need supplies and I've got to
                 stay with him.

                           ADAM
                 I'll go up.

       They go through the living room and cross to the patio.

                           HELEN
                 I'm afraid you've got to.

                           ADAM
                 I'll be all right.

                           HELEN
                     (patting his cheek)
                 You're my brave boy.



       Helen hands him a pencil and pad. Adam follows her to the
       fish farm.

                           HELEN
                 Just act normal.  If anybody asks,
                 simply say you're from out-of-town,
                 and that you're in town on business.
                 Write that down.

       He does.

                           HELEN (cont'd)
                 I'm going to give you a shopping list
                 and some money.  We need just enough
                 things to get us through the next year
                 or two.  And you'll find most of these
                 items at what used to be called a
                 grocery store or a hardware store.
                 Write that down.

                           ADAM
                 Yes, ma'am.

       At the fish tank, Helen pulls up a slim chain that is
       attached to a water-tight aluminum box which she quickly
       opens. The box contains $6,000 in wrapped one hundred
       dollar bills. Helen takes half of it.

                           HELEN
                 I don't know how far you'll have to
                 travel to find supplies, but if you
                 can't get home by nightfall, I want
                 you to look for something called a
                 Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a
                 hotel. There might still be one
                 standing.

                           ADAM
                 Yes, ma'am.


                           HELEN
                 Let's get you packed.

       She heads back for the house. He follows.

                           ADAM
                 Right.

                           HELEN
                     (indicating money)
                 I just hope this is still good up
                 there.

                           ADAM
                 Mom?


                           HELEN
                 Yes?

                           ADAM
                 I was thinking that, uh...you know,
                 while I was up there and all...that
                 maybe I could, you know...try to meet
                 a girl.  I've, been thinking about
                 that a little...just these
                 last...fifteen years or so.

       They have stopped by the garden.


                           HELEN
                 Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if
                 you could find a girl. One who's not a
                 mutant...and hopefully comes from
                 Pasadena. Nothing against Valley
                 girls,
                 but in my day anyhow, the girls from
                 Pasadena, I don't know...always just
                 seemed a little nicer.

                           ADAM
                 Yes, ma'am.

       They hug.

                           HELEN
                 Oh, there's also a thing called a
                 liquor store. Write that down.

       INT. ADAM'S ROOM - AN HOUR LATER

       He is packing. He looks at his cigar box and opens it. He
       studies the contents: The Cards, stock certificates, and
       an old photo of his parents. He decides to pack the box.
       Helen enters with a long shopping list.

                           HELEN
                 Here's the shopping list and $3,000
                 which should take care of everything.

                           ADAM
                 Yes, ma'am.

                           HELEN
                 Your father has a few final words for
                 you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw
                 for you - he loves you so much. We
                 both do.

                           ADAM
                 Heck, I know that mom! You're my
                 parents.

       INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

       Adam sets down his suitcase and goes to his father's bed.
       He sits. At the door, Helen dries her eyes with her
       apron.  Calvin indicates that he wants to whisper to
       Adam, who drops his ear close to his father's lips.

                           CALVIN
                 Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...

                           ADAM
                 Yes, father?! Yes?

                           CALVIN
                 ...the pipe tobacco.

                           ADAM
                 Yes, sir.  Is that all?

       Calvin nods. Adam rises and starts for the door. But
       Calvin remembers something and beckons him back to speak
       weakly into his son's ear.

                           CALVIN
                 Also...stay out of the "Adult
                 Bookstore."

                           ADAM
                 Adult Bookstore.  Why?

                           CALVIN
                 Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.

                           ADAM
                 I promise. Is that all?

                           CALVIN
                 One more thing. If you find a healthy
                 young woman, bring her back with you.

                           ADAM
                 I'll try.

       And then Calvin closes his eyes and sleeps.

       INT. MALT SHOP - SAME DAY

       The Soda Jerk has turned the rear exit into a religious
       shrine.  He's put flowers and candles and costume jewelry
       and religious icons (from all the Majors) on top of and
       around the broken cement.  Currently he's on his knees,
       rocking back and forth as he prays.

       And,lo! There came a rumbling even as from the very
       bowels of the earth and a great light showed forth
       followed by gates of armor which opened and shut and
       delivered up the vision of a young man whose countenance
       caused the Soda Jerk to be struck dumb and to fall on his
       face and to weep in fear.  And, Adam, taking pity on the
       man, put down his suitcase, and went to him, saying:

                           ADAM
                 Are you all right?

                           SODA JERK
                 Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes!
                 But  where is the one who came last
                 night -- all in yellow?!

                           ADAM
                 All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my
                 father!

                           SODA JERK
                 Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father!
                 Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for
                 my wasted life?!  Everything has been
                 so awful!!

                           ADAM
                     (comforting him)
                 I know it has been terrible.  But it
                 wasn't your fault. And now all the
                 decay is over with and things are
                 going to get better. You understand?

                           SODA JERK
                 Yes.

                           ADAM
                 I've got to go, now.

                           SODA JERK
                 Of course you do.  I'll stay here and
                 pray.

                           ADAM
                     (picking up his suitcase)
                 That's always a good idea! Would you
                 like some money? I have a great deal
                 of it.

                           SODA JERK
                 No. I don't need money anymore -- I
                 see that now.

                           ADAM
                 How do I leave here?

                           SODA JERK
                 The front door is open.  Will you be
                 back?

                           ADAM
                 I promise.

       Adam turns and leaves. The Soda Jerk falls to his knees
       and shakes all over.

       EXT. MALT SHOP - CONTINUOUS

       Adam steps out onto the sidewalk and sunlight falls on
       him much brighter than anything he has ever seen.  He
       looks at it on the arm of his coat and then, slowly, he
       looks up at the sky.

       INTERCUT - LOVELY CLOUDS AND BLUE SKY

       And now it is Adam who is dumbstruck. BYSTANDER #1
       appears and sees Adam looking up.

                           BYSTANDER #1
                 What?  What is it?!

                           ADAM
                 The sky!!!

                           BYSTANDER #1
                 The sky?  Where?

                           ADAM
                     (pointing)
                 Up there!!

                           BYSTANDER #1
                 I don't see anything!

                           ADAM
                 Just look!!

       Adam becomes momentarily interested in a parking meter.

       A MOTHER and her CHILD approach from the other direction.

                           WOMAN
                 What is it!

                           BYSTANDER #1
                     (pointing)
                 He sees something.

                           MOTHER
                 What?

                           CHILD
                 I see it, mommy!

                           BYSTANDER #2
                 Where?!


       Several more people are drawn over. A CONVERTIBLE goes by
       in the foreground with passengers who are looking up.

                           WOMAN
                 What is it?

                           ADAM
                 I have never in my life seen anything
                 like this!!!! Nothing even comes
                 close!!

       Adam continues down the sidewalk,looking up. A BLACK
       WOMAN POSTAL WORKER passes by.

                           POSTAL WORKER
                 Whatcha looking at?

                           ADAM
                 Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!

                           POSTAL WORKER
                     (with attitude)
                 Say what?!

                           ADAM
                     (offering his hand)
                 How do you do, ma'am.

                           POSTAL WORKER
                     (leary, but taking his hand)
                 I do alright.

                           ADAM
                 Good!

       The Pakistani exits the Adult Bookstore.


                           PAKISTANI
                 What is it?!  What do you see?!

       When Adam looks down to answer the man he sees the "Adult
       Bookstore" sign.

                           ADAM
                 Oh, no!

                           PAKISTANI
                 What?!

                           ADAM
                 Poisonous gas!!  Run for your life,
                 it's invisible poisonous gas!!!

       And everyone does run away, including Adam. The avenue is
       left totally deserted.



       INT. KITCHEN NOOK - SAME DAY

       Helen sits sipping tea, deep in thoughts of concern for
       Adam. Behind her Calvin appears in the open window.

                           CALVIN
                 You know--

       Helen is so startled she knocks the tea all over the
       place.

                           CALVIN (cont'd)
                 I just wanted to say that I think he's
                 going to be just fine.

                           HELEN
                     (holding her heart)
                 Thank you, Calvin. Thank you very
                 much.

       Calvin leaves, then comes back.

                           CALVIN
                 He's smart.

                           HELEN
                 Yes, dear, I know.



       SCENE 85A OMITTED


       EXT. CORNER BUS STOP - AFTERNOON, SAME DAY

       An L.A. bus comes directly at CAMERA.



       ANGLE - THE DRIVER

       is startled. He reacts.

       ANGLE - DRIVER'S FOOT

       slamming down the brake pedal.

       ANGLE - ADAM

       in profile. The braking bus stops an inch from his nose.
       Adam smiles. (Have him head for bus door in this angle.)

       ANGLE - THE DRIVER

       from over Adam. He is in shock.



       INT. BUS - A MOMENT LATER

       Start on a MOVING STEADY CAM SHOT on Adam's POV of bus
       passengers as he heads for a seat. The passengers look at
       him in amazement and some fear.

       ANGLE - ADAM

       going to his seat; smiling at the passengers. (He is
       carrying a $100 bill.)

                           ADAM
                 Hello! Hi. Good afternoon! Howdy.

       Adam finds a seat next to a heavily perspiring young
       PSYCHO HEROIN ADDICT.

       ANOTHER ANGLE OF THEM

       Adam shows the Psycho the $100 bill.

                           ADAM
                 I tried to give the driver this but he
                 wouldn't take it. He seems angry. A
                 lot of people do.

       The bus pulls out. It gets up to about twenty miles an
       hour.

                           ADAM (cont'd)
                 Oh, boy! Here we go! We're moving!
                 Wow.

       INTERCUT: PASSENGERS

       looking back at Adam with concern.

                           ADAM (CONT'D)

                 So this is public transportation. My
                 Dad says that it becomes more and more
                 important because of pollution --
                 which is more and more carbon dioxide
                 and other hazardous gases in the air.
                     (then, confidentially)
                 Do you have a gun, by the way?

       The increasingly nervous Psycho looks around, then nods
       that he does.

                           ADAM (cont'd)
                 Well, thanks for not waving it around.
                 And for not vomitting, for that
                 matter. Wow, we're really flying. Say,
                 do you know where I could find a
                 grocery store?

       The psycho shakes his head.

                           ADAM (cont'd)
                 I have to find that. And a hardware
                 store  and a liquour store and a
                 standing Holiday Inn. Although, I may
                 not need the Holiday Inn. That's still
                 kind of up in the air. It depends
                 really on how things go.

                           PSYCHO
                     (pointing)
                 There's a grocery store coming up.

                           ADAM
                 Thank-Q!
                     (jumping up)
                 Driver! Please stop the bus
                 immediately! I have to get off!
                     (then an aside to the psycho)
                 Do you think I should get a gun?

                           PSYCHO
                 I don't know...maybe.

                           ADAM
                     (back to driver)
                 Driver! Please stop, sir!

       INTERCUT - DRIVER IN THE REAR VIEW

       He's not going to stop until he wants to stop.

       ANGLE - OLD JEWISH COUPLE PASSENGERS.

       who are anxious for Adam to leave.

                           OLD JEWISH MAN
                 For the love of God! Let him off the
                 bus!! Can't you see he's meshugina!

       Adam leans in close to the OLD MAN.

                           ADAM
                 I'm sorry, what did you call me?

       The man and his wife take that the wrong way and start to
       scream.

       ANGLE - THE DRIVER'S FOOT

       hitting the brakes.

       EXT.- BUS

       stopping suddenly. Through the windows we see Adam go
       down.

       INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS

       The back door opens as Adam gets up.

                           ADAM
                 Thank you, driver! Good-bye, everyone!

       Adam exits the bus. Everyone, including the Psycho,
       heaves a huge sign of relief.

       INT. SUPER MARKET - MINUTES LATER

       Adam enters and (after getting over the automatic doors
       and the check-out technology) is overwhelmed by the
       magnificence of the postmodern California supermarket.
       The check-out counters alone are amazing. Seeing others
       do it, he takes a cart, placing his suitcase in it.

       INT. BAKERY COUNTER

       Adam passes the baked goods, paying particular attention
       to the elaborate birthday cakes.

                           ADAM
                 Is that a birthday cake?!

                           CLERK
                 Yes, it is.

                           ADAM
                 Gee-ma-nee!

       Adam leaves. The clerk turns to a fellow worker.

                           CLERK
                 Bakersfield.

       INT. AISLE

       Adam marvels at the abundance and variety. He passes a
       mother whose child is riding in the cart and that reminds
       him of his own mom -- when she used to let him ride that
       way.  Then he is surprised to see a MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE so
       casually dressed in public. She (overweight) is in an
       unfortunate terrycloth halter-shorts combination.  He
       (hirsute) is in a sleeveless undershirt and baggy bathing
       trunks.

                           ADAM
                     (to himself)
                 My first mutants.

       INT. FRESH PRODUCE

       Adam picks up one of those huge California cucumbers that
       always amaze Easterners.  He shows it to the JAPANESE-
       AMERICAN CLERK.

                           ADAM
                 Is this because of the radiation?

                           CLERK
                 What?

                           ADAM
                 Nothing.

       INT. MEAT COUNTER

       Adam is looking at the live lobsters as a BUTCHER steps
       up.

                           BUTCHER
                 Help you?

                           ADAM
                 Yes, please.
                     (consulting his Mom's list)
                 I'm looking for all beef patties.



                           BUTCHER
                 Fresh or frozen?

       Adam chuckles because he thinks the man is kidding.

                           ADAM
                 Come on. Frozen. How much are they?

                           BUTCHER
                 Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in
                 the three pound box.

                           ADAM
                 Then I'll need, twelve into nine
                 hundred, seventy-five boxes. And
                 that's almost...five hundred dollars
                 just for the hamburger! And my Mom
                 only gave me three thousand dollars
                 for everything! The yacht batteries!
                 The diesel oil! The birthday candles!

                           BUTCHER
                 You could have a meat order that big
                 delivered to your home.

                           ADAM

                 Really?!

                           BUTCHER
                 Sure.

                           ADAM
                 Well, that's great then!
                 Terrific...except...it just occurred
                 to me. I don't know where I live! I'm
                 lost! I don't know where home is!
                     (then)
                 Would you excuse me?

                           BUTCHER
                 Gladly.

       Adam hurries away.



       SCENE 93 OMITTED

       SCENE 94 OMITTED



       A MONTAGE

       of Adam on another bus. He looks frantically out the
       window. We see his POV of shops and stores and people. At
       one point he sees two women joggers which he wonders
       about. Then he sees two men arguing violently. Gradually
       late day turns to night and Adam becomes more and more
       depressed. Then he sees something. He is elated. He jumps
       up and tells the driver:

                           ADAM
                 Driver! Stop this bus immediately!
                 Please sir!!

       EXT. - VENTURA BLVD - NIGHT

       The bus stops mid-block and Adam gets off. He crosses the
       street causing only one car to hit the brakes. On the
       other side of the avenue we see what has gotten his
       attention. It's an ADULT BOOKSTORE much like the last one
       we saw (probably owned by the same chain.) He's happy but
       when he looks next door he sees he's in a different
       place. Sad and lost he turns north and starts to walk
       until -- a billboard catches his attention. We pan up to
       see a billboard for liposuction that features an almost
       NUDE WOMAN. Adam is struck by the image and we spend some
       time cutting between him and it. Then gathering himself
       he turns and begins to walk south.

       ANOTHER ANGLE

       of him as he passes a BODY PIERCING STORE and wonders
       about that. Then he sees something that blows his mind.

       WIDER ANGLE

       of a STRAY DOG passing by. Adam reacts.

                           ADAM
                 Oh my. Oh, my goodness gracious! Oh,
                 my...Oh. That is so great!! Man alive!

       ANGLE - CU OF BASEBALL CARDS STORE WINDOW



       A sign says: COMIC BOOKS & BASEBALL CARDS BOUGHT, SOLD &
       TRADED.

       INT. CARD AND COMIC STORE - MOMENTS LATER

       Adam enters with his suitcase in one hand and his cigar
       box in the other.  He steps up to the counter where the
       owner (JERRY) sits reading the newspaper. He has a
       fondness for Navajo jewelry.

                           ADAM
                 Hello.

                           JERRY
                     (gives him a look, then goes
                      back to reading)
                 Hi.

       A YOUNG WOMAN enters from the back of the store and goes
       to another counter.  Neither man notices.

                           ADAM
                 The name is Adam Webber and I see you
                 buy baseball cards and although these
                 are a lot older than the ones in the
                 window, I was hoping you still might
                 be interested.

       He flips open the cigar box to reveal to Jerry riches
       beyond his wildest dreams.  Jerry actually moans and then
       must pretend the moan was a cough.

                           JERRY
                 How--how much do you want for the
                 Mickey Mantle, rookie season?

                           ADAM
                 I was thinking of selling all the
                 cards.

                           JERRY
                 Really? No kidding?

       He reaches in and looks through the cards.

                           ADAM
                 See, my problem is, all I have are
                 hundred dollar bills and I need
                 something smaller.  Ones, fives, tens.
                 Like that.

                           JERRY
                 I see what ya mean. Tell you
                 what...I'll give you five hundred
                 dollars in small bills for the whole
                 box.

                           ADAM
                 Oh, that would be wonderful!

                           JERRY
                 Well, we're here to help!

       A woman steps into the shot. She has come from the back
       of the store and her back is momentarily to us.

                           EVE (OC)
                 Oh, shit!

       Adam turns to her and is immediately awe struck. We
       reveal EVE RUSTOKOV. She tosses her lipstick into her
       purse. Eve works in the card shop and is on her way out.


                           JERRY
                 I'm workin' here, Evey-poo.  Don't
                 screw me up.


                           ADAM
                 Bon soir, mademoiselle!

                           EVE
                 Are you French?

                           ADAM
                 No.
                     (then, thinking fast)
                 I'm from out of town.
                     (then sensing the need for
                      further clarification)
                 I'm here on business.

                           EVE
                 Well, your business must not be sports
                 memorabilia, because this one Mantle
                 card right here--
                     (holds up a card)
                 --is worth six thousand dollars all by
                 its little self.


                           ADAM
                 Get out of here!

                           EVE
                 No, you get out of here.

       She closes his cigar box and gives it to him.




                           JERRY
                 Terrific...you're fired! You know
                 that?!



                           EVE
                 No, ferry--excuse me, Jerry, I quit.

       She walks back to the counter to get her coat.

                           JERRY
                 Oh, no! I fired ya! Just like the hair
                 salon guy and the Chevy dealer!  You
                 know why you can't keep a goddamn
                 job?!  Because you can't keep your
                 goddamn mouth shut!  That's why!

       Jerry is surprised when Adam suddenly takes his arm
       firmly.

                           ADAM
                 Sir? I would really appreciate it if
                 you wouldn't take the Lord's name in
                 vain again.

                           JERRY
                     (looking at Adam's hand)
                 Oh, you got a problem with that?


                           ADAM
                 I have a big problem with that.

       Eve sees a fist fight coming. She takes Adam by the arm.



                           EVE
                 Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to
                 the corner.

                           ADAM
                 Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.



                           EVE
                 Just come on.

       They head for the door and exit.

                           JERRY
                 Hah!  Adam and Eve!  The perfect
                 match!  I hope you two will be very
                 happy together!  Mazel-fuckin'-tov!
                 Don't try coming back, Ms. Big Shot!
                 I'm serious this time! You're finished
                 in the hobby business! Take that to
                 the bank, why don'tcha!

       Adam re-enters.

                           ADAM
                 I didn't want to leave without saying
                 how much I admire your jewelry.

                           JERRY
                 Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your
                 butt?

       Adam walks towards the man smiling.

                           ADAM
                 How 'bout you what?

       Jerry takes a nervous step backwards, but Eve steps back
       in and pulls Adam out.

                           EVE
                 I said come on!



       Adam exits. Jerry doesn't know what to say.

       EXT. CARD STORE - NIGHT

       They exit the store.

                           ADAM
                 Where are we going?

                           EVE
                 We? I'm going home. And, judging by
                 that coat, I'd say you have to get
                 back to the barber college.

                           ADAM
                 No, I'm lost.

                           EVE
                 You're lost?

                           ADAM
                 Say,...did you just lose your job
                 because of me?

                           EVE
                 Forget it.  I'm sick of working for
                 that dickhead.

                           ADAM
                 Dickhead?

                           EVE
                 A walking penis capable of intelligent
                 speech.  A dickhead.

       A mental picture of that causes Adam to slump against a
       store window and drop his box of cards.

                           EVE
                 What's wrong with you?

                           ADAM
                 I just had a mental picture of...

                           EVE
                 Here, pick these up!

       Together they pick up the cards.

                           EVE (cont'd)
                 Where are you parked?

                           ADAM
                 I came on a bus.

                           EVE
                 Why doesn't that surprise me?

                           ADAM
                 I don't know. Why doesn't it?

       They rise.

                           EVE
                 Well, I guess because I'm a little
                 psychic...I have this thing.

                           ADAM
                 Oh, that's nice.

                           EVE
                 Let me guess something. This is your
                 first visit to La La Land. You're
                 staying somewhere over in Hollywood
                 because, like an idiot, you thought
                 that would be an exciting place to
                 stay.  Right so far?



                           ADAM
                     (could be a question, could
                      be an answer.)
                 So far?

                           EVE
                 Yes, I'm right?

                           ADAM
                 Right.

                           EVE
                 I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus
                 and before you know it, you're out
                 here in the San Fernando Valley
                 without a clue.  Which brings us to
                 here.  Correct again?

                           ADAM
                 Again.

                           EVE
                 Where are you staying? The Holiday
                 Inn?

                           ADAM
                 Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's
                 exactly right!

                           EVE
                 See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but
                 pretty much. That was pretty good,
                 wasn't it?!

                           ADAM
                 It was amazing.

                           EVE
                 Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a
                 bus for you to get on.

                           ADAM
                 Do you own a car?

                           EVE
                 I'm not taking you there, Sweetie.
                 Rule Number One in North America: No
                 strangers in the car.

                           ADAM
                 If it will make you feel any better, I
                 don't have a gun.

                           EVE
                 You don't?

                           ADAM
                 Nope.

                           EVE
                 Well, that changes everything. Get the
                 fuck away from me!!  I mean it!!

       She races around the corner.  He goes after her.

                           ADAM
                 I'm sorry!  I said something wrong,
                 didn't I!  Please forgive me!

                           EVE
                 Get away from me!!

       She runs into a parking lot.  He follows.

                           ADAM
                 Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal
                 with you!  I'll give you a Rogers
                 Hornsby, if you'll take me to the
                 hotel!

                           EVE
                 Rogers Hornsby?!?

                           ADAM
                 He's all yours. I was holding him
                 back.

       Adam takes a Hornsby card from his coat pocket and shows
       it to her.

                           EVE
                 Rogers Hornsby's worth like four
                 thousand dollars!

                           ADAM
                 So what?!  I've got two of him!
                 		(removing more cards from his
                 		 pocket)
                 And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons.
                 I was holding these out, too.

       She arrives at her car (dirty GEO) and anxiously unlocks
       the driver's door.

                           EVE
                 So for four thousand dollars, all I
                 have to do is drive you to your hotel?

                           ADAM
                 Yes.

                           EVE
                 And that's it?

                           ADAM
                 Yes.

                           EVE
                 I don't have to take a physical in
                 your space ship?

                           ADAM
                 Heck, no!  What?!

                           EVE
                 Okay.  What the hell?  You got a deal.
                 Get in.

       She gets in. He gets in the back seat behind her.

                           EVE (cont'd)
                 The front seat!

       He runs around to the front while Eve chats with herself.

                           EVE (cont'd)
                 Why am I doing this? What in the hell
                 is wrong with me? That's what I'd like
                 to know.



       SCENE 99 OMITTED



       EXT. HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - MINUTES LATER

       Traffic is moving at fifteen miles an hour. The dash
       lights fascinate him but the car scares him.  She notices
       that he is gripping the seat belt for dear life.

                           EVE
                 So...Mister Andretti, your first time
                 on the freeway?

                           ADAM
                 It's Webber.  Adam Webber.

                           EVE
                 Mind if I change the station?
                 Better traffic reports on AM.

       She switches over to AM and runs by a Perry Como record,
       "Round and Round", looking for traffic.

                           ADAM
                 Wait!  Wait!

                           EVE
                 What is it?!

                           ADAM
                 It's Perry!

                           EVE
                 Perry?

                           ADAM
                 Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back!
                 Go back!

                           EVE
                 Okay, okay!  Take it easy!

       She gets Perry.

                           EVE
                 How's that?

                           ADAM
                     (star-struck)
                 Oh, I could die...

                           EVE
                 Over this?

                           ADAM
                 Yeah! Listen to this part. This is
                 where it really takes off!

                           EVE
                 You are one scary son-of-a-gun.




       EXT. FREEWAY

       Eve's car splits for the exit ramp.

       INT. EVE'S CAR

       The sudden speed scares Adam.

                           ADAM
                 Hey, what are you doing?!

                           EVE
                 I know a short-cut.

       EXT. OFF RAMP

       She comes off, catches the light and whips onto the
       surface street, tires squealing.

       INT. CAR

       Adam is hanging onto his seat belt. Eve puts the pedal to
       the metal.

                           ADAM
                 Gee-zooie!!  You better slow down!!!

                           EVE
                 I can't help it. Perry Como always
                 does this to me! I just get so
                 cranked!

       She turns Perry way up.

       EXT. AVENUE

       Eve does a dandy job of trading lanes and passing.  The
       little Geo's engine screams. Adam's sort of getting into
       it.

       EXT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - TEN MINUTES LATER

       The Geo flies up to a quick stop.

       INT. CAR

       Eve turns to Adam, who has had A Life Experience.

                           EVE
                 Card, please.  End of service.

       He hands over the card like someone in a post-sex stupor.

                           ADAM
                 That was...wonderful!  I've never felt
                 anything like that in my life.

                           EVE
                 Yeah, same here. Don't forget your
                 suitcase.

                           ADAM
                 Right.

       He gets out with the suitcase, and after shutting the
       door leans down to speak to her.

                           ADAM
                 You know--

       She tears off, leaving him there.

       INT. HOTEL REGISTRATION - MINUTES LATER

       Adam addresses the clerk.

                           ADAM
                 Good evening. I want to stay at this
                 hotel.

                           CLERK
                 Fill this out please. And I'll need a
                 card.

                           ADAM
                 A card?

                           CLERK
                 Yes, sir.

                           ADAM
                 Of course!

       Adam gives him a baseball card.

       INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER SAME NIGHT

       A BELLBOY ushers Adam in and sets down his bag.

                           BELLBOY
                 Bathroom's there, TV's over there.
                 Remote's on top. Room Service menu is
                 on the table.

       Adam picks up the phone and listens.


                           BELLBOY (CONT'D)
                 You dial nine to get out.

                           ADAM
                     (beat, then)
                 Of what?

                           BELLBOY
                     (beat, then)
                 The hotel.

                           ADAM
                     (beat, then he hangs up)
                 I see.  Well, thank you very much.
                 You've been very, very nice.

       He offers two dollars.

                           ADAM (cont'd)
                 I was able to get some change
                 downstairs and my father taught me
                 that it's customary to tip in a
                 situation such as this.

                           BELLBOY
                 Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.

                           ADAM
                 My father is a genius.

                           BELLBOY
                 No kiddin'. Well...good night.

                           ADAM
                 Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let
                 the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom
                 always says...
                 		(choking up)
                 ...who I'm really beginning to miss.
                 I'm sorry.  It's my first night away
                 from home.

                           BELLBOY
                 How old are you?

                           ADAM
                 Thirty-five.

                           BELLBOY
                 You don't look thirty-five.

                           ADAM
                 How old do I look?

                           BELLBOY
                 Twenty-five? Around there.

                           ADAM
                 I guess living up here makes people
                 look older.

                           BELLBOY
                 Up here on the fifteenth floor?

                           ADAM
                     (catching himself)
                 Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor.
                 Goodnight.

                           BELLBOY
                 Goodnight.

       Adam abruptly shuts the door in the man's face.
       He goes to the window and looks out. The height scares
       him to death. He jumps back.



       INT. SHELTER, DINNER TABLE - SAME TIME

       Adam's parents pray.

                           CALVIN
                 And Lord we ask finally that you send
                 an angel to look after and protect our
                 beloved son, Adam.  Amen.

                           HELEN
                 Amen.

       She begins to tear up and he pats her hand.

       INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAWN

       Adam sits by the window watching his first dawn.

       EXT. HOLIDAY INN - MORNING

       It's another bright, smoggy day.  And here comes Eve,
       marching from the parking garage to the hotel entrance.

                           EVE
                     (skyward)
                 What in the hell am I doing here?!
                 That's what I'd like to know! Somebody
                 tell me that.

       INT. FRONT DESK - MOMENTS LATER

       Eve is speaking to a DESK CLERK.

                           DESK CLERK
                 You don't have a last name?

                           EVE
                 All I know is that his first name is
                 Adam.  No!  Adam Webber!  That's it.

       INT. ADAM'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

       He is seated on the bed, transfixed, watching a
       television commercial.The PHONE RINGS loudly.  Adam
       nearly jumps out of his skin.  After he figures out where
       the ringing is coming from, he answers the phone.

                           ADAM
                     (into phone, after a long
                      pause)
                 Yes?

       INT. LOBBY

       At the house phone.

                           EVE
                     (into phone)
                 Hi. This is the woman from the
                 baseball card store.  Remember me?

       INT. ADAM'S ROOM

       Boy, is he glad to hear from her!

                           ADAM
                 Yes!  Hello!  Hi!  Hot-diggity-dog!
                 Thank you for calling me on the
                 telephone!!

       INT. LOBBY

       Eve holds the receiver away from her for a moment.

                           EVE
                 Good grief. Hey listen, I'm in the
                 lobby.
                     (pause, then)
                 On the first floor! Where the hell
                 else would it be?


       INT. LOBBY, ELEVATORS - MOMENTS LATER

       The doors open and Adam hurries out, looking for Eve, who
       he sees and goes directly to, smiling all the while like
       a rumpled idiot.

                           ADAM
                 I am so glad to see you!!  I thought
                 I'd never see you again!

                           EVE
                 Okay, down boy. (holds up the baseball
                 card) I can't take this for driving
                 you home. I wish I could, but I can't.
                 So here, take it back. I could have
                 just left it for you at the desk, but
                 it's very valuable. Now take it.

                           ADAM
                 I can't, it's yours.

                           EVE
                 Take it. damn it!

                           ADAM
                     (with hand over his mouth)
                 Okay.

       He takes the card.

                           EVE
                 Why are you doing that?

                           ADAM
                 I haven't brushed yet.

                           EVE
                 Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your
                 visit.


       She heads for the front door.  He goes after her.

                           ADAM
                 Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.

                           EVE
                 Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!

       EXT. HOTEL - DAY

       They exit.

                           EVE
                 I knew this would happen!  You're like
                 a lost puppy!

                           ADAM
                 Can't you please just talk to me for
                 one second?

                           EVE
                 Okay!  Damn!

       She stops, he stops.

                           EVE (CONT'D)
                 I should have taken the money and run!
                 That's what Troy told me to do!  But
                 do I listen?  No! Put your hand down!

       He does.

                           ADAM
                 Troy? Is he your husband? Or a
                 boyfriend?

                           EVE
                 No.

                           ADAM
                     (eyes to heaven)
                 Thank-Q!

                           EVE
                 Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know
                 you like me.  I can tell. But you know
                 what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me,
                 exactly. It's more like the legs or
                 the butt or the hair.  Or some
                 combination of the above.

                           ADAM
                 I think it's the eyes.

                           EVE
                 The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow,
                 it never works out.  Okay?  Not that
                 you even need to know that!  You look
                 like crap, by the way.  What have you
                 been doing?

                           ADAM
                 Watching television in color.

                           EVE
                 Hey, no kidding?  In color?

                           ADAM
                 Cross my heart and hope to die.

       She looks at him for a beat or two, then abruptly turns
       away.

                           EVE
                 See, ya.

                           ADAM
                 Why doesn't it never work out?

                           EVE
                 What?

                           ADAM
                 Why does it never work out?  You
                 and...men?

                           EVE
                 Why?!  Who the hell knows?!

       He follows closely. She stops.

                           EVE (cont'd)
                 Okay, if you promise to leave me
                 alone, I'll tell you.

                           ADAM
                 ...Okay.

                           EVE
                 It never works out because I'm into
                 legs and butts and hair myself!
                 That's why! So I wind up with guys who
                 are very good looking, but
                 even more shallow than I am, if you
                 can picture that.
                 Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go
                 find another low-paying, demeaning job
                 where some guy named Jerry keeps
                 telling me how lousy his marriage is.

                           ADAM
                 Why not go to work for me?

                           EVE
                 Doing what?

                           ADAM
                 Selling all my baseball cards.
                 And helping me buy enough food and
                 supplies to fill several large trucks.

                           EVE
                 Food and supplies?  Who for?  Like
                 starving people?


                           ADAM
                 Well, they're not starving yet, but
                 they need help.

                           EVE
                 How long would you need me?

                           ADAM
                 Two weeks.

                           EVE
                 What's the pay?

                           ADAM
                 What's fair?

                           EVE
                 I've got to make at least a thousand a
                 week.

       He gives her his patented thumbs up sign which of course
       is exactly like his father's.

                           ADAM
                 You got it!
                 Wait here while I change.

                           EVE
                 Sure.

       He walks back to the hotel.

                           EVE
                     (to herself)
                 My career's finally taking off...

       EXT. MARINE WHOLESALE SUPPLY, MARINA DEL REY - DAY

       Heavy-duty BOAT BATTERIES are being loaded into a U-Haul
       truck.  The store MANAGER steps up to Eve who is
       watching. Adam appears in the bg, thanking and being nice
       to the MEN loading the truck. He looks mighty stupid in
       another one of his Dad's old outfits.

                           MANAGER
                 Why would someone need twenty yacht
                 batteries?

                           EVE
                 I just work for the guy.

                           MANAGER
                 And who does he work for?  The CIA?

                           EVE
                 Naw...it's some sort of charity
                 thing..I guess for starving people
                 with yachts.



       INT. PRICE CLUB - LATER SAME DAY

       Eve and Adam shop with two carts, both full of CASES OF
       DR. PEPPER.

                           EVE
                 Why not buy them milk or something--
                 instead of Dr. Pepper?

                           ADAM
                 They like Dr. Pepper.

                           EVE
                 Who are these people?

                           ADAM
                 My Mom and Dad.

                           EVE
                 Very funny, smart ass.

                           ADAM
                 Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need
                 all of this! This is swell!

       He goes over to a huge supply of Prince Albert.

                           EVE
                     (to herself)
                 Swell? Run, Eve.  Run.

       EXT. LOADING DOCK - SAME DAY

       Eve and Adam watch as a man with a forklift puts a year's
       supply of toilet paper into the back of the rental truck.

       EXT. GROCERY STORE PARKING LOT - SAME DAY

       A crowd has gathered to watch Adam and Eve empty seven
       shopping carts full of non-perishable groceries.

       ANGLE - 5 MINUTES LATER

       Eve goes to get into the truck. Adam hurries by her.

                           ADAM
                 Wait! Wait!

                           EVE
                 What?

       He opens the door for her. She shakes her head and gets
       in.

       EXT. HOLIDAY INN - THAT NIGHT

       She drives the truck to a stop. He keeps the beat to the
       song on the AM radio. It's VolarÈ. Adam loves it. Eve
       hates it. They come to a stop and she snaps off the
       radio.


                           EVE
                 Well, another day, another dollar.
                     (then)
                 Stop staring at me!!

                           ADAM
                 Sorry.

       He gets out.

                           EVE
                 Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.

                           ADAM
                 Hey, you know. I was thinking...

                           EVE
                 Night!

       She pulls away.

                           ADAM
                 Night!

       EXT./INT. U-STORE-IT - NEXT DAY

       Adam drags the last 50-pound bag of flour into a self-
       storage locker and pulls down the sliding door which he
       padlocks.

                           ADAM
                 We'll have to rent a refrigerated
                 truck for the beef and poultry.

                           EVE
                 It's your life.  And, by the way, it's
                 a dandy.

                           ADAM
                 I guess we'll need another locker.

                           EVE
                 No problem.  We'll just sell another
                 baseball card.

                           ADAM
                 You know, Eve -- don't get mad, okay? -
                 -  but, I'd just be lost without you.



                           EVE
                 Thank you.

                           ADAM
                 And, um ...I guess...
                 I guess you and I, uh...

                           EVE
                 Adam?  Don't even think about it.
                 Okay?
                 I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean,
                 but believe me, it would be meaner if
                 I didn't say it. Okay?

                           ADAM
                 Okay.

                           EVE
                 Now, let's take the truck back and get
                 something to eat.

       She hops in behind the wheel.  He (hurt) is a little
       slower getting in his side.

       EXT. FREEWAY - LATER, SAME DAY

       Traffic is moving about forty miles an hour.  Their truck
       is in one of the middle lanes.

       INT. U-HAUL - CONTINUOUS

       Adam screws up his guts and turns to her.

                           ADAM
                 There's something else I would like
                 you to help me with.

                           EVE
                 Name it.

                           ADAM
                 Well, this is going to sound a little
                 crazy.

                           EVE
                     (laughing)
                 Oh, I'm sure it will!

                           ADAM
                 Then forget it.

                           EVE
                 No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?

                           ADAM
                 This is for me.

                           EVE
                 Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.


                           ADAM
                 Well... Okay. I would like you to help
                 me find a...wife.

                           EVE
                 A wife?

                           ADAM
                 Yes.

                           EVE
                 What for?

                           ADAM
                 Because I want to get married.

                           EVE
                 Why?!

                           ADAM
                 I don't want to be alone.

                           EVE
                 You can be single and not alone.
                 Marriage bites!

                           ADAM
                 Bites what?

                           EVE
                 The big one!

                           ADAM
                 It does?

                           EVE
                 Sure.

                           ADAM
                 I didn't know that.

                           EVE
                 Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced
                 sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and
                 dad.

                           ADAM
                 They're all divorced?

                           EVE
                 Everybody's divorced.

                           ADAM
                 It didn't used to be that way.

                           EVE
                 I wouldn't know.
                     (then)
                 What kind of wife are you looking for?

                           ADAM
                 One who's not a mutant.

                           EVE
                 No dogs, huh? Okay.

                           ADAM
                 And if possible, I'd like to marry
                 someone from Pasadena.

       She is speechless. Then:

                           EVE
                 When do you need her by?

                           ADAM
                 Two weeks.

                           EVE
                 Well, I could probably get you laid in
                 two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant
                 wife from Pasadena...that could take
                 some
                 time.

                           ADAM
                 That's what I was afraid of.


       INT. DINER - LATER, SAME DAY

       Adam and Eve are in a booth. The WAITRESS approaches with
       sandwiches and drinks.

                           ADAM
                 What do you mean, you can get me laid?

       He and the waitress look to Eve for an answer.

                           EVE
                 Could we talk about that a little
                 later?

                           ADAM
                 Of course.

                           EVE
                     (sugary, to waitress)
                 Thank you.

       The amazed waitress leaves.  Adam automatically lowers
       his head and says grace.  Two HAPPENIN' GUYS at the
       counter look over and chuckle at the rube.  Eve flips
       them a mean bird and mouths the words "fuck you" as Adam
       continues to pray. The guys shut up.

       EXT. EVE'S HOUSE - LATE DAY

       Eve shares a frame Santa Monica bungalow.  It's in a
       pretty nice neighborhood on a quiet street.  Her GEO
       FISHTAILS into the picture and comes to rest half in the
       street, half on the curb.  Adam is driving.

                           EVE
                 Get out!

                           ADAM
                 The engine is still running.

       She rips the keys out of the ignition.

                           EVE
                 Now, get out!!

                           ADAM
                 Yes, ma'am!

                           EVE
                 Stop that ma'am crap!

                           ADAM
                 Sorry!

       They get out.

                           EVE
                 You almost got us killed!

                           ADAM
                 I told you I've never driven before!

                           EVE
                 Never drive again!

                           ADAM
                 You said it would be easy!

                           EVE
                 I was wrong!!

                           ADAM
                 Is this your house?

                           EVE
                 Yes!

                           ADAM
                 I like it.

       She storms off for the house where a YOUNG MAN is coming
       out the front door in a cut-off T-shirt and spandex
       exercise shorts.

                           EVE
                 Swell!


       EXT. PORCH

       CLIFF is leaving with a cardboard box full of clothes.
       He is exceedingly GOOD LOOKING AND IN VERY GOOD SHAPE.
       Eve and Adam come up the steps.

                           CLIFF
                 What are you bitching about now?

                           EVE
                 What are you doing here?

                           CLIFF
                 I forgot some of my stuff.

                           EVE
                 Your stuff?  Let me see that.

       She looks in the box.  Holds up a pair of old briefs.

                           EVE
                 You came back for these?

                           CLIFF
                 Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's
                 this interesting looking fellow?

                           EVE
                 This is Adam.  Adam, meet Cliff.

                           ADAM
                     (offering hand)
                 How do you do?

                           CLIFF
                 I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?
                 		(eyeing Eve)
                 You doin' any good?

                           EVE
                 Go home, Cliff, wherever that might
                 be.

                           CLIFF
                 Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember
                 her?  The model who went to Harvard?
                 Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam.
                 Nice coat!

       Cliff smiles and bounces down the steps.

                           ADAM
                 Why, thank you!  Very nice to have met
                 you, Cliff!
                 		(then to her)
                 May I ask you a question?

                           EVE
                 He's a former boyfriend. We lived
                 together for about six months.  And
                 yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind
                 of got a thing for him.
                     (entering the house)
                 That's what you wanted to know, isn't
                 it?

                           ADAM
                     (following)
                 Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff
                 likes to wear another man's
                 underpants.

                           EVE
                     (OC)
                 What?!

       INT. EVE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

       Very good music is playing. Adam listens to one speaker
       then crosses to listen to the other. Then he goes back to
       the first.

       INT.EVE'S KITCHEN - SAME TIME

       Eve is pouring champagne into a glass that contains two
       sugar cubes.  Next she adds several dashes of bitters.
       TROY, HER GAY ROOMMATE, throws together a tray of
       appetizers as dinner cooks on the stove.


                           TROY
                     (sotto)
                 Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!

                           EVE
                 I knew you'd like him.

                           TROY
                 Darlin', this is X-File stuff!  Think
                 about it!  The guy's got all this
                 easily negotiable property. He's
                 obviously setting something up very
                 big.  Like a self-sustaining island
                 off the coast of South America, for
                 instance. Or perhaps he's the head of
                 a cult that's doing weird things with
                 poultry and pipe tobacco. I've heard
                 worse.

       He rushes out with the tray.

       INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

       Troy enters with sushi appetizers. Adam is looking at the
       ceiling.

                           ADAM
                 You have very nice ceilings.

                           TROY
                 I do? Well, thank you! You like
                 ceilings?

                           ADAM
                 Not particularly.

                           TROY
                 Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea
                 urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori"
                 if you prefer. I love sushi.

                           ADAM
                 I love Lucy!

                           TROY
                 You nut!

       Eve enters with Adam's drink and two white wines.

       .

                           EVE
                 Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.

                           ADAM
                 Thank-Q!

                           EVE
                 I thought only hookers drank those
                 things.

                           ADAM
                 Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!

       Eve and Troy look at each other as she hands him his
       wine.

                           TROY
                 Dinner in fifteen minutes. Why don't
                 we sit and chat.

       They do.



                           TROY
                 So, Adam...where on earth are you
                 from?

                           EVE
                 Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.

                           ADAM
                 It's a very small place. People don't
                 even know it's there.

                           TROY
                 And it's called...?

                           ADAM
                 Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.

                           TROY
                 Really?  Since when?

                           EVE
                     (defensive)
                 Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm
                 Springs.

                           TROY
                 Oh, yes.

                           EVE
                 I even guessed his hotel, didn't I?

                           ADAM
                 Right on the button.

                           TROY
                 Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home
                 town.

                           EVE
                 Give me your hand.

                           TROY
                     (to himself)
                 Oh, my God...

       Adam holds out his hand and she takes it, rubbing her
       finger slowly and gently around in his palm.  For her,
       it's psychic stuff.  For him, it's spine-tingling.

                           EVE
                 Okay, let's see...I'm not promising
                 anything. You okay?

                           ADAM
                 Um-hum.

                           EVE
                 I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow.
                 Way up North.  Are we getting hot?

                           ADAM
                 Yes!

                           EVE
                 You live in...Alaska.  The only way in
                 or out of your place is by plane
                 and... you've definitely come down
                 here for food and supplies and... to
                 find a wife!

                           ADAM
                 Wow.

       She tosses back his hand and grabs her wine for a victory
       gulp.

                           TROY
                 That's right?

                           ADAM
                     (to Eve)
                 I've never met anyone like you in my
                 life.

                           TROY
                 She's right?!

                           EVE
                 Hey, butthead, I'm clairvoyant.


                           ADAM
                 I've got goose-bumps all over me.

                           TROY
                 Why not just go to... Nome for
                 supplies and a wife?  Isn't that
                 closer?

                           EVE
                 Yeah, right!  That's where you'd go to
                 find girls!  Nome.  He's gay, by the
                 way.

                           ADAM
                 Good for you.

                           TROY
                 Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask
                 you a few questions.  When did Alaska
                 become a state?

                           ADAM
                 1959.

                           TROY
                 Who use to own it?

                           ADAM
                 Russia.

                           TROY
                 When did we get it from them?

                           ADAM
                 1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2
                 million dollars for it. A tidy sum
                 then, as well as now. I'm quoting my
                 father, of course.

                           TROY
                 What's the capitol?

                           ADAM
                 Juneau.

                           TROY
                 Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!

                           ADAM
                 Sorry, that's the largest city.

       Troy jumps up and runs out of the room.

                           ADAM
                 Where's he gone?

                           EVE
                 He's gone to check your answers on his
                 computer.

                           ADAM
                 He has a computer?

                           EVE
                 Sure.

                           ADAM
                 In the house?

                           EVE
                 No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of
                 course, in the house.  It's in there.

                           ADAM
                 May I please be excused?

                           EVE
                 Uh...yeah.

       TROY'S OFFICE

       He has "Alaska" on his computer screen.  Adam enters and
       looks at the computer, which captivates him.

                           ADAM
                 This must be very new.

                           TROY
                 Yeah.

                           ADAM
                 It's so small.

                           TROY
                 What are you talking about? This is
                 the new Mac. You a hacker?

                           ADAM
                 I don't think so.

                           TROY
                 You don't have a computer in your
                 cabin?

                           ADAM
                 No.

                           TROY
                 How do you get through those winters?
                 		(reading screen)
                 Well, you're right.  Juneau.
                 		(then, covering the
                 		 screen with his hand)
                 What's the highest peak?

                           ADAM
                 Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest
                 point in North America.

                           TROY
                     (after peeking at the screen)
                 Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go
                 eat!

                           ADAM
                     (indicating computer)
                 That would knock my father out.

                           TROY
                 Yeah?

                           ADAM
                 Oh, yes.
                     (to himself)
                 It would probably kill him.

                           TROY
                 He's a Windows guy then, huh?

                           ADAM
                 Yes. He likes windows.

                           TROY
                 Well, I think Windows stink. What do
                 you think of that?

                           ADAM
                 ...I guess it's...just a matter of
                 personal taste.

                           TROY
                 True.

       Troy exits. Adam follows.


       (EDITORIAL:  Scenes 131, 132, and 133 should follow scene
       134 rather than precede it.)








       INT. SHELTER, MASTER BEDROOM - SAME TIME

       Calvin Webber is sleeping soundly.  Helen stands quietly
       at the door looking at him. She finishes off her
       champagne cocktail and very quietly shuts the door.

       INT. ANTEROOM - MOMENTS LATER

       Helen goes into the elevator. Obviously, she's had too
       much to drink.

       INT. MALT SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

       The floor rumbles and the metal doors open emitting the
       red light.  Soda Jerk and TEN OF HIS FOLLOWERS stand up
       expectantly and anxiously.  Helen appears--and looks at
       this terribly odd assortment of people.

                           SODA JERK
                 Who are you?!

                           HELEN
                     (beat, then)
                 I'm the mother.

                           SODA JERK
                 It's the mother!!

       And they all fall down on their knees and worship her
       with much wailing and rejoicing.  Several speak in
       tongues. Helen stares at them wide-eyed, presses the
       button on the control box, and goes back down.


       INT. DINING TABLE - NIGHT

       Adam's impeccable table manners serve to highlight Eve's
       and Troy's utter lack of same.

                           TROY
                 But first, you have to start with the
                 clothes!

                           EVE
                 Exactly.
                 		(then to Adam)
                 You understand that, don't you?  You
                 have no chance of meeting a woman
                 dressed like that.

                           ADAM
                 All right.

                           EVE
                     (to Troy)
                 So, what are you seeing?

                           TROY
                     (looking Adam over)
                 I don't know.

                           EVE
                 Money is no object.  He's got cards up
                 the wazoo.

                           ADAM
                 The what?

                           EVE
                 Wazoo!  Try to listen.
                     (then to Troy)
                 Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip-
                 hop, Euro trash?

                           TROY
                 You're serious, aren't you?

                           EVE
                 What's that supposed to mean?

                           TROY
                 It means that your taste in men's
                 apparel is as bad as your taste in
                 men.

                           EVE
                 Well, that's blunt!

                           TROY
                 I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.

                           EVE
                 And I suppose you see him in some sort
                 of strapless  thing, don't you?

                           TROY
                 I see "elegant."

                           EVE
                 Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?

                           TROY
                 That's what I'm sensing.

                           ADAM
                 The guy with the underpants!

                           EVE
                 That's boring!

                           TROY
                     (indicating Adam)
                 Not on him.

                           ADAM
                 I'm not wearing his pants.

                           TROY
                 Why not? He has great pants.

                           ADAM
                 I just don't want to.

                           TROY
                 Okay.

                           EVE

                 Why don't you take him and pick out
                 his clothes?

                           TROY
                 Alright, I will.

                           EVE
                     (talking with her mouth full)
                 I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to
                 buy six thousand paper napkins.

                           TROY
                 What do you think, Adam?

                           ADAM
                 About clothing?

                           EVE
                 Yeah.

                           ADAM
                 Whatever you two want. If you've got
                 the time, I've got the wazoo.

       Eve and Troy watch him eat for a beat or two.

                           TROY
                 Isn't it a little tiring to sit up
                 straight like that?

                           ADAM
                 No.

                           EVE
                 What about holding your right arm up
                 like that all the time?

                           ADAM
                 It's fine. Just give it a try.
                 And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot
                 off the chair!

       She does. Eve and Troy emulate Adam.

       SCENE 136 OMITTED



       EXT. EVE'S HOUSE - DAY

       Troy and Adam get out of Eve's car with a lot of
       packages. They head for the house.

                           ADAM
                 I guess a lot of those tall buildings
                 we saw this morning are new.

                           TROY
                 Almost all of them.

                           ADAM
                 The recovery is very impressive.

                           TROY
                 The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they
                 rebuilt the freeway in six months.

                           ADAM
                 Amazing. I'm very impressed.



       INT. EVE'S HOUSE - SAME DAY

       Eve is on the couch doing her toenails when Adam and Troy
       enter. Adam is in a casually elegant outfit that looks
       terrific. Both he and Troy are carrying lots of other
       packages and garment bags. We see names like Gucci,
       Armani and Lauren. Eve is visibly impressed by Adam's
       makeover.

                           TROY
                 Well, what do you think?

                           EVE
                 I think...it...works.

                           TROY
                 Let me show you the entire trousseau!

                           ADAM
                 But first let me show her these!

       He reaches into a bag and removes a box that contains --
       a pair of rollerblades.

                           ADAM (cont'd)
                 Eve, can I skate around your block?

                           TROY
                     (making it sexual)
                 How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around
                 your block?

                           EVE
                     (beat, then)
                 No.

       SCENE 137B OMITTED

       SCENE 138 OMITTED




       EXT. VENICE BEACH - LATER, SAME DAY

       There is a most unusual band shell location on the beach
       that is completely covered by graffiti. Eve and Troy sit
       at one of the many stone tables watching Adam skate all
       over the place. He wears spandex workout pants and a T-
       shirt.



       The starting CRANE SHOT begins on the nearly deserted
       commercial section of Venice Beach and then takes us to
       the band shell.

       ANGLE - CLOSER

       of him skating and them watching.

                           EVE
                 He's going to kill himself.
                     (then, to Adam)
                 Go skate out on the bike path! It's
                 that way!

                           ADAM
                 Okay!

       He heads out of the band shell. We follow him as he
       skates into an area that has been given over to the
       homeless. They sit around in their sleeping bags and
       blankets and cheer (and jeer) Adam when he passes by. He
       takes them to be more mutants.

       EXT. BIKE PATH - CONTINUOUS

       Adam skates to it and is amazed to see two very pretty
       girls skating in their tiny bikinis. A nearly nude body-
       builder guy goes by on a bike. Then Adam sees the ocean.

       ANGLE - WAVES

       breaking on the beach and rocks.

       EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS

       Adam tosses off his roller-blades and walks trance-like
       towards the waves.

       ANGLE - TROY AND EVE

       appear on a dune behind him and watch.

       ANGLE - ADAM

       Adam raises his arms to greet the ocean, perhaps like a
       Plains Indian would. Then he joyously runs into the surf
       and dives.

       ANGLE - TROY AND EVE

       watching.

                           EVE
                 That water's freezing!

                           TROY
                 He's from Alaska.

       ANGLE - ADAM

       He surfaces and throws his fists in the air.

       ANGLE - TROY AND EVE

                           TROY
                 That's why little things mean so much
                 to him.

       ANGLE - ADAM

                           ADAM
                 I LOVE THIS!!

       Begin the record "YMCA" over this.

       INT. EVE'S LIVING ROOM - NEXT DAY

       Eve enters from her morning shower to find Troy and Adam
       goofing to The Village People song. She gives Troy a
       disapproving look.

                           TROY
                     (defensive)
                 What?! He wanted to hear some
                 standards!

       (My hip daughters tell me that "YMCA" is enjoying a huge
       rebirth of popularity at their parties. Apparently they
       line dance to it.)

       EXT. FREEWAY - SAME DAY

       A helicopter shot follows the U-Haul in traffic.
       (Continue music.)

       EXT. SELF-STORAGE - SAME DAY

       Adam and Eve fill a second storage site. (Continue
       music.)

       EXT. BASEBALL DIAMOND, PUBLIC PARK  - DAY

       We see the infield of a gay softball team wheel a double
       play.

       ANGLE - TROY AND ADAM

       Cheering the play with other gay fans.

                           ADAM
                 I get it! I finally get it! You have
                 to see it to understand it!

       Music ends.



       INT. EVE'S KITCHEN - NEXT DAY (RAIN)

       She looks out the back window at the rain and shakes her
       head. She exits the back door with an umbrella.

       EXT. EVE'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

       Eve hurries to Adam who is sitting on a lawn chair in the
       middle of the small back yard, enjoying the rain. She
       holds the umbrella over her head.

                           ADAM
                 Hey, Eve!

                           EVE
                 Have you ever heard the saying, "He
                 hasn't got enough sense to come in out
                 of the rain?"

                           ADAM
                 Yep.
                     (then watching the rain hit
                      the palm of his hand)
                 You know, my father -- who is a
                 scientist -- says that everything is a
                 miracle. Everything. Until recently I
                 wasn 't sure what he meant by that.

                           EVE
                 Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still
                 want to go girl hunting tonight?

                           ADAM
                 I certainly do!

                           EVE
                 Okay. But you know, this business of
                 finding you a wife -- it's kind of
                 ridiculous, don't you think?

                           ADAM
                     (rising)
                 No it's not!

                           EVE
                 Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a
                 wife? I mean...

                           ADAM
                 Then just help me find a girlfriend!
                 That's all I ask.
                 I'll give you every single card I've
                 got left!

                           EVE
                 Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm
                 just somebody you can buy off! Listen,
                 let me tell you something--

                           ADAM
                     (taking her by the arms)
                 Would you do it just because you're my
                 friend? My very best friend.

                           EVE
                 Well...yeah. Okay.

       He hugs her.

                           ADAM
                 Thank Q, Eve!

       She's uncomfortable with the hug. Wait a minute. No she's
       not.

       EXT. "THE FORTIES" NIGHT CLUB - SAME NIGHT

       This hip, up-market club is based on a 1940's theme.
       Establish the YOUTHFUL RICH arriving in their black four-
       wheel vehicles and silver Porsches. Coats and ties. Eve,
       Troy and Adam arrive on foot. Adam notices the valet
       parking.

                           ADAM
                 Why did you park way back there?

                           TROY
                 Miss Rustokov refuses to let total
                 strangers drive her car.

                           ADAM
                 Oh. I see.

       Eve looks like she owns the place.

       INT. NIGHT CLUB ANTEROOM - SAME TIME

       As they enter Adam grabs Troy, who is leading the way.

                           TROY
                 What?!

                           ADAM
                 Ladies first, Troy! That was close.

       Adam and Troy follow Eve in. The club is NOISY AND
       HOPPING. The house music is from the 40's. Adam, Eve and
       Troy enter a long corridor of booths and walk forward.
       Adam's got on that terrific dark suit. Women notice. Eve
       notices them noticing.

                           ADAM
                 My goodness gracious!  This place is
                 something!

                           EVE
                 Look unimpressed.

                           TROY
                 Bored even.

       Adam gives it a shot and goes too bored.

                           TROY
                 Vaguely bored!

       He gets vaguely bored but misses unimpressed by a mile.

                           EVE
                 Unimpressed, but still interested.

       He tries that. It's like watching a neon sign switch back
       and forth:  First interested, then not.

                           EVE
                 No!  Not crazy!

                           ADAM
                 Do I look crazy?

                           EVE
                 Yes!

                           TROY
                 Be loose.

       He overplays that.

                           EVE
                 Just be yourself.

                           TROY
                 Always good advice.

                           EVE
                 For him. It doesn't work for the rest
                 of us.

                           ADAM
                 Holy Mo-ly, Miss Pay-o-ly!! This place
                 is neat-o!!

       Adam enters the main room. Eve and Troy follow.



       INT. MAIN ROOM

       There is a bar, a seated section, and a dance floor with
       a DJ booth. The DJ is in a white dinner jacket and does a
       perfect Humphrey Bogart impression as he ad libs his
       speel between records.

       ANGLE - BAR

       JASON and JONATHAN wave when they see Eve and Troy
       approaching. They ad-lib hellos. Here, and at the tables,
       the recorded MUSIC IS SO LOUD THEY MUST SPEAK OVER IT.

                           EVE
                 Jason, Jonathan, this is Adam! Adam,
                 that's them!

       They shake.

                           ADAM
                 How do you do?! It's very nice to meet
                 you, Jason and Jonathan!
                     (confidentially, to them)
                 My mother always told me that if you
                 meet a person for the first time it's
                 easier to remember their names if you
                 use those names right away.

       Jason and Jonathan just stare at him.

                           TROY
                 He's from Alaska!

                           JASON/JONATHAN
                     (relieved)
                 Oh!

       A slightly drunk beauty named SOPHIE appears behind Eve.

                           SOPHIE
                 Hi, there, Eve, who's the hunk?

       Eve hates Sophie.

                           EVE
                 Get lost, Sophie.

       Sophie pushes her way right up to Adam.

                           SOPHIE
                 Hi. I'm Sophie.

                           ADAM
                 Hello, Sophie, I'm Adam Webber.

                           JASON
                 Adam lives in Alaska.

                           SOPHIE
                 No shit?

                           ADAM
                 Tu parle Francais? Tu a un tres bon
                 accent.

                           SOPHIE
                 You speak beautiful French!
                 J'ai habitÈ a Paris un an.

                           ADAM
                 Paris!! La ville de lumieres!
                 C'est bien rencontrer quelqu'un pour
                 pratiquer le francais.

                           SOPHIE
                 Si tu veux, nous pouvons pratiquer
                 beaucoup des choses ensemble.


       Eve steps in and takes Adam's hand, drawing him away from
       Sophie.

                           EVE
                 Quit showing off!  We're here on
                 business!

                           ADAM
                 Good-bye!

                           SOPHIE
                 Non, cherie. A bientot.

       Eve leads Adam to a table. Troy follows.

                           ADAM
                 I thought I was here to meet women.

                           EVE
                 Not that one!

                           ADAM
                 I like her.

                           EVE
                 And don't be so obvious!

       INT. TABLE - TEN MINUTES LATER

       Adam, Eve and Troy examine female patrons over drinks.
       It's white wine for her, imported beer for Troy, and a
       Rob Roy for Adam.

                           EVE
                 What have you ordered?

                           ADAM
                 It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink,
                 I'm told.

       ANGLE - LOVELY BRUNETTE

       slinking by.

       ANGLE - TABLE

                           ADAM (OC)
                 What about her?

                           EVE (OC)
                 No way.

                           ADAM
                 Why?!  I think she's very attractive.

                           EVE
                 Adam!  She's got bitch written all
                 over her!  You do know what "bitch"
                 means, don't you?

                           ADAM
                 Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't
                 understand for the life of me why you
                 would call her that!  Or why Cliff
                 would say that about you.

                           EVE
                 Because we're bitches!  Look at her!
                 Look at the expression on her face!
                 The walk, the jewelry, the
                 fingernails.  Please!

                           ADAM
                 How 'bout this one?

       "This one" is a KILLER BLOND.

                           EVE
                 Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even
                 be a crumb on her table!  You don't
                 see that?!

                           TROY
                 Eve?!

                           EVE
                 Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's
                 nothing personal.

                           TROY
                 Adam,  I think for you, we should go
                 for "sweet."

                           ADAM
                 Okay. I like that.

                           EVE
                     (swigging her drink)
                 Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of
                 putting it.

                           ADAM
                     (to Troy)
                 What do I say to Miss Sweet when I
                 meet her?

                           TROY
                 Um... Eve?

                           EVE
                 It's not so much what you say but how
                 you say it.  Women like men who are
                 unpredictable.

                           ADAM
                 Really?

                           EVE
                 Yes, really! Basically, they want what
                 they think they can't have.  Same with
                 guys.  That's why everybody is walking
                 around here sending off "you can't
                 have me" signals!

       ANGLE OF MEN AND WOMEN

       doing precisely that. Then:

       BACK TO TABLE

                           ADAM
                 That's ridiculous.

                           EVE
                 Maybe. But that's how it works.

                           TROY
                 Ah-ha! There's " Miss Sweet."  At the
                 hors d'oeuvres table!

       INTERCUT - MISS SWEET

       She's a pretty young thing with a sweet face.

                           EVE
                 Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo.
                 Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.

                           ADAM
                     (very serious)
                 Okay. All right.
                     (then)
                 And what do I say?

                           EVE
                 Say something surprising. And funny.
                 Lie, if need be.

                           TROY
                 Yes! Lying is always a very effective
                 dating tool.

                           ADAM
                 Okay. Thank you, my friends.

       Adam rises.

                           ADAM (cont'd)
                 By the way, that's a great play.

                           EVE
                 What?

                           ADAM
                 Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.

                           EVE
                 Did you?

       Adam nods and shoves off.

                           TROY
                 I'm not sure I want to watch this.

       Eve puts her hand to her head -- hating herself and still
       not  sure exactly why.

       ANGLE - ADAM

       crossing to Miss Sweet.

                           ADAM
                     (to himself)
                 Surprising and funny. Well, I know a
                 duck who bought some lip balm...

       INT. HORS D'OEUVRES TABLE

       Adam sheepishly approaches Miss Sweet, then gathers
       himself:

                           ADAM
       Hi!

                           MISS SWEET
                     (not sweet)
                 Yes?

                           ADAM
                     (beat, then)
                 I was wondering if you might help me.
                 I...I seem to have lost my
                 Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere
                 around here.

       Miss Sweet stares at him for a beat or two, then
       chuckles.

                           MISS SWEET
                 Oh, now, that's a great one!

                           ADAM
                     (big smile)
                 You like it?

                           MISS SWEET
                     (a little clap)
                 Bravo!

                           ADAM
                 Thank-Q!

       They both laugh.

       ANGLE - EVE AND TROY

       Stunned...as they watch Adam and Miss Sweet. Another
       pretty young woman (HEATHER) joins Adam.

       ANGLE - ADAM AND GIRLS

       Heather is a friend of Miss Sweet's.

                           MISS SWEET
                 This is my new friend...

                           ADAM
                 I'm Adam Webber.

                           MISS SWEET
                 He's really funny!

                           HEATHER
                 Hi!  I'm Heather!

                           ADAM
                 "Heather?"  I don't believe I've ever
                 heard that name before.

       There's a slight beat before both girls laugh.

                           HEATHER
                 Yeah, right!

                           MISS SWEET
                 I told you!  He's funny!

       ANGLE - EVE AND TROY

       More stunned. Eve finds that she very much hates watching
       Adam having a good time with other healthy non-mutants.

       ANGLE - ADAM AND HIS NEW FRIENDS

                 We work on Rodeo Drive.  But we're
                 both professional dancers.

                           ADAM
                 Really?

                           HEATHER
                 You dance?

                           ADAM
                 I took a dance lesson everyday of my
                 life until a couple of days ago.

                           MISS SWEET
                 You're kidding!

                           ADAM
                 No, I'm not! My mom taught me.

                           MISS SWEET
                 Your mom was a dancer?

                           ADAM
                 She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You
                 would like her very much! Shall we
                 dance?

                           MISS SWEET
                 Sure.


       They head for the dance floor.

       ANGLE - TROY AND EVE

       watching.

       ANGLE - THE FLOOR

       A jitterbug song comes on and so does Adam.



       He and Miss Sweet are a little rough on take-off, but
       they hit smooth sailing soon enough. He's terrific at
       picking up the new stuff she shows him.

       ANGLE - EVE & TROY

       They are shocked.

       ANGLE - DANCE FLOOR

       Heather cuts in on Miss Sweet as the other dancers stop
       to watch someone who is so much better than them. The
       three of them begin to dance together.

       ANGLE - TROY & EVE


                           TROY
                 You know, he's a very, very good--


                           EVE
                 Shut up!

       ANGLE - DANCE FLOOR/ EVE

       Adam dances beautifully with the two women. We CUT BACK
       AND FORTH between them and Eve.

       ANGLE - DANCE FLOOR

       Adam, Miss Sweet and Heather complete their dance with
       great aplomb.  Other dancers applaud them. Someone is
       WHISTLING LOUDLY OFF CAMERA.  Adam and his dance partners
       look over to:

       ANGLE - EVE

       She is whistling like a guy calling his dog.  Troy is
       embarrassed.

                           TROY
                 Must you...

       Eve points at Adam and beckons broadly for him to come
       over -- a basketball coach calling her player off the
       floor.

                           TROY
                 What in the hell is wrong with you?!!

       ANGLE - DANCE FLOOR

                           MISS SWEET
                 Is that your girl friend?

                           ADAM
                 No. Would you please excuse me?

                           HEATHER
                 If you'll please come back.

                           ADAM
                 I will certainly try.  And thank you
                 both very much for the dance.

       He leaves.

                           MISS SWEET
                 When was the last time you saw manners
                 like that?

                           HEATHER
                 Yeah.  It's like meeting a foreigner
                 or something.

       ANGLE - TABLE

       as Adam comes over. The music is not so loud now.

                           EVE
                     (to Troy)
                 Go to the bathroom.

                           TROY
                 Right here?
                 		(then, off her look)
                 Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't
                 sure!

       Troy rises and exits.  Adam arrives and sits down.

                           ADAM
                 You wanted to see me!

                           EVE
                 You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you
                 learn to dance like that?!  And there
                 are no starving people, are there?!

                           ADAM
                 Why are you suddenly so mad at me?

                           EVE
                 Don't change the subject! I want you
                 to tell me the truth about yourself.

                           ADAM
                 I've never lied to you.  I've maybe
                 let you believe things that you wanted
                 to believe, but I've never lied.

                           EVE
                 You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't
                 you?!

                           ADAM
                 No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love
                 with you the first time I saw you.
                     (off her look)
                 I did. I think that you are the most--

                           EVE
                 I want to know exactly who you are and
                 what you're really up to!

                           ADAM
                 All right. Let me tell you the whole
                 thing. In 1962--


                           CLIFF (OC)
                 Well, well, well.  Don't we clean up
                 nice?

       Cliff steps up to the table.  Adam, automatically a
       gentleman, rises and offers his hand.

                           ADAM
                 Hello, Cliff, how are you this
                 evening?

       Cliff barely shakes his hand.

                           CLIFF
                 Not bad.

       Then he sits in Adam's seat.

                           CLIFF
                 But I do miss that green sport coat of
                 yours.

                           ADAM
                 Thank you very much. But, Cliff,
                 that's my seat. And I was just--

                           CLIFF
                     (to Eve)
                 How 'bout a drink at the bar?

                           EVE
                     (pause, then)
                 Sure.

       They rise.  Cliff gestures to the chair.

                           CLIFF
                 It's all yours.

       Eve and Cliff go to the bar.  Adam sits down glumly.  He
       looks across the room and catches the eye of Miss Sweet
       who is seated at a table with Heather.  A GOOD LOOKING
       GUY is hitting on them.  CUTTING BACK AND FORTH between
       Adam and them we see Miss Sweet's smile escalate.  Then
       she nudges Heather who also looks over and smiles. Adam
       smiles back.  Finish with a CLOSER SHOT OF HIS POV of
       Miss Sweet's hair, butt and legs.

       ANGLE - BAR

       Eve and Cliff are in cozy conversation at the bar.
       Jonathan, Jason, and Sophie are in the bg.

       ANGLE - Troy

       returning from the restroom.  He is surprised to see Eve
       at the bar with Cliff.  When he looks back at the dance
       floor table, Adam is not there.

       ANGLE - EVE AND CLIFF

       Sipping wine.

                           EVE
                 So where is your roommate, the model?

                           CLIFF
                 You know, I don't know.  And looking
                 at you, I don't care.  It's been too
                 long, Eve.

                           ADAM (OC)
                 Please excuse this interruption.

                           CLIFF
                 Oh, brother...

       WIDER - BAR

       Adam steps closer, looking past Cliff at Eve.

                           ADAM
                 Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and
                 please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't
                 Cliff just a butt with hair?

                           CLIFF
                 What?!

                           ADAM
                 I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and
                 hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow,
                 as well?

                           CLIFF
                     (the shallowest guy in the
                      world)
                 Shallow? I'm shallow?!

                           EVE
                 Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.

                           CLIFF
                 Yeah. Before I kick your ass.

       He gives Adam a shove.

                           ADAM
                 Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to
                 defend myself.

                           CLIFF
                 Do ya?

       Cliff throws a right which Adam calmly blocks and
       counters with a short right jab to Cliff's mouth,
       snapping his head back.  It's not a big punch, but very,
       very quick. It makes Eve mad and astonishes Troy, Jason
       and Jonathan.

                           EVE
                 Stop it, you two!

                           CLIFF
                     (slightly insecure)
                 I guess we shouldn't fight in here.

                           ADAM
                     (lowering his guard)
                 Yes, I agree.

       Cliff draws back another right.  Adam flicks out a quick
       left to Cliff's cheek, again snapping his head back, but
       not his body. (These aren't big movie hits.) Cliff takes
       a beat or two then draws back his right fist again.  Adam
       pops him in the nose. Cliff drops his right arm to his
       side.

                           EVE
                 Adam?!

                           ADAM
                 I'm sorry.

                           CLIFF
                     (increasingly insecure)
                 Maybe we shouldn't fight at all.
                 Fighting is pretty immature.

                           ADAM
                     (lowering his guard)
                 It certainly is.  I agree with you
                 completely.

                           CLIFF
                 Eve? I'm leaving.

                           EVE
                 I don't blame you!

                           ADAM
                     (turning to Eve)
                 Eve, I'm sorry.

       Seeing an opportunity, Cliff rears back with another
       right. Adam deftly pops him in the mouth again with a
       short right jab.

                           CLIFF
                     (deeply insecure)
                 Well, good night, everyone.

       Troy, Jonathan and Jason say good night to him.  Cliff
       walks unsteadily away bleeding from the mouth and both
       nostrils. (Hopeful that no one has noticed that he's very
       subtly just gotten the crap beat out of him.)

                           EVE
                 I'm leaving, too.

                           ADAM
                 But, Eve, I would--

                           EVE
                 And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you
                 out--because I quit!  This is
                 ridiculous! You're ridiculous! I'm
                 ridiculous!

       She exits. Adam looks over at Troy who shrugs.

       EXT. EVE'S HOUSE - MIDNIGHT

       Troy takes out his keys as he approaches the front door.
       But the door opens. Eve stands there in sweats. Agitated.

                           EVE
                 He go back to the hotel?

                           TROY
                 Uh..he might of.

       INT. EVE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

       Troy enters. She slams the door.

                           EVE
                 What's that mean?

                           TROY
                 We did not leave together.

                           EVE
                 Who did he leave with?


                           TROY
                 What's it to you?!

                           EVE
                 I'm his pimp. He left with the
                 dancers, didn't he?

                           TROY
                 Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the
                 psychic pimp.  You tell me.

                           EVE
                 Those sluts!

                           TROY
                 Yeah. But who's not a slut these days?


       He enters the kitchen

       INT. KITCHEN

       She follows him: He gets something to drink.

       .

                           EVE
                  Where are you going?

                           TROY
                 To bed.

                           EVE
                 To bed?

                           TROY
                 Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love
                 with the guy.

                           EVE
                 What?!  Now hold on!  Wait one damn
                 minute!

       Troy exits into his office.


       INT. OFFICE

       He plops down on the chair.

       .

                           EVE
                 In the first place, I don't fall in
                 love with weirdos I've only known for
                 four or five days.

                           TROY
                 Yes, you do.

                           EVE
                 And I don't fall in love with grown
                 men who collect baseball cards!!

                           TROY
                 Uh, yes, you do.

                           EVE
                 Or pee in their pants when they see
                 the ocean!

                           TROY
                 Yes, you do!

                           EVE
                 Or have perfect table manners.

                           TROY
                     (sitting up)
                 You know, I asked him about that. And
                 he said that good manners are a way we
                 have of showing other people that we
                 respect them. See, you'd eat like a
                 slob if you
                 were alone, but since another human
                 being is present, you show that person
                 respect by going to the trouble of
                 having proper manners. I didn't know
                 that. I thought it was a way of
                 appearing superior.
                     (then)
                 Know what else he told me?

                           EVE
                     (sitting on the bed)
                 What?

                           TROY
                 He thinks that I am a gentleman and
                 that you are a lady!

                           EVE
                 Well, consider the source. I don't
                 even know what a lady is.

                           TROY
                 Exactly! I thought a gentleman was
                 somebody who owned horses. Turns out,
                 the short and very simple definition
                 of a gentleman or a lady is: someone
                 who always attempts to make the people
                 around him or her feel as comfortable
                 as possible. That's it! If you don't
                 do that, nothing else matters. The
                 cars, the clothes, the houses...

                           EVE
                 Where did he get all that information?

                           TROY
                 From the oddest place. His parent's
                 told him. I don't think I got that
                 memo.

                           EVE
                 So now I suppose he's trying to make
                 those two dancers feel as comfortable
                 as possible.

                           TROY
                 He didn't leave with them.

                           EVE
                 Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear
                 that.

                           TROY
                 He left with Sophie.

                           EVE
                 What?!!

                           TROY
                 It's true.  She swept him out the door
                 whispering little French things into
                 his ear.

                           EVE
                 Oh, no! Not Sophie! No way! Please
                 don't tell me that!!


                           TROY
                 What are you going to do? Go over to
                 her place and kick in the door?

                           EVE
                 You're goddamn right I am!

       She exits, then sticks her hand back in.

                           EVE (cont'd)
                 You coming?!

                           TROY
                     (cringing)
                 I don't think so.

                           EVE
                 Coward!

       She exits.

                           TROY
                 Gentleman coward, to you.

       SCENE 148 OMITTED



       EXT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

       Eve hurries out of the house leaving the front door wide
       open.  She runs down the porch steps, across the yard,
       and to her car, which she unlocks with the usual
       fumbling.

                           EVE
                 Come on!  Come on, damn it!

       INT. CAR

       She jumps in and sticks the key in the ignition.  Adam
       appears at the passenger window.

                           ADAM
                 Hi!

       Eve SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER as she throws open her door and
       jumps out into the street where she falls down, hurting
       her knee.  Adam runs around the car to help her to her
       feet. Dogs start barking in several houses.

                           ADAM
                 Eve?!

                           EVE
                 Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You
                 stupid son of a bitch!!!

                           ADAM
                 I'm really sorry!

                           EVE
                 What in the hell are you doing here!!
                 You're supposed to be over on San
                 Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex
                 with that slut Sophie!!

                           ADAM
                 I know...and I'm really sorry.

                           EVE
                 Well, you should be!  Thanks to you,
                 my heart is in my neck!

                           ADAM
                 What?

                           EVE
                 Goodnight!

       Eve marches, with a limp, back to the house.

                           ADAM
                 Eve, if you'll let me, I can --

                           EVE
                 Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is
                 that?!  What if this is for life?!

                           ADAM
                 I know first aid!

                           EVE
                 Well, you had better!!

       He chases her up the porch steps.

       INT. LIVING ROOM - THIRTY MINUTES LATER

       Lights are low and warm.  Adam is attempting to swab the
       abrasion on Eve's knee through the tear in her old sweat
       pants.

                           EVE
                 Wait a minute.

       She reaches down and gives the knee hole a good rip,
       revealing her leg from above the knee to the gym sock.

                           EVE
                 There.

                           ADAM
                 Thanks.

       He takes the back of her calf in one hand and applies the
       antiseptic to her knee with the other.  It stings and she
       flinches.

                           ADAM
                 Steady. Steady.  It's going to be all
                 right in no time.

       He leans down and blows on the wound.  CU of that.  CU of
       his hand on her calf.  CU of her looking down at him,
       watching as he blows gently on her knee.

                           ADAM
                 I went to Sophie's and she was very
                 hospitable.

                           EVE
                 Is that what you call it?

                           ADAM
                 But it just wasn't where I wanted to
                 be so I left as politely as I could
                 and found a taxi.  But I asked the
                 driver to drop me here instead of at
                 the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como
                 sings called "On the Street Where You
                 Live."  You know it?

                           EVE
                 Sing it to me.

                           ADAM
                     (softly, saying it as much as
                      singing it)
                 "All at once am I--several stories
                 high-- knowing I'm--on the street--
                 where you live."  It's about a young
                 man who is overjoyed just to be
                 standing in front of the house of the
                 person he loves.

       She reaches down, and taking hold of his collar, draws
       him to her and they kiss very romantically and at length.
       Then:

                           EVE
                 Adam...dumb question, but humor me.
                 Have you ever had sex before?

                           ADAM
                 No.


       She sits up.

                           EVE
                 How is that possible?

       During the following speech CAMERA pushes past him and
       lingers on her as she gradually realizes that Adam is
       mental.

                           ADAM
                     (sitting up)
                 In 1962, when the bomb was dropped on
                 Los Angeles, my parents were in our
                 fallout shelter.  That's where I was
                 born. We
                 only survived because it was a huge
                 shelter as fallout shelters go. My
                 father worked on it secretly for
                 years. When he had to, he used
                 contractors, but always from out-of-
                 state and always for just a portion of
                 the job. He told them it was a secret
                 government experiment done through
                 CalTech. My Dad's not a liar, but he
                 felt in this case he had no choice. Of
                 course, it had to be a secret, because
                 we had just enough supplies to last
                 three people thirty-five years. That's
                 also why I have no brothers or
                 sisters. The air vent was the really
                 tricky part, but he was able to cut
                 into a flood control sewer. What I'd
                 like to do Eve, is take you down into
                 the fallout shelter with me. We could
                 live there with my Mom and Dad. My dad
                 said if I found a healthy girl I
                 should "bring her on down". And you
                 look plenty healthy to me.


                           EVE
                 Uh-huh. Adam?

                           ADAM
                 Yes, Eve?

                           EVE
                 I want you to go back to the hotel
                 now.  I'll call you a cab.

                           ADAM
                 Of course.  I shouldn't be over here
                 at this hour.

       He rises.  She gets up and leads him to the door.

                           EVE
                 That's right.  And I'll see you in the
                 morning in the lobby.  Do you mind
                 waiting outside for the taxi?

                           ADAM
                 Not at all.  And Eve thank you for
                 tonight...and for the kiss. My first.

                           EVE
                 My pleasure.

                           ADAM
                 It was at least as good as the sky.

                           EVE
                 Really?  Okay!

                           ADAM
                 And I think better than the ocean. I'm
                 serious!

                           EVE
                 Neat. Goodnight!

       EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

       Adam comes out glowing with happiness. He looks
       heavenward. And does his patented thumbs up.


       Behind him we hear Eve locking all the locks on her front
       door.

       EXT. VALLEY AVENUE - DAY

       A REFRIGERATED U-HAUL TRUCK lurches down the street.

       INT. TRUCK

       Adam struggles with the gears as Troy worries about his
       driving skills.

                           TROY
                 Goddamn, Adam!


                           ADAM
                 Wait a minute!

       He promptly pulls over and turns off the engine.

                           TROY
                 I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in
                 vain again, didn't I?  I'm so sorry.

                           ADAM
                 No!  There's an Adult Bookstore back
                 there!  I'll be right back!

       Adam jumps out of the truck and runs off.

                           TROY
                 Without question, the strangest man
                 I've ever met.

       EXT. ADULT BOOKSTORE - MOMENTS LATER

       Adam runs up.  The bookstore looks familiar.  Adam runs
       to the next store. It's a bar.  He runs to the next
       store.  It's the Malt Shop.  Adam is thrilled.  He tries
       the front door and at first it does not open.

       INT. MALT SHOP

       The Soda Jerk is leading about twelve followers in
       prayers.

                           SODA JERK
                 Give us a sign!  That's all we ask!
                 Give us some sort of sign!

       The front door opens and Adam peers in.  He sees the Soda
       Jerk; smiles broadly at him and waves.  Then he closes
       the
       door.  The Soda Jerk grabs his heart and faints.  His
       followers rush to his aid.

       INT. TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

       Adam jumps in.

                           ADAM
                 Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef
                 frozen patties!

                           TROY
                 How 'bout we check with Eve first?

                           ADAM
                 You bet!

                           TROY
                 So, did you buy a movie?

                           ADAM
                 What?

                           TROY
                 A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the
                 bookstore.

                           ADAM
                     (concentrating on his
                      driving)
                 No, I wouldn't go in one of those
                 places with a gas mask on.

                           TROY
                     (laughing in agreement)
                 I know what you mean!  I usually wear
                 a big hat and dark glasses.

                           ADAM
                 Does that work?

                           TROY
                 Yeah...Seems to.

       Adam would not have thought that.

       INT. EVE'S HOUSE - AN HOUR LATER

       Adam springs in, Troy drags in behind him (knowing the
       deal). Eve is standing away from the door next to a kind
       looking professional woman named Dr.Aron.

                           ADAM
                 Hi, Eve!

                           EVE
                 Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....

                           ARON
                 I'm Nina Aron, Adam.

                           ADAM
                 How do you do?

                           ARON
                 Very well, thank you. I'm with the
                 County Family Services Department. Eve
                 tells me you've been living in a bomb
                 shelter most of your life.

                           ADAM
                 Fallout shelter. There's a difference.

                           ARON
                 Adam, I'd like to introduce you to my
                 associate -- Mr. Brown.

       BROWN appears from the kitchen.  He's good-sized man who
       dresses casually.  Adam becomes uneasy.

                           ADAM
                 Hello.

       He nods politely.

                           ARON
                 We want you to come with us so we can
                 talk some more about your experiences.

                           ADAM
                 Come where?

                           ARON
                 My office.

                           ADAM
                 For how long?

                           ARON
                 Well, that depends...

                           ADAM
                 I thank you very much for the
                 invitation, but I'm quite busy today.
                 Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.

                           EVE
                 Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron.
                 It's the best thing.  The best thing
                 for you. I promise.

                           ADAM
                 ...All right, Eve.  If you say so.

                           EVE
                 ...I do.

                           ADAM
                     (to Aron)
                 Could I please just go home?  I was
                 lost, but this morning I found home
                 and I promise not to bother any of you
                 ever again.

                           ARON
                 Let's go talk first, Adam.

                           ADAM
                 Yes, ma'am.



       The two come forward.  One opens the door and one beckons
       for Adam to step out.

                           TROY
                 Good-bye, Adam.

                           ADAM
                 Goodbye.

       Adam looks back at Eve, who looks away. Adam exits.

                           ARON
                     (to Eve)
                 You'll be hearing from me.

       She shuts the door. Troy sits dejectedly.

                           EVE
                 Well what was I supposed to do?! He
                 wants me to live underground with him!
                 That's like Silence of the Lambs,
                 don't you think?!

                           TROY
                 I know...I know. You did the right
                 thing.

       Eve goes to the window and watches as WE SEE ADAM BREAK
       FROM BROWN AND RUN OFF with him chasing.

                           EVE
                 Oh, no!

                           TROY
                 What?!

       She runs out.  He follows.

       EXT. STREET

       Adam races down the sidewalk.  He cuts left and runs
       between houses.  Brown is not as fast.

       EXT. EVE'S FRONT YARD

       Eve and Troy run out to Aron who is dialing her cell
       phone.

                           EVE
                 Oh, my God!

                           ARON
                 He'll catch him.
                 		(then into phone)
                 Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run
                 away and I'm going to need police
                 assistance.

                           EVE
                 No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!

                           ARON
                 I have to. If a complaint is made and
                 the person resists obser--

                           EVE
                 No, I can't have that! They'll come
                 with their cars and their guns and
                 their handcuffs--

                           ARON
                 Calm down, please. This man needs help
                 and you need protection from him.
                 That's obvious.

                           EVE
                 You know, I don't think so. I'm
                 confused but you know, I don't think
                 he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd
                 hurt anyone.

                           ARON
                 And now you must let me be the judge
                 of that!

                           EVE
                 I was frightened and I didn't know
                 what to think! But you know-I believe
                 him. I think he just wants to go home.
                 Wherever the hell that is...

                           ARON
                 Let's all remain calm. That's the key
                 thing.





       Suddenly Adam appears from the side of the house,
       startling everyone. He tosses his hotel key to Eve.


                           ADAM
                 The key to my hotel room!  I want you
                 to have my baseball cards!
                 		(running to the truck)
                 And please be sure to pay my bill!

                           ARON
                 Young man, stop right there!

       Aron looks around for Mr. Brown.






       Adam jumps into the truck. Aron yells for him to stop.

                           ARON
                 Stop, right now! Get out of that
                 truck!

                           TROY
                 Adam, you really shouldn't try to
                 drive that truck!

                           ADAM
                     (starting the engine)
                 Bye, Troy!

                           TROY
                 Bye, Adam!

                           ADAM
                 And thanks for always being happy!

                           TROY
                 What?

                           EVE
                 Gay.

                           TROY
                 Oh.
                 		(yelling to Adam)
                 Well, you're...certainly welcome!

       Adam gets the truck in reverse and backs out of the
       driveway and into a parked car.

                           ARON
                 Hey!!! That's my car, you son of a
                 bitch!!

       Getting the truck in first, Adam has to go down the
       sidewalk a bungalow or two before he can get back onto
       the street.  He clips two parked cars as he does.  Brown
       comes running from the side of the house.  His pants are
       torn.

                           ARON (cont'd)
                 Where the hell have you been?!

                           BROWN
                 I fell down!
                     (to Troy and Eve)
                 What's the license number of that
                 truck?!

                           ARON
                 Don't ask them!  They're as fucked-up
                 as the other guy!

                           TROY
                 Let's all just try to remain calm.
                 That's the key thing.

                           ARON
                 How 'bout I just knock the shit out of
                 you?!

       Brown has to grab her.

       EXT. U-STORE-IT - LATER, SAME DAY

       Eve and Troy arrive in her GEO to see that the two locker
       doors are open and much of the stuff has been carried
       off.  Eve drops her head in disappointment.

                           TROY
                 I guess he took what he could.



                           EVE
                     (putting her head in her
                      hand)
                 Good God...you don't think there
                 really is a bomb shelter, do you?

                           TROY
                 Fallout shelter.

       She gives him a look.

                           TROY (cont'd)
                 There's a difference.

       INT. SHELTER, PATIO - LATER, SAME DAY

       Helen is using the hip-reduction machine while Calvin
       reads, How to Win Friends and Influence People. The
       distant sound of the hatchway being open gets their
       attention.  Then:

                           ADAM (OC)
                 Mom?!  Dad?!  I'm home!

       They jump up and race into the living room, meeting Adam
       halfway.   The parents kiss and hug their son before
       noticing that he's got the Soda Jerk with him.

                           ADAM
                 I've got almost everything we need!
                 And this nice man...

                           SODA JERK
                 Archbishop Melker. We met earlier.

       He promptly drops to his knees in supplication.

                           ADAM
                 ...and his church group have
                 volunteered to help us bring the
                 supplies down.  But we've got to
                 hurry.

                           HELEN
                 Are you in trouble, son?!

                           ADAM
                 I think I'm being chased by a
                 psychiatrist.

                           HELEN
                 A psychiatrist?!

                           SODA JERK
                 It happens.

                           HELEN
                 My goodness! How bad is it up there?!

                           SODA JERK
                 Horrible.

                           CALVIN
                 You have something on your forehead.

                           SODA JERK
                 I know.

       INT. ADAM'S HOTEL ROOM - DUSK

       Eve and Troy look around.  She opens a drawer and sees
       how nicely folded and put away things are.  Troy notices
       "TV Guide" and the Gideon Bible sitting out with a page
       marker in it.  He opens the night table drawer and takes
       out the cigar box.

                           TROY
                 This it?

       Eve nods.

                           TROY
                 What do you want to do with it?

                           EVE
                 Give it back to him.

                           TROY
                 And if we can't find him?

                           EVE
                 We'll find him.

       INT. BATHROOM, ADAM'S HOTEL ROOM

       Eve enters and looks at how tidy Adam's toiletries are;
       how the comb is just right in the brush; how the tooth
       paste (Ipanna in a '61 tube) has been squeezed from the
       bottom; and at how he has hung up his socks to dry.  It
       makes her very sad.  She picks up the toothpaste and
       holds it as if it were his ring.

                           TROY (OC)
                 Hey, Eve?  Eve?

       He enters with stock certificates and sees that she's
       very close to crying.

                           TROY
                 What's wrong?

                           EVE
                 I don't know.  Everything's so neat.
                 It's all just so...goddamn dear.
                 		(starting to cry)
                 Damn!

                           TROY
                 See these?  Found them in the box with
                 the cards.  These are stock
                 certificates.  IBM.  AT&T.  Polaroid.

       Instead of taking the certificates, she hands him the
       toothpaste and sits down on the bed in a funk.

                           TROY (cont'd)
                     (looking at the toothpaste)
                 Ipana. I think I remember that brand.
                     (then)
                 Oh, here, you should read this.
                 "Trademark, 1961."

       He holds out the tube and she takes it to read.


       EXT. REAR OF MALT SHOP - SAME TIME

       Adam, the Soda Jerk and fifteen followers hurriedly
       unload the truck, taking provisions into the back door of
       the malt shop.

       INT. JASON'S OFFICE - SAME TIME

       Their pal Jason is on the phone with Troy.

                           JASON
                 Purchased in 1958 and '59?  Ten
                 thousand shares of each?  They'd be
                 worth millions. Hell, I don't
                 know...millions upon millions upon
                 millions!  How 'bout that?

       INT. HOTEL ROOM - EARLY EVENING

       Troy is on the phone.  Eve is standing, looking at the
       stock certificates.

                           TROY
                 Thanks, Jason.

       He slams down the phone and jumps to his feet.

                           TROY
                 Millions upon millions upon millions!
                 The cards. The stock!  The clothes!
                 The toothpaste!  The guy was on the
                 level!  And you blew it!  A man walks
                 into your life who is the kindest,
                 most polite, honest, trustworthy,
                 incredibly rich guy you have ever met
                 in your life!! And what do you do?!

                           EVE
                 Have him committed.

                           TROY
                 Yeah! That's thinking.

                           EVE
                 He was always so "nice"! How was I
                 supposed to know that's a good thing?!
                 "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is
                 "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you
                 that.
                     (beat, then)
                 Was it ever?

                           TROY
                 I don't know. I like to think so.

                           EVE
                 Well, at least I fell for him before I
                 found out he was rich! That's new.
                     (then)
                 Wait a minute! He said today he knew
                 where home was. What happened this
                 morning?! Where did you go?!

                           TROY
                 To get some frozen poultry.

                           EVE
                 Then what?

                           TROY
                 We came back to the house!

                           EVE
                 You didn't stop anywhere else?!

                           TROY
                 No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a
                 porno store.

                           EVE
                 What?!

                           TROY
                 An adult bookstore. He was very
                 excited about seeing it. You think
                 home is under a dirty bookstore in the
                 Valley?

                           EVE
                 Come on.

       She heads out.

                           TROY
                 Trendy address.

       They exit.


       EXT. ADULT BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

       Troy and Eve approach and enter.



       INT. ADULT BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

       The Pakistani looks up briefly when Eve and Troy enter.
       There are two male customers in the bg. Eve taps her foot
       on the floor hoping to hear a hollow sound.  But it is
       solid.  She and Troy move about the store tapping their
       feet and finally jumping up and down.  The Pakistani and
       two customers become concerned.

                           EVE
                     (to Pakistani)
                 Have you got a basement?

                           PAKISTANI
                     (indicating merchandise)
                 Believe me, all the really good stuff
                 is right here.

                           EVE
                 Is there a back entrance?

                           PAKISTANI
                 Are you kidding?  Of course.

       He points to the rear of the store.

       EXT. REAR MALT SHOP PARKING LOT - NIGHT

       The Soda Jerk drives the rental truck away leaving the
       lot empty and the door to the Malt Shop closed. Troy and
       Eve appear after the truck is gone.

                           EVE
                 Why would you put a fallout shelter
                 under a porno shop?

                           TROY
                 None of this stuff was here in 1962.
                 The Valley was mostly small homes and
                 fruit orchards.

                           EVE
                 Well, we've come a long way, haven't
                 we?  I want to go home.

                           TROY
                 Yeah.  Maybe he'll call.

       They turn left to get back to the avenue.

       INT. EVE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

       The phone is ringing.  Then the recorder answers.

                           TROY
                 Hi. Troy and Eve are out so leave a
                 message. And if you want to leave a
                 number don't say it fast! I hate that!
                 Say it slow. Thank you.

       Beep,

                           ADAM
                 Uh, Eve...this is Adam.  Look, I just
                 wanted to thank you for everything you
                 did for me...and I wanted to tell you
                 that I...uh...that I wish so many good
                 things for you. I wish so hard that
                 all of your dreams come true. Um...I,
                 uh...



       EXT. AVENUE - NIGHT

       Eve lets Troy drive.  She clutches the cigar box and
       rests her head on the seat as they pull away from the
       curb in front of the bookstore.  A low rider passes them
       on the left.  Eve sees an old hag being shoved out of the
       bar and a homeless man slipping into the abandoned malt
       shop and the cross-dressing STREET WALKER making eyes at
       passing cars and Adam hanging up the pay phone he just
       used.

                           EVE
                 Adam!!

                           TROY
                 Where?!

                           EVE
                 Stop!

       She rolls down her window.

                           EVE
                 Adam!!

       ANGLE - ADAM

       Turning when he hears Eve yell his name.

       ANGLE - EVE

       Running from the car.  The cigar box falls to the street
       and the contents scatter.  Eve could care less.  Besides,
       Troy is there to retrieve everything.

       In a series of cuts and slo-mo action the couple race
       into each other's arms...to the pleasure of all the
       lowlifes mentioned above.  Now the street looks more like
       Capra than Scorsese. She's surprised that she wants to
       kiss him so bad. He's surprised that he gets so
       aggressive.

       INT. SHELTER, KITCHEN - LATER, SAME NIGHT

       Helen watches Calvin work on the timing device for the
       locks with a screwdriver.

                           HELEN
                 How long will you set it for this
                 time?

                           CALVIN
                 I thought ten years.

                           HELEN
                 Well, that's...considerably shorter
                 than before.  I was wondering, Calvin,
                 why set the locks at all.  I mean the
                 radiation is gone and...

                           CALVIN
                 To keep what's up there from getting
                 down here! It's not the radiation I'm
                 worried about.

                           ADAM (OC)
                 Mom?  Dad?

       They turn to see Adam walking forward with Eve.

                           ADAM
                 I'd like for you to meet Miss Eve
                 Rustokov.

       Calvin knows a Russian name when he hears one. But he
       chooses not to pursue it.

                           EVE
                     (stepping forward, offering
                      her hand)
                 How do you do, Mrs. Webber?  Mr.
                 Webber?

                           WEBBERS
                     (rather dumb-struck)
                 Hello.

                            EVE
                 Uh-huh. I've heard so many wonderful
                 things about you.

                           HELEN
                 Well, please excuse us!  We...we
                 haven't entertained a guest in...um...

                           CALVIN
                 Some time.

                           HELEN
                 What can I offer you, Eve?

                           ADAM
                 Mom?  Eve and I have to go.

                           HELEN
                 What?

                           ADAM
                 I can't explain it now.  But I want
                 you to set the locks for two months.
                 You have more than enough of
                 everything.  Then we'll be back to get
                 you.

                           CALVIN
                 But, I don't understand.

                           ADAM
                 And, I'm asking you to trust me
                 without understanding why.

                           CALVIN
                 Well, in that case...of course, son.

                           HELEN
                 Of course.

                           EVE
                 They are wonderful parents.

                           ADAM
                 We have to go.

                           HELEN
                 No, wait! At least stay for dinner!

                           CALVIN
                 Yes, please! You must.

                           ADAM/EVE
                 Well...sure...okay.

       INT. BAR - AN HOUR LATER

       Calvin mixes drinks just like he did at the party in
       1962. Adam is with him.

       INT. - KITCHEN

       Helen races around, just like she did in 1962, getting
       the roast ready. Eve. watches.

                           EVE
                 Adam said I shouldn't mention the
                 Communists.

                           HELEN
                 Oh, yes! Please, don't mention the
                 Communists!

       INT. - DINING ROOM

       Helen hurries out of the kitchen to take her seat. The
       others are already there.

                           HELEN
                 Eve. I hope I'm not being nosey, but
                 are you and Adam...um...dating?

                           EVE
                 Yes, Mrs. Webber we are.
                     (then)
                 I'm also from Pasadena.

       Helen nearly comes unglued. Calvin is pleased, too. He
       raises his tea cup.

                           CALVIN
                 A toast! To Adam and Eve!

       The others also raise their cups and everyone clicks.
       Then they drink.

                           EVE
                     (gagging)
                 What is this sh...stuff?!

                           CALVIN
                 Hot Dr. Pepper! Most people don't know
                 how good it is heated up.

                           EVE
                 You know, they don't, do they?

       They begin to eat.

                           EVE (cont'd)
                 What about grace?

                           HELEN
                 Oh, my goodness! We almost forgot!
                     (then)
                 I like your friend, Adam.

       They all join hands and lower their heads. Calvin leads
       them.

                           EVE (VO)
                 And you thought your parents were
                 weird.

       EXT. BEAUTIFUL VALLEY NORTH OF LA - MORNING

       Adam and Eve are with a REAL ESTATE BROKER. The broker
       unlocks the gate of a chain-link fence and Adam and Eve
       step onto the property. The broker's Lexus is in the b.g.

                           BROKER
                 It's like the Garden of Eden, don't
                 you think?

       Adam and Eve respond but we can't hear them under Eve's
       narration.

                           EVE (VO)
                 You see, that night, Adam had a choice
                 between me and his parents.







       SCENE 173 OMITTED

       EXT. VALLEY PROPERTY - DAY

       Adam and Eve are working with a TEAM OF ARCHITECTS AND
       CONTRACTORS at the site of a new home. They have plans
       and are discussing dimensions.

                           EVE (VO)
                 It's truly amazing what you can get
                 done when you have unlimited funds.
                 Did you know you can have whole houses
                 built in just a matter of months. All
                 you have to say is this..."I don't
                 care what it costs."  And then, of
                 course, you've got
                 to really mean it, which no one ever
                 does.

       EXT. NEW HOUSE - DAY

       It is under construction.


       EXT. MELROSE RETRO FURNITURE STORE - DAY

       Adam, Eve and Troy enter.

       INT. RETRO STORE

       This is great stuff from the fifties and the sixties.
       Adam finds things very similar to what he grew up with.
       There's a
       lamp (or something) that's just like the lamp (or
       something) from the Webber living room.

                           ADAM
                 That lamp is perfect!

                           STORE OWNER
                     (very faggy)
                 I'm holding that for Elton John.

                           TROY
                     (faggy right back)
                 Oh, I think not.

       SCENE 176 OMITTED  (REFER TO SCENE 172D)



       EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF MALT SHOP (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT

       Adam and Eve embracing as Troy picks up baseball cards
       and the street people look on.

                           ADAM
                 Eve, I've got to go back! My parents
                 can't handle this up here. And there
                 was no bomb, was there?



                           EVE
                 No.

                           ADAM
                 See! I can't tell them that!  I can't
                 ever let them know. It makes their
                 life..well, frankly...
                 a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You
                 understand?

                           EVE
                 We can make this work, Adam! Believe
                 me! I'm very good at making things
                 work!

                           ADAM
                 My mother's like that.

       They kiss again.



       INT. MALT SHOP - DAY

       Eve and Troy are showing large color drawings to the Soda
       Jerk.  In CU we see the Malt Shop exterior all dolled up
       with a big lighted sign that says "GIVE ME SHELTER."
       There's valet parking and the Adult Bookstore and Bar
       have been turned into a Souvenir Center (think Planet
       Hollywood).  Another drawing shows fashionable guests
       boarding the elevator.

                           EVE (VO)
                 It took a while to convince Archbishop
                 Milker that Adam wasn't God, and he
                 was pretty broken up about it, too,
                 until I showed him my plans for Los
                 Angeles' hottest and most original
                 night spot.

       Other drawings show dancing on the shelter patio and
       guided tours being shown various parts of the shelter.

                           EVE
                 You'll be a ten percent partner and
                 still retain ownership of the
                 entrance.

                           SODA JERK
                 Praise the Lord.  And I mean the real
                 one.

       EXT. BEAUTIFUL VALLEY NORTH OF L.A. - TWO MONTHS LATER

       A 1962 Cadillac leads a 1962 windowless van through
       automatic gates that have signs on them saying:  PRIVATE
       ROAD and NO TRESPASSING. Troy drives the van. Eve drives
       the Cadillac. Adam is her passenger.

                           EVE (VO)
                 Our idea was to bring Adam's parents
                 up to the surface very slowly.  Make
                 them very comfortable and then break
                 the bad news to them that there was no
                 nuclear holocaust. And if that doesn't
                 kill them Adam's going to tell his
                 father about the Internet.

       EXT. EXACT REPLICA OF THE WEBBER HOUSE - DAY

       The cars pull up and Adam lets his parents out. They go
       bonkers when they see the house.





       INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

       The parents enter first. They are thrilled, shocked, etc.

       INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

       As a demonstration, Troy removes a hot cup of coffee from
       the microwave.  Helen is happy to see this handy new
       device.  Calvin, the inventor, sticks his head into the
       machine to investigate its workings.

       INT. FAMILY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

       Adam demonstrates the VCR to his parents as Troy and Eve
       look on.

                           ADAM
                 You put the tape in here and you get a
                 movie -- in your own home.

       We see the main title to Natural Born Killers come up on
       the screen. Troy and Eve rush forward.

                           EVE/TROY
                 No!!

       INT. ADAM'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

       It has been turned into an office for Calvin.

                           HELEN
                 This is your bedroom?

                           ADAM
                 No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's
                 office.

                           HELEN
                 Well, where are you --

                           ADAM
                 Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.

                           HELEN
                 No.

                           ADAM
                 Yes.

                           EVE
                 Is that all right?

                           HELEN
                 It's wonderful, dear! Wonderful!!

       They hug.

                           HELEN (cont'd)
                 Calvin!  They're married!

                           CALVIN
                     (offering his hand to both)
                 That's wonderful. We Webber guys have
                 mighty good luck when it comes to
                 women.

       Calvin points out the computer.

                           CALVIN (cont'd)
                 What's that thing?

                           ADAM
                 It's kind of a combination television-
                 typewriter-telephone-post office type
                 of thing.
                     (leading Calvin out)
                 I'll show it to you later.

       EXT. PATIO - AN HOUR LATER

       Adam and Calvin exit the house. They wear baseball gloves
       and start playing catch. (Calvin notes the modern
       construction of his glove, but does not comment on it.)

                           CALVIN
                 This is great son, just great. By the
                 way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov,
                 that's not Russian, is it?

                           ADAM
                 It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents
                 immigrated here.

                           CALVIN
                 Uh-huh.

                           ADAM
                 Dad, I don't know how to tell you
                 this. And I was going to wait a while,
                 but I think...Dad,there was no bomb.
                 A plane crashed into our backyard. I
                 looked it up in old newspapers.

                           CALVIN
                     (after a while)
                 You're sure?

                           ADAM
                 Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed
                 without a shot being fired. The Cold
                 War is over.

                           CALVIN
                 That's what everybody believes?

                           ADAM
                 Yes, sir. It's true.

                           CALVIN
                 What? Did the politburo just one day
                 say - "We give up?"

                           ADAM
                 Yes. That's kind of how it was.

                           CALVIN
                 Uh-huh.

       Adam throws the ball, but Calvin makes no attempt to
       catch it.

                           CALVIN
                 My gosh, those Commies are brilliant!
                 You've got to hand it to 'em!  "No, we
                 didn't drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our
                 evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor
                 us!"  I bet they've even asked the
                 West for aid!  Right?!

                           ADAM
                 Uh, I think they have.

                           CALVIN
                 Hah!!! Those cagey rascals! Those sly
                 dissemblers! Those, uh...
                     (he can't think of another
                      description, so he moves on)
                 They've finally pulled the wool over
                 everybody's eyes!

                           EVE (VO)
                 Have you ever in your life seen a son
                 who did more for his parents?

       Helen comes out with a tray of champagne cocktails.

                           EVE (VO)
                 Adam says that this is simply how
                 things work.  First the parents take
                 care of the children and then the
                 children take care
                 of the parents. He says historically,
                 that's how it works.

       INT. LIVING ROOM

       Eve and Troy are sitting by the window.  Adam and Helen
       come in to offer cocktails to Troy and Eve.

                           EVE (VO)
                 Whenever Adam gives me such obviously
                 incorrect information, I just smile,
                 slap him on the knee, and look out the
                 window.
                 Why spoil his dreams?  They're such
                 wonderful dreams.

       The CAMERA wanders off of them and shoots out the glass
       doors. We see Calvin behind the house...measuring off the
       dimensions for a fallout shelter.

       EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

       Calvin continues to measure as we pull way back and up.
       Perry Como sings "We'll Meet Again".

                                                          FADE OUT:

                           THE END
FADE IN:



       SCENE 1 OMITTED

       EXT. SAN FERNANDO VALLEY - NIGHT

       OPEN on a MOVING WIDE SHOT of a mountain range with the
       distant lights of the San Fernando Valley behind it.
       BEGIN CREDITS as a NAVY JET drops down into the picture.
       PUSH IN on the jet's exhaust flame. Have the words "THE
       BLAST" come out of the flame. Then there is a SLIGHT
       EXPLOSION and the flame intensifies. The words "FROM THE
       PAST" jump out of the exhaust as the jet momentarily
       shakes.

       INT. JET

       The PILOT feels the jet shake. But he looks at his
       indicators and everything appears to be normal. He
       relaxes.

       EXT. JET

       We begin with a WIDER REAR SHOT of the jet and allow the
       plane to move away. Then SUPER: "LOS ANGELES, 1962"
       before continuing the main titles. A popular recording
       from that period has been playing throughout.

       EXT. CALVIN'S WORK SHOP - NIGHT

       Start on a CU of the HAM RADIO ANTENNA, WIND GAUGE and
       THERMOMETER attached to the roof of Calvin's shop. (We
       can hear military air traffic chatter on Calvin's
       Hallicrafter radio.) Then move down to the window where
       we see CALVIN Webber tinkering with a gadget at his work
       bench. Calvin's very pregnant wife HELEN appears. The
       music becomes source.

                           HELEN
                 For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got
                 guests!

                           CALVIN
                 Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling
                 with this darn rheostat.

                           HELEN
                 Well, put it down and come in!

                           CALVIN
                 You bet, hon!

       They exit the workshop for the house.  Calvin has left
       the ham radio on.




                           NAVY PILOT (ON
                           RADIO)
                 Tower, Wolf One is five miles from the
                 overhead.

                           TOWER (ON RADIO)
                 Wolf One, Tower. Report the numbers.
                 You're number one for the overhead.

                           NAVY PILOT (ON
                           RADIO)
                 Wolf one.


       INT. COCKPIT OF JET - SAME TIME

       The YOUNG PILOT looks down at the flashing red light on
       his control panel. He speaks into the oxygen mask that
       hangs loosely from his helmet.

                           PILOT
                 Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem
                 here.

                           TOWER (OC)
                 Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you
                 declaring an emergency?

                           PILOT
                 Stand by. One.

       INT. DINING ROOM

       DAVE, BETTY, BOB, and RUTH (30's) pass around the buffet
       table. Another period song is playing on the phonograph.

                           BETTY
                 Just remember: don't mention the
                 communists!

                           DAVE
                 Calvin's a great guy, but he's a
                 little, you know...

                           BETTY
                 Nutty.

                           RUTH
                 What's his wife like?

                           BETTY
                 Oh, you know, housewife.

                           DAVE
                 Likes to cook. Pregnant.

                           RUTH
                 Normal, then.

                           BETTY
                 Well, I wouldn't go that far.
                     (then)
                 Helen!

       Helen has entered from the kitchen with more food. She
       favors June Allison.

                           HELEN
                 Hi, Betty!  Dave!

                           BETTY
                 Just look at you!

                           HELEN
                 Any day now!

                           BETTY
                 This is my sister and her husband.

                           HELEN
                 Oh, hi! Welcome!

       INT. LIVING ROOM

       Calvin is using a cocktail shaker to very carefully make
       Rob Roys for the crowd at the bar. It's like watching a
       chemist at work. Calvin's a pipe-smoker.

                           CALVIN
                 So anyhow this duck says to the clerk,
                 "I'd like to buy this lip balm."  And
                 the clerk says, "Will that be cash or
                 a check?"  And the duck says, "Just
                 put it on my bill!"

       Polite laughter follows, but the guy out of Calvin's
       sight-line rolls his eyes.

       ANGLE - DAVE AND BOB

       with drinks. Helen is in the b.g., rushing around, over-
       serving everyone.

                           DAVE
                 He was the golden-boy professor at Cal
                 Tech.  But then he starts inventing
                 things.

                           BOB
                 What kind of things?

                           DAVE
                 You got me.  Some kind of special
                 synthetic rubber.  And some kind of
                 automated machine.  Anyhow, suddenly
                 he gets rich.  I mean rich!  And quits
                 teaching.

       ANGLE - CALVIN

       as his guests sample their Rob Roys.

                           CALVIN
                 How's that?

                           GUEST
                 Just what the doctor ordered!

       Calvin gives the man his patented thumbs-up sign.

       ANGLE - BETTY AND RUTH

       over by the patio doors. We can see Calvin's shop through
       the window.

                           BETTY
                 With all his money they could have
                 moved to Beverly Hills, but they
                 decided to stay in the Valley.  Calvin
                 spends all his time tinkering out
                 there in his workshop.  If you ask me
                 it's all very strange.

                           WOMAN GUEST #1
                     (chiming in)
                 He dug a huge hole out there for a
                 swimming pool. Then he decided he
                 didn't want it and filled the thing
                 in. And what's that big, high fence
                 for?

       The women look at Calvin.



       ANGLE - CALVIN

       with guests (one is called Harold) at the bar.

                           CALVIN
                 There currently exists a type of neon
                 light that lasts five years.  But you
                 won't see it on the market. Same is
                 true of batteries. I could take your
                 simple yacht battery and rig it to
                 last a decade, easily.

                           HAROLD
                 Well, what the heck kind of a
                 marketing system can't get great new
                 products like that out to the public?

                           CALVIN
                     (intense)
                 A veeeery good one, Harold. Free
                 market capitalism may not be a perfect
                 order, but it's the best we've got, or
                 will ever have.  And why?  Three
                 reasons!

       Poor Harold.

       INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

       Most of the guests are women, gabbing and helping Helen
       out as she removes a pot roast from the oven and busily
       jumps around the kitchen.

                           WOMAN GUEST #2
                 Say, Helen?  What does Calvin think
                 about this trouble down in Cuba?

                           HELEN
                     (rolling her eyes)
                 Oh, please don't bring that up!

       EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT, MOMENTS LATER

       A late guest named RON hurries up the walkway and into
       the house.





       SCENE 8 OMITTED

       INT. LIVING ROOM - A SECOND LATER

       Calvin is with another guest.

                           CALVIN
                 I'd say my baseball card collection is
                 as complete as any one I've ever seen.

       Ron pushes his way through the crowd.

                           RON
                 Calvin!  Hey, Calvin!
                 		(pointing over his shoulder)
                 Kennedy's going toe-to-toe with
                 Khrushchev on the television!

       Calvin immediately heads for the family room. Others
       follow.

       INT. FAMILY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

       Everyone is huddled around the JFK TV press conference.
       There seems to be a lot of smokers. Helen appears
       shortly, wearing a hot pad mitten on each hand.

                           JFK
                 ...this sudden, clandestine decision
                 to station strategic weapons for the
                 first time outside of Soviet soil, is
                 a deliberately provocative and
                 unjustified change in the status quo
                 which cannot be accepted by this
                 country.

       Calvin cuts a knowing look at Helen who dutifully returns
       it.

       EXT. JET - NIGHT

       The plane swoops over the Valley and we see the
       spectacular lights of L.A. sprawl.  There is a TRAIL OF
       SPARKS coming from the jet's engine.

       INT. JET COCKPIT

       The plane is shaking terribly and the pilot is having a
       very hard time controlling it.

                           TOWER
                 Wolf One -- say intentions.

                           PILOT
                 I've got secondaries of an engine fire
                 and I'll need to find a clear area to
                 eject.

                           TOWER
                 Roger, Wolf One. Can you make it to
                 the ocean?

       EXT. JET

       The trembling plane circles to the west.

       INT. FAMILY ROOM

       Return to TV.

                           JFK
                 ...we will not prematurely or
                 unnecessarily risk the cost of
                 worldwide nuclear war, in which even
                 the fruits of victory would be ashes
                 in our mouth.  But neither will we
                 shrink from the risk at any time it
                 must be faced.

       INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT/ EXT. HOUSE, MOMENTS LATER

       To Helen's embarrassment, Calvin is ushering  all the
       guests to the front door. Helen is passing out hats and
       purses. She and Calvin speak simultaneously - somewhere
       in the middle we cut outside.


                           CALVIN
                 I'm sorry everyone, but given this
                 extraordinary turn of events, I think
                 it's prudent that we cut the evening
                 short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will
                 resolve itself, but in the
                 meantime...I'd suggest taking a
                 prayerful watch-and-wait stance!

                           HELEN
                 We'll do this again! Maybe next week.
                 Here's your hat. Could I wrap
                 something up for you? Did you have a
                 coat?

       Helen can barely get a "good night" out before Calvin
       shuts the door.

       ANGLE - DAVE AND BOB

       Following their wives out.

                 			DAVE
                     (sotto to Bob)
                 What'd I tell ya?!

       Bob whistles softly. Calvin's a nut all right.

       INT. FRONT DOOR

       Calvin turns to Helen, a grave expression on his face.

                           CALVIN
                 It's time.

                           HELEN
                     (misinterpreting, holding her
                      stomach)
                 Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time
                 yet. I still have--

       He points down.

                           HELEN (cont'd)
                 Oh, that time! You know Calvin, I'm
                 not sure I'm really ready for this.

                           CALVIN
                 On the contrary, I think we're the
                 only ones who are.

       He leads her out of shot.

                           HELEN (OC)
                 Calvin I'm sure everything's going to
                 be all right. I just know it is!

       EXT. BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

       Calvin and Helen leave the house; cross the patio; and
       hurry to the shop. Back in the house, the record player
       has been left on:  "How Much Is That Doggie In The
       Window...?"  Helen is carrying the pot roast which is
       wrapped in foil.

                           HELEN
                 Well, I'm certainly not going to let
                 the pot roast go to waste. Could you
                 just put that seat cover back on that
                 lawn chair?

       He does.

                           HELEN (cont'd)
                 Shouldn't we at least turn off the
                 phonograph?

                           CALVIN
                 It shuts off automatically.

                           HELEN
                 Did you rig it to do that? You're so
                 clever.

                           CALVIN
                 No.  They all do.

                           HELEN
                 I never know anymore.

       The SOUND OF THE TRAINER JET makes a low pass over
       Calvin's house.  Calvin sticks his head out the door and
       looks up.

                           CALVIN
                 I bet that's a fighter jet on his way
                 to Key West!  Good luck, amigo!

       INT. WORKSHOP

       They enter. The place is full of tools and gadgets--
       mostly construction equipment. The ham radio is still on.

                           TOWER
                 An emergency has been declared. I
                 repeat, an emergency has been
                 declared.

       Calvin and Helen speak over the Tower who is telling
       other aircraft in the vicinity to clear the area.

                           CALVIN
                 You hear that?!

                           HELEN
                 Yes.

       Calvin unplugs the radio and quickly wraps the cord.

                           CALVIN
                 We can listen to the rest downstairs!

       He pushes aside a table that is hiding a hatch in the
       floor and unlocks it by turning the hatch's wheel.  Then
       he opens the hatch and reaches inside to turn on a light.
       Red submarine light shines up from below.  All the while
       he and Helen are chatting:

                           HELEN
                 Calvin, I wish you would have at least
                 let me do the dishes. It's not going
                 to be that easy getting all that dried-
                 on food off my nice plates.

                           CALVIN
                 I just hope those plates aren't
                 radioactive by tomorrow morning.

                           HELEN
                 Cheese is particularly troublesome.

                           CALVIN
                 Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?

                           HELEN
                 Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that
                 Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember
                 that?

                           CALVIN
                 Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast
                 and watch your step.  I'll come back
                 for the radio.

       She steps into the hatch and onto a ladder.


       INT. JET - NIGHT

       The young pilot is bouncing around the now smokey
       cockpit.

                           PILOT
                 Tower, say again!!

                           TOWER
                 The SAR HELO is airborne with you in
                 sight.

                           PILOT
                 I'm marking the 180 radial for five
                 and ejecting.

                           TOWER
                 Roger, Wolf One.




       The pilot rights the plane; points the joy stick; and
       reaches for the ejection handles between his legs.

       EXT. JET

       The pilot ejects.

       INT. EMPTY COCKPIT

       This is the pilot's POV (were there a pilot.)  We see the
       coastline and we notice that the plane is making a... U-
       turn, away from the water and back towards the Valley.

       EXT. JET

       Streaking back to the Valley with a dramatic tail of
       sparks.

       EXT. THE PARACHUTING PILOT

       He notices that his plane is headed directly at him.  It
       misses him by a matter of yards.

       INT. LADDER - CONTINUOUS

       Taking the liberty of a CUTAWAY SECTION, we follow them
       down the ladder which is inside a corrugated metal tube.
       On either side of the tube we see layers of dirt.

                           HELEN
                 How long will we have to stay down
                 here?

                           CALVIN
                 I don't know. For this thing to blow
                 over, it could take days.

                           HELEN
                 Days??

                           CALVIN
                 Rather safe than sorry. That's my
                 motto!

                           HELEN
                 But, what if I go into labor? That
                 could happen any time.

                           CALVIN
                 I've read up on it. I'll deliver the
                 baby myself if I have to.

                           HELEN
                 Now you listen to me Calvin Webber,
                 when this baby comes, you're going to
                 be out in the waiting
                 room smoking yourself to death with
                 all the other fathers.

                           CALVIN
                     (chuckling)
                 Yes, dear!

                           HELEN
                 As long as we've got that straight.

       EXT. JET - SAME TIME

       It COMPLETES ITS TURN and STREAKS SKYWARD at a 90 degree
       angle to the ground... until it SPUTTERS and the ENGINES
       STOP.  Then, after a Road Runner-like beat or two, it
       begins to FALL DIRECTLY BACK TO EARTH, tail first.

       INT. SMALL ANTEROOM - SAME TIME

       The Webbers step off a metal ladder and face a vault-like
       chrome hatchway.  Calvin opens the six-inch thick door by
       pushing another switch on his small box. Helen takes the
       roast.

       EXT. JET - NIGHT

       With only the sound of wind, the jet continues to fall as
       the lights of the Valley rush up to meet it.



       INT. SHELTER - CONTINUOUS

       They step into a darkened room.

                           CALVIN
                     (with arms spread)
                 Home sweet home!

                           HELEN
                 To you maybe.

       Calvin flicks a wall switch and we HEAR A SERIES OF
       LIGHTS COMING ON.  The echoes of the sounds suggest a
       large, cavernous space.  All we can see is the cinder
       block wall behind them and the hatch door, which Calvin
       begins to shut by putting his body into it.

       Just then there is a TREMENDOUS DOUBLE EXPLOSION FROM
       ABOVE which knocks them to the floor. (Note: Helen hangs
       on to the roast, trying her best not to drop it.) The
       LADDER, CORRUGATED TUBE, ROOF, AND LOTS OR DIRT AND ROCK
       BEGIN TO CRASH DOWN INTO THE ANTEROOM. Calvin struggles
       to his feet and gets the vault door shut just in the nick
       of time.

                           HELEN
                 What was that?!

                           CALVIN
                 Are you all right?!

       Hanging on to the roast she nods vigorously, trying to be
       brave.

                           HELEN
                 Yes, I think so.

       Calvin hurries to a bright RED METAL BOX on the wall.
       Next to the box is a LARGE THERMOMETER OR GAUGE that's
       labeled "Radiation Count."  There are OTHER GAUGES that
       are dropping to zero.

                           CALVIN
                 Oh, no!  It's happened!  Look at that
                 heat!!  All my surface indicators are
                 knocked out!  Oh, my Lord...it's
                 actually happened!!

       INTER CUT - CU OF BOX AND THERMOMETER

       The box has a dial on it, next to which is a large lever.
       A foreboding sign reads  HATCHWAY TIME LOCKS, USE EXTREME
       CAUTION.  Calvin pulls the lever.

       BACK TO SCENE

       The chrome and steel EXIT HATCHWAY AUTOMATICALLY LOCKS
       with great noise, precision and...finality. There is the
       SOUND OF A REAR DOOR doing the same thing.

                           HELEN
                 What's that noise?

                           CALVIN
                 The locks.

                           HELEN
                 The locks?

                           CALVIN
                 To keep us from trying to leave. After
                 an atomic blast there's a radiation
                 half-life that lasts thirty five
                 years.

                           HELEN
                 Thirty -five years!

                           CALVIN
                 Then after that it's safe.

                           HELEN
                 It's safe.

       She continues to stare at him.

                           CALVIN
                 To go up.

                           HELEN
                 To go up.

       She continues to stare at him.

                           CALVIN
                     (confidently)
                 Hey, honey. Don't you worry. We're
                 going to be just fine.

       Helen bursts into tears.

       EXT WEBBER PATIO - DAY

       Two police detectives, LEVY and ATKINSON, exit the house.
       Uniformed workers carefully carry small pieces of the jet
       from the crash site. The detectives lead us to what's
       left of Calvin's shop. It's mostly a charred crater.

                           LEVY
                 According to Caltech, this Webber guy
                 was a bonafide genius and a borderline
                 nutcase.

                           ATKINSON
                 Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have
                 been out here when the plane hit.

                           LEVY
                 Unless we get a postcard or somethin',
                 that's my guess.

                           ATKINSON
                 What about relatives?

                           LEVY
                 All back East.

                           ATKINSON
                 The neighbors over there said the guy
                 spent day and night out here. She'd
                 bring him sandwiches and hot Dr.
                 Pepper.

                           LEVY
                 He drank it hot?

                           ATKINSON
                 Yeah.

                           LEVY
                 Good god.

                           ATKINSON
                 Yeah.



       INT. MASTER BEDROOM - SAME TIME (12 HOURS AFTER BLAST)

       Helen awakes alone and still dressed. She sits up and
       trys the phone on the night table. It is dead. She hangs
       up and exits.

       INT. KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM/PATIO

       Calvin is making sandwiches from the pot roast. Two empty
       Doctor Pepper bottles sit next to the stove where Calvin
       is heating the soda. He sees Helen enter the livingroom.

                           CALVIN
                 Hi, honey! Feeling better?

                           HELEN
                 No.

                           CALVIN
                 We have to be strong, sweetheart. If
                 not for ourselves, for the child.

                           HELEN
                 All our friends...

       He enters with her sandwich and a cup of Dr. Pepper.

                           CALVIN
                 Burnt to a crisp.
                     (indicating sandwiches)
                 I've given you the most well-done cut.

                           HELEN
                 I'm not hungry.

                           CALVIN
                 Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!

                           HELEN
                     (leaving)
                 No, Calvin, you're favorite.

                           CALVIN
                 Really?

       She walks out onto the patio. She rubs her arms as if
       cold.

                           CALVIN
                 A bit chilly? Shouldn't be.
                 Temperature's a nice 73 degrees.



       He follows her out to the patio.

                           HELEN
                 Maybe I've just got the creeps.

                           CALVIN
                 How could you?! This is just like
                 home!

       A reverse angle shows for the first time the rest of the
       fallout shelter -- which looks very different from
       "home". Perhaps she starts to cry again.

                           HELEN
                 No. No! Calvin, this is different!
                 Believe me!

                           CALVIN
                 Would you like a tranquilizer?

                           HELEN
                 You have tranquilizers?

                           CALVIN
                 I told you! I've got everything!











        Helen groans in pain.

                           HELEN
                 Oh, no.

                           CALVIN
                 What?

                           HELEN
                 Uh, oh. Now it's time.

                           CALVIN
                 Honey?

       INT. VERY WIDE OF THE SHELTER - HOURS LATER

       We can only hear Adam's entrance into the world. There is
       Helen's pain, followed by Adam's cry, followed by
       Calvin's rejoicing.

                           CALVIN (OC)
                 The first child to be born on earth
                 after the annihilation!!



       INT. SHELTER - DAYS LATER

       SUPER: SEVERAL DAYS LATER

       Start on the record player in the living room. The
       country and western classic "Hey, Good Looking" is
       spinning.



       OMIT SCENE 30

       INT. SHELTER, BATTERY ROOM - SAME TIME

       Calvin walks through checking things over; pleased by
       what he sees.  He exits. ("Hey Good Looking" continues.)

       INT. SHELTER, FISH FARM - CONTINUOUS

       Calvin checks the switch he uses to control the lights.
       Then he checks out all the tiny fish swimming in the six
       feet by six feet tank.  When he hears a baby's cry he
       hurries away.(Music continues)

       INT. SHELTER, MASTER BEDROOM

       Calvin enters and smiles with great affection at his
       family:  Helen and a NEWBORN SON cradled next to her in
       bed.

                           CALVIN
                 Is there a problem?

                           HELEN
                 No, Calvin.  Babies cry.

                           CALVIN
                 I've noticed.

                           HELEN
                 What shall we call him?

       Calvin shrugs.

                           HELEN (cont'd)
                 Well, I was thinking...in light of the
                 situation...that we should call him
                 Adam.  That's not sacrilegious is it?

                           CALVIN
                 No.  I think it's just right.

                           HELEN
                 And I was wondering...if...if I could
                 have a...

                           CALVIN
                 Yes!

                           HELEN
                 If I...you know...

                           CALVIN
                 What? Whatever you want, Helen!

       She points upwards.

                           HELEN
                 I want a bedroom ceiling.

       They both look up. Then he tells her.

                           CALVIN
                 You've got it!

       Calvin happily gives her his patented thumbs-up sign.

       A MONTAGE:  1) CALVIN , IN A LARGE SUPPLY ROOM, PICKS OUT
       THE PLYWOOD HE'LL NEED FOR THE CEILINGS. ( 60'S HAPPY,
       BUSY SCORE COVERS ALL THIS.)

       2) HELEN, CARRIES LITTLE ADAM (THREE DAYS OLD) ONTO THE
       FAKE PATIO (WITH THE PLASTIC PLANTS AND THE PLASTIC
       GRASS). SHE LOOKS UP AT CALVIN WHO'S ON A LADDER
       INSTALLING A CEILING.

       SUPER: SEVERAL WEEKS LATER

       3) IN THE FAMILY ROOM, CALVIN SHOWS HELEN HOW HE'S RIGGED
       A PROJECTOR TO THROW A PICTURE ONTO THE TV SCREEN. SHE'S
       THRILLED TO SEE "THE HONEYMOONERS!" MAIN TITLES COME ON.
       ADAM, LYING ON A QUILT BY HELEN'S CHAIR, IS ABOUT FOUR
       WEEKS OLD. (IT'S IMPORTANT HERE THAT WE SEE A 8MM FILM
       BOX WITH THE "I LOVE LUCY" LOGO ON IT)

       SUPER: SEVERAL MONTHS LATER

       4) TOTAL DARKNESS. THEN CALVIN FLICKS A SWITCH AND A BANK
       OF OVERHEAD LIGHTS COMES ON TO SIMULATE SUNLIGHT. UNDER
       THE LIGHTS ARE SOIL BEDS ON WOODEN TABLES. CALVIN IS
       EXCITED TO SHOW HELEN THE TINY, YOUNG CARROTS COMING UP.
       HELEN HOLDS ADAM AT THREE MONTHS OLD.

       SUPER: A YEAR LATER

       5) IN THE DINING ROOM, HELEN IS SERVING POT ROAST AND
       SOME VERY NICE LOOKING CARROTS. ADAM IS SIX MONTHS OLD.
       HE WATCHES HIS PARENTS AS THEY SAY GRACE.

       6) HELEN "SHOPS" FOR SUPPLIES IN THE LARGE STOREROOM.
       ADAM, ONE YEAR OLD, RIDES IN THE SHOPPING CART.(1963)

       7) CALVIN NETS A WIGGLING, FULLY GROWN FISH.

       8) THE FAMILY WATCHES "THE HONEYMOONERS" TOGETHER. (ADAM
       IS STILL ONE YEAR OLD.)

       CALVIN ENJOYS HIS PIPE IN THE LIVINGROOM

       9) CALVIN EXAMINES THE REAR HATCHWAY AS HELEN APPROACHES
       WITH ADAM IN HER ARMS.

                           HELEN (OC)
                 Calvin?!

                           CALVIN
                 Right here!

                           HELEN
                     (arriving)
                 We looked all over for you. What are
                 you doing back here?

                           CALVIN
                 Oh, I was just examining this rear
                 hatchway.

                           HELEN
                 Why?

                           CALVIN
                 No reason.
                 		(then, off her look)
                 Well, it's pretty clear that the front
                 entrance caved in when the bomb went
                 off. So, you know, when the time is
                 up, we'll have to return to the
                 surface using, you know, this back
                 entrance.  Which is very nice because
                 it has the service elevator!

                           HELEN
                 Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.

                           CALVIN
                 Yes.  Well... yes.

       A sober beat, then:

                           CALVIN (cont'd)
                 You wanted to see me?

       Helen nods vigorously.

                           HELEN
                 Watch this!

                           CALVIN
                 What?

       She sets Adam (one year old) down on his wobbly little
       legs, steadying him at the shoulders.

                           HELEN
                 Go to Daddy, Adam. Go to Daddy.

       And Adam takes his first step. And then another! And
       another! It's a joyous event.

       CAMERA LEAVES THEM AND TRAVELS UPWARD THROUGH THE CEILING
       AND THEN, AGAIN USING THE DEVICE OF A CUTAWAY, IT
       CONTINUES THROUGH DIRT AND SEDIMENT ALL THE WAY UP TO THE
       SURFACE-- WHERE THE BACKYARD AVOCADO TREES ARE BEING
       BULLDOZED AND THE BACK FENCE HAS ALREADY BEEN TORN DOWN.
       THE WEBBER HOUSE FACED A QUIET RESIDENTIAL STREET, BUT IT
       BACKED ONTO VICTORY AVENUE (OR ONE OF THOSE VALLEY
       AVENUES) AND IN THE LATE FIFTIES AND EARLY SIXTIES THOSE
       MAIN THOROUGHFARES WENT COMMERCIAL.

       A SIGN tells us that this is the future site of MOM'S
       MALT SHOP."

       Some WORKMEN with shovels have discovered the REAR
       SHELTER DOORS where they have been digging.



                           WORKMAN #1
                 Hey, Boss!

       The construction BOSS comes over for a look.

                           WORKMAN #1
                 What do you make of this?

                           BOSS
                 Damn if I know.

                           WORKMAN #2
                 I bet it's some kinda septic tank.

                           WORKMAN #1
                 I've never seen a septic tank that
                 looked like that.

                           BOSS
                 Well, don't fool with it. If it is a
                 septic tank, I sure as hell don't want
                 to open it. We'll just lay the
                 foundation over it.

                           WORKMAN #1
                 Okay.

       EXT. WEBBER HOUSE, PATIO (THE REAL ONE) - DAY, SAME TIME

       A Realtor steps out with A COUPLE looking to buy the
       house.

                           REALTOR
                 ...and since it's almost certain that
                 the Webbers were killed, the bank is
                 selling the house and that back parcel
                 over there that's been re-zoned
                 commercial. It's right there on the
                 avenue.

                           WOMAN BUYER
                 Is that where the plane crashed?

       She points out to a LEVEL LAWN where the shop used to be.
       We can see the Malt Shop construction crew beyond that.

                           REALTOR
                 Yep, right there.

                           MAN BUYER
                 This place gives me the willies.

                           REALTOR
                 Yeah, I know what you mean. But the
                 price is right.

       EXT. BACK AT THE MALT SHOP CONSTRUCTION SIGHT -
       CONTINUOUS, DAY

       The guy driving the heavy front loader lets the bucket
       slam to the ground hard.

       INT. BACK AT THE SHELTER REAR DOOR - CONTINUOUS

       Calvin vaguely hears the noise made by the front loader.

       INT. SHELTER, LIVING ROOM - EVENING (1965-66)

       SUPER: 1965

       Calvin smokes his pipe and enjoys a Manhattan cocktail as
       Adam (three and a half) sits in his lap reading the title
       page from Alice in Wonderland.

                           ADAM
                 Al ice in won der lan.

       Calvin smiles pridefully over at Helen who works
       intensely on the couch making a coffee-can Santa from
       instructions in the The Redbook Crafts Collection.

                           CALVIN
                 Not bad for a three and a half year
                 old! I'd like to see the public school
                 system match that! I don't care how
                 terrific it is!

                           HELEN
                 Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like
                 his father. But you know, Calvin,
                 maybe he's a little...young for
                 school.

                           CALVIN
                 Nonsense. People have no idea what the
                 human mind is capable of. Look at us!

       Helen ponders that statement.


                           ADAM
                     (pointing to the book's art
                      work)
                 Look, Daddy. Alice went down a hole,
                 just like us.

       Calvin smiles and messes up Adam's hair.

                           ADAM (cont'd)
                 Will I ever get to go up on top?

                           CALVIN
                 Yes, you certainly will. And you'll
                 find a nice girl and rebuild America.
                 Just the way it used to be.

                           HELEN
                 Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be
                 making promises that perhaps can't be
                 kept.

                           CALVIN
                 I believe there will be other
                 survivors. In fact, I'm guessing
                 there's life on the surface, even now.
                 It's not life worth living perhaps,
                 but believe me, something's moving
                 around up there. And I don't just mean
                 the cockroaches.

       They both look nervously up at the ceiling.

       EXT. MOM'S MALT SHOP (NOW FINISHED) - DAY (1965-66)

       CARS PASS BY on the busy avenue.

       INT. MOM'S MALT SHOP - CONTINUOUS

       CLEAN CUT SURFER KIDS are being served their favorite ice-
       cream and malt treats by MOM herself and a young SODA
       JERK. Appropriate music comes from the jukebox.

                           MOM
                 I'm going to need two more banana-
                 splits and a cherry coke!

                           SODA JERK
                 You bet, Mom! Coming up!

       Two YOUNG MEN IN BEATLE HAIRCUTS enter. Everyone looks at
       them in amazement. (Perhaps there is also a record change
       here.)

       INT. SHELTER, CLASSROOM - DAY (65-66)

       Calvin is building and furnishing a classroom from
       materials available to him. He has had the forethought to
       bring down the books needed for his child's education.
       Little Adam is watching him.

                           CALVIN
                     (to Adam)
                 Nothing in the world is more fun than
                 learning new things.

       INT. FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

       The family watches the same "Honeymooner" clip they
       watched before. Calvin still finds it funny. Helen
       wonders about that.

       INT. BEDROOM - LATER

       Helen is pouring cooking sherry into an empty Listerine
       bottle.

       EXT. MALT SHOP - DAY (1970-71)

       SUPER: 1970

       Other buildings have been constructed around the malt
       shop. Foot and car traffic are heavier.

       INT. MALT SHOP - SAME TIME

       The clean-cut kids have been replaced by FLOWER CHILDREN.
       Mom hasn't put a lot back into the decor, but she has
       made concessions to the fashions of the time. The jukebox
       plays something appropriate. Mom and the Jerk are five
       years older.

                           MOM
                 I can't tell the boys from the girls
                 anymore!

                           SODA JERK
                     (stoned)
                 Uh...yeah. It's like hard.

       Mom gives the Jerk a suspicious look.

       INT. SHELTER - DAY (1970-71)

       Calvin (40) is giving Adam (8) a boxing lesson. They work
       from a "How To" book and use gloves made from living room
       pillows. Adam's pretty good. Helen appears and watches
       with pride. Then she interupts.

                           HELEN
                 Boys! Excuse me, but I believe it's my
                 turn.
                     (holding out her hand)
                 Adam?

       He goes to her.

       INT. SHELTER - MINUTES LATER

       The hydroponic garden area is empty. A Perry Como song
       begins and Adam and Helen enter waltzing. Adam has
       changed shirts and combed his hair. Somewhere, Calvin is
       watching with pride. After a while Calvin cuts in. He and
       Helen dance beautifully. Then they kiss. Somewhere, Adam
       is watching with pride.

       INT. MALT SHOP - DAY (1975-76)

       SUPER: 1975

       The place continues its decline. Acid rock plays loudly.
       Mom and the Jerk serve the smallish crowd.

                           MOM
                 I miss those nice flower-power kids.
                 How 'bout you?

                           SODA JERK
                     (after studying her for some
                      time)
                 Um...uh...

       The acid rock song ends and an early, bad disco hit comes
       on the jukebox.

                           MOM
                 What the hell kind of music is that?!

       The Jerk puts his hands to his ears, he so hates the new
       music.

                           SODA JERK
                 Oh, man. I'm like not sure I like
                 that.



       INT. SHELTER, CLASSROOM  (1975-76)

       The room looks like Ricky Nelson's class.  There are twin
       pictures of Ike and JFK on the wall.  Adam is eleven.

                           CALVIN
                 This is what money looks like.  It
                 comes like this, in coin, or like this
                 in paper.  Or you can have an
                 "investment."  These are stock
                 "certificates" that we bought in your
                 name.  Of course, they're worthless
                 now, but at one time they were quite
                 valuable.

                           ADAM
                 They're pretty.  Can I have them?

                           CALVIN
                 Sure. Now, let's move on to our French
                 exam.

                           ADAM
                 Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.

                           CALVIN
                 You're right!  It's Tuesday already!
                 By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!

                           ADAM
                 Tempus fugit!

                           CALVIN
                 En arte voluptus.
                 Que les bons temps roulÈ!

                           ADAM

                           ADAM
                 Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!

                           CALVIN
                     (marveling)
                 You know, you have a wonderful sense
                 of humor, son!  I must say, the acorn
                 doesn't fall very far from the tree.
                 By the way, it's time I gave you
                 something. Come with me.

       Adam follows his dad out.

       INT. SHUFFLEBOARD COURT - CONTINUOUS

       They pass Helen who is absentmindedly poking at the puck
       with a stick. She's not having a very good day. She wears
       her hair dryer but it's not plugged in.

                           CALVIN
                 Hi, honey!

                           HELEN
                 Hi.

       INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

       Calvin hands Adam a cigar box. Adam opens it to see
       Calvin's remarkable baseball card collection.

                           ADAM
                 These are wonderful.

                           CALVIN
                 It's my entire baseball collection.
                 It's yours now.

                           ADAM
                 What's baseball?

                           CALVIN
                 It's a game, son. I can explain it
                 pretty easily. There's a pitcher.

                           ADAM
                 Like a painting?

                           CALVIN
                     (chuckling)
                 No, son. A pitcher.

                           ADAM
                 Like one of Mom's?

                           CALVIN
                 Uh, no. There's a man who throws the
                 ball -- to a man who has a bat.

                           ADAM
                 The nocturnal flying mammal?

                           CALVIN
                     (slightly pissed)
                 No. Sit down.

       They do.

       INT. SHELTER - NIGHT

       Start close on flashing roller skates. Then cut wider to
       show Adam roller skating. He passes Helen who has fallen
       asleep knitting in one of the lawn chairs. Then Adam
       passes Calvin who is on a ladder soldering a leaking
       ceiling pipe.

       EXT. MALT SHOP - DAY (1991)

       SUPER: 1991

       TWO PUNKS with spiked green hair enter to the strains of
       "My Sharona."


       INT. MALT SHOP - DAY (1991)

       Mom watches the punks enter. Then crosses to the Soda
       Jerk who now has a tattoo on his forehead.

                           MOM
                 I'm selling this place.  I want out of
                 this hell hole!

                           SODA JERK
                 Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...

                           MOM
                 Buy it from me?

                           SODA JERK
                 Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!

                           MOM
                 I'll give it to ya, no money down.
                 The neighborhood has gone to hell
                 anyway.

       She walks off.

                           SODA JERK
                 Cool.

       INT. KITCHEN  (1995)

       SUPER: 1995

       Helen has prepared a birthday cake. Having no birthday
       candles, she's used three votive candles. We can hear
       Calvin and Adam talking in the dining room. (She and
       Calvin are now in their 60's.)

                           CALVIN (OC)
                 No, no! The runner on second goes to
                 third! He's out there!

                           ADAM  (OC)
                 Why?

                           CALVIN (OC)
                 Because he's forced out at third! It's
                 a force!

                           ADAM  (OC)
                 Then why go there?

                           CALVIN  (OC)
                 Because he must!

                           HELEN
                 Calvin!

                           CALVIN  (OC)
                 Coming!

       Calvin enters.

                           CALVIN (cont'd)
                 Yes, dear?

                           HELEN
                 Get the presents and do the lights.

                           CALVIN
                 You bet.

       Calvin leaves while Helen lights the candles. The whole
       shelter goes dark. Calvin returns with two presents
       wrapped in whatever is available.

       INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS



       Helen and Calvin enter singing Happy Birthday. We see the
       ADULT ADAM for the first time in silhouette. His handsome
       face is revealed to us when the cake is placed before
       him.

                           ADAM
                 Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!

                           CALVIN
                 Blow out the candles!

                           HELEN
                 Make a wish!

       He does both. His parents clap. Helen takes one of the
       presents from Calvin and gives it to Adam. He unwraps it.
       It's a green coat.

                           ADAM
                 Oh, boy! A jacket!

                           CALVIN
                 Your mom made that all by herself.

                           ADAM
                 No kidding!

                           HELEN
                 No kidding.
                     (aside, to Calvin)
                 Who else would have done it?

                           CALVIN
                 And I made these!

       He gives Adam the second present. Adam tears off the
       paper to find a pair of roller-skates that Calvin has
       redesigned. The new skates look kind of like
       rollerblades.

                           ADAM
                 Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!

                           CALVIN
                 Your roller-skates! I redesigned them!
                 I think this new design will work even
                 better!

                           ADAM
                 These are really swell! I mean swell!

                           HELEN
                 What did you wish for, Adam?

                           CALVIN
                 If he tells, it won't come true!

                           HELEN
                 Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We
                 never believed that in my family!

                           CALVIN
                 Well, we did in my family!

                           ADAM
                 I wished I could meet a girl.

       His parents don't have a reply for that.

                           HELEN
                 Oh. A nice one, I hope.

                           ADAM
                 Yes, ma'am.

                           CALVIN
                 One who doesn't glow in the dark.

                           HELEN
                 Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!

                           CALVIN
                 Well, we'll be going up in two years.
                 We'll know then. I'm very hopeful.

                           ADAM
                     (ardently)
                 Me, too.

       His parents stare at him for a beat, then:

                           HELEN
                 Let's eat our cake.

                           CALVIN
                 Yeah. Let's dig in!

       They do.

                           HELEN
                 Elbows, Son.

                           ADAM
                 Sorry, Mom!

                           HELEN
                 You never know. You may someday dine
                 at the White House with the president.

                           CALVIN
                 If we still have one.

                           HELEN
                 Yes...

                           CALVIN
                 You know, when we do go up...I'm going
                 to miss this old place. How 'bout you,
                 hon?

                           HELEN
                     (after a beat)
                 Would you excuse me?

                           CALVIN
                 Sure.

       Helen rises and exits.

       INT. BATTERY ROOM- LATER, SAME NIGHT

       Helen enters and goes into the generator room. Through
       the glass we can see (and hear) her scream. Straightening
       her hair and feeling much better, she exits as Calvin
       strolls by wearing his tool belt. She's headed out.

                           CALVIN
                 In the generator room again?

                           HELEN
                 Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how
                 all    these things work.

                           CALVIN
                 I know exactly what you mean!
                     (then)
                 Hey, honey?

       She turns to him. He gives her his patented thumbs up
       sign.

                           CALVIN (cont'd)
                 Great cake!!

       She smiles wanely and leaves. He shuts the generator door
       she left open.

       SCENE 60 OMITTED



       SCENE 61 OMITTED

       INT.SHELTER, LIVING ROOM - VERY EARLY MORNING

       SUPER: THE PRESENT

       The room is quiet and empty.  The star-burst WALL CLOCK
       on the paneling says 6:15.

       INT. SHELTER, KITCHEN - SAME TIME

       Also empty.

       INT. STOREROOM - SAME TIME

       Also empty.  And with MEAGER SUPPLIES on the shelves.

       INT. POWER AND PUMP ROOM - SAME TIME

       The old pipes are rusted and patched. Some are leaking
       badly.

       INT. MASTER BEDROOM - SAME TIME

       Calvin wakes up. He looks over at Helen's bed.

       ANGLE - HELEN

       She wakes up. Then jumps out of bed.



       SCENE 67 OMITTED



       CLOSE ON THE RED METAL BOX

       that has been ticking on the wall for thirty-five years.
       Suddenly it STOPS TICKING and a rather annoying ALARM
       GOES OFF.  Calvin's hand reaches up and turns it off by
       throwing the lever up.

       ANOTHER ANGLE shows us the mechanism on the FRONT
       HATCHWAY switch to OPEN with a loud, vault-like move.

       ANOTHER ANGLE

       reveals the family in their pajamas standing in front of
       the front hatchway and red box.

                           ADAM
                 So...we just open this door and go up?



       Calvin grabs a handle and using all his strength, opens
       the front entrance hatch. And then must jump back when
       nothing but earth and rock pour into the room.

                           ADAM
                 Um...is that supposed to happen?

       His parents take a beat then race off like maniacs
       through the entire shelter to the back hatch door.  They
       knock over whatever gets in their way as they go. Adam
       follows.

                           ADAM
                 Hey, where are we going?!  Is
                 everything all right?!

       INT. BACK HATCHWAY - MOMENTS LATER

       Calvin and Helen arrive followed by Adam who can't
       possibly share his parent's deep concerns. Everyone is
       out of breath.

                           CALVIN
                 Should we say a little prayer first?

                           HELEN
                 Just open the door.

       Calvin attempts to open the big hatch, but can't.  Adam
       helps him.  Helen pitches in.  Slowly, with lots of
       squeaking, the DOOR OPENS. He steps through the hatch and
       flips a wall switch.  Red submarine LIGHTS COME ON....
       And the service elevator is intact.

       INT. ANTEROOM - CONTINUOUS

       Helen steps through and embraces Calvin joyfully.  The
       old folks break into a dance as Adam enters.

                           ADAM
                 Well, do we just go on up?!

                           CALVIN
                     (quickly back to business,
                      and way too dramatic)
                 No, son! We wait for night.  Now...is
                 precisely when... we must be at our...
                 most cautious.

                           HELEN
                     (barely a whisper, but
                      definitely tired of his
                      B.S.)
                 Oh, shit.

       Helen's eyes widen and her hand flies up to her mouth.
       She is just as shocked as Calvin.

                           CALVIN
                 Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have
                 been down here a little too long!
                     (to Adam)
                 Please excuse her French.

                           ADAM
                 Shit is a French word?

                           HELEN
                 Yes, yes it is!

                           CALVIN
                 It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly
                 meaning..."good".

                           HELEN
                 Yes! That's right!

                           ADAM
                 Oh.
                     (then)
                 Well...then...shit!

       There is a pause, then:

                           CALVIN
                 C'est bon, Monsieur.

                           ADAM
                 Merci!

       SCENE 71 OMITTED



       EXT. THE MALT SHOP - NIGHT

       Cars flash by in a rare L.A. DOWNPOUR.  All that's left
       of Mom's is an EMPTY BUILDING with a painted-out front
       window and a "For Sale or Rent" sign.  There's ANOTHER
       SHOP attached to it CAMERA RIGHT but we can't see what it
       is.  The alley way on the left has always been there.

       INT. MALT SHOP - CONTINUOUS

       TWO DRUNK BUMS are sharing a bottle. One of them is the
       Soda Jerk, now a  dissipated middle-aged man (with a
       tattoo on his forehead.)

                           SODA JERK
                 ...all of these things...Alcoholics
                 Anonymous...Cocaine Anonymous...Heroin
                 Anonymous.

                           OTHER BUM
                 There's a Heroin Anonymous?

                            SODA JERK
                 Shut up! All of these things... ask
                 you to believe in a power greater than
                 yourself! Some sort of God on High!
                 Well...I have lifted my eyes skyward a
                 time or two... and I have certainly
                 not seen anything coming from up there
                 except a goddamn airplane -- that I
                 can't afford to get on!

       The cement FLOOR of the old Malt Shop begins to QUIVER
       AND RUMBLE.

                           OTHER BUM
                 Earthquake!  Another earthquake!

                           SODA JERK
                 Let her come!  Let's get this over
                 with!  And please, if there is a God,
                 let it be worse in Bel Air!!

       The Other Bum staggers to his feet and SPLITS for a back
       window.  Soda Jerk is fearless.  Until finally the
       HYDRAULIC DOORS of the back entrance SPLIT THE FLOOR with
       an eerie, struggling whine and LARGE CHUNKS OF CEMENT GO
       FLYING.  Then up comes RED SUBMARINE LIGHT followed by
       Calvin in his BIG YELLOW SUIT with Geiger counter
       ticking.

                           SODA JERK
                 Oh, God!  Oh, God!!  Oh,God, save me!!
                 For I have seen the light!!

       Calvin raises his hand and yells through his mask.

                           CALVIN
                 I come in peace!!

       The Soda Jerk FAINTS. Calvin, sounding like a deep sea
       diver and having to walk like Frankenstein, goes over to
       the Soda Jerk and studies his face in the light of his
       flashlight.  He is horrified by what he sees.

                           CALVIN
                 My, gosh...

       Calvin looks around the room and heads for the back.  He
       moves his Geiger counter around and gets a quiet (safe)
       reading. Then he removes a KITCHEN MATCH from a plastic
       container and strikes it against the wall.  The MATCH
       BURNS, so Calvin takes off his hood and visor and
       breathes the air.  It stinks in there.

       EXT. MALT SHOP - MOMENTS LATER, RAINING

       Calvin (out of the head gear and top of the suit) slowly
       pushes the door open and steps out. He's surprised to
       find an empty BODY SHOP behind the Malt Shop, where the
       avocado trees should be.

                           CALVIN
                 Where is my backyard?

       He points his flashlight around and heads for the ALLEY
       to his left.

       EXT. ALLEY - A MOMENT LATER, RAINING

       DERELICT CARS left over from the Body Shop sit against a
       fence. Calvin marvels at the cars, even in their present
       condition.  In a TIGHTER SHOT he studies the chrome-
       plated word "Toyota."   A HOMELESS MAN arrives to search
       through the garbage. Calvin hurries back towards the
       avenue.

       SCENE 76 OMITTED

       EXT. MALT SHOP - TEN MINUTES LATER, RAIN

       Calvin emerges from the alley that separates the Malt
       Shop from another storefront (perhaps now a rundown Thai
       restaurant.)

       CLOSER ON HIM

       watching the cars fly by on the wet avenue.  Suddenly, a
       cross-dressing STREET WALKER steps up to him with a
       cigarette.

                           STREET WALKER
                 You got a light, honey?

                           CALVIN
                 What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a
                 light!

                           STREET WALKER
                 Good.

       Fumbling, he finally gets her little cigar lighted with
       one of his kitchen matches.

                           CALVIN
                 So...you...survived the blast, did
                 you?

                           STREET WALKER
                 The blast?  Honey, I have survived a
                 host of things. Like the song says: "A
                 country boy can survive!"

                           CALVIN
                 Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has
                 it been...hell up here?

                           STREET WALKER
                 "Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell
                 up here, down there and over yonder!
                 Hell everywhere.

                           CALVIN
                 Yes, I can tell that just looking
                 around.
                 		(then)
                 "Boy?"  Did you say you were a
                 "country boy?"

                           STREET WALKER
                 Cute Little Old Man, if you want a
                 boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want
                 a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be
                 anything you want me to be!

                           CALVIN
                 Really?

                           STREET WALKER
                 Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the
                 remarkably low price of only $200!
                 And if you act now, I might even throw
                 in some free lawn furniture.

                           CALVIN
                     (stumbling away from her)
                 No, I can't.  I'm sorry!  I have to
                 go!  I have to...

       He breaks into a trot, heading up the street past a seedy
       BAR (used to be the convenience store) just as a
       hopelessly DRUNK HAG of a woman is shoved out and told to
       stay out.  Calvin watches as the woman stumbles to the
       curb where she TOSSES her cookies.  TWO LOW RIDERS HOP BY
       full of TAUNTING YOUNG HISPANIC GANG MEMBERS, one of whom
       BRANDISHES A PISTOL and, just for fun, points it at
       Calvin.  When Calvin sees the pistol he ducks into the
       ADULT BOOKSTORE. The young gang member pulls the trigger
       and we (not Calvin) see that the realistic-looking pistol
       is really a water gun.

       INT. ADULT BOOK AND VIDEO STORE

       Calvin races in and, gathering himself, addresses the
       PAKISTANI MAN behind the counter.

                           CALVIN
                 Hello!  How are you this evening?!
                 Mind if I, you know, browse around?!

       The clerk just watches him.

                           CALVIN
                 Thank-Q very much!

       Then Calvin turns and has his first look at the
       material...and he GRABS HIS HEART and SCREAMS and FALLS
       back KNOCKING OVER a whole ROW OF VIDEOS AND MAGAZINES.

       INT. SHELTER, KITCHEN - AN HOUR LATER

       Calvin sits at the breakfast table, still breathing hard
       and holding his chest.  His family looks on with great
       concern.  The anti-radiation suit and gear is piled in
       the corner.

                           CALVIN
                 I'm going to give it to you straight.
                 There's no point in beating around the
                 bush. There were survivors.
                 Apparently,
                 the fallout has created....a
                 subspecies of mutants.

                           HELEN
                 Mutants?!

                           CALVIN
                 It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out
                 of garbage cans.  Others are...cover
                 your ears, Son, and hum.  I mean that
                 literally and I mean right now!

       ADAM covers his ears and hums.

                           CALVIN
                 Others are...multi-sexual.  It
                 seems...they can be both masculine and
                 feminine...simultaneously.

                           HELEN
                 No.

                           CALVIN
                 Yes.

                           HELEN
                 I don't believe it!

       Helen copes by moving around the kitchen doing things
       that don't need to be done.


                           CALVIN
                 Believe it. He tried to sell me his
                 body, Helen.
                 		(beat)
                 They offer lawn furniture as a come
                 on!

       She slumps, then resumes her needless activity.  Calvin
       takes Adam's arm and the son drops his hands and stops
       humming.

                           CALVIN
                 They've done a lot of re-building but
                 society, at least as we knew it, has
                 utterly collapsed. People throw up in
                 the streets. Others point guns.
                 There's something terribly wrong with
                 the automobiles and...and I...I can't
                 tell you the rest.  I just can't.

                           HELEN
                 Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So,
                 what do we do now?

                           CALVIN
                 We stay down here.

                           HELEN
                 We do?

                           CALVIN
                 Yes.

                           HELEN
                 Excuse me.

       She hurries into the living room.

       INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

       Helen let's out a silent scream, then hurries back into
       the kitchen.

       INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS



                           HELEN
                 For how long?  We've just about run
                 out of everything!

                           CALVIN
                 We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion
                 that these mutants will eventually
                 kill each other off and then--

                           HELEN
                     (rising)
                 No, Calvin.  We're not going to make
                 do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going
                 up no matter what!  We deserve it.
                 Even if it's terrible!

                           CALVIN
                 Well, I am the head of this household--

                           HELEN
                 I want him to at least see the sky!

                           CALVIN
                 --and we will--

                           HELEN
                 And the ocean!  A mountain range!

                           CALVIN
                 --do as I say!

       Breathing heavily, Calvin suddenly clutches at his chest
       in great pain and collapses.

                           ADAM
                 Dad!

                           HELEN
                 Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get
                 him into the bedroom.

       INT. HALLWAY - HOURS LATER

       Adam paces.  Then Helen comes out.  Behind her, we can
       see Calvin sleeping in his bed. She heads for the living
       room. He follows.

                           HELEN
                 He seems to be doing all right now.  I
                 don't know if he's had a heart attack
                 or just... a horrifying experience.
                 But we  need supplies and I've got to
                 stay with him.

                           ADAM
                 I'll go up.

       They go through the living room and cross to the patio.

                           HELEN
                 I'm afraid you've got to.

                           ADAM
                 I'll be all right.

                           HELEN
                     (patting his cheek)
                 You're my brave boy.



       Helen hands him a pencil and pad. Adam follows her to the
       fish farm.

                           HELEN
                 Just act normal.  If anybody asks,
                 simply say you're from out-of-town,
                 and that you're in town on business.
                 Write that down.

       He does.

                           HELEN (cont'd)
                 I'm going to give you a shopping list
                 and some money.  We need just enough
                 things to get us through the next year
                 or two.  And you'll find most of these
                 items at what used to be called a
                 grocery store or a hardware store.
                 Write that down.

                           ADAM
                 Yes, ma'am.

       At the fish tank, Helen pulls up a slim chain that is
       attached to a water-tight aluminum box which she quickly
       opens. The box contains $6,000 in wrapped one hundred
       dollar bills. Helen takes half of it.

                           HELEN
                 I don't know how far you'll have to
                 travel to find supplies, but if you
                 can't get home by nightfall, I want
                 you to look for something called a
                 Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a
                 hotel. There might still be one
                 standing.

                           ADAM
                 Yes, ma'am.


                           HELEN
                 Let's get you packed.

       She heads back for the house. He follows.

                           ADAM
                 Right.

                           HELEN
                     (indicating money)
                 I just hope this is still good up
                 there.

                           ADAM
                 Mom?


                           HELEN
                 Yes?

                           ADAM
                 I was thinking that, uh...you know,
                 while I was up there and all...that
                 maybe I could, you know...try to meet
                 a girl.  I've, been thinking about
                 that a little...just these
                 last...fifteen years or so.

       They have stopped by the garden.


                           HELEN
                 Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if
                 you could find a girl. One who's not a
                 mutant...and hopefully comes from
                 Pasadena. Nothing against Valley
                 girls,
                 but in my day anyhow, the girls from
                 Pasadena, I don't know...always just
                 seemed a little nicer.

                           ADAM
                 Yes, ma'am.

       They hug.

                           HELEN
                 Oh, there's also a thing called a
                 liquor store. Write that down.

       INT. ADAM'S ROOM - AN HOUR LATER

       He is packing. He looks at his cigar box and opens it. He
       studies the contents: The Cards, stock certificates, and
       an old photo of his parents. He decides to pack the box.
       Helen enters with a long shopping list.

                           HELEN
                 Here's the shopping list and $3,000
                 which should take care of everything.

                           ADAM
                 Yes, ma'am.

                           HELEN
                 Your father has a few final words for
                 you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw
                 for you - he loves you so much. We
                 both do.

                           ADAM
                 Heck, I know that mom! You're my
                 parents.

       INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

       Adam sets down his suitcase and goes to his father's bed.
       He sits. At the door, Helen dries her eyes with her
       apron.  Calvin indicates that he wants to whisper to
       Adam, who drops his ear close to his father's lips.

                           CALVIN
                 Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...

                           ADAM
                 Yes, father?! Yes?

                           CALVIN
                 ...the pipe tobacco.

                           ADAM
                 Yes, sir.  Is that all?

       Calvin nods. Adam rises and starts for the door. But
       Calvin remembers something and beckons him back to speak
       weakly into his son's ear.

                           CALVIN
                 Also...stay out of the "Adult
                 Bookstore."

                           ADAM
                 Adult Bookstore.  Why?

                           CALVIN
                 Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.

                           ADAM
                 I promise. Is that all?

                           CALVIN
                 One more thing. If you find a healthy
                 young woman, bring her back with you.

                           ADAM
                 I'll try.

       And then Calvin closes his eyes and sleeps.

       INT. MALT SHOP - SAME DAY

       The Soda Jerk has turned the rear exit into a religious
       shrine.  He's put flowers and candles and costume jewelry
       and religious icons (from all the Majors) on top of and
       around the broken cement.  Currently he's on his knees,
       rocking back and forth as he prays.

       And,lo! There came a rumbling even as from the very
       bowels of the earth and a great light showed forth
       followed by gates of armor which opened and shut and
       delivered up the vision of a young man whose countenance
       caused the Soda Jerk to be struck dumb and to fall on his
       face and to weep in fear.  And, Adam, taking pity on the
       man, put down his suitcase, and went to him, saying:

                           ADAM
                 Are you all right?

                           SODA JERK
                 Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes!
                 But  where is the one who came last
                 night -- all in yellow?!

                           ADAM
                 All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my
                 father!

                           SODA JERK
                 Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father!
                 Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for
                 my wasted life?!  Everything has been
                 so awful!!

                           ADAM
                     (comforting him)
                 I know it has been terrible.  But it
                 wasn't your fault. And now all the
                 decay is over with and things are
                 going to get better. You understand?

                           SODA JERK
                 Yes.

                           ADAM
                 I've got to go, now.

                           SODA JERK
                 Of course you do.  I'll stay here and
                 pray.

                           ADAM
                     (picking up his suitcase)
                 That's always a good idea! Would you
                 like some money? I have a great deal
                 of it.

                           SODA JERK
                 No. I don't need money anymore -- I
                 see that now.

                           ADAM
                 How do I leave here?

                           SODA JERK
                 The front door is open.  Will you be
                 back?

                           ADAM
                 I promise.

       Adam turns and leaves. The Soda Jerk falls to his knees
       and shakes all over.

       EXT. MALT SHOP - CONTINUOUS

       Adam steps out onto the sidewalk and sunlight falls on
       him much brighter than anything he has ever seen.  He
       looks at it on the arm of his coat and then, slowly, he
       looks up at the sky.

       INTERCUT - LOVELY CLOUDS AND BLUE SKY

       And now it is Adam who is dumbstruck. BYSTANDER #1
       appears and sees Adam looking up.

                           BYSTANDER #1
                 What?  What is it?!

                           ADAM
                 The sky!!!

                           BYSTANDER #1
                 The sky?  Where?

                           ADAM
                     (pointing)
                 Up there!!

                           BYSTANDER #1
                 I don't see anything!

                           ADAM
                 Just look!!

       Adam becomes momentarily interested in a parking meter.

       A MOTHER and her CHILD approach from the other direction.

                           WOMAN
                 What is it!

                           BYSTANDER #1
                     (pointing)
                 He sees something.

                           MOTHER
                 What?

                           CHILD
                 I see it, mommy!

                           BYSTANDER #2
                 Where?!


       Several more people are drawn over. A CONVERTIBLE goes by
       in the foreground with passengers who are looking up.

                           WOMAN
                 What is it?

                           ADAM
                 I have never in my life seen anything
                 like this!!!! Nothing even comes
                 close!!

       Adam continues down the sidewalk,looking up. A BLACK
       WOMAN POSTAL WORKER passes by.

                           POSTAL WORKER
                 Whatcha looking at?

                           ADAM
                 Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!

                           POSTAL WORKER
                     (with attitude)
                 Say what?!

                           ADAM
                     (offering his hand)
                 How do you do, ma'am.

                           POSTAL WORKER
                     (leary, but taking his hand)
                 I do alright.

                           ADAM
                 Good!

       The Pakistani exits the Adult Bookstore.


                           PAKISTANI
                 What is it?!  What do you see?!

       When Adam looks down to answer the man he sees the "Adult
       Bookstore" sign.

                           ADAM
                 Oh, no!

                           PAKISTANI
                 What?!

                           ADAM
                 Poisonous gas!!  Run for your life,
                 it's invisible poisonous gas!!!

       And everyone does run away, including Adam. The avenue is
       left totally deserted.



       INT. KITCHEN NOOK - SAME DAY

       Helen sits sipping tea, deep in thoughts of concern for
       Adam. Behind her Calvin appears in the open window.

                           CALVIN
                 You know--

       Helen is so startled she knocks the tea all over the
       place.

                           CALVIN (cont'd)
                 I just wanted to say that I think he's
                 going to be just fine.

                           HELEN
                     (holding her heart)
                 Thank you, Calvin. Thank you very
                 much.

       Calvin leaves, then comes back.

                           CALVIN
                 He's smart.

                           HELEN
                 Yes, dear, I know.



       SCENE 85A OMITTED


       EXT. CORNER BUS STOP - AFTERNOON, SAME DAY

       An L.A. bus comes directly at CAMERA.



       ANGLE - THE DRIVER

       is startled. He reacts.

       ANGLE - DRIVER'S FOOT

       slamming down the brake pedal.

       ANGLE - ADAM

       in profile. The braking bus stops an inch from his nose.
       Adam smiles. (Have him head for bus door in this angle.)

       ANGLE - THE DRIVER

       from over Adam. He is in shock.



       INT. BUS - A MOMENT LATER

       Start on a MOVING STEADY CAM SHOT on Adam's POV of bus
       passengers as he heads for a seat. The passengers look at
       him in amazement and some fear.

       ANGLE - ADAM

       going to his seat; smiling at the passengers. (He is
       carrying a $100 bill.)

                           ADAM
                 Hello! Hi. Good afternoon! Howdy.

       Adam finds a seat next to a heavily perspiring young
       PSYCHO HEROIN ADDICT.

       ANOTHER ANGLE OF THEM

       Adam shows the Psycho the $100 bill.

                           ADAM
                 I tried to give the driver this but he
                 wouldn't take it. He seems angry. A
                 lot of people do.

       The bus pulls out. It gets up to about twenty miles an
       hour.

                           ADAM (cont'd)
                 Oh, boy! Here we go! We're moving!
                 Wow.

       INTERCUT: PASSENGERS

       looking back at Adam with concern.

                           ADAM (CONT'D)

                 So this is public transportation. My
                 Dad says that it becomes more and more
                 important because of pollution --
                 which is more and more carbon dioxide
                 and other hazardous gases in the air.
                     (then, confidentially)
                 Do you have a gun, by the way?

       The increasingly nervous Psycho looks around, then nods
       that he does.

                           ADAM (cont'd)
                 Well, thanks for not waving it around.
                 And for not vomitting, for that
                 matter. Wow, we're really flying. Say,
                 do you know where I could find a
                 grocery store?

       The psycho shakes his head.

                           ADAM (cont'd)
                 I have to find that. And a hardware
                 store  and a liquour store and a
                 standing Holiday Inn. Although, I may
                 not need the Holiday Inn. That's still
                 kind of up in the air. It depends
                 really on how things go.

                           PSYCHO
                     (pointing)
                 There's a grocery store coming up.

                           ADAM
                 Thank-Q!
                     (jumping up)
                 Driver! Please stop the bus
                 immediately! I have to get off!
                     (then an aside to the psycho)
                 Do you think I should get a gun?

                           PSYCHO
                 I don't know...maybe.

                           ADAM
                     (back to driver)
                 Driver! Please stop, sir!

       INTERCUT - DRIVER IN THE REAR VIEW

       He's not going to stop until he wants to stop.

       ANGLE - OLD JEWISH COUPLE PASSENGERS.

       who are anxious for Adam to leave.

                           OLD JEWISH MAN
                 For the love of God! Let him off the
                 bus!! Can't you see he's meshugina!

       Adam leans in close to the OLD MAN.

                           ADAM
                 I'm sorry, what did you call me?

       The man and his wife take that the wrong way and start to
       scream.

       ANGLE - THE DRIVER'S FOOT

       hitting the brakes.

       EXT.- BUS

       stopping suddenly. Through the windows we see Adam go
       down.

       INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS

       The back door opens as Adam gets up.

                           ADAM
                 Thank you, driver! Good-bye, everyone!

       Adam exits the bus. Everyone, including the Psycho,
       heaves a huge sign of relief.

       INT. SUPER MARKET - MINUTES LATER

       Adam enters and (after getting over the automatic doors
       and the check-out technology) is overwhelmed by the
       magnificence of the postmodern California supermarket.
       The check-out counters alone are amazing. Seeing others
       do it, he takes a cart, placing his suitcase in it.

       INT. BAKERY COUNTER

       Adam passes the baked goods, paying particular attention
       to the elaborate birthday cakes.

                           ADAM
                 Is that a birthday cake?!

                           CLERK
                 Yes, it is.

                           ADAM
                 Gee-ma-nee!

       Adam leaves. The clerk turns to a fellow worker.

                           CLERK
                 Bakersfield.

       INT. AISLE

       Adam marvels at the abundance and variety. He passes a
       mother whose child is riding in the cart and that reminds
       him of his own mom -- when she used to let him ride that
       way.  Then he is surprised to see a MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE so
       casually dressed in public. She (overweight) is in an
       unfortunate terrycloth halter-shorts combination.  He
       (hirsute) is in a sleeveless undershirt and baggy bathing
       trunks.

                           ADAM
                     (to himself)
                 My first mutants.

       INT. FRESH PRODUCE

       Adam picks up one of those huge California cucumbers that
       always amaze Easterners.  He shows it to the JAPANESE-
       AMERICAN CLERK.

                           ADAM
                 Is this because of the radiation?

                           CLERK
                 What?

                           ADAM
                 Nothing.

       INT. MEAT COUNTER

       Adam is looking at the live lobsters as a BUTCHER steps
       up.

                           BUTCHER
                 Help you?

                           ADAM
                 Yes, please.
                     (consulting his Mom's list)
                 I'm looking for all beef patties.



                           BUTCHER
                 Fresh or frozen?

       Adam chuckles because he thinks the man is kidding.

                           ADAM
                 Come on. Frozen. How much are they?

                           BUTCHER
                 Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in
                 the three pound box.

                           ADAM
                 Then I'll need, twelve into nine
                 hundred, seventy-five boxes. And
                 that's almost...five hundred dollars
                 just for the hamburger! And my Mom
                 only gave me three thousand dollars
                 for everything! The yacht batteries!
                 The diesel oil! The birthday candles!

                           BUTCHER
                 You could have a meat order that big
                 delivered to your home.

                           ADAM

                 Really?!

                           BUTCHER
                 Sure.

                           ADAM
                 Well, that's great then!
                 Terrific...except...it just occurred
                 to me. I don't know where I live! I'm
                 lost! I don't know where home is!
                     (then)
                 Would you excuse me?

                           BUTCHER
                 Gladly.

       Adam hurries away.



       SCENE 93 OMITTED

       SCENE 94 OMITTED



       A MONTAGE

       of Adam on another bus. He looks frantically out the
       window. We see his POV of shops and stores and people. At
       one point he sees two women joggers which he wonders
       about. Then he sees two men arguing violently. Gradually
       late day turns to night and Adam becomes more and more
       depressed. Then he sees something. He is elated. He jumps
       up and tells the driver:

                           ADAM
                 Driver! Stop this bus immediately!
                 Please sir!!

       EXT. - VENTURA BLVD - NIGHT

       The bus stops mid-block and Adam gets off. He crosses the
       street causing only one car to hit the brakes. On the
       other side of the avenue we see what has gotten his
       attention. It's an ADULT BOOKSTORE much like the last one
       we saw (probably owned by the same chain.) He's happy but
       when he looks next door he sees he's in a different
       place. Sad and lost he turns north and starts to walk
       until -- a billboard catches his attention. We pan up to
       see a billboard for liposuction that features an almost
       NUDE WOMAN. Adam is struck by the image and we spend some
       time cutting between him and it. Then gathering himself
       he turns and begins to walk south.

       ANOTHER ANGLE

       of him as he passes a BODY PIERCING STORE and wonders
       about that. Then he sees something that blows his mind.

       WIDER ANGLE

       of a STRAY DOG passing by. Adam reacts.

                           ADAM
                 Oh my. Oh, my goodness gracious! Oh,
                 my...Oh. That is so great!! Man alive!

       ANGLE - CU OF BASEBALL CARDS STORE WINDOW



       A sign says: COMIC BOOKS & BASEBALL CARDS BOUGHT, SOLD &
       TRADED.

       INT. CARD AND COMIC STORE - MOMENTS LATER

       Adam enters with his suitcase in one hand and his cigar
       box in the other.  He steps up to the counter where the
       owner (JERRY) sits reading the newspaper. He has a
       fondness for Navajo jewelry.

                           ADAM
                 Hello.

                           JERRY
                     (gives him a look, then goes
                      back to reading)
                 Hi.

       A YOUNG WOMAN enters from the back of the store and goes
       to another counter.  Neither man notices.

                           ADAM
                 The name is Adam Webber and I see you
                 buy baseball cards and although these
                 are a lot older than the ones in the
                 window, I was hoping you still might
                 be interested.

       He flips open the cigar box to reveal to Jerry riches
       beyond his wildest dreams.  Jerry actually moans and then
       must pretend the moan was a cough.

                           JERRY
                 How--how much do you want for the
                 Mickey Mantle, rookie season?

                           ADAM
                 I was thinking of selling all the
                 cards.

                           JERRY
                 Really? No kidding?

       He reaches in and looks through the cards.

                           ADAM
                 See, my problem is, all I have are
                 hundred dollar bills and I need
                 something smaller.  Ones, fives, tens.
                 Like that.

                           JERRY
                 I see what ya mean. Tell you
                 what...I'll give you five hundred
                 dollars in small bills for the whole
                 box.

                           ADAM
                 Oh, that would be wonderful!

                           JERRY
                 Well, we're here to help!

       A woman steps into the shot. She has come from the back
       of the store and her back is momentarily to us.

                           EVE (OC)
                 Oh, shit!

       Adam turns to her and is immediately awe struck. We
       reveal EVE RUSTOKOV. She tosses her lipstick into her
       purse. Eve works in the card shop and is on her way out.


                           JERRY
                 I'm workin' here, Evey-poo.  Don't
                 screw me up.


                           ADAM
                 Bon soir, mademoiselle!

                           EVE
                 Are you French?

                           ADAM
                 No.
                     (then, thinking fast)
                 I'm from out of town.
                     (then sensing the need for
                      further clarification)
                 I'm here on business.

                           EVE
                 Well, your business must not be sports
                 memorabilia, because this one Mantle
                 card right here--
                     (holds up a card)
                 --is worth six thousand dollars all by
                 its little self.


                           ADAM
                 Get out of here!

                           EVE
                 No, you get out of here.

       She closes his cigar box and gives it to him.




                           JERRY
                 Terrific...you're fired! You know
                 that?!



                           EVE
                 No, ferry--excuse me, Jerry, I quit.

       She walks back to the counter to get her coat.

                           JERRY
                 Oh, no! I fired ya! Just like the hair
                 salon guy and the Chevy dealer!  You
                 know why you can't keep a goddamn
                 job?!  Because you can't keep your
                 goddamn mouth shut!  That's why!

       Jerry is surprised when Adam suddenly takes his arm
       firmly.

                           ADAM
                 Sir? I would really appreciate it if
                 you wouldn't take the Lord's name in
                 vain again.

                           JERRY
                     (looking at Adam's hand)
                 Oh, you got a problem with that?


                           ADAM
                 I have a big problem with that.

       Eve sees a fist fight coming. She takes Adam by the arm.



                           EVE
                 Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to
                 the corner.

                           ADAM
                 Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.



                           EVE
                 Just come on.

       They head for the door and exit.

                           JERRY
                 Hah!  Adam and Eve!  The perfect
                 match!  I hope you two will be very
                 happy together!  Mazel-fuckin'-tov!
                 Don't try coming back, Ms. Big Shot!
                 I'm serious this time! You're finished
                 in the hobby business! Take that to
                 the bank, why don'tcha!

       Adam re-enters.

                           ADAM
                 I didn't want to leave without saying
                 how much I admire your jewelry.

                           JERRY
                 Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your
                 butt?

       Adam walks towards the man smiling.

                           ADAM
                 How 'bout you what?

       Jerry takes a nervous step backwards, but Eve steps back
       in and pulls Adam out.

                           EVE
                 I said come on!



       Adam exits. Jerry doesn't know what to say.

       EXT. CARD STORE - NIGHT

       They exit the store.

                           ADAM
                 Where are we going?

                           EVE
                 We? I'm going home. And, judging by
                 that coat, I'd say you have to get
                 back to the barber college.

                           ADAM
                 No, I'm lost.

                           EVE
                 You're lost?

                           ADAM
                 Say,...did you just lose your job
                 because of me?

                           EVE
                 Forget it.  I'm sick of working for
                 that dickhead.

                           ADAM
                 Dickhead?

                           EVE
                 A walking penis capable of intelligent
                 speech.  A dickhead.

       A mental picture of that causes Adam to slump against a
       store window and drop his box of cards.

                           EVE
                 What's wrong with you?

                           ADAM
                 I just had a mental picture of...

                           EVE
                 Here, pick these up!

       Together they pick up the cards.

                           EVE (cont'd)
                 Where are you parked?

                           ADAM
                 I came on a bus.

                           EVE
                 Why doesn't that surprise me?

                           ADAM
                 I don't know. Why doesn't it?

       They rise.

                           EVE
                 Well, I guess because I'm a little
                 psychic...I have this thing.

                           ADAM
                 Oh, that's nice.

                           EVE
                 Let me guess something. This is your
                 first visit to La La Land. You're
                 staying somewhere over in Hollywood
                 because, like an idiot, you thought
                 that would be an exciting place to
                 stay.  Right so far?



                           ADAM
                     (could be a question, could
                      be an answer.)
                 So far?

                           EVE
                 Yes, I'm right?

                           ADAM
                 Right.

                           EVE
                 I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus
                 and before you know it, you're out
                 here in the San Fernando Valley
                 without a clue.  Which brings us to
                 here.  Correct again?

                           ADAM
                 Again.

                           EVE
                 Where are you staying? The Holiday
                 Inn?

                           ADAM
                 Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's
                 exactly right!

                           EVE
                 See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but
                 pretty much. That was pretty good,
                 wasn't it?!

                           ADAM
                 It was amazing.

                           EVE
                 Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a
                 bus for you to get on.

                           ADAM
                 Do you own a car?

                           EVE
                 I'm not taking you there, Sweetie.
                 Rule Number One in North America: No
                 strangers in the car.

                           ADAM
                 If it will make you feel any better, I
                 don't have a gun.

                           EVE
                 You don't?

                           ADAM
                 Nope.

                           EVE
                 Well, that changes everything. Get the
                 fuck away from me!!  I mean it!!

       She races around the corner.  He goes after her.

                           ADAM
                 I'm sorry!  I said something wrong,
                 didn't I!  Please forgive me!

                           EVE
                 Get away from me!!

       She runs into a parking lot.  He follows.

                           ADAM
                 Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal
                 with you!  I'll give you a Rogers
                 Hornsby, if you'll take me to the
                 hotel!

                           EVE
                 Rogers Hornsby?!?

                           ADAM
                 He's all yours. I was holding him
                 back.

       Adam takes a Hornsby card from his coat pocket and shows
       it to her.

                           EVE
                 Rogers Hornsby's worth like four
                 thousand dollars!

                           ADAM
                 So what?!  I've got two of him!
                 		(removing more cards from his
                 		 pocket)
                 And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons.
                 I was holding these out, too.

       She arrives at her car (dirty GEO) and anxiously unlocks
       the driver's door.

                           EVE
                 So for four thousand dollars, all I
                 have to do is drive you to your hotel?

                           ADAM
                 Yes.

                           EVE
                 And that's it?

                           ADAM
                 Yes.

                           EVE
                 I don't have to take a physical in
                 your space ship?

                           ADAM
                 Heck, no!  What?!

                           EVE
                 Okay.  What the hell?  You got a deal.
                 Get in.

       She gets in. He gets in the back seat behind her.

                           EVE (cont'd)
                 The front seat!

       He runs around to the front while Eve chats with herself.

                           EVE (cont'd)
                 Why am I doing this? What in the hell
                 is wrong with me? That's what I'd like
                 to know.



       SCENE 99 OMITTED



       EXT. HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - MINUTES LATER

       Traffic is moving at fifteen miles an hour. The dash
       lights fascinate him but the car scares him.  She notices
       that he is gripping the seat belt for dear life.

                           EVE
                 So...Mister Andretti, your first time
                 on the freeway?

                           ADAM
                 It's Webber.  Adam Webber.

                           EVE
                 Mind if I change the station?
                 Better traffic reports on AM.

       She switches over to AM and runs by a Perry Como record,
       "Round and Round", looking for traffic.

                           ADAM
                 Wait!  Wait!

                           EVE
                 What is it?!

                           ADAM
                 It's Perry!

                           EVE
                 Perry?

                           ADAM
                 Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back!
                 Go back!

                           EVE
                 Okay, okay!  Take it easy!

       She gets Perry.

                           EVE
                 How's that?

                           ADAM
                     (star-struck)
                 Oh, I could die...

                           EVE
                 Over this?

                           ADAM
                 Yeah! Listen to this part. This is
                 where it really takes off!

                           EVE
                 You are one scary son-of-a-gun.




       EXT. FREEWAY

       Eve's car splits for the exit ramp.

       INT. EVE'S CAR

       The sudden speed scares Adam.

                           ADAM
                 Hey, what are you doing?!

                           EVE
                 I know a short-cut.

       EXT. OFF RAMP

       She comes off, catches the light and whips onto the
       surface street, tires squealing.

       INT. CAR

       Adam is hanging onto his seat belt. Eve puts the pedal to
       the metal.

                           ADAM
                 Gee-zooie!!  You better slow down!!!

                           EVE
                 I can't help it. Perry Como always
                 does this to me! I just get so
                 cranked!

       She turns Perry way up.

       EXT. AVENUE

       Eve does a dandy job of trading lanes and passing.  The
       little Geo's engine screams. Adam's sort of getting into
       it.

       EXT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - TEN MINUTES LATER

       The Geo flies up to a quick stop.

       INT. CAR

       Eve turns to Adam, who has had A Life Experience.

                           EVE
                 Card, please.  End of service.

       He hands over the card like someone in a post-sex stupor.

                           ADAM
                 That was...wonderful!  I've never felt
                 anything like that in my life.

                           EVE
                 Yeah, same here. Don't forget your
                 suitcase.

                           ADAM
                 Right.

       He gets out with the suitcase, and after shutting the
       door leans down to speak to her.

                           ADAM
                 You know--

       She tears off, leaving him there.

       INT. HOTEL REGISTRATION - MINUTES LATER

       Adam addresses the clerk.

                           ADAM
                 Good evening. I want to stay at this
                 hotel.

                           CLERK
                 Fill this out please. And I'll need a
                 card.

                           ADAM
                 A card?

                           CLERK
                 Yes, sir.

                           ADAM
                 Of course!

       Adam gives him a baseball card.

       INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER SAME NIGHT

       A BELLBOY ushers Adam in and sets down his bag.

                           BELLBOY
                 Bathroom's there, TV's over there.
                 Remote's on top. Room Service menu is
                 on the table.

       Adam picks up the phone and listens.


                           BELLBOY (CONT'D)
                 You dial nine to get out.

                           ADAM
                     (beat, then)
                 Of what?

                           BELLBOY
                     (beat, then)
                 The hotel.

                           ADAM
                     (beat, then he hangs up)
                 I see.  Well, thank you very much.
                 You've been very, very nice.

       He offers two dollars.

                           ADAM (cont'd)
                 I was able to get some change
                 downstairs and my father taught me
                 that it's customary to tip in a
                 situation such as this.

                           BELLBOY
                 Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.

                           ADAM
                 My father is a genius.

                           BELLBOY
                 No kiddin'. Well...good night.

                           ADAM
                 Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let
                 the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom
                 always says...
                 		(choking up)
                 ...who I'm really beginning to miss.
                 I'm sorry.  It's my first night away
                 from home.

                           BELLBOY
                 How old are you?

                           ADAM
                 Thirty-five.

                           BELLBOY
                 You don't look thirty-five.

                           ADAM
                 How old do I look?

                           BELLBOY
                 Twenty-five? Around there.

                           ADAM
                 I guess living up here makes people
                 look older.

                           BELLBOY
                 Up here on the fifteenth floor?

                           ADAM
                     (catching himself)
                 Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor.
                 Goodnight.

                           BELLBOY
                 Goodnight.

       Adam abruptly shuts the door in the man's face.
       He goes to the window and looks out. The height scares
       him to death. He jumps back.



       INT. SHELTER, DINNER TABLE - SAME TIME

       Adam's parents pray.

                           CALVIN
                 And Lord we ask finally that you send
                 an angel to look after and protect our
                 beloved son, Adam.  Amen.

                           HELEN
                 Amen.

       She begins to tear up and he pats her hand.

       INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAWN

       Adam sits by the window watching his first dawn.

       EXT. HOLIDAY INN - MORNING

       It's another bright, smoggy day.  And here comes Eve,
       marching from the parking garage to the hotel entrance.

                           EVE
                     (skyward)
                 What in the hell am I doing here?!
                 That's what I'd like to know! Somebody
                 tell me that.

       INT. FRONT DESK - MOMENTS LATER

       Eve is speaking to a DESK CLERK.

                           DESK CLERK
                 You don't have a last name?

                           EVE
                 All I know is that his first name is
                 Adam.  No!  Adam Webber!  That's it.

       INT. ADAM'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

       He is seated on the bed, transfixed, watching a
       television commercial.The PHONE RINGS loudly.  Adam
       nearly jumps out of his skin.  After he figures out where
       the ringing is coming from, he answers the phone.

                           ADAM
                     (into phone, after a long
                      pause)
                 Yes?

       INT. LOBBY

       At the house phone.

                           EVE
                     (into phone)
                 Hi. This is the woman from the
                 baseball card store.  Remember me?

       INT. ADAM'S ROOM

       Boy, is he glad to hear from her!

                           ADAM
                 Yes!  Hello!  Hi!  Hot-diggity-dog!
                 Thank you for calling me on the
                 telephone!!

       INT. LOBBY

       Eve holds the receiver away from her for a moment.

                           EVE
                 Good grief. Hey listen, I'm in the
                 lobby.
                     (pause, then)
                 On the first floor! Where the hell
                 else would it be?


       INT. LOBBY, ELEVATORS - MOMENTS LATER

       The doors open and Adam hurries out, looking for Eve, who
       he sees and goes directly to, smiling all the while like
       a rumpled idiot.

                           ADAM
                 I am so glad to see you!!  I thought
                 I'd never see you again!

                           EVE
                 Okay, down boy. (holds up the baseball
                 card) I can't take this for driving
                 you home. I wish I could, but I can't.
                 So here, take it back. I could have
                 just left it for you at the desk, but
                 it's very valuable. Now take it.

                           ADAM
                 I can't, it's yours.

                           EVE
                 Take it. damn it!

                           ADAM
                     (with hand over his mouth)
                 Okay.

       He takes the card.

                           EVE
                 Why are you doing that?

                           ADAM
                 I haven't brushed yet.

                           EVE
                 Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your
                 visit.


       She heads for the front door.  He goes after her.

                           ADAM
                 Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.

                           EVE
                 Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!

       EXT. HOTEL - DAY

       They exit.

                           EVE
                 I knew this would happen!  You're like
                 a lost puppy!

                           ADAM
                 Can't you please just talk to me for
                 one second?

                           EVE
                 Okay!  Damn!

       She stops, he stops.

                           EVE (CONT'D)
                 I should have taken the money and run!
                 That's what Troy told me to do!  But
                 do I listen?  No! Put your hand down!

       He does.

                           ADAM
                 Troy? Is he your husband? Or a
                 boyfriend?

                           EVE
                 No.

                           ADAM
                     (eyes to heaven)
                 Thank-Q!

                           EVE
                 Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know
                 you like me.  I can tell. But you know
                 what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me,
                 exactly. It's more like the legs or
                 the butt or the hair.  Or some
                 combination of the above.

                           ADAM
                 I think it's the eyes.

                           EVE
                 The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow,
                 it never works out.  Okay?  Not that
                 you even need to know that!  You look
                 like crap, by the way.  What have you
                 been doing?

                           ADAM
                 Watching television in color.

                           EVE
                 Hey, no kidding?  In color?

                           ADAM
                 Cross my heart and hope to die.

       She looks at him for a beat or two, then abruptly turns
       away.

                           EVE
                 See, ya.

                           ADAM
                 Why doesn't it never work out?

                           EVE
                 What?

                           ADAM
                 Why does it never work out?  You
                 and...men?

                           EVE
                 Why?!  Who the hell knows?!

       He follows closely. She stops.

                           EVE (cont'd)
                 Okay, if you promise to leave me
                 alone, I'll tell you.

                           ADAM
                 ...Okay.

                           EVE
                 It never works out because I'm into
                 legs and butts and hair myself!
                 That's why! So I wind up with guys who
                 are very good looking, but
                 even more shallow than I am, if you
                 can picture that.
                 Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go
                 find another low-paying, demeaning job
                 where some guy named Jerry keeps
                 telling me how lousy his marriage is.

                           ADAM
                 Why not go to work for me?

                           EVE
                 Doing what?

                           ADAM
                 Selling all my baseball cards.
                 And helping me buy enough food and
                 supplies to fill several large trucks.

                           EVE
                 Food and supplies?  Who for?  Like
                 starving people?


                           ADAM
                 Well, they're not starving yet, but
                 they need help.

                           EVE
                 How long would you need me?

                           ADAM
                 Two weeks.

                           EVE
                 What's the pay?

                           ADAM
                 What's fair?

                           EVE
                 I've got to make at least a thousand a
                 week.

       He gives her his patented thumbs up sign which of course
       is exactly like his father's.

                           ADAM
                 You got it!
                 Wait here while I change.

                           EVE
                 Sure.

       He walks back to the hotel.

                           EVE
                     (to herself)
                 My career's finally taking off...

       EXT. MARINE WHOLESALE SUPPLY, MARINA DEL REY - DAY

       Heavy-duty BOAT BATTERIES are being loaded into a U-Haul
       truck.  The store MANAGER steps up to Eve who is
       watching. Adam appears in the bg, thanking and being nice
       to the MEN loading the truck. He looks mighty stupid in
       another one of his Dad's old outfits.

                           MANAGER
                 Why would someone need twenty yacht
                 batteries?

                           EVE
                 I just work for the guy.

                           MANAGER
                 And who does he work for?  The CIA?

                           EVE
                 Naw...it's some sort of charity
                 thing..I guess for starving people
                 with yachts.



       INT. PRICE CLUB - LATER SAME DAY

       Eve and Adam shop with two carts, both full of CASES OF
       DR. PEPPER.

                           EVE
                 Why not buy them milk or something--
                 instead of Dr. Pepper?

                           ADAM
                 They like Dr. Pepper.

                           EVE
                 Who are these people?

                           ADAM
                 My Mom and Dad.

                           EVE
                 Very funny, smart ass.

                           ADAM
                 Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need
                 all of this! This is swell!

       He goes over to a huge supply of Prince Albert.

                           EVE
                     (to herself)
                 Swell? Run, Eve.  Run.

       EXT. LOADING DOCK - SAME DAY

       Eve and Adam watch as a man with a forklift puts a year's
       supply of toilet paper into the back of the rental truck.

       EXT. GROCERY STORE PARKING LOT - SAME DAY

       A crowd has gathered to watch Adam and Eve empty seven
       shopping carts full of non-perishable groceries.

       ANGLE - 5 MINUTES LATER

       Eve goes to get into the truck. Adam hurries by her.

                           ADAM
                 Wait! Wait!

                           EVE
                 What?

       He opens the door for her. She shakes her head and gets
       in.

       EXT. HOLIDAY INN - THAT NIGHT

       She drives the truck to a stop. He keeps the beat to the
       song on the AM radio. It's VolarÈ. Adam loves it. Eve
       hates it. They come to a stop and she snaps off the
       radio.


                           EVE
                 Well, another day, another dollar.
                     (then)
                 Stop staring at me!!

                           ADAM
                 Sorry.

       He gets out.

                           EVE
                 Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.

                           ADAM
                 Hey, you know. I was thinking...

                           EVE
                 Night!

       She pulls away.

                           ADAM
                 Night!

       EXT./INT. U-STORE-IT - NEXT DAY

       Adam drags the last 50-pound bag of flour into a self-
       storage locker and pulls down the sliding door which he
       padlocks.

                           ADAM
                 We'll have to rent a refrigerated
                 truck for the beef and poultry.

                           EVE
                 It's your life.  And, by the way, it's
                 a dandy.

                           ADAM
                 I guess we'll need another locker.

                           EVE
                 No problem.  We'll just sell another
                 baseball card.

                           ADAM
                 You know, Eve -- don't get mad, okay? -
                 -  but, I'd just be lost without you.



                           EVE
                 Thank you.

                           ADAM
                 And, um ...I guess...
                 I guess you and I, uh...

                           EVE
                 Adam?  Don't even think about it.
                 Okay?
                 I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean,
                 but believe me, it would be meaner if
                 I didn't say it. Okay?

                           ADAM
                 Okay.

                           EVE
                 Now, let's take the truck back and get
                 something to eat.

       She hops in behind the wheel.  He (hurt) is a little
       slower getting in his side.

       EXT. FREEWAY - LATER, SAME DAY

       Traffic is moving about forty miles an hour.  Their truck
       is in one of the middle lanes.

       INT. U-HAUL - CONTINUOUS

       Adam screws up his guts and turns to her.

                           ADAM
                 There's something else I would like
                 you to help me with.

                           EVE
                 Name it.

                           ADAM
                 Well, this is going to sound a little
                 crazy.

                           EVE
                     (laughing)
                 Oh, I'm sure it will!

                           ADAM
                 Then forget it.

                           EVE
                 No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?

                           ADAM
                 This is for me.

                           EVE
                 Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.


                           ADAM
                 Well... Okay. I would like you to help
                 me find a...wife.

                           EVE
                 A wife?

                           ADAM
                 Yes.

                           EVE
                 What for?

                           ADAM
                 Because I want to get married.

                           EVE
                 Why?!

                           ADAM
                 I don't want to be alone.

                           EVE
                 You can be single and not alone.
                 Marriage bites!

                           ADAM
                 Bites what?

                           EVE
                 The big one!

                           ADAM
                 It does?

                           EVE
                 Sure.

                           ADAM
                 I didn't know that.

                           EVE
                 Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced
                 sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and
                 dad.

                           ADAM
                 They're all divorced?

                           EVE
                 Everybody's divorced.

                           ADAM
                 It didn't used to be that way.

                           EVE
                 I wouldn't know.
                     (then)
                 What kind of wife are you looking for?

                           ADAM
                 One who's not a mutant.

                           EVE
                 No dogs, huh? Okay.

                           ADAM
                 And if possible, I'd like to marry
                 someone from Pasadena.

       She is speechless. Then:

                           EVE
                 When do you need her by?

                           ADAM
                 Two weeks.

                           EVE
                 Well, I could probably get you laid in
                 two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant
                 wife from Pasadena...that could take
                 some
                 time.

                           ADAM
                 That's what I was afraid of.


       INT. DINER - LATER, SAME DAY

       Adam and Eve are in a booth. The WAITRESS approaches with
       sandwiches and drinks.

                           ADAM
                 What do you mean, you can get me laid?

       He and the waitress look to Eve for an answer.

                           EVE
                 Could we talk about that a little
                 later?

                           ADAM
                 Of course.

                           EVE
                     (sugary, to waitress)
                 Thank you.

       The amazed waitress leaves.  Adam automatically lowers
       his head and says grace.  Two HAPPENIN' GUYS at the
       counter look over and chuckle at the rube.  Eve flips
       them a mean bird and mouths the words "fuck you" as Adam
       continues to pray. The guys shut up.

       EXT. EVE'S HOUSE - LATE DAY

       Eve shares a frame Santa Monica bungalow.  It's in a
       pretty nice neighborhood on a quiet street.  Her GEO
       FISHTAILS into the picture and comes to rest half in the
       street, half on the curb.  Adam is driving.

                           EVE
                 Get out!

                           ADAM
                 The engine is still running.

       She rips the keys out of the ignition.

                           EVE
                 Now, get out!!

                           ADAM
                 Yes, ma'am!

                           EVE
                 Stop that ma'am crap!

                           ADAM
                 Sorry!

       They get out.

                           EVE
                 You almost got us killed!

                           ADAM
                 I told you I've never driven before!

                           EVE
                 Never drive again!

                           ADAM
                 You said it would be easy!

                           EVE
                 I was wrong!!

                           ADAM
                 Is this your house?

                           EVE
                 Yes!

                           ADAM
                 I like it.

       She storms off for the house where a YOUNG MAN is coming
       out the front door in a cut-off T-shirt and spandex
       exercise shorts.

                           EVE
                 Swell!


       EXT. PORCH

       CLIFF is leaving with a cardboard box full of clothes.
       He is exceedingly GOOD LOOKING AND IN VERY GOOD SHAPE.
       Eve and Adam come up the steps.

                           CLIFF
                 What are you bitching about now?

                           EVE
                 What are you doing here?

                           CLIFF
                 I forgot some of my stuff.

                           EVE
                 Your stuff?  Let me see that.

       She looks in the box.  Holds up a pair of old briefs.

                           EVE
                 You came back for these?

                           CLIFF
                 Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's
                 this interesting looking fellow?

                           EVE
                 This is Adam.  Adam, meet Cliff.

                           ADAM
                     (offering hand)
                 How do you do?

                           CLIFF
                 I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?
                 		(eyeing Eve)
                 You doin' any good?

                           EVE
                 Go home, Cliff, wherever that might
                 be.

                           CLIFF
                 Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember
                 her?  The model who went to Harvard?
                 Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam.
                 Nice coat!

       Cliff smiles and bounces down the steps.

                           ADAM
                 Why, thank you!  Very nice to have met
                 you, Cliff!
                 		(then to her)
                 May I ask you a question?

                           EVE
                 He's a former boyfriend. We lived
                 together for about six months.  And
                 yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind
                 of got a thing for him.
                     (entering the house)
                 That's what you wanted to know, isn't
                 it?

                           ADAM
                     (following)
                 Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff
                 likes to wear another man's
                 underpants.

                           EVE
                     (OC)
                 What?!

       INT. EVE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

       Very good music is playing. Adam listens to one speaker
       then crosses to listen to the other. Then he goes back to
       the first.

       INT.EVE'S KITCHEN - SAME TIME

       Eve is pouring champagne into a glass that contains two
       sugar cubes.  Next she adds several dashes of bitters.
       TROY, HER GAY ROOMMATE, throws together a tray of
       appetizers as dinner cooks on the stove.


                           TROY
                     (sotto)
                 Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!

                           EVE
                 I knew you'd like him.

                           TROY
                 Darlin', this is X-File stuff!  Think
                 about it!  The guy's got all this
                 easily negotiable property. He's
                 obviously setting something up very
                 big.  Like a self-sustaining island
                 off the coast of South America, for
                 instance. Or perhaps he's the head of
                 a cult that's doing weird things with
                 poultry and pipe tobacco. I've heard
                 worse.

       He rushes out with the tray.

       INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

       Troy enters with sushi appetizers. Adam is looking at the
       ceiling.

                           ADAM
                 You have very nice ceilings.

                           TROY
                 I do? Well, thank you! You like
                 ceilings?

                           ADAM
                 Not particularly.

                           TROY
                 Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea
                 urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori"
                 if you prefer. I love sushi.

                           ADAM
                 I love Lucy!

                           TROY
                 You nut!

       Eve enters with Adam's drink and two white wines.

       .

                           EVE
                 Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.

                           ADAM
                 Thank-Q!

                           EVE
                 I thought only hookers drank those
                 things.

                           ADAM
                 Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!

       Eve and Troy look at each other as she hands him his
       wine.

                           TROY
                 Dinner in fifteen minutes. Why don't
                 we sit and chat.

       They do.



                           TROY
                 So, Adam...where on earth are you
                 from?

                           EVE
                 Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.

                           ADAM
                 It's a very small place. People don't
                 even know it's there.

                           TROY
                 And it's called...?

                           ADAM
                 Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.

                           TROY
                 Really?  Since when?

                           EVE
                     (defensive)
                 Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm
                 Springs.

                           TROY
                 Oh, yes.

                           EVE
                 I even guessed his hotel, didn't I?

                           ADAM
                 Right on the button.

                           TROY
                 Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home
                 town.

                           EVE
                 Give me your hand.

                           TROY
                     (to himself)
                 Oh, my God...

       Adam holds out his hand and she takes it, rubbing her
       finger slowly and gently around in his palm.  For her,
       it's psychic stuff.  For him, it's spine-tingling.

                           EVE
                 Okay, let's see...I'm not promising
                 anything. You okay?

                           ADAM
                 Um-hum.

                           EVE
                 I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow.
                 Way up North.  Are we getting hot?

                           ADAM
                 Yes!

                           EVE
                 You live in...Alaska.  The only way in
                 or out of your place is by plane
                 and... you've definitely come down
                 here for food and supplies and... to
                 find a wife!

                           ADAM
                 Wow.

       She tosses back his hand and grabs her wine for a victory
       gulp.

                           TROY
                 That's right?

                           ADAM
                     (to Eve)
                 I've never met anyone like you in my
                 life.

                           TROY
                 She's right?!

                           EVE
                 Hey, butthead, I'm clairvoyant.


                           ADAM
                 I've got goose-bumps all over me.

                           TROY
                 Why not just go to... Nome for
                 supplies and a wife?  Isn't that
                 closer?

                           EVE
                 Yeah, right!  That's where you'd go to
                 find girls!  Nome.  He's gay, by the
                 way.

                           ADAM
                 Good for you.

                           TROY
                 Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask
                 you a few questions.  When did Alaska
                 become a state?

                           ADAM
                 1959.

                           TROY
                 Who use to own it?

                           ADAM
                 Russia.

                           TROY
                 When did we get it from them?

                           ADAM
                 1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2
                 million dollars for it. A tidy sum
                 then, as well as now. I'm quoting my
                 father, of course.

                           TROY
                 What's the capitol?

                           ADAM
                 Juneau.

                           TROY
                 Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!

                           ADAM
                 Sorry, that's the largest city.

       Troy jumps up and runs out of the room.

                           ADAM
                 Where's he gone?

                           EVE
                 He's gone to check your answers on his
                 computer.

                           ADAM
                 He has a computer?

                           EVE
                 Sure.

                           ADAM
                 In the house?

                           EVE
                 No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of
                 course, in the house.  It's in there.

                           ADAM
                 May I please be excused?

                           EVE
                 Uh...yeah.

       TROY'S OFFICE

       He has "Alaska" on his computer screen.  Adam enters and
       looks at the computer, which captivates him.

                           ADAM
                 This must be very new.

                           TROY
                 Yeah.

                           ADAM
                 It's so small.

                           TROY
                 What are you talking about? This is
                 the new Mac. You a hacker?

                           ADAM
                 I don't think so.

                           TROY
                 You don't have a computer in your
                 cabin?

                           ADAM
                 No.

                           TROY
                 How do you get through those winters?
                 		(reading screen)
                 Well, you're right.  Juneau.
                 		(then, covering the
                 		 screen with his hand)
                 What's the highest peak?

                           ADAM
                 Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest
                 point in North America.

                           TROY
                     (after peeking at the screen)
                 Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go
                 eat!

                           ADAM
                     (indicating computer)
                 That would knock my father out.

                           TROY
                 Yeah?

                           ADAM
                 Oh, yes.
                     (to himself)
                 It would probably kill him.

                           TROY
                 He's a Windows guy then, huh?

                           ADAM
                 Yes. He likes windows.

                           TROY
                 Well, I think Windows stink. What do
                 you think of that?

                           ADAM
                 ...I guess it's...just a matter of
                 personal taste.

                           TROY
                 True.

       Troy exits. Adam follows.


       (EDITORIAL:  Scenes 131, 132, and 133 should follow scene
       134 rather than precede it.)








       INT. SHELTER, MASTER BEDROOM - SAME TIME

       Calvin Webber is sleeping soundly.  Helen stands quietly
       at the door looking at him. She finishes off her
       champagne cocktail and very quietly shuts the door.

       INT. ANTEROOM - MOMENTS LATER

       Helen goes into the elevator. Obviously, she's had too
       much to drink.

       INT. MALT SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

       The floor rumbles and the metal doors open emitting the
       red light.  Soda Jerk and TEN OF HIS FOLLOWERS stand up
       expectantly and anxiously.  Helen appears--and looks at
       this terribly odd assortment of people.

                           SODA JERK
                 Who are you?!

                           HELEN
                     (beat, then)
                 I'm the mother.

                           SODA JERK
                 It's the mother!!

       And they all fall down on their knees and worship her
       with much wailing and rejoicing.  Several speak in
       tongues. Helen stares at them wide-eyed, presses the
       button on the control box, and goes back down.


       INT. DINING TABLE - NIGHT

       Adam's impeccable table manners serve to highlight Eve's
       and Troy's utter lack of same.

                           TROY
                 But first, you have to start with the
                 clothes!

                           EVE
                 Exactly.
                 		(then to Adam)
                 You understand that, don't you?  You
                 have no chance of meeting a woman
                 dressed like that.

                           ADAM
                 All right.

                           EVE
                     (to Troy)
                 So, what are you seeing?

                           TROY
                     (looking Adam over)
                 I don't know.

                           EVE
                 Money is no object.  He's got cards up
                 the wazoo.

                           ADAM
                 The what?

                           EVE
                 Wazoo!  Try to listen.
                     (then to Troy)
                 Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip-
                 hop, Euro trash?

                           TROY
                 You're serious, aren't you?

                           EVE
                 What's that supposed to mean?

                           TROY
                 It means that your taste in men's
                 apparel is as bad as your taste in
                 men.

                           EVE
                 Well, that's blunt!

                           TROY
                 I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.

                           EVE
                 And I suppose you see him in some sort
                 of strapless  thing, don't you?

                           TROY
                 I see "elegant."

                           EVE
                 Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?

                           TROY
                 That's what I'm sensing.

                           ADAM
                 The guy with the underpants!

                           EVE
                 That's boring!

                           TROY
                     (indicating Adam)
                 Not on him.

                           ADAM
                 I'm not wearing his pants.

                           TROY
                 Why not? He has great pants.

                           ADAM
                 I just don't want to.

                           TROY
                 Okay.

                           EVE

                 Why don't you take him and pick out
                 his clothes?

                           TROY
                 Alright, I will.

                           EVE
                     (talking with her mouth full)
                 I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to
                 buy six thousand paper napkins.

                           TROY
                 What do you think, Adam?

                           ADAM
                 About clothing?

                           EVE
                 Yeah.

                           ADAM
                 Whatever you two want. If you've got
                 the time, I've got the wazoo.

       Eve and Troy watch him eat for a beat or two.

                           TROY
                 Isn't it a little tiring to sit up
                 straight like that?

                           ADAM
                 No.

                           EVE
                 What about holding your right arm up
                 like that all the time?

                           ADAM
                 It's fine. Just give it a try.
                 And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot
                 off the chair!

       She does. Eve and Troy emulate Adam.

       SCENE 136 OMITTED



       EXT. EVE'S HOUSE - DAY

       Troy and Adam get out of Eve's car with a lot of
       packages. They head for the house.

                           ADAM
                 I guess a lot of those tall buildings
                 we saw this morning are new.

                           TROY
                 Almost all of them.

                           ADAM
                 The recovery is very impressive.

                           TROY
                 The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they
                 rebuilt the freeway in six months.

                           ADAM
                 Amazing. I'm very impressed.



       INT. EVE'S HOUSE - SAME DAY

       Eve is on the couch doing her toenails when Adam and Troy
       enter. Adam is in a casually elegant outfit that looks
       terrific. Both he and Troy are carrying lots of other
       packages and garment bags. We see names like Gucci,
       Armani and Lauren. Eve is visibly impressed by Adam's
       makeover.

                           TROY
                 Well, what do you think?

                           EVE
                 I think...it...works.

                           TROY
                 Let me show you the entire trousseau!

                           ADAM
                 But first let me show her these!

       He reaches into a bag and removes a box that contains --
       a pair of rollerblades.

                           ADAM (cont'd)
                 Eve, can I skate around your block?

                           TROY
                     (making it sexual)
                 How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around
                 your block?

                           EVE
                     (beat, then)
                 No.

       SCENE 137A OMITTED

       SCENE 137B OMITTED

       SCENE 138 OMITTED




       EXT. VENICE BEACH - LATER, SAME DAY

       There is a most unusual band shell location on the beach
       that is completely covered by graffiti. Eve and Troy sit
       at one of the many stone tables watching Adam skate all
       over the place. He wears spandex workout pants and a T-
       shirt.



       The starting CRANE SHOT begins on the nearly deserted
       commercial section of Venice Beach and then takes us to
       the band shell.

       ANGLE - CLOSER

       of him skating and them watching.

                           EVE
                 He's going to kill himself.
                     (then, to Adam)
                 Go skate out on the bike path! It's
                 that way!

                           ADAM
                 Okay!

       He heads out of the band shell. We follow him as he
       skates into an area that has been given over to the
       homeless. They sit around in their sleeping bags and
       blankets and cheer (and jeer) Adam when he passes by. He
       takes them to be more mutants.

       EXT. BIKE PATH - CONTINUOUS

       Adam skates to it and is amazed to see two very pretty
       girls skating in their tiny bikinis. A nearly nude body-
       builder guy goes by on a bike. Then Adam sees the ocean.

       ANGLE - WAVES

       breaking on the beach and rocks.

       EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS

       Adam tosses off his roller-blades and walks trance-like
       towards the waves.

       ANGLE - TROY AND EVE

       appear on a dune behind him and watch.

       ANGLE - ADAM

       Adam raises his arms to greet the ocean, perhaps like a
       Plains Indian would. Then he joyously runs into the surf
       and dives.

       ANGLE - TROY AND EVE

       watching.

                           EVE
                 That water's freezing!

                           TROY
                 He's from Alaska.

       ANGLE - ADAM

       He surfaces and throws his fists in the air.

       ANGLE - TROY AND EVE

                           TROY
                 That's why little things mean so much
                 to him.

       ANGLE - ADAM

                           ADAM
                 I LOVE THIS!!

       Begin the record "YMCA" over this.

       INT. EVE'S LIVING ROOM - NEXT DAY

       Eve enters from her morning shower to find Troy and Adam
       goofing to The Village People song. She gives Troy a
       disapproving look.

                           TROY
                     (defensive)
                 What?! He wanted to hear some
                 standards!

       (My hip daughters tell me that "YMCA" is enjoying a huge
       rebirth of popularity at their parties. Apparently they
       line dance to it.)

       EXT. FREEWAY - SAME DAY

       A helicopter shot follows the U-Haul in traffic.
       (Continue music.)

       EXT. SELF-STORAGE - SAME DAY

       Adam and Eve fill a second storage site. (Continue
       music.)

       EXT. BASEBALL DIAMOND, PUBLIC PARK  - DAY

       We see the infield of a gay softball team wheel a double
       play.

       ANGLE - TROY AND ADAM

       Cheering the play with other gay fans.

                           ADAM
                 I get it! I finally get it! You have
                 to see it to understand it!

       Music ends.



       INT. EVE'S KITCHEN - NEXT DAY (RAIN)

       She looks out the back window at the rain and shakes her
       head. She exits the back door with an umbrella.

       EXT. EVE'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

       Eve hurries to Adam who is sitting on a lawn chair in the
       middle of the small back yard, enjoying the rain. She
       holds the umbrella over her head.

                           ADAM
                 Hey, Eve!

                           EVE
                 Have you ever heard the saying, "He
                 hasn't got enough sense to come in out
                 of the rain?"

                           ADAM
                 Yep.
                     (then watching the rain hit
                      the palm of his hand)
                 You know, my father -- who is a
                 scientist -- says that everything is a
                 miracle. Everything. Until recently I
                 wasn 't sure what he meant by that.

                           EVE
                 Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still
                 want to go girl hunting tonight?

                           ADAM
                 I certainly do!

                           EVE
                 Okay. But you know, this business of
                 finding you a wife -- it's kind of
                 ridiculous, don't you think?

                           ADAM
                     (rising)
                 No it's not!

                           EVE
                 Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a
                 wife? I mean...

                           ADAM
                 Then just help me find a girlfriend!
                 That's all I ask.
                 I'll give you every single card I've
                 got left!

                           EVE
                 Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm
                 just somebody you can buy off! Listen,
                 let me tell you something--

                           ADAM
                     (taking her by the arms)
                 Would you do it just because you're my
                 friend? My very best friend.

                           EVE
                 Well...yeah. Okay.

       He hugs her.

                           ADAM
                 Thank Q, Eve!

       She's uncomfortable with the hug. Wait a minute. No she's
       not.

       EXT. "THE FORTIES" NIGHT CLUB - SAME NIGHT

       This hip, up-market club is based on a 1940's theme.
       Establish the YOUTHFUL RICH arriving in their black four-
       wheel vehicles and silver Porsches. Coats and ties. Eve,
       Troy and Adam arrive on foot. Adam notices the valet
       parking.

                           ADAM
                 Why did you park way back there?

                           TROY
                 Miss Rustokov refuses to let total
                 strangers drive her car.

                           ADAM
                 Oh. I see.

       Eve looks like she owns the place.

       INT. NIGHT CLUB ANTEROOM - SAME TIME

       As they enter Adam grabs Troy, who is leading the way.

                           TROY
                 What?!

                           ADAM
                 Ladies first, Troy! That was close.

       Adam and Troy follow Eve in. The club is NOISY AND
       HOPPING. The house music is from the 40's. Adam, Eve and
       Troy enter a long corridor of booths and walk forward.
       Adam's got on that terrific dark suit. Women notice. Eve
       notices them noticing.

                           ADAM
                 My goodness gracious!  This place is
                 something!

                           EVE
                 Look unimpressed.

                           TROY
                 Bored even.

       Adam gives it a shot and goes too bored.

                           TROY
                 Vaguely bored!

       He gets vaguely bored but misses unimpressed by a mile.

                           EVE
                 Unimpressed, but still interested.

       He tries that. It's like watching a neon sign switch back
       and forth:  First interested, then not.

                           EVE
                 No!  Not crazy!

                           ADAM
                 Do I look crazy?

                           EVE
                 Yes!

                           TROY
                 Be loose.

       He overplays that.

                           EVE
                 Just be yourself.

                           TROY
                 Always good advice.

                           EVE
                 For him. It doesn't work for the rest
                 of us.

                           ADAM
                 Holy Mo-ly, Miss Pay-o-ly!! This place
                 is neat-o!!

       Adam enters the main room. Eve and Troy follow.



       INT. MAIN ROOM

       There is a bar, a seated section, and a dance floor with
       a DJ booth. The DJ is in a white dinner jacket and does a
       perfect Humphrey Bogart impression as he ad libs his
       speel between records.

       ANGLE - BAR

       JASON and JONATHAN wave when they see Eve and Troy
       approaching. They ad-lib hellos. Here, and at the tables,
       the recorded MUSIC IS SO LOUD THEY MUST SPEAK OVER IT.

                           EVE
                 Jason, Jonathan, this is Adam! Adam,
                 that's them!

       They shake.

                           ADAM
                 How do you do?! It's very nice to meet
                 you, Jason and Jonathan!
                     (confidentially, to them)
                 My mother always told me that if you
                 meet a person for the first time it's
                 easier to remember their names if you
                 use those names right away.

       Jason and Jonathan just stare at him.

                           TROY
                 He's from Alaska!

                           JASON/JONATHAN
                     (relieved)
                 Oh!

       A slightly drunk beauty named SOPHIE appears behind Eve.

                           SOPHIE
                 Hi, there, Eve, who's the hunk?

       Eve hates Sophie.

                           EVE
                 Get lost, Sophie.

       Sophie pushes her way right up to Adam.

                           SOPHIE
                 Hi. I'm Sophie.

                           ADAM
                 Hello, Sophie, I'm Adam Webber.

                           JASON
                 Adam lives in Alaska.

                           SOPHIE
                 No shit?

                           ADAM
                 Tu parle Francais? Tu a un tres bon
                 accent.

                           SOPHIE
                 You speak beautiful French!
                 J'ai habitÈ a Paris un an.

                           ADAM
                 Paris!! La ville de lumieres!
                 C'est bien rencontrer quelqu'un pour
                 pratiquer le francais.

                           SOPHIE
                 Si tu veux, nous pouvons pratiquer
                 beaucoup des choses ensemble.


       Eve steps in and takes Adam's hand, drawing him away from
       Sophie.

                           EVE
                 Quit showing off!  We're here on
                 business!

                           ADAM
                 Good-bye!

                           SOPHIE
                 Non, cherie. A bientot.

       Eve leads Adam to a table. Troy follows.

                           ADAM
                 I thought I was here to meet women.

                           EVE
                 Not that one!

                           ADAM
                 I like her.

                           EVE
                 And don't be so obvious!

       INT. TABLE - TEN MINUTES LATER

       Adam, Eve and Troy examine female patrons over drinks.
       It's white wine for her, imported beer for Troy, and a
       Rob Roy for Adam.

                           EVE
                 What have you ordered?

                           ADAM
                 It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink,
                 I'm told.

       ANGLE - LOVELY BRUNETTE

       ANGLE - TABLE

                           ADAM (OC)
                 What about her?

                           EVE (OC)
                 No way.

                           ADAM
                 Why?!  I think she's very attractive.

                           EVE
                 Adam!  She's got bitch written all
                 over her!  You do know what "bitch"
                 means, don't you?

                           ADAM
                 Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't
                 understand for the life of me why you
                 would call her that!  Or why Cliff
                 would say that about you.

                           EVE
                 Because we're bitches!  Look at her!
                 Look at the expression on her face!
                 The walk, the jewelry, the
                 fingernails.  Please!

                           ADAM
                 How 'bout this one?

       "This one" is a KILLER BLOND.

                           EVE
                 Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even
                 be a crumb on her table!  You don't
                 see that?!

                           TROY
                 Eve?!

                           EVE
                 Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's
                 nothing personal.

                           TROY
                 Adam,  I think for you, we should go
                 for "sweet."

                           ADAM
                 Okay. I like that.

                           EVE
                     (swigging her drink)
                 Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of
                 putting it.

                           ADAM
                     (to Troy)
                 What do I say to Miss Sweet when I
                 meet her?

                           TROY
                 Um... Eve?

                           EVE
                 It's not so much what you say but how
                 you say it.  Women like men who are
                 unpredictable.

                           ADAM
                 Really?

                           EVE
                 Yes, really! Basically, they want what
                 they think they can't have.  Same with
                 guys.  That's why everybody is walking
                 around here sending off "you can't
                 have me" signals!

       ANGLE OF MEN AND WOMEN

       doing precisely that. Then:

       BACK TO TABLE

                           ADAM
                 That's ridiculous.

                           EVE
                 Maybe. But that's how it works.

                           TROY
                 Ah-ha! There's " Miss Sweet."  At the
                 hors d'oeuvres table!

       INTERCUT - MISS SWEET

       She's a pretty young thing with a sweet face.

                           EVE
                 Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo.
                 Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.

                           ADAM
                     (very serious)
                 Okay. All right.
                     (then)
                 And what do I say?

                           EVE
                 Say something surprising. And funny.
                 Lie, if need be.

                           TROY
                 Yes! Lying is always a very effective
                 dating tool.

                           ADAM
                 Okay. Thank you, my friends.

       Adam rises.

                           ADAM (cont'd)
                 By the way, that's a great play.

                           EVE
                 What?

                           ADAM
                 Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.

                           EVE
                 Did you?

       Adam nods and shoves off.

                           TROY
                 I'm not sure I want to watch this.

       Eve puts her hand to her head -- hating herself and still
       not  sure exactly why.

       ANGLE - ADAM

       crossing to Miss Sweet.

                           ADAM
                     (to himself)
                 Surprising and funny. Well, I know a
                 duck who bought some lip balm...

       INT. HORS D'OEUVRES TABLE

       Adam sheepishly approaches Miss Sweet, then gathers
       himself:

                           ADAM
       Hi!

                           MISS SWEET
                     (not sweet)
                 Yes?

                           ADAM
                     (beat, then)
                 I was wondering if you might help me.
                 I...I seem to have lost my
                 Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere
                 around here.

       Miss Sweet stares at him for a beat or two, then
       chuckles.

                           MISS SWEET
                 Oh, now, that's a great one!

                           ADAM
                     (big smile)
                 You like it?

                           MISS SWEET
                     (a little clap)
                 Bravo!

                           ADAM
                 Thank-Q!

       They both laugh.

       ANGLE - EVE AND TROY

       Stunned...as they watch Adam and Miss Sweet. Another
       pretty young woman (HEATHER) joins Adam.

       ANGLE - ADAM AND GIRLS

       Heather is a friend of Miss Sweet's.

                           MISS SWEET
                 This is my new friend...

                           ADAM
                 I'm Adam Webber.

                           MISS SWEET
                 He's really funny!

                           HEATHER
                 Hi!  I'm Heather!

                           ADAM
                 "Heather?"  I don't believe I've ever
                 heard that name before.

       There's a slight beat before both girls laugh.

                           HEATHER
                 Yeah, right!

                           MISS SWEET
                 I told you!  He's funny!

       ANGLE - EVE AND TROY

       More stunned. Eve finds that she very much hates watching
       Adam having a good time with other healthy non-mutants.

       ANGLE - ADAM AND HIS NEW FRIENDS

                           MISS SWEET
                 We work on Rodeo Drive.  But we're
                 both professional dancers.

                           ADAM
                 Really?

                           HEATHER
                 You dance?

                           ADAM
                 I took a dance lesson everyday of my
                 life until a couple of days ago.

                           MISS SWEET
                 You're kidding!

                           ADAM
                 No, I'm not! My mom taught me.

                           MISS SWEET
                 Your mom was a dancer?

                           ADAM
                 She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You
                 would like her very much! Shall we
                 dance?

                           MISS SWEET
                 Sure.


       They head for the dance floor.

       ANGLE - TROY AND EVE

       watching.

       ANGLE - THE FLOOR

       A jitterbug song comes on and so does Adam.



       He and Miss Sweet are a little rough on take-off, but
       they hit smooth sailing soon enough. He's terrific at
       picking up the new stuff she shows him.

       ANGLE - EVE & TROY

       They are shocked.

       ANGLE - DANCE FLOOR

       Heather cuts in on Miss Sweet as the other dancers stop
       to watch someone who is so much better than them. The
       three of them begin to dance together.

       ANGLE - TROY & EVE


                           TROY
                 You know, he's a very, very good--

                 Shut up!

       ANGLE - DANCE FLOOR/ EVE

       Adam dances beautifully with the two women. We CUT BACK
       AND FORTH between them and Eve.

       ANGLE - DANCE FLOOR

       Adam, Miss Sweet and Heather complete their dance with
       great aplomb.  Other dancers applaud them. Someone is
       WHISTLING LOUDLY OFF CAMERA.  Adam and his dance partners
       look over to:

       ANGLE - EVE

       She is whistling like a guy calling his dog.  Troy is
       embarrassed.

                           TROY
                 Must you...

       Eve points at Adam and beckons broadly for him to come
       over -- a basketball coach calling her player off the
       floor.

                           TROY
                 What in the hell is wrong with you?!!

       ANGLE - DANCE FLOOR

                           MISS SWEET
                 Is that your girl friend?

                           ADAM
                 No. Would you please excuse me?

                           HEATHER
                 If you'll please come back.

                           ADAM
                 I will certainly try.  And thank you
                 both very much for the dance.

       He leaves.

                           MISS SWEET
                 When was the last time you saw manners
                 like that?

                           HEATHER
                 Yeah.  It's like meeting a foreigner
                 or something.

       ANGLE - TABLE

       as Adam comes over. The music is not so loud now.

                           EVE
                     (to Troy)
                 Go to the bathroom.

                           TROY
                 Right here?
                 		(then, off her look)
                 Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't
                 sure!

       Troy rises and exits.  Adam arrives and sits down.

                           ADAM
                 You wanted to see me!

                           EVE
                 You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you
                 learn to dance like that?!  And there
                 are no starving people, are there?!

                           ADAM
                 Why are you suddenly so mad at me?

                           EVE
                 Don't change the subject! I want you
                 to tell me the truth about yourself.

                           ADAM
                 I've never lied to you.  I've maybe
                 let you believe things that you wanted
                 to believe, but I've never lied.

                           EVE
                 You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't
                 you?!

                           ADAM
                 No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love
                 with you the first time I saw you.
                     (off her look)
                 I did. I think that you are the most--

                           EVE
                 I want to know exactly who you are and
                 what you're really up to!

                           ADAM
                 All right. Let me tell you the whole
                 thing. In 1962--


                           CLIFF (OC)
                 Well, well, well.  Don't we clean up
                 nice?

       Cliff steps up to the table.  Adam, automatically a
       gentleman, rises and offers his hand.

                           ADAM
                 Hello, Cliff, how are you this
                 evening?

       Cliff barely shakes his hand.

                           CLIFF
                 Not bad.

       Then he sits in Adam's seat.

                           CLIFF
                 But I do miss that green sport coat of
                 yours.

                           ADAM
                 Thank you very much. But, Cliff,
                 that's my seat. And I was just--

                           CLIFF
                     (to Eve)
                 How 'bout a drink at the bar?

                           EVE
                     (pause, then)
                 Sure.

       They rise.  Cliff gestures to the chair.

                           CLIFF
                 It's all yours.

       Eve and Cliff go to the bar.  Adam sits down glumly.  He
       looks across the room and catches the eye of Miss Sweet
       who is seated at a table with Heather.  A GOOD LOOKING
       GUY is hitting on them.  CUTTING BACK AND FORTH between
       Adam and them we see Miss Sweet's smile escalate.  Then
       she nudges Heather who also looks over and smiles. Adam
       smiles back.  Finish with a CLOSER SHOT OF HIS POV of
       Miss Sweet's hair, butt and legs.

       ANGLE - BAR

       Eve and Cliff are in cozy conversation at the bar.
       Jonathan, Jason, and Sophie are in the bg.

       ANGLE - Troy

       returning from the restroom.  He is surprised to see Eve
       at the bar with Cliff.  When he looks back at the dance
       floor table, Adam is not there.

       ANGLE - EVE AND CLIFF

       Sipping wine.

                           EVE
                 So where is your roommate, the model?

                           CLIFF
                 You know, I don't know.  And looking
                 at you, I don't care.  It's been too
                 long, Eve.

                           ADAM (OC)
                 Please excuse this interruption.

                           CLIFF
                 Oh, brother...

       WIDER - BAR

       Adam steps closer, looking past Cliff at Eve.

                           ADAM
                 Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and
                 please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't
                 Cliff just a butt with hair?

                           CLIFF
                 What?!

                           ADAM
                 I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and
                 hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow,
                 as well?

                           CLIFF
                     (the shallowest guy in the
                      world)
                 Shallow? I'm shallow?!

                           EVE
                 Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.

                           CLIFF
                 Yeah. Before I kick your ass.

       He gives Adam a shove.

                           ADAM
                 Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to
                 defend myself.

                           CLIFF
                 Do ya?

       Cliff throws a right which Adam calmly blocks and
       counters with a short right jab to Cliff's mouth,
       snapping his head back.  It's not a big punch, but very,
       very quick. It makes Eve mad and astonishes Troy, Jason
       and Jonathan.

                           EVE
                 Stop it, you two!

                           CLIFF
                     (slightly insecure)
                 I guess we shouldn't fight in here.

                           ADAM
                     (lowering his guard)
                 Yes, I agree.

       Cliff draws back another right.  Adam flicks out a quick
       left to Cliff's cheek, again snapping his head back, but
       not his body. (These aren't big movie hits.) Cliff takes
       a beat or two then draws back his right fist again.  Adam
       pops him in the nose. Cliff drops his right arm to his
       side.

                           EVE
                 Adam?!

                           ADAM
                 I'm sorry.

                           CLIFF
                     (increasingly insecure)
                 Maybe we shouldn't fight at all.
                 Fighting is pretty immature.

                           ADAM
                     (lowering his guard)
                 It certainly is.  I agree with you
                 completely.

                           CLIFF
                 Eve? I'm leaving.

                           EVE
                 I don't blame you!

                           ADAM
                     (turning to Eve)
                 Eve, I'm sorry.

       Seeing an opportunity, Cliff rears back with another
       right. Adam deftly pops him in the mouth again with a
       short right jab.

                           CLIFF
                     (deeply insecure)
                 Well, good night, everyone.

       Troy, Jonathan and Jason say good night to him.  Cliff
       walks unsteadily away bleeding from the mouth and both
       nostrils. (Hopeful that no one has noticed that he's very
       subtly just gotten the crap beat out of him.)

                           EVE
                 I'm leaving, too.

                           ADAM
                 But, Eve, I would--

                           EVE
                 And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you
                 out--because I quit!  This is
                 ridiculous! You're ridiculous! I'm
                 ridiculous!

       She exits. Adam looks over at Troy who shrugs.

       EXT. EVE'S HOUSE - MIDNIGHT

       Troy takes out his keys as he approaches the front door.
       But the door opens. Eve stands there in sweats. Agitated.

                           EVE
                 He go back to the hotel?

                           TROY
                 Uh..he might of.

       INT. EVE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

       Troy enters. She slams the door.

                           EVE
                 What's that mean?

                           TROY
                 We did not leave together.

                           EVE
                 Who did he leave with?


                           TROY
                 What's it to you?!

                           EVE
                 I'm his pimp. He left with the
                 dancers, didn't he?

                           TROY
                 Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the
                 psychic pimp.  You tell me.

                           EVE
                 Those sluts!

                           TROY
                 Yeah. But who's not a slut these days?


       He enters the kitchen

       INT. KITCHEN

       She follows him: He gets something to drink.

       .

                           EVE
                  Where are you going?

                           TROY
                 To bed.

                           EVE
                 To bed?

                           TROY
                 Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love
                 with the guy.

                           EVE
                 What?!  Now hold on!  Wait one damn
                 minute!

       Troy exits into his office.


       INT. OFFICE

       He plops down on the chair.

       .

                           EVE
                 In the first place, I don't fall in
                 love with weirdos I've only known for
                 four or five days.

                           TROY
                 Yes, you do.

                           EVE
                 And I don't fall in love with grown
                 men who collect baseball cards!!

                           TROY
                 Uh, yes, you do.

                           EVE
                 Or pee in their pants when they see
                 the ocean!

                           TROY
                 Yes, you do!

                           EVE
                 Or have perfect table manners.

                           TROY
                     (sitting up)
                 You know, I asked him about that. And
                 he said that good manners are a way we
                 have of showing other people that we
                 respect them. See, you'd eat like a
                 slob if you
                 were alone, but since another human
                 being is present, you show that person
                 respect by going to the trouble of
                 having proper manners. I didn't know
                 that. I thought it was a way of
                 appearing superior.
                     (then)
                 Know what else he told me?

                           EVE
                     (sitting on the bed)
                 What?

                           TROY
                 He thinks that I am a gentleman and
                 that you are a lady!

                           EVE
                 Well, consider the source. I don't
                 even know what a lady is.

                           TROY
                 Exactly! I thought a gentleman was
                 somebody who owned horses. Turns out,
                 the short and very simple definition
                 of a gentleman or a lady is: someone
                 who always attempts to make the people
                 around him or her feel as comfortable
                 as possible. That's it! If you don't
                 do that, nothing else matters. The
                 cars, the clothes, the houses...

                           EVE
                 Where did he get all that information?

                           TROY
                 From the oddest place. His parent's
                 told him. I don't think I got that
                 memo.

                           EVE
                 So now I suppose he's trying to make
                 those two dancers feel as comfortable
                 as possible.

                           TROY
                 He didn't leave with them.

                           EVE
                 Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear
                 that.

                           TROY
                 He left with Sophie.

                           EVE
                 What?!!

                           TROY
                 It's true.  She swept him out the door
                 whispering little French things into
                 his ear.

                           EVE
                 Oh, no! Not Sophie! No way! Please
                 don't tell me that!!


                           TROY
                 What are you going to do? Go over to
                 her place and kick in the door?

                           EVE
                 You're goddamn right I am!

       She exits, then sticks her hand back in.

                           EVE (cont'd)
                 You coming?!

                           TROY
                     (cringing)
                 I don't think so.

                           EVE
                 Coward!

       She exits.

                           TROY
                 Gentleman coward, to you.

       SCENE 148 OMITTED



       EXT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

       Eve hurries out of the house leaving the front door wide
       open.  She runs down the porch steps, across the yard,
       and to her car, which she unlocks with the usual
       fumbling.

                           EVE
                 Come on!  Come on, damn it!

       INT. CAR

       She jumps in and sticks the key in the ignition.  Adam
       appears at the passenger window.

                           ADAM
                 Hi!

       Eve SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER as she throws open her door and
       jumps out into the street where she falls down, hurting
       her knee.  Adam runs around the car to help her to her
       feet. Dogs start barking in several houses.

                           ADAM
                 Eve?!

                           EVE
                 Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You
                 stupid son of a bitch!!!

                           ADAM
                 I'm really sorry!

                           EVE
                 What in the hell are you doing here!!
                 You're supposed to be over on San
                 Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex
                 with that slut Sophie!!

                           ADAM
                 I know...and I'm really sorry.

                           EVE
                 Well, you should be!  Thanks to you,
                 my heart is in my neck!

                           ADAM
                 What?

                           EVE
                 Goodnight!

       Eve marches, with a limp, back to the house.

                           ADAM
                 Eve, if you'll let me, I can --

                           EVE
                 Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is
                 that?!  What if this is for life?!

                           ADAM
                 I know first aid!

                           EVE
                 Well, you had better!!

       He chases her up the porch steps.

       INT. LIVING ROOM - THIRTY MINUTES LATER

       Lights are low and warm.  Adam is attempting to swab the
       abrasion on Eve's knee through the tear in her old sweat
       pants.

                           EVE
                 Wait a minute.

       She reaches down and gives the knee hole a good rip,
       revealing her leg from above the knee to the gym sock.

                           EVE
                 There.

                           ADAM
                 Thanks.

       He takes the back of her calf in one hand and applies the
       antiseptic to her knee with the other.  It stings and she
       flinches.

                           ADAM
                 Steady. Steady.  It's going to be all
                 right in no time.

       He leans down and blows on the wound.  CU of that.  CU of
       his hand on her calf.  CU of her looking down at him,
       watching as he blows gently on her knee.

                           ADAM
                 I went to Sophie's and she was very
                 hospitable.

                           EVE
                 Is that what you call it?

                           ADAM
                 But it just wasn't where I wanted to
                 be so I left as politely as I could
                 and found a taxi.  But I asked the
                 driver to drop me here instead of at
                 the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como
                 sings called "On the Street Where You
                 Live."  You know it?

                           EVE
                 Sing it to me.

                           ADAM
                     (softly, saying it as much as
                      singing it)
                 "All at once am I--several stories
                 high-- knowing I'm--on the street--
                 where you live."  It's about a young
                 man who is overjoyed just to be
                 standing in front of the house of the
                 person he loves.

       She reaches down, and taking hold of his collar, draws
       him to her and they kiss very romantically and at length.
       Then:

                           EVE
                 Adam...dumb question, but humor me.
                 Have you ever had sex before?

                           ADAM
                 No.


       She sits up.

                           EVE
                 How is that possible?

       During the following speech CAMERA pushes past him and
       lingers on her as she gradually realizes that Adam is
       mental.

                           ADAM
                     (sitting up)
                 In 1962, when the bomb was dropped on
                 Los Angeles, my parents were in our
                 fallout shelter.  That's where I was
                 born. We
                 only survived because it was a huge
                 shelter as fallout shelters go. My
                 father worked on it secretly for
                 years. When he had to, he used
                 contractors, but always from out-of-
                 state and always for just a portion of
                 the job. He told them it was a secret
                 government experiment done through
                 CalTech. My Dad's not a liar, but he
                 felt in this case he had no choice. Of
                 course, it had to be a secret, because
                 we had just enough supplies to last
                 three people thirty-five years. That's
                 also why I have no brothers or
                 sisters. The air vent was the really
                 tricky part, but he was able to cut
                 into a flood control sewer. What I'd
                 like to do Eve, is take you down into
                 the fallout shelter with me. We could
                 live there with my Mom and Dad. My dad
                 said if I found a healthy girl I
                 should "bring her on down". And you
                 look plenty healthy to me.


                           EVE
                 Uh-huh. Adam?

                           ADAM
                 Yes, Eve?

                           EVE
                 I want you to go back to the hotel
                 now.  I'll call you a cab.

                           ADAM
                 Of course.  I shouldn't be over here
                 at this hour.

       He rises.  She gets up and leads him to the door.

                           EVE
                 That's right.  And I'll see you in the
                 morning in the lobby.  Do you mind
                 waiting outside for the taxi?

                           ADAM
                 Not at all.  And Eve thank you for
                 tonight...and for the kiss. My first.

                           EVE
                 My pleasure.

                           ADAM
                 It was at least as good as the sky.

                           EVE
                 Really?  Okay!

                           ADAM
                 And I think better than the ocean. I'm
                 serious!

                           EVE
                 Neat. Goodnight!

       EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

       Adam comes out glowing with happiness. He looks
       heavenward. And does his patented thumbs up.


       Behind him we hear Eve locking all the locks on her front
       door.

       EXT. VALLEY AVENUE - DAY

       A REFRIGERATED U-HAUL TRUCK lurches down the street.

       INT. TRUCK

       Adam struggles with the gears as Troy worries about his
       driving skills.

                           TROY
                 Goddamn, Adam!


                           ADAM
                 Wait a minute!

       He promptly pulls over and turns off the engine.

                           TROY
                 I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in
                 vain again, didn't I?  I'm so sorry.

                           ADAM
                 No!  There's an Adult Bookstore back
                 there!  I'll be right back!

       Adam jumps out of the truck and runs off.

                           TROY
                 Without question, the strangest man
                 I've ever met.

       EXT. ADULT BOOKSTORE - MOMENTS LATER

       Adam runs up.  The bookstore looks familiar.  Adam runs
       to the next store. It's a bar.  He runs to the next
       store.  It's the Malt Shop.  Adam is thrilled.  He tries
       the front door and at first it does not open.

       INT. MALT SHOP

       The Soda Jerk is leading about twelve followers in
       prayers.

                           SODA JERK
                 Give us a sign!  That's all we ask!
                 Give us some sort of sign!

       The front door opens and Adam peers in.  He sees the Soda
       Jerk; smiles broadly at him and waves.  Then he closes
       the
       door.  The Soda Jerk grabs his heart and faints.  His
       followers rush to his aid.

       INT. TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

       Adam jumps in.

                           ADAM
                 Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef
                 frozen patties!

                           TROY
                 How 'bout we check with Eve first?

                           ADAM
                 You bet!

                           TROY
                 So, did you buy a movie?

                           ADAM
                 What?

                           TROY
                 A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the
                 bookstore.

                           ADAM
                     (concentrating on his
                      driving)
                 No, I wouldn't go in one of those
                 places with a gas mask on.

                           TROY
                     (laughing in agreement)
                 I know what you mean!  I usually wear
                 a big hat and dark glasses.

                           ADAM
                 Does that work?

                           TROY
                 Yeah...Seems to.

       Adam would not have thought that.

       INT. EVE'S HOUSE - AN HOUR LATER

       Adam springs in, Troy drags in behind him (knowing the
       deal). Eve is standing away from the door next to a kind
       looking professional woman named Dr.Aron.

                           ADAM
                 Hi, Eve!

                           EVE
                 Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....

                           ARON
                 I'm Nina Aron, Adam.

                           ADAM
                 How do you do?

                           ARON
                 Very well, thank you. I'm with the
                 County Family Services Department. Eve
                 tells me you've been living in a bomb
                 shelter most of your life.

                           ADAM
                 Fallout shelter. There's a difference.

                           ARON
                 Adam, I'd like to introduce you to my
                 associate -- Mr. Brown.

       BROWN appears from the kitchen.  He's good-sized man who
       dresses casually.  Adam becomes uneasy.

                           ADAM
                 Hello.

       He nods politely.

                           ARON
                 We want you to come with us so we can
                 talk some more about your experiences.

                           ADAM
                 Come where?

                           ARON
                 My office.

                           ADAM
                 For how long?

                           ARON
                 Well, that depends...

                           ADAM
                 I thank you very much for the
                 invitation, but I'm quite busy today.
                 Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.

                           EVE
                 Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron.
                 It's the best thing.  The best thing
                 for you. I promise.

                           ADAM
                 ...All right, Eve.  If you say so.

                           EVE
                 ...I do.

                           ADAM
                     (to Aron)
                 Could I please just go home?  I was
                 lost, but this morning I found home
                 and I promise not to bother any of you
                 ever again.

                           ARON
                 Let's go talk first, Adam.

                           ADAM
                 Yes, ma'am.



       The two come forward.  One opens the door and one beckons
       for Adam to step out.

                           TROY
                 Good-bye, Adam.

                           ADAM
                 Goodbye.

       Adam looks back at Eve, who looks away. Adam exits.

                           ARON
                     (to Eve)
                 You'll be hearing from me.

       She shuts the door. Troy sits dejectedly.

                           EVE
                 Well what was I supposed to do?! He
                 wants me to live underground with him!
                 That's like Silence of the Lambs,
                 don't you think?!

                           TROY
                 I know...I know. You did the right
                 thing.

       Eve goes to the window and watches as WE SEE ADAM BREAK
       FROM BROWN AND RUN OFF with him chasing.

                           EVE
                 Oh, no!

                           TROY
                 What?!

       She runs out.  He follows.

       EXT. STREET

       Adam races down the sidewalk.  He cuts left and runs
       between houses.  Brown is not as fast.

       EXT. EVE'S FRONT YARD

       Eve and Troy run out to Aron who is dialing her cell
       phone.

                           EVE
                 Oh, my God!

                           ARON
                 He'll catch him.
                 		(then into phone)
                 Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run
                 away and I'm going to need police
                 assistance.

                           EVE
                 No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!

                           ARON
                 I have to. If a complaint is made and
                 the person resists obser--

                           EVE
                 No, I can't have that! They'll come
                 with their cars and their guns and
                 their handcuffs--

                           ARON
                 Calm down, please. This man needs help
                 and you need protection from him.
                 That's obvious.

                           EVE
                 You know, I don't think so. I'm
                 confused but you know, I don't think
                 he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd
                 hurt anyone.

                           ARON
                 And now you must let me be the judge
                 of that!

                           EVE
                 I was frightened and I didn't know
                 what to think! But you know-I believe
                 him. I think he just wants to go home.
                 Wherever the hell that is...

                           ARON
                 Let's all remain calm. That's the key
                 thing.





       Suddenly Adam appears from the side of the house,
       startling everyone. He tosses his hotel key to Eve.


                           ADAM
                 The key to my hotel room!  I want you
                 to have my baseball cards!
                 		(running to the truck)
                 And please be sure to pay my bill!

                           ARON
                 Young man, stop right there!

       Aron looks around for Mr. Brown.






       Adam jumps into the truck. Aron yells for him to stop.

                           ARON
                 Stop, right now! Get out of that
                 truck!

                           TROY
                 Adam, you really shouldn't try to
                 drive that truck!

                           ADAM
                     (starting the engine)
                 Bye, Troy!

                           TROY
                 Bye, Adam!

                           ADAM
                 And thanks for always being happy!

                           TROY
                 What?

                           EVE
                 Gay.

                           TROY
                 Oh.
                 		(yelling to Adam)
                 Well, you're...certainly welcome!

       Adam gets the truck in reverse and backs out of the
       driveway and into a parked car.

                           ARON
                 Hey!!! That's my car, you son of a
                 bitch!!

       Getting the truck in first, Adam has to go down the
       sidewalk a bungalow or two before he can get back onto
       the street.  He clips two parked cars as he does.  Brown
       comes running from the side of the house.  His pants are
       torn.

                           ARON (cont'd)
                 Where the hell have you been?!

                           BROWN
                 I fell down!
                     (to Troy and Eve)
                 What's the license number of that
                 truck?!

                           ARON
                 Don't ask them!  They're as fucked-up
                 as the other guy!

                           TROY
                 Let's all just try to remain calm.
                 That's the key thing.

                           ARON
                 How 'bout I just knock the shit out of
                 you?!

       Brown has to grab her.

       EXT. U-STORE-IT - LATER, SAME DAY

       Eve and Troy arrive in her GEO to see that the two locker
       doors are open and much of the stuff has been carried
       off.  Eve drops her head in disappointment.

                           TROY
                 I guess he took what he could.



                           EVE
                     (putting her head in her
                      hand)
                 Good God...you don't think there
                 really is a bomb shelter, do you?

                           TROY
                 Fallout shelter.

       She gives him a look.

                           TROY (cont'd)
                 There's a difference.

       INT. SHELTER, PATIO - LATER, SAME DAY

       Helen is using the hip-reduction machine while Calvin
       reads, How to Win Friends and Influence People. The
       distant sound of the hatchway being open gets their
       attention.  Then:

                           ADAM (OC)
                 Mom?!  Dad?!  I'm home!

       They jump up and race into the living room, meeting Adam
       halfway.   The parents kiss and hug their son before
       noticing that he's got the Soda Jerk with him.

                           ADAM
                 I've got almost everything we need!
                 And this nice man...

                           SODA JERK
                 Archbishop Melker. We met earlier.

       He promptly drops to his knees in supplication.

                           ADAM
                 ...and his church group have
                 volunteered to help us bring the
                 supplies down.  But we've got to
                 hurry.

                           HELEN
                 Are you in trouble, son?!

                           ADAM
                 I think I'm being chased by a
                 psychiatrist.

                           HELEN
                 A psychiatrist?!

                           SODA JERK
                 It happens.

                           HELEN
                 My goodness! How bad is it up there?!

                           SODA JERK
                 Horrible.

                           CALVIN
                 You have something on your forehead.

                           SODA JERK
                 I know.

       INT. ADAM'S HOTEL ROOM - DUSK

       Eve and Troy look around.  She opens a drawer and sees
       how nicely folded and put away things are.  Troy notices
       "TV Guide" and the Gideon Bible sitting out with a page
       marker in it.  He opens the night table drawer and takes
       out the cigar box.

                           TROY
                 This it?

       Eve nods.

                           TROY
                 What do you want to do with it?

                           EVE
                 Give it back to him.

                           TROY
                 And if we can't find him?

                           EVE
                 We'll find him.

       INT. BATHROOM, ADAM'S HOTEL ROOM

       Eve enters and looks at how tidy Adam's toiletries are;
       how the comb is just right in the brush; how the tooth
       paste (Ipanna in a '61 tube) has been squeezed from the
       bottom; and at how he has hung up his socks to dry.  It
       makes her very sad.  She picks up the toothpaste and
       holds it as if it were his ring.

                           TROY (OC)
                 Hey, Eve?  Eve?

       He enters with stock certificates and sees that she's
       very close to crying.

                           TROY
                 What's wrong?

                           EVE
                 I don't know.  Everything's so neat.
                 It's all just so...goddamn dear.
                 		(starting to cry)
                 Damn!

                           TROY
                 See these?  Found them in the box with
                 the cards.  These are stock
                 certificates.  IBM.  AT&T.  Polaroid.

       Instead of taking the certificates, she hands him the
       toothpaste and sits down on the bed in a funk.

                           TROY (cont'd)
                     (looking at the toothpaste)
                 Ipana. I think I remember that brand.
                     (then)
                 Oh, here, you should read this.
                 "Trademark, 1961."

       He holds out the tube and she takes it to read.


       EXT. REAR OF MALT SHOP - SAME TIME

       Adam, the Soda Jerk and fifteen followers hurriedly
       unload the truck, taking provisions into the back door of
       the malt shop.

       INT. JASON'S OFFICE - SAME TIME

       Their pal Jason is on the phone with Troy.

                           JASON
                 Purchased in 1958 and '59?  Ten
                 thousand shares of each?  They'd be
                 worth millions. Hell, I don't
                 know...millions upon millions upon
                 millions!  How 'bout that?

       INT. HOTEL ROOM - EARLY EVENING

       Troy is on the phone.  Eve is standing, looking at the
       stock certificates.

                           TROY
                 Thanks, Jason.

       He slams down the phone and jumps to his feet.

                           TROY
                 Millions upon millions upon millions!
                 The cards. The stock!  The clothes!
                 The toothpaste!  The guy was on the
                 level!  And you blew it!  A man walks
                 into your life who is the kindest,
                 most polite, honest, trustworthy,
                 incredibly rich guy you have ever met
                 in your life!! And what do you do?!

                           EVE
                 Have him committed.

                           TROY
                 Yeah! That's thinking.

                           EVE
                 He was always so "nice"! How was I
                 supposed to know that's a good thing?!
                 "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is
                 "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you
                 that.
                     (beat, then)
                 Was it ever?

                           TROY
                 I don't know. I like to think so.

                           EVE
                 Well, at least I fell for him before I
                 found out he was rich! That's new.
                     (then)
                 Wait a minute! He said today he knew
                 where home was. What happened this
                 morning?! Where did you go?!

                           TROY
                 To get some frozen poultry.

                           EVE
                 Then what?

                           TROY
                 We came back to the house!

                           EVE
                 You didn't stop anywhere else?!

                           TROY
                 No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a
                 porno store.

                           EVE
                 What?!

                           TROY
                 An adult bookstore. He was very
                 excited about seeing it. You think
                 home is under a dirty bookstore in the
                 Valley?

                           EVE
                 Come on.

       She heads out.

                           TROY
                 Trendy address.

       They exit.


       EXT. ADULT BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

       Troy and Eve approach and enter.



       INT. ADULT BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

       The Pakistani looks up briefly when Eve and Troy enter.
       There are two male customers in the bg. Eve taps her foot
       on the floor hoping to hear a hollow sound.  But it is
       solid.  She and Troy move about the store tapping their
       feet and finally jumping up and down.  The Pakistani and
       two customers become concerned.

                           EVE
                     (to Pakistani)
                 Have you got a basement?

                           PAKISTANI
                     (indicating merchandise)
                 Believe me, all the really good stuff
                 is right here.

                           EVE
                 Is there a back entrance?

                           PAKISTANI
                 Are you kidding?  Of course.

       He points to the rear of the store.

       EXT. REAR MALT SHOP PARKING LOT - NIGHT

       The Soda Jerk drives the rental truck away leaving the
       lot empty and the door to the Malt Shop closed. Troy and
       Eve appear after the truck is gone.

                           EVE
                 Why would you put a fallout shelter
                 under a porno shop?

                           TROY
                 None of this stuff was here in 1962.
                 The Valley was mostly small homes and
                 fruit orchards.

                           EVE
                 Well, we've come a long way, haven't
                 we?  I want to go home.

                           TROY
                 Yeah.  Maybe he'll call.

       They turn left to get back to the avenue.

       INT. EVE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

       The phone is ringing.  Then the recorder answers.

                           TROY
                 Hi. Troy and Eve are out so leave a
                 message. And if you want to leave a
                 number don't say it fast! I hate that!
                 Say it slow. Thank you.

       Beep,

                           ADAM
                 Uh, Eve...this is Adam.  Look, I just
                 wanted to thank you for everything you
                 did for me...and I wanted to tell you
                 that I...uh...that I wish so many good
                 things for you. I wish so hard that
                 all of your dreams come true. Um...I,
                 uh...



       EXT. AVENUE - NIGHT

       Eve lets Troy drive.  She clutches the cigar box and
       rests her head on the seat as they pull away from the
       curb in front of the bookstore.  A low rider passes them
       on the left.  Eve sees an old hag being shoved out of the
       bar and a homeless man slipping into the abandoned malt
       shop and the cross-dressing STREET WALKER making eyes at
       passing cars and Adam hanging up the pay phone he just
       used.

                           EVE
                 Adam!!

                           TROY
                 Where?!

                           EVE
                 Stop!

       She rolls down her window.

                           EVE
                 Adam!!

       ANGLE - ADAM

       Turning when he hears Eve yell his name.

       ANGLE - EVE

       Running from the car.  The cigar box falls to the street
       and the contents scatter.  Eve could care less.  Besides,
       Troy is there to retrieve everything.

       In a series of cuts and slo-mo action the couple race
       into each other's arms...to the pleasure of all the
       lowlifes mentioned above.  Now the street looks more like
       Capra than Scorsese. She's surprised that she wants to
       kiss him so bad. He's surprised that he gets so
       aggressive.

       INT. SHELTER, KITCHEN - LATER, SAME NIGHT

       Helen watches Calvin work on the timing device for the
       locks with a screwdriver.

                           HELEN
                 How long will you set it for this
                 time?

                           CALVIN
                 I thought ten years.

                           HELEN
                 Well, that's...considerably shorter
                 than before.  I was wondering, Calvin,
                 why set the locks at all.  I mean the
                 radiation is gone and...

                           CALVIN
                 To keep what's up there from getting
                 down here! It's not the radiation I'm
                 worried about.

                           ADAM (OC)
                 Mom?  Dad?

       They turn to see Adam walking forward with Eve.

                           ADAM
                 I'd like for you to meet Miss Eve
                 Rustokov.

       Calvin knows a Russian name when he hears one. But he
       chooses not to pursue it.

                           EVE
                     (stepping forward, offering
                      her hand)
                 How do you do, Mrs. Webber?  Mr.
                 Webber?

                           WEBBERS
                     (rather dumb-struck)
                 Hello.

                            EVE
                 Uh-huh. I've heard so many wonderful
                 things about you.

                           HELEN
                 Well, please excuse us!  We...we
                 haven't entertained a guest in...um...

                           CALVIN
                 Some time.

                           HELEN
                 What can I offer you, Eve?

                           ADAM
                 Mom?  Eve and I have to go.

                           HELEN
                 What?

                           ADAM
                 I can't explain it now.  But I want
                 you to set the locks for two months.
                 You have more than enough of
                 everything.  Then we'll be back to get
                 you.

                           CALVIN
                 But, I don't understand.

                           ADAM
                 And, I'm asking you to trust me
                 without understanding why.

                           CALVIN
                 Well, in that case...of course, son.

                           HELEN
                 Of course.

                           EVE
                 They are wonderful parents.

                           ADAM
                 We have to go.

                           HELEN
                 No, wait! At least stay for dinner!

                           CALVIN
                 Yes, please! You must.

                           ADAM/EVE
                 Well...sure...okay.

       INT. BAR - AN HOUR LATER

       Calvin mixes drinks just like he did at the party in
       1962. Adam is with him.

       INT. - KITCHEN

       Helen races around, just like she did in 1962, getting
       the roast ready. Eve. watches.

                           EVE
                 Adam said I shouldn't mention the
                 Communists.

                           HELEN
                 Oh, yes! Please, don't mention the
                 Communists!

       INT. - DINING ROOM

       Helen hurries out of the kitchen to take her seat. The
       others are already there.

                           HELEN
                 Eve. I hope I'm not being nosey, but
                 are you and Adam...um...dating?

                           EVE
                 Yes, Mrs. Webber we are.
                     (then)
                 I'm also from Pasadena.

       Helen nearly comes unglued. Calvin is pleased, too. He
       raises his tea cup.

                           CALVIN
                 A toast! To Adam and Eve!

       The others also raise their cups and everyone clicks.
       Then they drink.

                           EVE
                     (gagging)
                 What is this sh...stuff?!

                           CALVIN
                 Hot Dr. Pepper! Most people don't know
                 how good it is heated up.

                           EVE
                 You know, they don't, do they?

       They begin to eat.

                           EVE (cont'd)
                 What about grace?

                           HELEN
                 Oh, my goodness! We almost forgot!
                     (then)
                 I like your friend, Adam.

       They all join hands and lower their heads. Calvin leads
       them.

                           EVE (VO)
                 And you thought your parents were
                 weird.

       EXT. BEAUTIFUL VALLEY NORTH OF LA - MORNING

       Adam and Eve are with a REAL ESTATE BROKER. The broker
       unlocks the gate of a chain-link fence and Adam and Eve
       step onto the property. The broker's Lexus is in the b.g.

                           BROKER
                 It's like the Garden of Eden, don't
                 you think?

       Adam and Eve respond but we can't hear them under Eve's
       narration.

                           EVE (VO)
                 You see, that night, Adam had a choice
                 between me and his parents.







       SCENE 173 OMITTED

       EXT. VALLEY PROPERTY - DAY

       Adam and Eve are working with a TEAM OF ARCHITECTS AND
       CONTRACTORS at the site of a new home. They have plans
       and are discussing dimensions.

                           EVE (VO)
                 It's truly amazing what you can get
                 done when you have unlimited funds.
                 Did you know you can have whole houses
                 built in just a matter of months. All
                 you have to say is this..."I don't
                 care what it costs."  And then, of
                 course, you've got
                 to really mean it, which no one ever
                 does.

       EXT. NEW HOUSE - DAY

       It is under construction.


       EXT. MELROSE RETRO FURNITURE STORE - DAY

       Adam, Eve and Troy enter.

       INT. RETRO STORE

       This is great stuff from the fifties and the sixties.
       Adam finds things very similar to what he grew up with.
       There's a
       lamp (or something) that's just like the lamp (or
       something) from the Webber living room.

                           ADAM
                 That lamp is perfect!

                           STORE OWNER
                     (very faggy)
                 I'm holding that for Elton John.

                           TROY
                     (faggy right back)
                 Oh, I think not.

       SCENE 176 OMITTED  (REFER TO SCENE 172D)



       EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF MALT SHOP (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT

       Adam and Eve embracing as Troy picks up baseball cards
       and the street people look on.

                           ADAM
                 Eve, I've got to go back! My parents
                 can't handle this up here. And there
                 was no bomb, was there?



                           EVE
                 No.

                           ADAM
                 See! I can't tell them that!  I can't
                 ever let them know. It makes their
                 life..well, frankly...
                 a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You
                 understand?

                           EVE
                 We can make this work, Adam! Believe
                 me! I'm very good at making things
                 work!

                           ADAM
                 My mother's like that.

       They kiss again.



       INT. MALT SHOP - DAY

       Eve and Troy are showing large color drawings to the Soda
       Jerk.  In CU we see the Malt Shop exterior all dolled up
       with a big lighted sign that says "GIVE ME SHELTER."
       There's valet parking and the Adult Bookstore and Bar
       have been turned into a Souvenir Center (think Planet
       Hollywood).  Another drawing shows fashionable guests
       boarding the elevator.

                           EVE (VO)
                 It took a while to convince Archbishop
                 Milker that Adam wasn't God, and he
                 was pretty broken up about it, too,
                 until I showed him my plans for Los
                 Angeles' hottest and most original
                 night spot.

       Other drawings show dancing on the shelter patio and
       guided tours being shown various parts of the shelter.

                           EVE
                 You'll be a ten percent partner and
                 still retain ownership of the
                 entrance.

                           SODA JERK
                 Praise the Lord.  And I mean the real
                 one.

       EXT. BEAUTIFUL VALLEY NORTH OF L.A. - TWO MONTHS LATER

       A 1962 Cadillac leads a 1962 windowless van through
       automatic gates that have signs on them saying:  PRIVATE
       ROAD and NO TRESPASSING. Troy drives the van. Eve drives
       the Cadillac. Adam is her passenger.

                           EVE (VO)
                 Our idea was to bring Adam's parents
                 up to the surface very slowly.  Make
                 them very comfortable and then break
                 the bad news to them that there was no
                 nuclear holocaust. And if that doesn't
                 kill them Adam's going to tell his
                 father about the Internet.

       EXT. EXACT REPLICA OF THE WEBBER HOUSE - DAY

       The cars pull up and Adam lets his parents out. They go
       bonkers when they see the house.





       INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

       The parents enter first. They are thrilled, shocked, etc.

       INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

       As a demonstration, Troy removes a hot cup of coffee from
       the microwave.  Helen is happy to see this handy new
       device.  Calvin, the inventor, sticks his head into the
       machine to investigate its workings.

       INT. FAMILY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

       Adam demonstrates the VCR to his parents as Troy and Eve
       look on.

                           ADAM
                 You put the tape in here and you get a
                 movie -- in your own home.

       We see the main title to Natural Born Killers come up on
       the screen. Troy and Eve rush forward.

                           EVE/TROY
                 No!!

       INT. ADAM'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

       It has been turned into an office for Calvin.

                           HELEN
                 This is your bedroom?

                           ADAM
                 No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's
                 office.

                           HELEN
                 Well, where are you --

                           ADAM
                 Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.

                           HELEN
                 No.

                           ADAM
                 Yes.

                           EVE
                 Is that all right?

                           HELEN
                 It's wonderful, dear! Wonderful!!

       They hug.

                           HELEN (cont'd)
                 Calvin!  They're married!

                           CALVIN
                     (offering his hand to both)
                 That's wonderful. We Webber guys have
                 mighty good luck when it comes to
                 women.

       Calvin points out the computer.

                           CALVIN (cont'd)
                 What's that thing?

                           ADAM
                 It's kind of a combination television-
                 typewriter-telephone-post office type
                 of thing.
                     (leading Calvin out)
                 I'll show it to you later.

       EXT. PATIO - AN HOUR LATER

       Adam and Calvin exit the house. They wear baseball gloves
       and start playing catch. (Calvin notes the modern
       construction of his glove, but does not comment on it.)

                           CALVIN
                 This is great son, just great. By the
                 way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov,
                 that's not Russian, is it?

                           ADAM
                 It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents
                 immigrated here.

                           CALVIN
                 Uh-huh.

                           ADAM
                 Dad, I don't know how to tell you
                 this. And I was going to wait a while,
                 but I think...Dad,there was no bomb.
                 A plane crashed into our backyard. I
                 looked it up in old newspapers.

                           CALVIN
                     (after a while)
                 You're sure?

                           ADAM
                 Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed
                 without a shot being fired. The Cold
                 War is over.

                           CALVIN
                 That's what everybody believes?

                           ADAM
                 Yes, sir. It's true.

                           CALVIN
                 What? Did the politburo just one day
                 say - "We give up?"

                           ADAM
                 Yes. That's kind of how it was.

                           CALVIN
                 Uh-huh.

       Adam throws the ball, but Calvin makes no attempt to
       catch it.

                           CALVIN
                 My gosh, those Commies are brilliant!
                 You've got to hand it to 'em!  "No, we
                 didn't drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our
                 evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor
                 us!"  I bet they've even asked the
                 West for aid!  Right?!

                           ADAM
                 Uh, I think they have.

                           CALVIN
                 Hah!!! Those cagey rascals! Those sly
                 dissemblers! Those, uh...
                     (he can't think of another
                      description, so he moves on)
                 They've finally pulled the wool over
                 everybody's eyes!

                           EVE (VO)
                 Have you ever in your life seen a son
                 who did more for his parents?

       Helen comes out with a tray of champagne cocktails.

                           EVE (VO)
                 Adam says that this is simply how
                 things work.  First the parents take
                 care of the children and then the
                 children take care
                 of the parents. He says historically,
                 that's how it works.

       INT. LIVING ROOM

       Eve and Troy are sitting by the window.  Adam and Helen
       come in to offer cocktails to Troy and Eve.

                           EVE (VO)
                 Whenever Adam gives me such obviously
                 incorrect information, I just smile,
                 slap him on the knee, and look out the
                 window.
                 Why spoil his dreams?  They're such
                 wonderful dreams.

       The CAMERA wanders off of them and shoots out the glass
       doors. We see Calvin behind the house...measuring off the
       dimensions for a fallout shelter.

       EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

       Calvin continues to measure as we pull way back and up.
       Perry Como sings "We'll Meet Again".

                                                          FADE OUT:

                           THE END
BLUE VALENTINE

          EXT. RURAL SUBURBAN STREET - DAWN - PRESENT DAY
                         
           A 5-year old girl wearing pajamas wanders alone down the 
           street.
                         
                          FRANKIE

           FRANKIE crawls through a dog door. She walks into the living
           room where the TV is on loud.
                         
           DEAN PERIERA, 30 years old, hefty, sleeps in a lazyboy.

           Frankie uses the footrest to crawl up onto her dad's belly.
                         
                          FRANKIE (CONT'D)
           Wake up Daddy.
                         
                          DEAN (WAKING)
           What time is it baby?
                         
           She sniffles. He notices.
                         
           EXT. PERIERA HOME - BACK/FRONT YARDS - PRESENT DAY
                         
           The back door opens and Dean carries Frankie to the yard. The
           first yellow rays of sunlight hit their faces.
                         
           He looks over the lawn, an empty bowl, water tin and a
           doghouse posting the name MEGAN. He peeks inside the
           doghouse. There's no one home. Dean moves to the fence. The
           gate is open.
                         
           Dean carries Frankie to the front yard. They look around.
                         
                          FRANKIE
           When's she going to get back?
                         
                          DEAN
           She probably just went out for a run.
           She'll be back soon because she's going
           to get thirsty.
                         
                          FRANKIE
           She's going to be thirsty?

           You know what we should do? We should
           leave her bowl full of water and her dish
           full of food. Because she's gotta get
           hungry and thirsty sometime. You know?
                         
           Dean's optimism is infectious. Frankie nods slowly.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           Like me. I'm hungry. I'm so hungry I
           could eat your toes.
                         
           Dean pretends to gnaw at Frankie's toes. Breaks her sadness.

           CINDY PERIERA, 28, sleeps in bed. Sunlight spills through
           translucent yellow curtains into a small master bedroom.
                         
           Dean sets Frankie down on the bed, motions to her to be
           silent. He sniffs the air. She follows. They eye each other
           and pounce. Cindy wakes up with a gasp.
                         
                          CINDY
           I'm sleeping!
                         
                          DEAN
           We're hungry! We're going to eat you.
                         
           They pin her arms above her head and 'furber' her armpit.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           Don't laugh. Come on, don't laugh!
                         
           Cindy doesn't laugh, she screams.

           Cindy, nursing a weight-loss drink, scans through digital 
           photos on the computer. We see - family on vacation,
           Frankie's first day of school, Frankie and a black and white
           Border Collie mutt - Megan. Cindy exports the picture when...
           A tea kettle whistle blows.
                         
           Dean and Frankie sit at the table. He plays a song for
           Frankie on a ukulele. Cindy gets up, turns off the kettle.
                         
                          DEAN
           What happened to the flute?
                         
           Cindy pours the hot water into a bowl with instant oatmeal &
           raisins. She blows on the food and places it at the table.

           Frankie takes a tiny bite and makes a sour face.
                         
                          FRANKIE
           I don't like it...
                         
           Cindy turns on the faucet over a pile of dishes, returns to
           the computer to e-mail herself the missing dog flyer.
                         
                          DEAN
           Here... we can make it taste better.
                         
           Dean spoons the raisins out of her bowl onto the table.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           This is how a leopard eats.
                         
           He laps up his coffee like a cat. She mimics. Dean laughs.
                         
                          CINDY
           Come on Frankie, use a spoon. You know
           how to use a spoon.
                         
                          FRANKIE
           Lepers don't use spoons.
                         
                          DEAN (WHISPERS)
           Are you gonna listen to your mother? I
           think you better.
                         
           Frankie reluctantly takes a tiny bite. Her face sours and she
           lets the food fall out of her mouth and back in the bowl.
           Cindy returns to the dishes.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           How old are you?

           Five.
                         
                          DEAN
           Okay, eat five bites.
                         
           Dean gets up, goes to Cindy at the sink.

           Tries to take the dish sponge away from her. She resists.

           She drops the sponge, dries her hands.
                         
                          CINDY
           Frankie! We're leaving in 15. Eat!
                         
           Frankie ignores her.

           She pulls Frankie out of her seat and carries her under one
           arm to the back room. Frankie protests.
                         
           Dean watches, shakes his head. He sees the computer on,
           Cindy's e-mail is still open. He shuts off the running water.
                         
           He scans through messages from a bunch of names of people
           Dean doesn't know. He sweats, clicks open a return message
           from a real estate company - apartment now available.

           Frankie is propped up on the sink. Cindy draws cat whiskers
           on her cheeks. Frankie tips her head back.

           Cindy brakes. Dean hands Frankie her backpack.

           Dean stands there in his driveway, muttering to himself. He
           watches the car disappear down the street.
                         
           Another car, headed the opposite direction, barrels down the 
           road, past the Periera home.

           Feinberg walks away down the hallway.

           Dean drives with a beer in a koozie and a cigarette. He has a
           coughing fit, rolls down his window and spits.

           They talk about sex, women and broken fantasies. But Dean's 
           attention is on the side of the road, scanning the
           neighborhood for Megan. He whistles sharp and loud.
                         
                          CHARLEY 
           Cheer up man. God wants you to be happy.

           the window. She slows down, waits for opposing traffic to
           pass, then pulls a wide u-turn. She rises up out of her seat
           to look at something.

           FOURTH OF JULY music recital. The Pre-K classes are lined up 
           on small bleachers. Led by their teacher, the kids sing "I'm

           Frankie, steps out of her line of pre-kindergarteners to see

           jumps a little, and wonders if he can see her.

           Dean sits alone, picks paint off his hands. He does not fully 
           watch the children - he watches the door for Cindy to enter. 
           He wonders where she is - every possible scenario passes
           through his mind. looks at the clock - 3:35.
                         
           Cindy arrives with haste, purse open, holding a big set of 
           keys in her right hand and a water bottle in her left. She
           props her sunglasses on her head, looks around for Frankie.
           She waves to her, but Frankie doesn't see her.
                         
           Dean spots Cindy by the base of the bleachers - relaxes. He
           picks up his jacket, puts it on his lap, making room for her.
                         
           She looks around for Dean, spots him near the top of the
           bleachers. Little waves. She climbs the crowded bleachers,
           stopping to talk with parents along the way. She comes up
           next to Dean, takes her purse off. They say "hi" but neither
           one makes eye contact. Dean takes the water bottle from her.

           Cindy shakes her head "no." She drops her keys into her

           at her. She concentrates on closing the clasp on her purse.

           She doesn't want to start crying. Dean gets visibly
           frustrated. He's sick of prying everything out of her.

                          DEAN
           That's my girl. Gimme a squeezer.
                         
           Dean hugs her and she squeezes back as hard as her arms
           allow. Dean plays as if his neck was being pinched off. He
           sets her on the ground running back to the porch. She gets
           caught in the diameter of the sprinkler spray. She screams as
           the water chases her.
                         
                          JERRY
           It got you! Go right! OTHER RIGHT!
                         
           Dean and Cindy both laugh. Their eyes meet for the first time
           in days, maybe weeks. They exchange a brief smile, filled
           with mutual love, pride and respect - connected by their
           little girl. Frankie stands in front of Cindy, water drips
           from her bangs.
                         
                          CINDY
           Come on silly. Let's go in and get dry.
                         
                          FRANKIE
           I don't wanna take off my costume!

           You don't have to. Let's just go in.
                         
           Cindy leads Frankie with one hand and pulls Jerry's oxygen
           tank with the other. Jerry takes Frankie's free hand.
                         
           Dean smokes and watches... Cindy hold the screen open with
           her foot and maneuver father, tank and child inside. The
           screen door closes. Sammy barks at Dean through the screen
           door. He tugs his smoke, memories flood. He drifts...

           Dean comes inside from the cold. He tries to walk in quietly -
           not disturbing Jake who's watching TV in the back bedroom. He
           goes to say "hi" but decides he'd rather not disturb him.
                         
           Dean sits on the couch which he uses as a bed. He pulls his
           travelling bag from underneath the coffee table, digs around
           for a long sock where he keeps his money. He stuffs his day's
           pay ($45), in the sock with the rest of his $ (about $100).
                         
           In the kitchen, he opens the fridge. There is a pie tin with
           one last slice of pumpkin pie. Walks to Jake's room. Stands
           in the doorway. Jake doesn't acknowledge him.

           He makes it to the truck where Saned waits to help him get
           the boxes in. Dean can't quite manage a 30-pound, behind the
           back hand-off. He ends up spilling up the boxes and their
           contents all over the sidewalk. Saned gets pissed. Dean gets
           down on his hands and knees and packs up the boxes - quickly.

           ELLIPSE - A nurse wheels Walter down the hallway and
           introduces him to his new room.
                         
                          DEAN
           Wait up. We gotta do this right...
                         
           He takes the wheelchair from the nurse, wheels Walter out of
           the room, picks him out out of his wheelchair, and carries
           him back into the room across the threshold of his new home.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           You are gonna be the new stud in this 
           place.
                         
           Dean sets him down in a recliner, then gives him a tour of
           his room - tells him which drawer his socks are in, where put
           the aftershave, etc. Curtis pokes his head around the corner.
                         
                          CURTIS
           Boss says we gotta go. We gotta go.
                         
           Dean cuts the tour short, wishes the old man luck and tells
           him he'll come visit him someday. He backs out of the
           doorway, grabs his money off the dresser, and says goodbye.
           Dean turns and is frozen in his tracks. Something or someone
           makes his expression change to that of wonder, eyes fill with
           love... he puts the money in his pocket.

           Cindy pulls into the driveway behind Dean's van. He walks
           around her mini van and directs her to open the back hatch.
           She presses the button from inside. Hatch opens. She gathers
           the stack of missing dog flyers in the seat next to her.

           mound as a marker. He stands over it, smoking a cigarette.
           Cindy looks on from the porch, arms hugging her body. Dean
           walks to her and wraps his arms around her. Her arms fall and
           move up to touch his side.

           Dean blows on a hot cup of coffee. Cindy moves fast, loads in
           the bags next to their luggage, slams the hatch closed and
           snatches the keys from Dean's hands.

           You're drivin'?
                         
           Cindy hops in the driver's seat. Dean rides on the end of the
           buggy and crashes it into the buggy corral. She fires up the
           engine and honks. He throws his hands up.

           Cindy drives the car along a windy, mountain road. Dean keeps
           a lidless cup of coffee from spilling.
                         
                          DEAN
           Alright, lead foot. It's not a race.
                         
           Cindy is zoned into the road. She turns off the radio.
                         
                          CINDY
           Isn't it funny how you can be driving for
           20 minutes and it feels like you've only
           been driving for 20 seconds. The time
           just gets swallowed up somewhere...
                         
           Dean places his hand on Cindy's hand that rests on the car
           seat. A small squeeze. She squeezes back. Dean looks at her
           with tenderness. Her eyes are on the road. She lifts her hand
           to the wheel. Dean reaches for the radio.
                         
                          DEAN
           Do you mind if I turn this back on?
                         
                          CINDY
           I was kind of enjoying the silence.
                         
                          DEAN
           Let's just see if there's something on...
                         
           He scans through the low stations.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           Anything? Fuck it.
                         
           He turns it off.

           gets to be just quiet. You know?
                         
           Cindy nods. Dean rolls down his window, spits his gum as far
           as he can. He rolls it back up.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           What are you thinking about?
                         
           Dean looks at Cindy, waiting for her to respond.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)

                          DEAN
           Where d'you get these?
                         
           Dean reaches for the glasses on top of Cindy's head. She
           feels the dangling tag - "woops." She tears off the tag and
           tosses the glasses on the dashboard.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           Try em' on.
                         
           Cindy shakes her head "no." Dean puts them on his face. He
           poses for Cindy. She grabs the glasses and puts them on. She
           looks at Dean. He holds in a chuckle.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           You look like your mom.
                         
           Cindy takes them off. Back on the dash.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           You get any snacks?
                         
                          CINDY
           There should be some fig newtons back
           there.
                         
           Dean unbuckles his seatbelt, crawls to the back of the van
           digs through the bags. Cindy can't see out of the rear-view.
                         
                          DEAN
           Which bag?

           Cindy enjoys a moment alone, straightens her back, crosses
           the dotted yellow lines and passes a car, then relaxes. Dean
           crawls back up to the front seat. They both eat a cookie.
                         
                          DEAN
           Mmm. These are good.
                         
           He offers her another one. She shakes her head.

           The car stops on the shoulder of the two lane highway. Cindy
           gets out of the car.

           On the side of the road, she stares into the woods. Cars pass
           behind her, headlights flood the night. She descends into the
           thicket until the sound of the highway is faint. Wind through
           the leaves. She drops her pants and pees. Something rustles
           and she looks into the woods.

           defensive position. TROY LEANER, his buddy, gets on top of
           him in the offensive position. Bobby looks up, sees Cindy by
           the door attempting to pop wheelies in her wheelchair.
                         
           Whistle blows! Bobby escapes the position and wraps Troy up
           in a double grapevine. Quickly pins him, stands up, takes off
           his ear guards, bumps fists. He walks over to Cindy.

           Cindy picks up the fallen particles with her fork. Jerry's
           eyes burn into Glenda. She won't look at him.
                         
                          GLENDA
           Can I have your plate Dad?
                         
           He pushes it across the table an inch. Glenda lowers a slice
           onto Jerry's plate with a SPLAT. Jerry looks at his dinner.
           Glenda serves herself. Cindy cuts Gramma's meat with her fork
           and looks over at her dad. His face is turning beat-red...
                         
           Suddenly, Jerry pounds his fist into the mound of meatloaf,
           obliterating it. Particles of ground meat fly everywhere.
           Glenda won't look up, her shoulders tremble. Jerry raises his
           steaming fist. Bits of ground beef stick to his knuckles.
                         
                          JERRY
           What'd you do to meatloaf? Huh?!

           Are you kidding me? How long does it take
           to make a meatloaf? Five minutes? You
           mean to tell me that you didn't have five
           minutes to make a meatloaf? I been up
           since six this morning busting my fucking

           Well, what gave you the idea that any of
           us needed a change? Did you ask for a
           change? Cindy? She doesn't ask for
           anything... She doesn't talk. You didn't
           ask for a change, did you mom?...She
           can't hear! And I don't remember asking
           for a change. So, it was you, wasn't it?
           You wanted a change. I work all day so

           He storms out of the dining room. Glenda, Cindy and Gramma
           sit in silence. Cindy takes a bite.

           closes his eyes tight, trying to control himself. But the

           scrubs her crotch, hoping that this will wash him out of her.
                         
           Cindy comes out, shirt stretched over her waist. Bobby sits
           up, asks her what's wrong? She can't look.

           Cindy. Have you got a cigarette!
                         
                          CINDY
           Okay, shhh. But you gotta be quiet.
                         
           Cindy gets up and opens the window. She turns on the fan,
           digs in Gramma's purse, gets a cigarette and a lighter. Cindy
           walks to her gramma's door, sees Curtis walking away from the
           old man's room.
                         
           CURTIS (O.S.)
           Boss says we gotta go. We gotta go.
                         
           She starts closing the door, then sees Dean backing out of
           the old man's room. He puts a roll of money in his pocket,
           turns to leave and sees Cindy watching him.
                         
           DEAN (LOOKS DOWN AT HIS MONEY)
           I didn't just steal that.
                         
           Cindy doesn't know what this guy is talking about.
                         
           DEAN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
           You think I just stole that money?
                         
                          CINDY
           No.
                         
                          DEAN
           You do. No, you do. I know that you do.
           And the reason that I know that you do is
           - I have stolen money before... a lot of
           it. And I know what it feels like to have
           someone look at you like that...

           The way your lookin'. Just so you know, I
           have a job where I make money. Money that
           I can take girls out on dates with.
                         
                          CINDY

           Pack it up Periera. Bus is leaving.
                         
           Dean looks toward the door, then back at Cindy. He sees that
           he has kind of went to far with his rant.
                         
                          DEAN
           Can I give you my number or something.
                         
           He feels inside his shirt pocket, pulls out a business card.
           Finds a pen. Dean writes his name across the card. Hands it
           to Cindy.
                         
           DEAN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
           I'm Dean. Just call and you can ask for
           me. I'll get it.
                         
           Cindy looks down at the card, at his name. Then back up to
           him. Dean run out, chasing after his ride. He looking behind
           before he leaves. Cindy watches him go out the door.

           Door opens revealing Dean and Cindy holding groceries and
           suitcases. Dean flicks on the light, illuminating the Moon
           Room - a hotel room decorated like the lunar surface.
                         
                          DEAN
           Wow. Where are we?
                         
           He sets down the suitcases, transfixed by the room, a kid in
           a candy shop. Cindy moves to the small kitchen that looks
           like a control room. She makes herself a drink.

           Dean walks into the bright BATHROOM, turns on the shower, a
           sparse tinkle of water.
                         
           DEAN (yells out)
           I could piss harder than this!
                         
           The dual mirrors multiply his reflection. He looks at himself
           and removes his coffee-stained shirt. A neglected body. But
           something else distresses Dean. A fallen hair on the T-shirt
           he holds. He runs his hands through his hair, looks in horror
           at twelve fallen hairs in his palm. He washes them down the
           drain and leans to the mirror, inspecting his hairline.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)

           Cindy dials the telephone, drink in hand. Shirtless, Dean
           walks out of the BATHROOM with his empty palms open.
                         
                          DEAN
           Now watch.
                         
           He runs his hands through his hair then shows her his palms -
           three fallen hairs. His magic trick.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           See. I tol' ya. It's falling out!
                         
           Cindy ignores Dean who is mesmerized.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           Oooooooooh shiiiiiiit!
                         
           Cindy waves him away. Jerry picks up the line.

           Hi Dad. We're here... It's kind of crazy.
           I don't know, should I feel bad?
                         
           Dean trots back into the BATHROOM. He is screaming like a
           hyena.
                         
                          CINDY (CONT'D)

           Dean tosses his suitcase onto the circular spaceship bed,
           watches the graceful way it rebounds. He shoves the suitcase
           aside, falls backwards onto the bed. He sighs with pleasure.
           There is a box with a button next to the bed. He presses it.
           The bed rotates. He looks up at his spinning reflection in
           the mirror above the bed.
                         
           CINDY (O.S.)

           ...Was it cooked all the way through? No
           pink in there? ...
                         
           Dean walks up from behind, putting on a clean, white T-shirt.
           He snaps his fingers at Cindy. Cindy swipes his hand away
           with more force than necessary.
                         
                          CINDY (CONT'D)

           well of creativity in him. Frankie loves to hear him talk.
           And he loves to make her happy. He finishes. She is happy.

           He walks into the living room, stretching the phone cord,
           grabs the remote and turns on the television - animal doc.
           Dean turns the channel. Tennis.

           Dean hangs up and returns to the living room. He changes the
           station. A porno. He turns the volume down and watches. He
           hears water running in the BATHROOM. CLICK. A show on space.

           Dean closes the door, remains in the BATHROOM, watches his

           The small shower presses them close. Dean's smile infects
           her. He leans over, they kiss. Brushing lips at first. Dean
           presses closer. Cindy pulls back and pivots him around until
           the stream of water catches his body. He leans his head back,
           the water pours over his hair and face. He places his hands
           on Cindy's hips and pulls her close to him. Cindy hands him a
           bar of soap. He builds a gentle lather. Cindy inches back,
           turns around. Dean lathers her back, slow and languid.

           He washes her shoulders and neck. His hands sculpt her body
           and move to her breasts. No longer washing her, but molding
           her. Cindy looks up. His hands move to her belly. He kneels
           down. Cindy reaches down and lifts him up by the arms. But
           Dean remains where he is. He begins, on his knees, to wash
           the entire surface of her left thigh, knee, calf, foot. Then
           he moves to her right foot and up her calf, knee and thigh.
           Cindy releases her breath. Then, Dean's hands move up between
           her legs.
                         
                          CINDY
           Okay.
                         
           Cindy grabs under his armpits. He refuses, but she wins. She
           pivots them around again. Standing in the stream of water,
           Cindy washes the soap off her body, eyes closed, head back.
           Dean reaches for her and follows with his fingertips the flow
           of water down the front of her body.
                         
                          CINDY (CONT'D)
           Give me the soap.
                         
           She forms a quick lather in her hands. She rubs it into his
           chest, her strong hands making circles of suds. Dean is a
           tranquil participant. She lifts up his left arm, scrubs his
           armpit, then his right. Her hands build a lather and wash his
           penis. Dean catches his breath.
                         
                          CINDY (CONT'D)
           Turn around.
                         
           Dean obeys. She continues wash his back, buttocks and legs
           and stops. Dean turns around to Cindy who holds a squirt of
           shampoo in her hands. She reaches up and scours his head.
                         
                          DEAN
           Getting thinner, isn't it?

           Your hair is not falling out.
                         
           Cindy pivots him around into the water and rinses him.
                         
                          CINDY (CONT'D)

           She pecks him on the lips.

           Ice dumps into an ice bucket. Music and laughter emanate from
           other rooms. Dean wears a hotel robe and carries a full
           bucket of ice. He swipes his key. A TEENAGE boy in a tuxedo
           shirt and swim trunks chases a girl in a bikini down the
           hallway behind him.

           He takes a big drink, sifts through cassettes in his bag. In

           She hears the music begin from the other room, knows the song
           - (Penny & the Quarters or Dynamite Four) It sounds really
           good right now. Drink in hand, she begins to sway to the
           rhythm. Dean peeks his head around the corner with a shit-
           eating grin. He starts to awkwardly dance to the music and
           make his way down the hallway to the bedroom.
                         
           It's been years since they danced in front of each other, and
           it makes them a little embarrassed to be doing it now. The
           closer they get to each other, the less they can be seen, the
           less they are exposed. Soon, they are slow dancing, still
           holding drinks. They don't feel as vulnerable now. The cotton
           on Dean's robe feels good to Cindy's fingertips, she traces
           invisible pictures on his back. Dean burrows his nose into
           Cindy's neck, inhales deeply.
                         
           There is a knock at the door. They both wish it would go
           away. It doesn't. 
                         
           DEAN (YELLS) (cont'd) 
           Coming!
                         
           Something about this makes Cindy laugh, Dean too. He backs
           away from her, slowly, as if pulled by some unseen force. The
           song continues as Dean opens the door and pays the ROOM 
           SERVICE MAN. Cindy sets the table.

           in the corner. Dean reaches - a locket.

           ...And then the opportunity comes, it
           presents itself to you, living and
           breathing in the flesh, and you puss out.

           Dean holds up the locket and stares at it, twirling. He opens
           the latch - sees a picture of the old man and his wife - 60
           years ago. Dean puts it in his pocket, finishes sweeping up.

           Still wearing his work clothes, Dean rides the train out of
           the city, pulls out the locket. Reads the inscription on the
           back - "you are my sunshine."
                         
           Dean gets off the train. Asks some people for directions.

           Dean walks to the old man's room. The door is open, lights
           are off, room is empty. All the furniture, pictures, gone -
           just an empty bed. Dean is at a loss for what to do. He hears
           the TV coming from across the hall. He knocks, waits, then
           opens Cindy's Gramma's door. She is lying in bed. Tries to
           recognize Dean. He pulls up a chair next to her.
                         
                          DEAN
           Hi. I was looking for your neighbor...
           the man who moved in last month. Across
           the hall. Do you know what happened to
           him?

                          DEAN
           What about the girl that was with you?

           Who?
                         
           The conversation moves in circles. Not much information is
           gained. Dean ends up just holding her hand.

           The bus drives away. Inside, Dean stands. He is a little
           down. He feels around in his pocket. Finds the locket. He
           puts it on. The bus comes to a stop. A few passengers get on.
           One of them is Cindy. Dean watches her pay her fare and move
           to the back of the bus without noticing him.
                         
           She finds a seat, pulls her hoodie low, anonymous. She
           underlines passages from a textbook using a highlighter. Dean
           is frozen. He gathers the courage to walk toward her. The
           moving bus throws his balance. He stands over her for a
           moment. Cindy senses somebody in her space. She looks up.
           Recognizes him, but can't place it.
                         
                          DEAN

           I just had a long talk with your
           gramma... is that, is that your gramma?
                         
           Cindy remembers him now - he's just dressed nicer - he
           doesn't look like a mover
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           I was looking for that old guy who moved
           across the hall, you know? Do you know
           what happened to him?

           I think he passed away.
                         
           Dean feels for the locket around his neck. He shakes his
           head.
                         
                          DEAN
           That's exactly what happened to my dog.
           My parents moved out of our house and
           three days later she was a goner.
                         
           He pulls the locket out from behind his shirt. He unclasps
           it. Shows her the pictures.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           He was so handsome, wasn't he? I was
           trying to give it back to him.
                         
           Cindy looks at it.
                         
                          CINDY
           She was pretty too..
                         
           Dean thinks about the old man. The bus drives.
                         
                          DEAN
           She must have been crazy.
                         
                          CINDY
           Why do you say that?
                         
                          DEAN
           Cause there's one thing I know... the
           prettier a girl is the more nuts she is.
           I mean, look at you... you must be
           insane.
                         
                          CINDY

           It's okay, I mean, I get it. It's not
           your fault.
                         
           Cindy pulls the chain to stop the bus.

           Dean looks back. He sees a bunch of houses that all look the
           same. They keep walking.
                         
           ELLIPSE: Cindy smokes one of Dean's cigarettes, calls her dad
                         A89 A89
           on a pay phone and tells him she won't be home for dinner
           because she is studying.
                         
           ELLIPSE. DEAN tells Cindy about his childhood, the
                         B89 B89
           sexualizing of his mother, and his fascination with women's
           purses. It makes Cindy a little uncomfortable.
                         
                          DEAN

           He digs through text books, pens, a wallet, asthma inhaler.
           Then he comes to a bottle of lotion. Opens the cap, sniffs.

           face. He enjoys the feeling of it, offers her some. She say's
           no. He digs through her purse and finds lip balm, smells it.
                         
                          DEAN

           steal Cindy's purse from her. It is a game. Innocent.
                         
           ELLIPSE. DEAN TRIES TO GIVE CINDY THE LOCKET. SHE REFUSES.

                          DEAN
           Probably. I think I... I think I already
           did. It's okay. There's an early one.
                         
                          CINDY
           You are just gonna stay up all night?

           Same streets. Same people. Everything
           here is the same. You walk down the

           Where do you want to go? I mean, if you
           could go anywhere..
                         
           They walk to an old playground. Cindy gets an idea.
                         
                          CINDY
           There!
                         
           Cindy runs to an old, creaky merry-go round, jumps on.
                         
                          CINDY (CONT'D)
           I used to love these things.
                         
                          DEAN
           Oh God... I hate these things.
                         
                          CINDY
           Push me.
                         
           Dean is tentative, but goes along with her. He starts slow,
           but she eggs him to go faster. He runs in circles picking up
           speed until he is in a breathless, circular sprint. He can't
           keep up with the centrifugal force.
                         
                          CINDY (CONT'D)
           Get on!
                         
           Dean does as he's told. They both hold on for dear life. The
           world spins in a frenzy. The dread on Dean's face builds to
           insane laughter. It is super fun. Cindy screams. Her hair
           snaps in her face. Then, a look of sickness steals her smile
           away. She wants it to stop, which, slowly, it does. She gets
           off first, tries to walk, but is too dizzy. She just keeps
           falling to the ground. Dean crawls off the merry-go round on
           all fours, laughing.

                          CINDY
           Make it stop.
                         
                          DEAN
           You gotta puke... it's the only way.
                         
           She refuses.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           It's the only way. It will make you feel
           better. Don't be embarrassed. I'll do it.
                         
           He sticks his finger down his throat and forces himself to
           vomit. The sound of it is too much for her. She gags. Side by
           side, they puke into the gravel. They finish their business
           and end up on their backs and out of breath, side by side,
           looking up at the stars. They are both covered in sweat. We
           see their breath.
                         
                          CINDY
           I'm still spinning.

           Me too.
                         
                          CINDY
           Maybe it's just the Earth that's
           spinning.
                         
                          DEAN
           Yeah. We're flying.
                         
           They laugh. Birds begin to awaken and fly.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           You should come visit me in the city
           sometime.
                         
           The morning air chills their bodies. Dean takes off his
           jacket and uses it as a blanket. They get close together to
           get warm and watch the stars spin above them.

           The dining room table is set for two. A single champagne 
           glass is raised.

                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           Hey! Wait up.
                         
                          CINDY
           We're toasting tonight?
                         
           Dean makes his toast. CLINK. Dean quaffs his glass.
                         
                          CINDY (CONT'D)
           Sometimes you don't make any sense. You
           might as well be speaking Chinese.
                         
           Dean imitates a Chinese man - it goes on too long.
                         
                          CINDY (CONT'D)
           Happy belated anniversary.
                         
           Cindy starts to eat a spread of Indian food and booze.
                         
                          DEAN

           Great. She's the best.
                         
                          CINDY
           She didn't sound sad?
                         
                          DEAN
           Naw. She's the champ. She's the best
           parts of you and the best parts of me put
           together. Everyday she gets more and more
           amazing.
                         
           Dean chews a bite of meat and washes it down with a shot of
           vodka. He refills both their glasses.

           I didn't say that. What I meant is that
           it's important for us to have our space.
           That's all. We're grown people.
                         
                          DEAN
           Well there's not much space here. So I

           You know, we rarely sit down and have a
           conversation. An adult conversation.
           Because every time we do, you turn
           something that I say around and make it
           mean something that I didn't mean to say.
           You just blab. Blab.

           this, us, all of it.
                         
           Cindy lifts up her empty wine glass to the light.
                         
                          CINDY
           I think my glass has a hole in it.
                         
           Cindy cuts around her food and pushes a piece aside.
                         
                          DEAN
           What's wrong with that?
                         
                          CINDY
           It's fat.
                         
                          DEAN
           That's the flavor. Eat it.
                         
                          CINDY
           I don't want to. You eat it. 
                         
           Dean stabs a piece of fat and pops it into his mouth.
                         
                          CINDY (CONT'D) 
           That's going straight to your tits.
                         
                          DEAN
           My tits? I got tits?
                         
           Dean opens his shirt and peers down at his chest. 
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D) 
           I could still kick yer ass.

           A dime and you're on.
                         
           Cindy gulps more champagne. They scoot dishes out of the way
           and clasp hands in the middle of the table.
                         
                          CINDY
           Ready?
                         
                          DEAN
           I'm always ready, baby.
                         
                          CINDY
           On the count of three... One... Two...
                         
           Cindy flexes and starts.
                         
                          CINDY (CONT'D)
           THREE!
                         
           Dean, acting as if he isn't trying at all, holds Cindy's hand
           at a stand still.
                         
                          DEAN
           Come on. Go! Start.
                         
           Cindy ignores his taunts and pushes as hard as she can.
           Slowly, she begins to push Dean's hand down. Dean groans, 
           letting her win a little. Cindy presses down with all her
           weight. His hand is centimeters from hitting the table. Then,
           he turns the tide. Cindy battles back with all the strength 
           she can muster. Dean laughs, realizing her passion for
           victory. Dean pounds her hand into the table. He stands
           kisses his flexed bicep. Cindy lifts her hand. A fork is 
           stuck in the back of it. She looks at it with curiosity.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D) 
           Oh fuck.
                         
                          CINDY 
           I'm alright.

           He plucks the fork from her hand, leaving four vampire bites.
                         
                          CINDY
           Ow ow ow.
                         
           Dean leads her to the kitchen, holds her hand under the
           faucet. 
                         
                          DEAN
           You think we should rush you to the
           hospital before you bleed to death?
                         
           Cindy shoots him a look. Dean wraps her hand with a dishrag. 
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           Does it hurt?
                         
                          CINDY
           It stings a little.
                         
           Dean tries to pick up Cindy. She struggles against it.
           Finally he cradles her like a squirming baby.
                         
                          CINDY (CONT'D)
           No, no... Put me down. It's okay...
                         
           Dean huffs a little. Cindy adjusts her weight, self-
           conscious. He hefts her down the hallway to the bedroom.
                         
           INT. ROMANTASUITES - MOON ROOM - NIGHT - PRESENT DAY

           Dean awkwardly sets Cindy down on the circular spaceship bed.
                         
                          DEAN
           Wait wait wait.
                         
           He flicks the switch and the bed starts spinning. He runs out
           of the room. Cindy watches the room around her spin. Dean
           returns with the vodka bottle and two shot glasses. He kneels
           above her and pours them two shots.

           To numb the pain. Doctors orders. I'm an

           I'm spinning.
                         
           She sits up. They toast. Dean gulps his. Cindy takes a sip.
                         
                          DEAN
           Drink up. We haven't gotten loaded
           together in years.
                         
           He tops off her glass, refills his own, and quaffs it. 
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           I gotta take a piss. Don't fall asleep.
                         
           He kisses her on the forehead, stumbles. Cindy hears Dean 
           urinating. She is sickened by it. She tries to set her full 
           glass on the floor that spins beneath her. The toilet
           flushes. The drink tips over. A loud crash comes from the
           BATHROOM. Cindy sits up.
                         
                          CINDY
           What are you doing in there? ...Dean?!
                         
           An agonizing moan comes from down the hall. Cindy staggers 
           off the spinning bed and stumbles to the bathroom door.
                         
                          CINDY (CONT'D)
           Are you all right? Dean...
                         
           She pushes the door but it is blocked. Dean moans louder. 
           Cindy pushes again and inches it open. She sticks her head 
           in, sees him laying on his back looking up at the ceiling. 
                         
                          DEAN (SLURS)

           want you to laugh.
                         
           Cindy opens the door and Dean scoots, making room for her. He
           lets out an "ow" before extending his hand.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)

           Cindy reluctantly joins him on the bathroom floor. Their
           faces are close, eyes locked.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)

           Cindy looks down.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           Hey...that's not funny? How come you
           don't think I'm funny any more? I tell
           you something funny. You laugh. I see you
           laugh. But you don't really laugh so
           much. You don't laugh anymore Cindy.
                         
                          CINDY

                          DEAN
           No I want to make you laugh.
                         
           Tears well up in her eyes. Dean rolls on top of her. He cups
           her face in his hands and stares long into her watery eyes.

           After a moment, their lips meet in an awkward rejuvenation.
           She moves her head away and pats Dean on the shoulder in a
           gesture of friendship. Dean kisses her neck.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)

           ... I want another child.
                         
           Cindy bites her lip. He slides his hand between her legs.
                         
                          CINDY
           No... Dean... Wait a second.
                         
           She removes his hand and places it on her hip. Dean continues
           to kiss her neck. He slides his hand up to her breasts. Cindy
           turns her head in the other direction. She pushes his hand
           away. He brings it back aggressive. Again. Cindy squirms 
           underneath him. He grabs her wrists and holds her arms over
           her head. His tongue licks Cindy from her breasts to her
           face. She worms her arms away and grabs onto his hair. She
           arches her back, looks at him through slit eyes. His pelvis
           pulses and he moans. He looks up at her over his brow into
           her desperate eyes. He springs up. Sweat beads on his
           forehead.
                         
                          DEAN
           What!? I can't have sex with my wife!?
                         
           Cindy covers her face with her hand.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           Do I repulse you that much? I'm good to
           you. I'm good to Frankie. I deserve a
           little affection. Do you want me to stop
           loving you? Do you want me to fuck other
           women? Do you want me to beat you?

           Is that what you think you deserve? Would

           Cindy raises her hips and slips off her panties. She lifts
           the shirt up over her head, positions her feet on the door
           jam. Her arm falls over her eyes. Breathless, Dean awkwardly
           moves one hand up and down her bodice.

           He unbuckles his belt, pushes his pants and underwear down to
           his knees, holds himself in his hand. He lowers onto her.
           Cindy adjusts her legs higher. He rotates his hips, looks
           away in concentration. Cindy's arms move around him, grabbing
           the small of his arching back. His pelvis humps in a feeble
           performance. A small moan. Cindy's eyes press closed harder.
           The erratic motion slows... stops. Dean's raspy breathing.
           His weight covers Cindy. She opens her eyes to the ceiling. 
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...
                         
           She looks at him. His head faces away. She rolls out from
           underneath and stands. She wraps her dress around her and
           slips into the bedroom.

           Back against the closed door, Cindy turns the lock. Her eyes
           shift from despair to relief. Her gaze grows more wild. The
           doorknob jiggles. A secret, crazy laugh builds in Cindy that
           she suppresses. Dean presses his face into the bedroom door. 
           He talks to her. 
                         
           On the other side of the door, Cindy listens. Dean's voice
           cracks. A wave of confusion backs Cindy away from the door.
           She searches the room for an escape. There are no windows,
           the only way out is through the locked door. Trembling, she
           wraps her arms around herself. She tries to make herself as
           small as possible. The spaceship bed is the only place where
           she can disappear. She crawls underneath the covers, curls
           into a tight ball. Sadness lets loose. Cindy's body pulses
           with faint, painful tears. The black walls of the room
           twinkle with stars suspended in space. The cries get lost.

           Drunk, Dean and Cindy make out on the street corner. It is
           cold enough to see their breath. Their hands caress each
           other, feel what is underneath the layers of clothes. Cindy
           makes a move. She unbuttons Dean's Pea-Coat, feels the shape
           of his chest, his abdomen, his back.
                         
                          CINDY

           Dean follows suit, reaching up under her jacket to touch the
           skin on her lower back. She recoils from the icy touch.
                         
                          CINDY

           They make out in the back of a cab. But the cab driver won't
           allow it. But they can't keep their hands off each other.
           They try not to get caught.

           The door to Jake's room is cracked open and the TV is on.
           Dean and Cindy tiptoe in the apartment as quietly as they
           can. They can't keep their hands off each other. Dean makes a
           bed for them on the couch where he sleeps - straightening out
           a couple white sheets. They crawl under with clothes on.
                         
                          CINDY (WHISPERS)

           I don't know. Let me go check.
                         
           Dean tiptoes over to Jake's room. Peeks in his door. Returns
           to the couch where Cindy is taking off her jacket. He crawls
           back under the sheet.
                         
           DEAN (WHISPERS) (cont'd)
           He's just watching TV.
                         
           They start to make out while listening for Jake.
                         
                          CINDY (WHISPERS)
           Do you think he's gonna come out?

           brushed his teeth?
                         
           She nods. He throws off the sheet and goes into the bathroom,
           touches the bristles of Jake's tooth brush. Cindy takes off
           her socks and waits for Dean to return.

           It's still dry.
                         
           He gets back on the couch. They kiss. Slowly. Silently. Their
           hands search each other under the blanket. Clothing is
           removed and there is alot of movement, but the details of
           what occurs under that single sheet remain largely a mystery.
                         
           Jake's bedroom door opens and Jake walks out into the living
           room and into the kitchen. Dean and Cindy pantomime sleeping.
           They listen and hear Jake opening the refrigerator, pouring
           himself a bowl of cereal, crunching. They feel like he's
           watching them. Cindy tries her hardest not to laugh. Jake
           stares at the trembling sheet with contempt before returning
           to his room. Cindy releases her laugh. Dean tries to shush
           her, but he can't help laughing himself.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           Be quiet! Seriously. He's gonna kill me.
           He already hates me.
                         
                          CINDY
           You think he's gonna go to sleep now?
                         
           They hear Jake changing channels in the other room. As
           quietly as possible, they have sex under the sheet.

           A red plus sign bleeds onto the result area of a home
           pregnancy test. Cindy sits on a toilet in a stall holding the
           positive test stick. A knock on the BATHROOM door.

           She wraps the test in toilet paper and buries it in the trash

           Cindy opens the stall and confronts herself in the mirror.

           The note reads: I don't know if I can trust you. Can I trust

           The DOCTOR wheels over to the table in the center of the

           I'm going to have you lie up here, and

           Cindy gets on the table, looks over at a tray of instruments.
           The Doctor pulls a mask up over her face - the vacuum
           aspirator on a wheeled base. Cindy focuses her gaze at the
           corrugated ceiling, dim light.

           The Doctor touches Cindy's knee to spread her legs, picks up
           an instrument off the table.
                         
                          DOCTOR
           I want you to try and relax. This is
           going to be a little cold.
                         
           The Doctor inserts a speculum into Cindy's vagina.

           Doctor picks up a syringe.

           What's that?
                         
                          DOCTOR
           This is a mild anesthetic for your
           cervix. You're going to feel a pinch and
           then it's going to feel like electricity.
                         
           Cindy looks back up at the ceiling. She steady's her breath.
                         
                          DOCTOR (CONT'D)
           Can you cough for me.
                         
           Cindy coughs.

           Wheels move across the linoleum floor. The Doctor positions
           the vacuum aspirator.
                         
                          CINDY

           Cindy cuts herself off. The Doctor holds a hose.

           It won't take long. You may feel a little
           cramping.
                         
           The Doctor turns on the vacuum. Panic flushes Cindy's face.
           Her eyes widen.

           uterus. TROY, Bobby's wrestler friend, sits nearby.
                         
           The waiting room door opens, Cindy comes out. Dean puts the
           model back and stands up. They stare at each other. Dean nods
           slightly. Cindy shakes her head "no." A flush of realization
           across Dean's face, then a smile. He goes to her and wraps
           his arms around her.

           bright bus. Her head rests on his chest, arms holding his
           encircling arms. She is wearing the locket around her neck.
           Dean caresses Cindy's earlobe. Her eyes are closed.

           from the night before. She lifts her cell phone off the

           A SOUND - Cindy turns around sees her mom in the doorway.

           The car drives down a highway toward the city. TONY powers
           down beers in the back. Underwear hangs from the rearview.
                         
           BOBBY (V.O.)
           ...And I got nothing better to do than
           destroy you both. BEEP If you think I'm
           being evil, you have no idea, no idea at

           really don't give a fuck anymore...
                         
           Bobby shotguns a beer in the passenger's seat. Speed metal
           music and adrenaline. The car blasts down the street to the
           storage facility. The three bound out of the car, fists
           clenched, geared up for ultraviolence.

           They storm the reception. The office is empty - Jo is on her
           lunch break. Troy tries the door leading to the garage, it is
           locked. So he squeezes through the receptionist window, feels
           underneath the desk for the door release button. Tony yanks
           on the door. The door buzzes open and the gang, Bobby in the
           lead, rush into the cacophonous garage.

           Dean is all alone in the garage, loading up a truck with
           reams of cardboard boxes for a big job tomorrow. Bobby and
           gang search through a maze of yellow trucks.
                         
                          BOBBY

                          BOBBY (CONT'D)

           Who's askin'?
                         
           Bobby rushes him, throws a shoulder into his stomach. They
           both flail to the floor. The two lock. Everything is quick.
           Bobby sends a flurry of punches to Dean's ribs and guts. Dean
           pummels the back of Bobby's head with blind overhead rights.
           It becomes clear that Bobby has the upper hand. He holds
           Dean's bloodied head in some kind of jiujitsu headlock.
                         
                          BOBBY

           Dean struggles to breathe but manages to say...
                         
                          DEAN
           I think you're a fucking idiot.
                         
           Bobby hits him again, harder. Harder.
                         
                          BOBBY

           herself that everything is all right. Paces her room... Picks

           Troy whistles sharp, warning Bobby that Jo has just arrived.
           Bobby kicks Dean while he's down. Dean is beat and Bobby is
           running out of breath and strength.

           Bobby looks at his bloodied hands. He lacks the strength to
           lift he arms. Gives one last weak kick into Dean's bloodied
           face. Troy and Tony pull Bobby out. The gang leaves,
           victorious yet somehow defeated. The office phone, which has
           been ringing incessantly, stops.
                         
           Dean is on the floor in the fetal position. It takes him a
           while, but he manages to sit up. He feels the inside of his
           split lip with his tongue. He doesn't feel pain as much as he
           feels tingling and ringing - all over. Jo comes in. She
           freezes when she sees him.

           It takes Dean a while to get up, but he does. And it takes
           him a while to get to the office where his phone call awaits.
           Once there, he holds the receiver in his hand for a beat...

           Cindy. What's going on here?
                         
           Cindy points to Maria.

           Hello Mrs. Guevara. I'm Dr. Feinberg. I'm

           He reaches for the trembling Maria's blouse. Maria flinches.

           You need to fill that out, sir. You can

           There's nothing wrong with me.
                         
           Dean hands her back the clipboard.

           I got a ride.
                         
           Mimi appears behind Cindy.

           - I was going out of my mind. I didn't
           know if there's an emergency. I didn't
           know if Francis was hurt. Did you think
           about that?

           You're done. Leave.
                         
           Dean jerks Cindy up off the floor.
                         
                          DEAN
           Get up.
                         
           She hits Dean with a flurry of flailing fists.
                         
                          CINDY
           You son of a bitch!
                         
           Punches catch him in the nose. Cindy bullies Dean backwards
           with repeated shoves to the chest. He backs up down the
           hallway. Mimi stands in the hallway.
                         
                          MIMI
           Oh my god. Call 911. I'm going to call
           911.
                         
           The doors slide open and Dean backs outside.

           She digs into his pocket and fishes them out. She marches to
           the car, gets in the driver's seat, starts the car - the
           radio blasts at high decibels. Dean bangs on the passenger
           side window. Cindy flips the lock. Dean gets in the car.
                         
                          CINDY (CONT'D)
           I want a divorce!
                         
           She has emptied herself. Her whole body is numb and it feels
           as if she is floating in space. Anger overcomes Dean. He hits
           the dashboard with concrete fists.
                         
                          DEAN
           I know!
                         
           He grabs the suitcase next to him and opens the door. He
           throws it through the air into a FIELD - trying rid himself
           of pain, longing, and desperation. He clutches his wedding
           ring, but can't yank it off of his fat finger. Finally, he
           gets it off and tosses it into the field. The moment he
           releases it, he wishes he hadn't.
                         
           MOMENTS LATER - Dean and Cindy search for the ring. It is
           lost. Music begins to play in reverse.

           We follow Dean from behind - walking down the middle of the
           street. He holds the flowers. Meanwhile, we hear Cindy asking
           her gramma questions about love and life. "What's it like to
           be old?" - "when did men stop looking at you?" She confides
           her feelings for Dean. (The responses will be real responses -
           a real conversation).

           Dean finds the house. He straightens himself, walks to the
           front door, rings the BELL, checks the smell of his hands.
                         
           Jerry, bourbon in hand, opens the door. Dean's face is purple
           and swollen from the fight.
                         
                          DEAN
           I didn't know if it was pot luck so I
           brought an eggplant.
                         
           He points at his face. Behind Jerry, Cindy peeks out from the
           kitchen at the end of the hallway. It is the first time she
           has seen Dean since the fight. She is shocked.
                         
                          DEAN (CONT'D)
           Face looks like an eggplant, don't it?
           How you doing sir, I'm Dean.
                         
           Dean holds out his hand. Jerry looks Dean up and down.
                         
                          CINDY
           Oh God.
                         
           Cindy squeezes by her father to Dean. The expression on her
           face says it all. Dean hands her the flowers, leans in and
           kisses her. While he's there he whispers.
                         
                          DEAN
           I stole these for you.
                         
                          CINDY
           Are you okay?
                         
           Dean nods. She leads him down the hall. Jerry stops, turns.
                         
           JERRY (to Cindy)
           Tell him to take off his shoes.
                         
           Dean removes his boots. A toe wiggles out of a holey sock. He
           gathers the hole and tucks it between his big toe and his
           second toe. Cindy leads him by the hand to the kitchen.

           - They eat. Dean compliments the meal. Glenda is self
           depreciating. Jerry is judgemental. Gramma wants to go home.
           Cindy can't take her eyes off of Dean - she has fallen.

           She begins gently kissing Dean's wounds. Whispers.

           No. It feels good. Keep doing it.
                         
           She does and is interrupted by... The FAINT SOUND of her
           parents fighting downstairs.
                         
           JERRY (O.S.)
           ...She's going to struggle the rest of

           And that's okay with you. Sit there...sit

           Maybe I should go.

           Cindy goes over to her stereo and turns on some music, low -
           it is the same song that Dean and Cindy listened to in the
           moon room. It drowns out some of the fighting. She approaches
           him, starts unbuttoning his shirt.

           She kisses him. Opens up his shirt. Reveals a severely
           bruised torso. He winces a bit from the movement. She
           redresses his wounds, nursing him back to health.

           She kisses his chest. Dean starts getting underneath Cindy's
           clothes. He places his palm on her belly.

           From here on out, their actions increase with urgency. Each

           they hear a door slam downstairs.

           Cindy puts on a simple yellow dress. She checks herself in
           the mirror. Her hand traces the bump on her belly.

           Cindy pours a glass of water. She gulps down aspirin. Dean
           keeps his distance at the edge of the room.
                         
           In the backyard, Frankie makes herself dizzy by twirling.
           Jerry cranes his neck to look into the window of his house.
                         
                          CINDY
           I'm not coming home.
                         
           Fear strikes Dean. He presses the base of his palms into his
           eyes, rubbing until he sees stars.
                         
                          DEAN
           We're not alone here Cynthia. We have a
           little girl. We need to think about her.
                         
                          CINDY
           I am thinking about her.
                         
                          DEAN
           All you're thinking about is yourself.
           You. Francis is gonna grow up in a broken
           home and that's OK with you.
                         
                          CINDY
           I can't let her grow up in a home where
           her parents don't love each other.
                         
                          DEAN
           Don't love each other? I've only ever
           loved you.
                         
           Dean approaches her from behind. Reaches out...

           Dean wears his baby blue tux. He looks himself up and down in
           the mirror. Takes a deep breath.

           Cindy flinches from Dean's touch. A look of terror in her
           eyes. Dean hushes her. He leads her to a chair and sits her
           down. He kneels by her side and repeats her name.

           He holds her hands and gropes her arms, legs, shoulders
           whatever she will let him touch. Cindy has tears in her eyes
           but she is focused. There is nothing to say.

           Dean takes a quarter, places it in a gumball machine, turns
           the crank. A plastic box rolls out. He takes it, shakes it -
           inside is a plastic ring. She takes a quarter and follows
           suit, buying another plastic ring.

           In THE KITCHEN, Frankie climbs in through the old dog door.
           She sees her father kneeling on the floor at her mother's
           feet. Perplexed, she pulls at her bottom lip with her finger.
           Cindy releases herself from Dean's grip and goes to her
           suitcase. She carries it up the stairs.

           Dean and Cindy wait together in a room filled with other
           people about to get married. They observe these other people
           and create fictional narratives about them and their lives
           for each other.

           Cindy opens the door and sets her suitcase on the dusty bed.
           The room is just like it used to be.

           Dean is defeated. He sits back against the cupboards and
           hangs his head down low between his knees. Frankie touches
           his shoulders. She gives him a massage.
                         
                          FRANKIE
           I want to stay at Grampa's house next
           time for fifty nights.
                         
           Dean looks up. He has tears in his eyes. Frankie touches one
           as it streams down his face.
                         
                          FRANKIE (CONT'D)

           Dean can't answer. Frankie slides a chair over to the sink.
           She steps up and fills the glass with water. Balancing it
           still, she brings it to Dean. She takes a sip and hands the
           glass to him. He drinks.

           Dean stands and picks up Frankie. He walks to Cindy and hands

           Dean walks out the front door where he passes Jerry who
           stands on the porch. He moves across the lawn to the
           sidewalk. Vermillion light falls in the sky.
                         
           Cindy sets Frankie down and she runs out the door. Jerry
           catches the little girl by the arm and holds her tight.
                         
           Dean walks toward the horizon.

                          CINDY
           Let her go, Dad.
                         
           Jerry releases her and Frankie runs fast to Dean. She jumps
           at him to go into his arms. He doesn't pick her up. From the
           porch Cindy and Jerry watch Dean as he points to them.
           Frankie doesn't move. Dean yells for her to go back. Frankie
           heads back to her mother, confused. Cindy kneels down and
           takes her in her arms.

           The houses form neighborhoods that join with other

               A brown Pinto pulls out of a parking lot and into rush hour 
               traffic.

               INT. PINTO - DUSK

               BETH WALKER is driving. She looks younger, but she's twenty-
               eight. She has a strong face and flashing intelligent eyes. 
               She's wearing a WAITRESS UNIFORM from Friendly's. She's deep 
               in thought.

               Beth pulls up to stoplight and stops.

               SOUND: A gentle toot of car horn.

               Beth looks up, startled.

               BETH'S POV

               SID, a pleasant looking twenty-four year old, is in a pick-
               up truck next to her. He smiles and points up toward the 
               traffic light.

               BETH

               She looks up toward the traffic light.

               TRAFFIC LIGHTS

               They're red except for one with a lit green arrow.

               BETH AND SID

               She pantomimes that she's in the wrong lane and wants to go 
               straight.

               Sid pantomimes that he'll let her cut in front of him.

               SOUND: Horns honk impatiently.

               THE INTERSECTION

               Beth pulls away in front of the pick-up truck. The HONKING 
               continues. Sid looks back at the honking car, cheerfully 
               waves to it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CAROL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               A tiny well-kept Spanish style home in lower middle class 
               residential section.

               INT. CAROL'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               It's neat and smartly furnished -- discount Swedish modern, 
               framed deco posters, some nice plants. The only problem is 
               it seems a little more like a well-designed waiting room 
               than a home.

               There's an empty ice bucket, several empty liquor bottles, 
               and a swinging metal ball thingabobby on a chrome and glass 
               coffee table in front of leather sofa.

               CAROL AND NICK are curled up together on the sofa, drinks in 
               hand.

               They're both in their late twenties. Carol's dressed in the 
               casually stylish clothes worn by women who work in shopping 
               mall boutiques.

               Nick's clothes are frumpled, a knit tie loose around his 
               neck. They've achieved a state of contemplative drunkenness.

               Carol sips her drink. Nick sips his drink. Carol sips her 
               drink. Nick brings his glass to his lips, hesitates...

                                     NICK
                              (flatly)
                         We're moving.

                                     CAROL
                         What?

                                     NICK

                         Yeah.

               Carol shakes her head in weary disbelief.

                         Thanks for the news...

               She knocks back her drink. Nick broods.

                         I haven't known for long. I just 
                         decided.

                         these decisions?

               Carol stares at him. He knocks back his drink.

                                     CAROL
                         You got me.

               She pours herself another drink.

               She stops at an intersection.

                         Whatever makes me happy. That's what 
                         she says...

               Headlights flash from behind her. She turns and looks.

               BETH'S POV

               Sid's smiling from his truck right behind her. He flashes 
               his lights again.

               INT. BETH'S PINTO

               Beth looks up in the rearview mirror, amused.

               REARVIEW MIRROR

               Sid turns off, disappearing into the night.

               BETH

               Surprised to find herself vaguely disappointed, she drives 
               on.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAROL'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

               It's small, prefab, and tidy. It has a counter with shutters 
               that open onto the living room. Nick is kneeling, going 
               through bottles in a cabinet.

               Nick stands, with an almost empty bottle of Johnny Walker 
               Red.

                                     NICK
                         I know what happens here.

               He pours himself a drink. Carol shuts the cabinet.

                         I know what's going to happen.

               Nick opens a cabinet under the sink and tosses the empty 
               bottle in the trash. He begins to pace. Carol shuts the 
               cabinet and follows him with her gaze.

               As Nick speaks, he gestures grandly with his drink, liquor 
               splashing unnoticed over the sides.

               Beth pulls up to a stoplight, her face blank with thought. 
               She's suddenly lit by the flash of headlights going on and 
               off. She looks up and smiles.

               EXT. INTERSECTION - CONTINUOUS

               Sid's pick-up truck is facing her across the intersection. 
               It slowly pulls up beside her and stops.

               He smiles and gives a little wave of his hand.

               Without knowing why, she smiles and waves back.

                                     BETH

               She drives away. Sid stares after her.

               INT. CAROL'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Carol lifts the end metal ball on the thingabobby and releases 
               it, starting the chain reaction. She stares at it clacking 
               back and forth as she speaks.

               Carol stops the metal ball. She releases two balls, starting 
               a new chain reaction.

                                     NICK

               Nick slumps on the sofa beside her.

                         Hey. Think about this. You take a 
                         detour and go through Vegas -- you 
                         and Beth stop, see a show, have a 
                         nice romantic dinner -- play the 
                         slots, get the free drinks...

                              (interrupting)
                         Too much money. The show. The meal. 
                         The slots. Then the hotel -- that's 
                         another hundred down the toilet.

               As Carol speaks she pokes at Nick. He fends off her blows. 
               By the end of her speech she is on top of him mock-strangling 
               him.

                                     CAROL
                              (jabbing Nick)
                         No, you skip the hotel. It's night, 
                         the highway's empty -- you can make 
                         good time. You start speeding. You 
                         get stopped in Utah by the cops -- 
                         you flunk the breathalizer, they 
                         haul you in. The judge is Mormon -- 
                         you get fifteen years, you go to 
                         prison, but at least your life has 
                         taken a direction!

               Nick and Carol collapse into laughter. The front door opens.

                                     BETH

                         I'm here!

               Beth steps in. Carol quickly lets go of Nick's neck and gets 
               off him.

               NICK AND CAROL

               Embarrassed, they both smile self-consciously.

               There's an awkward instant followed by too much cheerfulness.

               interrupted something.

               Nick and Beth are standing in the lawn, lit by the glow of 
               the porch lamp.

               Both sides of the street are lined with nearly identical 
               tiny faux Spanish houses.

               smiles to herself, a trace of sadness in her eyes.

               She shuts the door.

               NICK AND BETH

               She starts to walk across the lawn. She stops and stares at 
               Nick, who's staring out into the night, oblivious to her.

               He walks up to her and past her -- when she doesn't fall 
               into step, he stops.

               She pulls away from him and starts walking to the house next

                         That's right.

                         I know...

                         And we're moving. She won't be your 
                         best friend anymore.

               They arrive at their front door. Beth takes out her keys. 
               Nick stops her hand and kisses her. She kisses him back.

                                     NICK
                         Living with someone isn't such a big 
                         deal.

               She nods and looks to the lock.

                                     NICK
                         Anyway... I live with you now.

               Beth looks to Nick. He stares out at the night.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CLOSE-UP: COFFEE-MAKER

               The coffee-maker clock hits nine o'clock. The coffee maker 
               clicks on with a rattle. Steam starts to spew out.

               The coffee-maker makes horrible gurgling sounds.

               INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

               The kitchen is small and a little grimy, its furnishings 
               fatigued.

               Nick stares at the coffee-maker in disbelief. He's dressed 
               in a dress shirt, untied necktie, and slacks. He's carrying 
               a sportscoat with a Sears' employee name-tag attached.

                                     NICK
                              (calling out)
                         Beth!... Beth!!

               Beth walks into the kitchen, wearing a robe and carrying the 
               paper.

               Nick points accusingly at the coffee maker as water pours 
               down from around its top.

                                     NICK
                         It's... it's raining!

                         It does that.

               She drops the paper on the kitchen table and gets a mug off 
               the counter.

                         What's wrong with it?

                         Water comes out.

                         Shit.

                         I hate this shit! It never kept the 
                         coffee hot. And now this.

               He angrily wraps the cord around the coffee-maker.

                                     BETH
                              (blowing on her coffee)
                         It still works.

                         No. It doesn't. Water comes out.

                         Okay.

               She sips her coffee. She flips open a box of Dunkin' Donuts.

                                     NICK
                         I could've gotten a new one. On my

                         Do you want a donut?

                         No. I want an appliance that works.

               Beth shrugs and takes a donut out of the box. She leans 
               against the counter, eating the donut.

               Nick walks past Beth and jams the coffee maker into the trash.

                                     NICK
                         This coffee maker was junk.

               Nick pushes a button on the blender. It makes a horrible 
               GRINDING WHINE. He unplugs it.

                         But at our age...

               They stare at each other. Nick picks the almost full pint 
               bottle of scotch off the counter and puts it in his jacket 
               pocket. Beth takes another donut.

               Beth is holding a donut and her coffee mug. Nick tosses his

                         them...

               Beth sips her coffee, waiting for Nick to decide.

                         Don't wanna be late on my last day.

               He kisses Beth, surprising her. He presses against her. He 
               takes the donut from her hand and takes a bite.

               Beth kisses Nick, his mouth still full of donut.

               About hundred cars dot the vast parking lot.

               Nick swings into a parking spot and gets out of the car. He 
               tosses his jacket on the roof and crouches, tieing his necktie 
               using the car's outside mirror.

               jacket and tie, is grinning at the crouched Nick. Nick's 
               reflection grins back.

               NICK AND CHIP

               Nick straightens up and grabs his jacket. They start walking 
               toward the mall.

                                     CHIP
                         Nothing much.

                         Yeah. I'm outta here.

               They approach the employees entrance.

               Nick opens the door.

               Nick follows Chip in.

               CLOSE-UP - NEWSPAPER

               The front page of the Phoenix Sun-Times -- the headline reads 
               "Misery Index Soars".

               Beth's hand comes INTO FRAME and crumples the page.

               INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

               Beth stuffs the paper in a glass and wraps the glass in 
               another piece. She's sitting on the floor, surrounded by 
               dishes, newspaper, and cardboard liquor boxes. She adds the 
               wrapped glass to a box.

               She hears the SOUND of a CAR DOOR SLAMMING, looks up, then 
               returns to her packing. She reaches behind herself into the 
               trash, pulls out the blender, and begins to wrap it.

               At the SOUND of the FRONT DOOR opening, followed by a curious 
               METALLIC CLUNKING, she stands and hurries through the swinging 
               door to the living room.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               The living room is sparsely furnished -- a sofa, a coffee 
               table, a bookcase cluttered with a handful of paperbooks, a 
               couple of boardgames, a dying cactus, etc. A crappy old 
               fifteen inch t.v. on a t.v. tray. WE SEE this for a moment 
               before...

               A paint-splattered cloth is unfurled FILLING THE SCREEN.

               It gently floats down, revealing a PAINTER and his shopping 
               cart overloaded with supplies. He's dressed in paint-
               splattered clothes. A paint-splattered Red Sox cap is pulled 
               low over his eyes, obscuring his face.

               Beth stares in disbelief. Without seeing her, the painter 
               backs up, his attention focused on spreading the dropcloth.

                                     BETH
                         Who are you?

                                     SID
                              (not looking up)
                         The painter.

                                     BETH
                              (agitated)
                         What are you doing?

                                     SID
                         Painting.

               The painter looks up from the drop-cloth, ready to deal with 
               this obstacle. He freezes. His face lights up.

               It's Sid.

                                     SID
                              (extremely pleased)
                         Well, good morning...

                                     BETH
                              (recognizing him)
                         You...

                                     SID
                              (extending a hand)
                         Sid. Nice to see you again.

               Beth stares in agitated disbelief.

               With his untaken extended hand, he pulls a long strip of 
               masking tape from a roll around his wrist, masking one side 
               of the door frame from top to bottom.

                                     BETH
                         Why are you here?

                                     SID
                         Realty office likes a fresh coat 
                         between tenants.

                                     BETH
                              (pointedly)
                         We're still here.

               He stands on his tiptoes and puts a strip of masking tape on 
               the top edge of the doorframe.

                                     SID
                         I've done this house before.
                              (admiringly)
                         I did a nice job.

               He masks the remaining side of the door frame.

                                     BETH
                         Can't you come back tomorrow?

                                     SID
                         Tomorrow's Sunday.

                                     BETH
                         Yeah...?

                                     SID
                         The new people move in on Sunday.
                              (conversationally)
                         Where are you moving to?

                                     BETH
                              (wearily)
                         Billings, Montana.

               Sid moves to a window.

                                     SID
                              (incredulous)
                         Why?

                                     BETH
                         It can't be worse than Enfield, 
                         Arizona.

               Sid pulls a strip of tape off the roll.

                                     SID
                              (smiling)
                         I've lived in Enfield my whole life.

               He holds out the end of the masking tape.

                                     SID
                         Could you hold this?

               Beth takes it. He walks backwards, easing a long strip of 
               tape off the roll.

                                     SID
                         I use this to mask. Have you ever 
                         used masking tape to mask?

               He tears the tape off the roll and sticks it to the top of 
               the baseboard in one corner.

                                     BETH
                         No. I haven't.

               Crouched, he waddles across the room toward Beth, applying 
               the masking tape to the baseboard. He gets to Beth, stands 
               up, takes the tape off her fingers, and presses it into place.

                                     SID
                         A house like this, it's real easy. 
                         Hardly needs a paint job.

                                     BETH
                         You can skip it. I won't tell.

                                     SID
                         It needs a fresh coat...

               He hands her the end of the tape again and begins another 
               baseboard.

                                     SID
                         ...a little color.

                                     BETH
                              (naturally curious)
                         What color is it gonna be?

                                     SID
                         Off-white.

               He goes along the floor pressing the masking tape to the 
               baseboard.

                                     BETH
                         It's already off-white.

                                     SID
                         No. It's white. It's just dirty.

               Beth looks at the walls. He's right.

                                     SID
                         Now if it was my house, I would choose 
                         a color...

               Beth kneels down, holding the tape, as he arrives at her end 
               of the wall.

                                     SID
                         I would not choose off-white.

               Beth holds out the tape. They are kneeling next to each other.

                                     BETH
                         What would you choose?

                                     SID
                         The color of your eyes.
                              (pause, without looking)
                         Hazel.

               Beth stares at Sid. Sid looks to Beth. Smiling, he takes the 
               tape from her fingers.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PIZZA HUT - AFTERNOON

               An oasis in the center of a packed mall parking lot. Carol 
               hurries toward the front entrance in a snappy skirt and blazer 
               combo, a Bullock's name tag attached to her lapel.

               INT. PIZZA HUT - CONTINUOUS

               Nick is sitting at a booth, a beer in front of him, lost in 
               thought.

               Carol arrives, drops a gift-wrapped box on the table, and 
               scoots into the booth.

                                     CAROL
                         Sorry I'm late, the new girl's a 
                         moron.

                                     NICK
                              (looking to the present)
                         What's that?

                                     CAROL
                         Going away present.

               Nick takes it.

                                     NICK
                         Thanks.

               He quickly unwraps it.

                                     NICK
                              (happily)
                         A map!

                                     CAROL
                         I thought you might need it.

                                     NICK
                              (unfolding it)
                         I do! I had a map -- I lost it.

               He spreads the map out over the table.

                                     CAROL
                              (organized)
                         Let's highlight your route.

               A MAP

               of the Western half of the U.S.A. fills the FRAME. Carol's 
               hand, holding a bright red felt-tip pen, ENTERS FRAME.

                                     CAROL (O.S.)
                         Here's Enfield.

               She circles it. Nick's finger ENTERS FRAME.

                                     NICK (O.S.)
                         Here's Billings.

               Carol circles Billings. Nick's finger starts to trace the 
               route.

               Carol's pen follows, marking the route. Halfway to Billings, 
               Nick's finger abruptly stops. Carol stops the pen at the 
               same point.

                                     NICK (O.S.)
                         Look at this -- right there -- that's 
                         the town I was born in.

               NICK AND CAROL

               He looks to her for a reaction.

                                     NICK
                              (emphatically)
                         Where I grew up. Where my parent's 
                         live... Isn't that a coincidence?

                                     CAROL
                         Visit them.

                                     NICK
                              (shaking his head)
                         Oh... no...

                                     CAROL
                         You're going to be driving by.

                                     NICK
                         No...
                              (shaking his head)
                         They're not near the interstate.
                              (sort of chagrined)
                         I haven't even called them in years.

                                     CAROL
                         You might as well visit.

                                     NICK
                              (adamantly)
                         No.
                              (shrugging)
                         I wouldn't know them.

               Nick starts to fold the map -- very unsuccessfully.

                                     NICK
                         Shit.

                                     CAROL
                         Let me.

               Nick hands her the map. She deftly folds it in one motion 
               and hands it back to him.

                                     NICK
                         Thanks.

               He leans over the table and kisses her. She stands.

                                     CAROL
                         I'm starved.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BETH AND NICK'S LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

               Two of the walls gleam with fresh paint.

               Sid is painting with long-handled roller.

               Beth, enters, hesitates, and then -- consciously ignoring 
               him -- walks by with a packed box and adds it to the stack 
               by the front door.

                                     SID
                         I'm lucky I don't have to kill them.

                                     BETH
                              (not a line she was 
                              expecting)
                         What?

                                     SID
                         If they were dark, I'd have to put a 
                         layer of kill down first.

               Beth starts back to the kitchen. Sid and THE CAMERA FOLLOW.

                                     SID
                         So the dark paint wouldn't shine 
                         through the off-white.

               INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

               The dishes are mostly packed.

                                     BETH
                         Oh.

               She picks up two empty liquor boxes.

                         Kill's an oil based paint.

               Beth carries the boxes out of the kitchen -- Sid and THE 
               CAMERA FOLLOW.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Beth walks right on through followed by the talking Sid and 
               THE CAMERA.

                                     SID
                         It covers the old paint so that you'd 
                         never know it was there, but it gives 
                         off fumes when it's drying.

               Beth goes into the small hallway, Sid and THE CAMERA FOLLOW.

               INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

               Beth walks toward the bedroom, Sid right behind her.

                                     SID
                         Noxious fumes. They would find us on 
                         the floor unconscious.

               They enter the bedroom, THE CAMERA FOLLOWING.

               INT. BEDROOM

               There's a queen-sized bed, a bureau, a mirror, and a closet.

               Beth takes the boxes to the closet.

                                     BETH
                         They?

               Sid sits on the bed, checking it's firmness.

                                     SID
                         The "they" that find people...

                              (interjecting)
                         Nick.

                                     SID
                         ...unconscious.

                                     BETH

                         Nick.
                              (after a beat)
                         The man I live with.

                                     SID
                              (smiling)
                         I guess he'd be the "they".

                                     BETH
                         He'd find us. And he'd be surprised.

               Sid gets off the bed and with a grin, gingerly pats out the 
               wrinkles he's made in the bed spread.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON

               Nick and Carol are walking away from the Pizza Hut, across a 
               huge parking lot, toward a large mall. Cars circle past them, 
               searching for close spots.

                                     NICK
                              (doggedly)
                         It was the drive that killed us. San 
                         Antonio to Seattle is just too many 
                         hours in a car. If we'd have flown, 
                         we would've made it.

                                     CAROL
                              (shaking her head)
                         No...

                         Things were all right in bed.

                                     CAROL
                         But the rest of the time they were... 
                         awful.

                                     NICK
                              (hurt)
                         Really?

                                     CAROL
                              (flatly)
                         Nick. We couldn't stand each other. 
                         We stopped in Enfield and just stayed.

                                     NICK
                              (after a beat)
                         Why didn't you go on to Seattle? It 
                         was your car.

               Carol stops. On her face, the answer to his question is clear -- 
               she was stuck on Nick then and she's still stuck on him now.

               But she'd never let him know that.

                                     CAROL
                              (dryly)
                         Big trees scare me.

               She starts walking. Nick hurries up beside her. They walk 
               side by side for a few paces before the shotdown Nick comes 
               up with a new ploy to win favor.

                                     NICK

               Beth's taking extra sheets and towels from the linen closet 
               and packing them in liquor boxes.

               Sid enters from the living room.

                         I'm done in there. I won't paint the 
                         ceiling 'til you've moved the 
                         furniture out.

                         I don't think we're going to take 
                         much of the furniture.

                                     SID
                         No?

                         It's ugly.

                         I kind of like the sofa.

                         It's a sofa bed.

                                     SID
                         You're not going to take it?

                                     BETH
                              (flatly)
                         It weighs two thousand pounds.

                                     SID
                         Can I have it?

                         It's yours.

                         Excellent.

               INT. THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               The furniture is kind of ugly, but the walls look great. The 
               whole room seems brighter, almost magically more cheerful.

               Sid runs into the room and flops onto the sofa. He settles 
               in and sighs contentedly.

               The front door BURSTS open. Sid leaps up.

               Carol races into the room.

                                     CAROL
                              (excited)
                         Nick's gonna steal a t.v.!

               She sees Sid and freezes.

                                     CAROL
                         Who are you?

                         The painter.

               Beth hurries into the living room.

                                     BETH
                              (excitedly)

                         He says yes.

               Carol glances pointedly at Sid then returns her attention to 
               Beth.

                                     CAROL

                         It's not a crime.

                         Sid.

               He holds out a hand to shake. Carol stares at his outstretched 
               hand.

               Carol takes Beth by the arm and leads her away from Sid. She 
               stares back over her shoulder at Sid.

               Taking the hint, he begins to stir a can of paint, assuming 
               an air of indifference. Carol turns her attention back to 
               Beth.

               In the BACKGROUND, on the big screen t.v., the soap actress 
               breaks the embrace and points a gun at the actor.

               The soap actress shoots the actor. He stares at her in 
               overacting disbelief and slumps to the floor.

                         I also mow lawns.

                              (dryly)
                         That is true.

               Sid wads the tape into a big ball.

                         I work on it.

               Sid shoots the tape ball into his shopping cart of supplies.

                                     SID
                         Do you want to get stoned?

               Carol thinks for a moment. It's been a long time and she's 
               not crazy about him being there.

               Sid takes a joint out of his shirt pocket.

                         It's not very good. It's homegrown.

               He takes a drag.

               He hands the joint to Carol.

               CAROL

               takes a drag on the joint like an old pro.

               Nick put his arm around the man's shoulder and guides him

               dumbfounded at the tiny t.v. He looks to Nick.

                         Think about American. They're mostly

               Beth stares at Nick, amazed that he's managed to come up 
               with a plan that has her taking the television.

               Beth rides down on the escalator, the receipt clenched in 
               her hand, surrounded by other shoppers, as a tinny Muzak 
               version of the "Theme from The Mary Tyler Moore Show" drones 
               on in the background.

               Conflicting emotions cloud her face.

               The sun is low, giving the room a golden glow.

               Sid and Beth are sitting on the sofa, the t.v. box on the 
               floor in front of them.

               Sid opens the television box. Slowly, he pulls out the sheets 
               of bubbled packing plastic. He pops several of the bubbles.

                         C'mon! You stole it. You gotta see 
                         it! Hold the box.

               Beth holds the box. Sid starts to lift out the television.

                                     SID
                              (urgently)
                         Wait!

               Beth looks to him, anxiously.

                         I thought I heard the police.

               Beth listens, nervously. Sid grins.

               Embarrassed, Sid pulls Visine from a pocket and drips it in 
               his eyes as he speaks.

                         Carol's really stoned.

                                     BETH
                         You got Carol stoned?

                                     SID
                         Very stoned.

                                     BETH
                         I didn't think she liked you.

                                     SID
                         She doesn't. But she likes getting 
                         stoned.

                                     BETH
                              (smiling)
                         She does.

                                     SID
                         There's nothing like drugs to create 
                         a quick and shallow friendship.

               Beth laughs.

                                     SID
                              (rubbing his hands)
                         Let's look at the loot.

               Sid pulls the t.v. up and out of the box. He sits back on 
               the sofa, the t.v. in his lap.

               The t.v. is spectacular -- huge, metallic, and ultra-modern.

                                     SID
                              (very impressed)
                         Jesus... you didn't fool around.

                                     BETH
                              (w/ mixed emotions)
                         This is the nicest thing I've ever 
                         owned.

               Beth stares at the television. Sid stares at Beth. She meets 
               his eyes, then looks quickly back to the television.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT./EXT. SEDAN - ENFIELD'S MAIN DRAG - DUSK

               Nick is driving. His face is beaded with sweat as he drags 
               heavily on a cigarette. He pushes the buttons on his radio, 
               getting NEWS BROADCASTS.

                                     NEWSMAN'S VOICE
                         And in Canton, Ohio today, a man 
                         opened fire in a mall, killing nine 
                         and wounding seventeen others. Initial 
                         reports indicate the young man was a 
                         disgruntled employee...

               Nick turns the radio off.

               He pulls the scotch bottle from his jacket and takes a slug.

               He jerks his necktie loose and slips it over his head. He 
               tosses it into the back seat.

               NICK'S SEDAN

               swerves into a vast mall parking lot.

               EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - MINUTES LATER

               Through the flow of traffic, WE SEE Nick standing at a 
               payphone on the outside wall of a Red Lobster Restaurant.

               Nick speaks urgently into the phone, punctuating his 
               conversation with edgy body language. Abruptly, he hangs up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAROL'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

               Carol hangs up a wallphone. She leans against the 
               refridgerator, her expression a controlled blank. She turns 
               her head and looks out her kitchen window.

               CAROL'S POV

               Through Nick and Beth's living room window, WE SEE Sid 
               struggling under the weight of the t.v. as Beth laughingly 
               gestures where she wants it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BETH AND NICK'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Beth and Sid are kneeling on the floor in front of the t.v.

               Playing on the t.v. a rock video featuring girls, guitars, 
               and the endless highway.

                                     BETH
                         It's a beautiful picture.

               Sid takes the remote from Beth and turns the VOLUME UP very 
               loud.

                                     SID
                              (enthusiastically)
                         Nice speakers!

               Carol enters through the front door, unseen by the mesmerized 
               t. v. viewers.

                                     BETH
                              (happily)
                         Yeah!
                              (w/ happy disbelief)
                         Fuckin' Nick...

               Sid and Beth stare at the television, completely engrossed. 
               Carol stares at them for a long moment.

                                     CAROL
                              (over the din, dryly)
                         Hi, kids.

               Startled, Sid and Beth jump back. They look at each other 
               and laugh.

                                     BETH
                              (cheerfully)
                         Come see!

               Beth turns the VOLUME DOWN as Carol comes and looks at the 
               t.v.

                                     CAROL
                              (impressed)
                         I should have had him steal me one, 
                         too.

                                     BETH
                         You can come over and watch.

               Carol looks to Beth, a quizzical expression on her face.

                                     SID
                              (to Beth, quietly)
                         You're moving.

                                     BETH
                              (w/ a tinge of sadness)
                         Oh. Right.
                              (to Carol)
                         Sorry.

                                     CAROL
                         Forget it...

               Beth turns off the t.v. There's a moment of awkward silence 
               as they all stare at the blank screen.

                                     CAROL
                              (breaking the silence, 
                              pointedly)
                         How's the painting going?

                                     SID
                              (shaking his head)
                         Too many distractions. I'll be at it 
                         all night.

                                     CAROL
                         You have bad work habits.

                                     SID
                         Not when I'm actually working.
                              (standing)
                         I better get set up in the kitchen.

               He goes to his shopping cart of supplies. Carol and Beth 
               stare at the television.

               The television stares back at them, gleamingly modern.

                                     CAROL
                         It makes teevee seem very futuristic.

                                     SID
                              (at the kitchen door)
                         That's 'cause you're stoned.

                                     CAROL
                         I'm hardly stoned.

               She looks to Beth. Beth is grinning.

                                     CAROL
                              (mitigating)
                         It was homegrown.

                                     BETH
                              (teasing)
                         Want some Visine?

                                     CAROL
                              (flatly)
                         No.

                                     SID (O.S.)
                              (calling out)
                         It gets the red out.

               The Visine comes flying INTO FRAME. Carol fumbles, then 
               catches it.

                                     CAROL
                              (dryly)
                         Thank you.

               Carol tilts back her head and manuevers the Visine.

                                     CAROL
                         Shit. Missed the eye, got the face.

                                     BETH
                         Need help?

                                     CAROL
                         Yeah.

               Beth goes to her and takes the Visine.

                                     BETH
                         Okay.
                              (holding Carol's arm)
                         Tilt your head back.

                                     CAROL
                         Beth...

                                     BETH
                         Stop fidgeting.

               She puts a drop in one eye. Carol flinches.

                                     CAROL
                         Got it.

                                     BETH
                         Next eye.

                                     CAROL
                         Wait a second.

               Carol blinks and wipes a Visine tear off her cheek.

                                     CAROL
                              (nodding to the 
                              kitchen, in a 
                              conspiratorial whisper)
                         He really wants to get in your pants.

                                     BETH
                              (smiling)
                         My pants are taken.

               She tilts Carol's head back.

                                     BETH
                         Why don't you go for him?

                                     CAROL
                         He likes you.

               Beth puts a drop in Carol's eye. Carol flinches and rubs her 
               eye.

                                     BETH
                         I wish Nick would get back and help 
                         with the packing.

               She sighs, cheerfully exasperated.

                                     BETH
                         He's probably getting drunk with the 
                         stockboys...
                              (after a beat)
                         That's what he's probably doing.

               Carol braces herself.

                                     CAROL
                         Beth...
                              (pause, then w/ 
                              difficulty)
                         Listen...

               They stare into each other's eyes.

               After a long moment Carol averts her eyes and looks down.

                                     BETH
                              (simply)
                         He's gone.

                                     CAROL
                         Yeah.

                                     BETH
                              (badly shaken)
                         Where'd he call from?

                                     CAROL
                         He said the highway.

               Beth takes a deep breath, controlling her emotions.

                                     BETH
                         I have to do something.

                                     CAROL
                         I'll help.

                                     BETH
                         I've got to be out of here Sunday. 
                         That's tomorrow.

                                     CAROL
                         You can come to my place.

                                     BETH
                              (stunned)
                         He's gone.

               Beth sinks onto the arm of the sofa to support herself.

                                     CAROL
                              (gently)
                         He's an asshole.

               CLOSE-UP: BETH

               The truth makes its way deeply into her.

                                     BETH
                              (a half whisper)
                         Fuckin' Nick...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               The lightly traveled highway cuts a straight line through 
               the desert.

               Nick's sedan pulls off into a service station with a giant 
               teepee beside it.

               EXT. SERVICE STATION

               The wind is roaring, kicking up swirls of grey dust in the 
               flourescent light of the service station.

               A TEENAGE NAVAJO boy is filling Nick's tank. Nick leans 
               against the car staring at the giant teepee.

                                     NICK
                         Nobody lives in that, right?

                                     NAVAJO TEEN
                         Gift shop. But it closed at seven.

                                     NICK
                              (cheerfully shrugging)
                         I got no one to shop for.

               A gust of wind sends dust into Nick's eye.

                                     NICK
                         Shit.
                              (rubbing his eye)
                         Fuckin' wind...

                                     NAVAJO TEEN
                         Yeah.

                                     NICK
                              (sincerely)
                         What does it mean?

                                     NAVAJO TEEN
                         High pressure field coming in -- 
                         should bring some nice weather.

                                     NICK
                         No. The wind itself, you know what I 
                         mean, you're an Indian...

                                     NAVAJO TEEN
                              (correcting him)
                         I'm a Navajo.

                                     NICK
                         Yeah, so you're in tune with this 
                         stuff...

                                     NAVAJO TEEN
                              (checking the pump)
                         It's thirteen bucks.

                                     NICK
                              (his train of thought 
                              broken)
                         Oh... right.

               Nick pulls a bill out of his wallet and holds it out.

                                     NICK
                         Here's a twenty.

               The Navajo Teen takes the bill and takes a wad of bills from 
               his pocket.

               Nick stares out at the moonlit desert and the mountains rising 
               in the distance.

                                     NICK
                         So what does the wind mean? Like as 
                         an omen or something, you know --
                              (making his voice 
                              mystical)
                         -- a change is coming to the people. -- 
                         the spirit of freedom is walking the 
                         land.
                              (flatly)
                         That kind of meaning...

                                     NAVAJO TEEN
                              (handing him money)
                         Fourteen, fifteen and five makes 
                         twenty.

               He opens Nick's car door for him.

                                     NAVAJO TEEN
                         The wind is. It's the wind like I'm 
                         a Navajo.

                                     NICK
                         That's it?

               The Navajo teen nods.

                                     NICK
                         Shit.

               He gets in the car, his mood darkening, and pulls his door 
               shut with a slam.

                                     NICK
                              (out the window)
                         It would be better if meant something.

               The Navajo teen shrugs. Nick starts the engine.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. A BAR IN ENFIELD - NIGHT

               A dimly lit room filled with raucous customers and lots of 
               neon beer signs. Waitresses in red dresses tote pitchers of 
               brew to the thirsty throng. At the far end a band plays a 
               foot-stompin' good time tune about a trucker on his way to 
               see his woman.

               THE CAMERA MOVES through the crowd and discovers Carol and 
               Beth sitting at a small table, an almost finished pitcher of 
               beer between them.

               They speak loudly to be heard over the din.

                                     CAROL
                         He said he needs to be alone again. 
                         Learn about himself. Make a fresh 
                         start in a new town.

               Beth shakes her head then takes a sip of her beer -- it tastes 
               bitter in her mouth and she puts her glass down in disgust.

                                     CAROL
                              (after a beat)
                         He's sorry.

               Beth stares at her beer. Carol puts a hand comfortingly on 
               Beth's arm.

                                     CAROL
                         He said he would have called you, 
                         but your phone's disconnected. 'Cause 
                         you're moving.
                              (after a beat)
                         He's always been an asshole.
                              (after a beat)
                         You'll be all right.

                                     BETH
                         Yeah...

                                     CAROL
                              (gently)
                         I'm here.

                                     BETH
                         I know that.

               A big-haired WAITRESS approaches the table.

                                     WAITRESS
                         You ready for another?

               Carol looks to Beth.

                                     BETH
                         Oh... uh, no...

                                     CAROL
                         We're fine.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Is Nick coming in?

               Carol throws the waitress a look that could kill. Beth takes 
               a deep breath.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT./EXT. NICK'S SEDAN - HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               Nick stares at the road ahead. He takes rapid drags on a 
               cigarette. The RADIO is barely audible over the ROAR of the 
               WIND through the open windows.

                                     PREACHER'S VOICE
                              (covered by static)
                         "And he arose and came to his father, 
                         but when he was still a great way 
                         off, his father saw him and had 
                         compassion, and ran and..."

               Nick turns the radio off.

               He fumbles the cigarette into the ashtray.

               He takes a pint of scotch from the front seat, uncaps it, 
               takes a slug, takes another slug, recaps it, and drops it 
               back on the seat.

               He stares at the road. He looks down to the front seat and 
               finds the map. He splits his attention between the road and 
               unfolding the map. The wind catches the map.

               The map billows up, covering his face. Losing control of the 
               car, Nick slaps it down.

               A car HORN blares.

               Nick jerks the car back into his lane, bats the map down 
               again, and pulls off to the side of the road.

               He stops the car and slams the shift into park.

               He opens his door a crack, turning on the dome light. He 
               smooths out the map on the dashboard.

               Billings and Enfield are marked with Carol's big red circles.

               CLOSE-UP - THE MAP

               Nick's finger traces from Enfield toward Billings along the 
               route Carol highlighted with the red felt-tip. Halfway to 
               Billings, the red line stops. Nick's finger stops.

               NICK

               He stares at the map.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BETH'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Beth comes in the front door. The sound of Sid whistling 
               comes softly from the kitchen.

               Beth stares at the t.v. for a moment then strides purposefully 
               toward the kitchen.

               INT. BETH'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

               Sid is standing on the counter masking the top sill of the 
               kitchen window. There's half a donut hanging from his mouth.

               Beth comes through the swinging door.

                                     BETH
                              (forcefully)
                         You've lived here your whole life?

               The half-donut falls from the startled Sid's mouth.

                                     SID
                              (after a beat)
                         Yeah.

                                     BETH
                              (increduously)
                         You've never gone anywhere?

               He picks up the half-donut.

                                     SID
                         Travelling has no allure for me.

                                     BETH
                         None?

               Sid climbs down and sits on the counter, dropping the half-
               donut back into the donut box.

                                     SID
                         Maybe through time.

                                     BETH
                              (smiling)
                         That's not offered.

                                     SID
                         So I stay here.

                                     BETH
                         Why?

                                     SID
                              (the simple truth)
                         It's my home. I belong here.

                                     BETH
                         I'm serious.

               So was Sid -- but he realizes Beth doesn't believe it can be 
               as simple as that.

                                     SID
                         My father says if you stay in one 
                         place long enough your luck knows 
                         where to find you.

                                     BETH
                              (wryly)
                         Maybe that's my problem.

                                     SID
                              (carefully)
                         Maybe it is...

               Sid holds out the box of donuts to her.

                                     BETH
                         Thanks.

               She takes a donut and fiddles with it.

                                     BETH
                         You think your father knows the truth?

                                     SID
                         He's a bartender.
                              (smiling)
                         He's lived here his whole life.

                                     BETH
                         Has his luck found him?

                                     SID
                         Not yet.
                              (after a beat)
                         But it's probably very close.

               Beth smiles weakly. Abruptly, she drops her donut back in 
               the box.

                                     SID
                              (cautiously)
                         Are you all right?

                                     BETH
                              (apologetically)
                         Must be the paint fumes...

               She opens up the back door and steps out. Sid stares at the 
               empty doorway.

               EXT. BACK STOOP - CONTINUOUS

               Beth stands in the moonlight, staring out at the stars.

                                     BETH
                              (contemplatively 
                              dubious)
                         You find what you want here?

               Sid steps out behind her.

                                     SID
                         It seems that way.

                                     BETH
                         Yeah?

                                     SID
                              (simply)
                         I found you.

                                     BETH
                         Oh. No...

               She walks out into the backyard. Sid follows her.

                                     SID
                              (earnestly)
                         We never met before last night...

               The moonlight through the orange trees casts a magical air 
               about the backyard. Beth stops by a swingset.

                                     SID
                         ...but we know each other.

               Beth stiffens.

                                     BETH
                         No...

               She walks away from him. He watches her intently.

                                     SID
                         Leave it behind.

               She looks to him.

                                     BETH
                         Leave what behind?

                                     SID
                         Unhappiness.

                                     BETH
                              (amused)
                         That was a bad answer.

                                     SID
                              (seriously)
                         No. It was true.

               Beth stares at Sid.

                                     BETH
                         It's not.

                                     SID
                         Come hold me.
                              (after a beat)
                         Come hold me, and you'll be happy.

                                     BETH
                              (dryly)
                         I'll find happiness. Right. In your 
                         arms.

                                     SID
                         Yes.

                                     BETH
                         In you.

                                     SID
                         Yes.

                                     BETH
                         But I won't. I have to find happiness 
                         in myself.

                                     SID
                         No. That's wrong.
                              (going toward her)
                         People tell you that, but it's wrong.

               She turns away from him. He stands behind her, close.

                                     SID
                         I've lived with people who have that 
                         happiness from within. That happiness -- 
                         it's just them being pleased with 
                         themselves. It's not enough. It's a 
                         lonely thing.

               She turns and faces him. The moonlight casts a pale glow 
               over them.

               She stares in his eyes for a long moment. She steps back 
               from him.

                                     BETH
                         You're showing how young you are.

                                     SID
                         No. I'm not. I'm showing you a way. 
                         You know that. And you know me.
                              (after a beat)
                         And I know you.

               She walks away from him, back to the swingset.

                                     BETH
                         I don't know you.

               Sid follows and takes her arms, turning her to face him.

                                     SID
                         You know.

                                     BETH
                              (after a beat, 
                              defensively)
                         I know you want to fuck me.

               He pulls her very close. He lets go of her arms so she is 
               standing against him, unrestrained.

                                     SID
                         Is that what you know?

               Beth stares at his face for a long time.

                                     BETH
                         I know...

               She kisses him, suddenly, long and slow.

                                     BETH
                              (whispering)
                         I know you.

               They kiss, pulling each other tight.

               They lose their balance and stagger against the swingset, 
               kissing passionately. Beth pulls back.

                                     BETH
                              (w/ fierce intensity)
                         I know you.

                                     SID
                         That's right.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. TWO-STORY SUBURBAN RANCH HOUSE - NIGHT

               A canopy of stars hangs over it.

               INT. NICK'S SEDAN - CONTINUOUS

               Nick is parked, staring at the house. The roadmap is on the 
               seat beside him. He takes a drink from a half empty pint of 
               scotch. He screws the cap on and drops the bottle on the 
               map.

               He steps out of the car, unsteadily.

               EXT. RANCH HOUSE'S FRONT LAWN - CONTINUOUS

               Nick walks toward the door. He stops, stares at the door and 
               starts back for his car. He stops, shakes his head, and walks 
               quickly to the front door.

               FRONT PORCH

               Nick stands, staring at the door. He knocks. He waits 
               impatiently, then pounds on the door. On his third pound the 
               lights in the house suddenly go on.

               OVER NICK'S SHOULDER

               The door abruptly opens.

               MR. AUGUST, an eighty year old man, stands in the doorway. 
               HE wears pajamas, slippers, and a long robe. He is over six 
               and a half feet tall.

               NICK AND MR. AUGUST

               Nick, startled, steps back. Mr. August stares at him. Nick 
               composes himself.

                                     NICK
                         Excuse me...

               Mr. August stares at him.

                                     NICK
                         Excuse me... I'm... I'm looking for 
                         my parents.

               Mr. August calmly puts his hands over his ears, and slowly 
               shakes his head.

                                     NICK
                         My mother, my father... they...

               ELIZABETH, a fifteen year old girl steps out from behind Mr. 
               August. She seems very small next to Mr. August. He puts a 
               hand on her shoulder. She stares at Nick.

                                     NICK
                              (uncomfortably)
                         Hello.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Hello.

                                     NICK
                              (exhaling in relief)
                         Oh... good...
                              (to the point)
                         This is my house. I, uhh... mean 
                         this is the house I grew up in.

               Nick looks past them into the house.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (nodding to Mr. August)
                         This is his house now.

                                     NICK
                         Nice to meet you.

               He holds out a hand to Mr. August, who slowly shakes it.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         He's deaf.

                                     NICK
                              (loudly)
                         Nice to meet you.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         He's stone deaf.

                                     NICK
                         Oh.
                              (uncomfortably)
                         Yelling doesn't help.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         No.

               Nick breaks the handshake. Mr. August smiles at him. Nick 
               looks to Elizabeth.

                                     NICK
                         My name is Nick, Nick Brennan.

               He waits for her to introduce herself. She doesn't.

                                     NICK
                         Did you know the Brennans?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         No.

                                     NICK
                         They lived here. They used to live 
                         here. I used to live here with them...

               Elizabeth stares at him. Nick tries his salesman charm.

                                     NICK
                         What's your name?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Elizabeth.

                                     NICK
                         No...

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Yes.

                                     NICK
                         I know an Elizabeth.
                              (quietly)
                         I call her Beth.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BETH'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Bathed in moonlight, Sid and Beth make tender passionate 
               love.

               Sid has never wanted someone so much and Beth has never felt 
               so wanted.

               Beth clings to Sid as if she were afraid of being swept 
               away... and then she is.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. MR. AUGUST'S DINING ROOM - LATER

               A chandelier casts a gently sparkling golden glow.

               The CAMERA TILTS down to reveal...

               Mr. August, Elizabeth and Nick, sitting at a large antique 
               dining room table.

               Nick is eating a sandwich, an untouched glass of milk in 
               front of him. Mr. August and Elizabeth watch him, expectantly. 
               Nick notices this.

                                     NICK
                              (swallowing)
                         This is a good sandwich.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Thank you.

                                     NICK
                              (abruptly nodding 
                              toward Mr. August)
                         When did he move here? Would he know 
                         where the people before him went?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         No. He wouldn't remember.

                                     NICK
                         You're sure?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Yes. He doesn't remember anymore.

                                     NICK
                         Oh.
                              (taking a deep breath)
                         He can't help me.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         No.

               Nick looks around the familiar room, struck by the absurdity 
               of the situation.

                                     NICK
                              (with wry awareness)
                         I've lost my parents.

               Nick smiles weakly at Elizabeth.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (matter-or-factly)
                         Did you lose them both at the same 
                         time?

                                     NICK
                         Is that like a joke?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         No.

                                     NICK
                         Then yes. I lost them both at the 
                         same time.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         I lost mine one at a time.
                              (after a beat)
                         Last year.

               Nick realizes she's talking about death.

                                     NICK
                         I'm sorry. That's tragic. I should...

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (interrupting)
                         Six months apart. Body failures. 
                         Separate body failures.

                                     NICK
                         I'm really sorry.
                              (standing)
                         I should go.

               Mr. August slowly stands as Elizabeth follows Nick toward 
               the foyer.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         First my father's heart kept starting 
                         and stopping.

                                     NICK
                              (nodding)
                         Attacks...

               IN THE FOYER

               Nick edges toward the door followed by Elizabeth and Mr. 
               August.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         My mother and I were with him in the 
                         hospital and he'd grab at us, he'd 
                         grab my arms and hold on.

                                     NICK
                         That's very sad...
                              (after a beat, backing 
                              toward the door)
                         I've really gotta be going. I, uh... 
                         thank you again for the sandwich. 
                         Delicious...

                                     ELIZABETH
                         Right before my mother died, she 
                         said -- "Elizabeth. You're adopted."

               Nick stops in his tracks, his hand on the doorknob.

                                     NICK
                         Have you found your real parents?

                                     ELIZABETH
                         No. Two are enough to lose.

               Nick stares at her -- the sad truth of her statement sinking 
               in.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         I'm not alone. I have my Grandfather.

               Nick looks down. He is alone. He has no one.

                                     NICK
                              (opening the door)
                         Listen...

               He looks into her eyes.

               Elizabeth suddenly grabs his arm.

               He stares at her, not knowing what to do. She holds his arm 
               tightly for a moment, then lets go.

                                     ELIZABETH
                         I'm sorry.

               She steps back from Nick, against her grandfather.

                                     ELIZABETH
                              (in explanation)
                         He's stone deaf.

               Nick stares at Elizabeth.

                                     NICK
                         I have to go.

               And he hurries out the door into the night.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BETH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Beth is sitting up in bed, Sid leaning back against her, her 
               arms wrapped around him.

                                     SID
                              (after a beat)
                         I'd like to stay right here...

                                     BETH
                         I have to be out tomorrow.

                                     SID
                         In this moment... Enjoying this 
                         moment.

               They both lie perfectly still. A flicker of sadness crosses 
               Beth's face.

                                     BETH
                              (hushed)
                         The moment's gone.

                                     SID
                              (shaking his head)
                         It can go on as long as we want.

               Beth leans him back, cradling him in her arms. She stares at 
               him, a quizzical expression on her face.

                                     BETH
                              (skeptically)
                         Have you ever been in a relationship?

                                     SID
                         No.
                              (after a beat)
                         I was married... but it wasn't really 
                         a relationship.

                                     BETH
                              (incredulous)
                         You weren't married...

                                     SID
                         Two years. Right out of high school.

               Beth ponders this for a moment.

                                     BETH
                         Do I remind you of her?

                                     SID
                         No.

                                     BETH
                              (relieved)
                         Thank God.

               Sid runs his hands over her body.

                                     SID
                         You have beautiful skin... her skin 
                         was polka-dotted.

                                     BETH
                         Freckled...

                                     SID
                         When we were kids we called her 
                         "Spot".

                                     BETH
                              (laughing)
                         What happened?

                                     SID
                         She disappeared.

               Beth looks to Sid. He's staring off.

                                     BETH
                              (after a beat)
                         Was she ever found?

               A flicker of loss crosses his face.

                                     SID
                         No. Not by me...
                              (looking to Beth)
                         I didn't go look.

               Beth stares at him, uncertainly. He leans up and gently traces 
               circles on Beth's skin.

                                     SID
                         She wanted to meet someone new. I 
                         asked her "why?" -- she said, "Because 
                         he won't know me from before. Just 
                         now. Just what I am now."

               Beth looks to him, puzzled.

                                     SID
                         I knew her... on playgrounds... in 
                         Sunday School... all those grades -- 
                         I knew her as she changed. But she 
                         was still the same person. All the 
                         times I knew her, she was still her.
                              (after a beat)
                         She can't get away from that.

               He holds Beth tightly.

                                     SID
                         You stay in one place, and all those 
                         things that are you... are there. 
                         She didn't understand that if you 
                         leave, they're still there, in you -- 
                         but they stop being clear. You stop 
                         knowing who you are, and what you 
                         want.

                                     BETH
                         You've stayed here and you know who 
                         you are?

               He moves away from Beth.

                                     SID
                         I see the lawns I mow, houses I've 
                         painted, faces I know... my parents... 
                         And I'm constantly reminded of who I 
                         am.

                                     BETH
                         And you know what you want.

                                     SID
                         I want you.

                                     BETH
                         Oh.

                                     SID
                         I want to be inside you.

                                     BETH
                         Good.
                              (after a beat)
                         Come here and put it inside me.

                                     SID
                         No... I want to be able to put myself 
                         inside of you.

                                     BETH
                         Doing this is as close as you get.

               Beth pulls Sid close, bringing him into her.

                                     BETH
                         Come here.

                                     SID
                         I love you.

               She holds him tightly.

                                     BETH
                         Come inside me.

               Sid arches away from her.

                                     SID
                         Beth?

                                     BETH
                         Yes?

                                     SID
                         What do you want?

                                     BETH
                              (uncertainly)
                         I want... I want...

               Beth pulls Sid back to her.

                                     BETH
                              (w/ quiet urgency)
                         Come inside me.

               They hold each other tightly.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT./EXT. NICK'S SEDAN - NIGHT

               Nick looks like hell -- his eyes red, his hair a mess. The 
               nearly empty scotch bottle is on the dashboard.

               The car windows are open, the roar of the wind competing 
               with the blasting radio.

               Nick suddenly jerks the wheel over.

               EXT. ABANDONED REST STOP - CONTINUOUS

               The sedan screeches off the highway into the abandoned rest 
               area.

               It stops facing a battered phone booth -- the engine turns 
               off but the headlines stay shining on the phone booth.

               IN THE SEDAN

               Nick turns off the radio. It is suddenly very quiet -- only 
               the occasional lonely DRONE OF A TRUCK passing on the highway. 
               He takes a deep breath.

               INT. PHONE BOOTH - MOMENTS LATER

               Nick is standing in the phone booth, harshly lit by his 
               headlights.

                                     NICK
                              (into the phone)
                         Could you give me the number for 
                         information in Arizona?... Thank 
                         you.

               Nick dials with drunken concentration.

                         Enfield. Carol, Carol, umm...
                              (mortified)
                         Carol... Carol Something... Shit!

               He hangs up. He hits himself in the head in angry disbelief. 
               He hurriedly dials zero and listens for a moment, desperately 
               summoning up all his salesman charm.

                                     NICK
                              (into the phone)
                         Hello Janet, thank you for being my 
                         operator. I hope you can help me, I 
                         need to call my home.

               Nick listens impatiently.

                                     NICK
                         Well, I'll tell you my number, but 
                         there's a problem. My phone's been 
                         disconnected, not because of bills, 
                         I mean we paid all our bills. We 
                         were hardly ever even late. We were 
                         very good customers, but we're moving, 
                         so we had the phone disconnected. 
                         But now I need to call... the woman 
                         I live with. She's still there and 
                         I've got to let her know where I am.

               Nick listens, shaking his head emphatically.

                                     NICK
                         I don't know any of the neighbors. I 
                         know one, but I can't remember her 
                         last name.
                              (he listens, frustrated)
                         No. No. No. You see you have to be 
                         able to help me, this is not a prank, 
                         it's my home phone, this is an 
                         emergency.
                              (he listens, then 
                              urgently)
                         Yes it can, it can be done. Someone 
                         there can hook the phone back up. 
                         It's not like a phone guy came to 
                         our house to disconnect the phone, 
                         nobody came to our house, someone 
                         just flipped a switch somewhere, 
                         somewhere there where you work, or 
                         plugged something into a computer 
                         and our phone stopped working!
                              (he listens)
                         They turned it off, they can turn it 
                         back on!
                              (he listens, starting 
                              to panic)
                         I know it's the week-end! I know! 
                         Call them at home! They'll have a 
                         computer at their house, they'll 
                         have a phone thing to hook it up to 
                         the real computer! That's how these 
                         people live! They'll be glad to do 
                         it!...

               Nick listens. Suddenly all his energy drains away.

                                     NICK
                              (crestfallen)
                         No. No. I can't have the police go 
                         to the house. That won't work, there 
                         are circumstances.
                              (desperately)
                         It's you... you've got to help me! 
                         Please! I've gotta call home! I can't 
                         wait. It could be too late! Janet!! 
                         You've gotta help me! Please! You 
                         can reconnect me. Please!! Don't 
                         hang up! Don't hang up!!

               He hurls the receiver at the phone.

                                     NICK
                         You fucker!! You heartless...

               Nick doubles over, retching, clutching the side of the booth.

               FADE IN:

               INT. BETH'S BEDROOM - MORNING

               Sid is sprawled out over the bed, sleeping, Beth nestled 
               against him. She stirs and cuddles closer.

               Suddenly she realizes it's not Nick. She pulls away, 
               orientating herself. She quickly scoots out of bed and 
               hurriedly pulls on a pair of jeans.

               The alarm clock CLANGS.

               Beth looks about for the alarm. She tensely scatters some 
               boxes. She dumps one, finds the alarm and shuts it off. She 
               stares at the clock and drops it into a box.

                                     SID (O.S.)
                              (cheerfully)
                         Morning.

               Beth cringes slightly and turns to face Sid.

               SID AND BETH

                                     BETH
                              (attempting a smile)
                         Hi.

                                     SID
                              (grinning)
                         Hi.

                                     BETH
                         I didn't want to wake you.

                                     SID
                              (cheerfully)
                         I'm awake. I'm a morning person.

                                     BETH
                         I'm not.

                                     SID
                         Then why don't you come back to bed?

                                     BETH
                         I've got to pack.

                                     SID
                              (sitting up)
                         Where do we start?

                                     BETH
                              (firmly)
                         No.
                              (softening)
                         You paint.

               She looks around the room littered with boxes and piles of 
               clothes.

                                     BETH
                         I'll manage.

                                     SID
                              (cheerfully)
                         Whatever you say.

               Sid gets out of bed, wrapping the sheet around himself. Beth 
               stares at the room. She suddenly trembles. She steadies 
               herself on the bed table.

                                     BETH
                         Oh God...

                                     SID
                              (concerned)
                         What?

               Beth avoids his eyes, glancing around the room.

                                     BETH
                              (an outpouring)
                         I'd be so much happier if I could 
                         blame this on Nick, but it always 
                         happens to me. I'm always left with 
                         nothing.
                              (taking a deep breath)
                         It doesn't matter if I leave the guy 
                         or if the guy leaves me -- I'm left 
                         with nothing. I never do anything 
                         for myself. I never acquire anything. 
                         I mean Nick didn't take from me. He 
                         stole a t.v. and left it for me. He 
                         didn't take my things, he didn't 
                         take our things... he didn't even 
                         take his clothes! And I'll still 
                         leave this house with nothing!

                                     SID
                         He took three years from you.

                                     BETH
                         No...
                              (meeting his eyes)
                         He didn't take 'em. I mean, when he 
                         cared about me, he cared about me. 
                         And he was really good in bed.

               She glances away from Sid toward the bed.

                                     BETH
                              (after a beat)
                         I didn't expect more.

               She turns away from Sid and the bed. Sid moves toward her.

                                     SID
                              (carefully)
                         Beth...

               Beth summons up all the composure she can manage.

                                     BETH
                              (referring to the 
                              cluttered room)
                         I can't face this.
                              (looking to Sid)
                         I'm gonna finish up the kitchen...
                              (heading for the door)
                         ...get some momentum...

               She goes out the bedroom door. Sid stares after her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ABANDONED REST STOP - MORNING

               Nick's sedan is parked in the same place as the night before.

               A YOUNG MAN with long hair ROARS into the rest stop on a 
               Harley-Davidson, his life's possession strapped on the back.

               He stops the bike between Nick's car and the phonebooth, 
               idling the engine, loudly. He looks to the phonebooth, the 
               receiver dangling. He turns to Nick's sedan.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Phone work?

               NICK

               Awakened by the ROAR, Nick has wearily leaned his head out 
               the window.

               Nick stares at the young man.

                                     NICK
                              (after a beat)
                         No.

               Drained, Nick rests his head on the steering wheel.

               OFFSCREEN, the motorcycle starts up and zooms away. A silence 
               falls over the rest stop.

               Without raising his head from the steering wheel, Nick starts 
               the car.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BETH'S BEDROOM - MORNING

               Sid is making the bed.

                                     CAROL (V.O.)
                              (gleefully 
                              conspiratorially)
                         How was he?

                                     BETH (V.O.)
                              (sheepishly)
                         He's twenty-four.

               Sid pulls up the blanket and fluffs the pillows.

                                     CAROL (V.O.)
                         A little weak on tenderness, but 
                         long on juice?

                                     BETH (V.O.)
                         Long on conversation.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BETH'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

               The cupboards are all open and bare. A half dozen boxes are 
               neatly stacked. Beth is sitting on the floor packing the 
               final dishes. Carol holds out a mug of coffee.

                                     CAROL
                         Did you need talk?

               Beth stands and takes the coffee.

                                     BETH
                         Yeah. I guess I did.

                                     CAROL
                         Good.

               Beth sips her coffee, gazing out the kitchen window.

               BETH'S POV

               The backyard. In the light of day it's lost its magical 
               quality. The grass needs cutting and is marred by brown 
               patches. The swingset looks pathetically rusted and 
               dilapidated.

               CLOSE-UP: BETH

               Her face clouds over.

                                     CAROL (O.S.)
                              (cheerfully)
                         So what are we doing?

               BETH AND CAROL

               Carol is staring at Beth staring out at the backyard.

                                     BETH
                         Christ...

               She turns to Carol.

                                     BETH
                              (w/ an edge of 
                              desperation)
                         I gotta get out here. I was in Tucson 
                         two years before you and Nick got 
                         here.
                              (in disbelief)
                         I've been here five years...

                                     CAROL
                         Yeah...

                                     BETH
                         This state's driving me crazy.

                                     CAROL
                         So what are you gonna do?

                                     BETH
                         I've got no money.

                                     CAROL
                         I've got some.

                                     BETH
                              (chagrined by self-
                              awareness)
                         I can't take it. I mean you're being 
                         great, but I can't take it. I'm gonna 
                         be gone, we won't see each other, 
                         and I won't send the money. I won't. 
                         I know... I won't get around, I'll 
                         forget, I won't do it.

               She looks around the room in disgust.

                                     BETH
                              (agitated)
                         Shit. I'll sell all this shit. I 
                         don't want any of it, just my car 
                         and my clothes...

                                     CAROL
                              (carefully)
                         Okay...

                                     BETH
                              (shaking her head)
                         I'm sorry... I shouldn't have fucked 
                         this kid last night. I should have 
                         slept. Now I've got all this stuff 
                         to do, and I'm tired, I'm churned 
                         up, I'm in a fuckin' mood.

                                     CAROL
                         Let's do things, get you busy.

                                     BETH
                         Yeah.

                                     CAROL
                         You get all the stuff you wanna sell, 
                         and I'll make some tag sale signs.

                                     BETH
                         No one'll buy my stuff. It's all 
                         junk.

                                     CAROL
                         That's what people buy at tag sales. 
                         Broken appliances, ugly knicknacks.

               Beth looks at the semi-packed boxes.

                                     BETH
                              (laughing)
                         I guess I do have stuff to sell.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BETH'S FRONT LAWN - DAY

               Boxes full of a motley collection of knickknacks, housewares, 
               and crummy appliances are spread out on the lawn.

               In the BACKGROUND a couple of M.T.V. influenced teens are 
               checking out the knickknacks and goofing on them.

               MRS. DOTSON, a woman in her late forties wearing a NURSE'S 
               UNIFORM is poking through the odds and ends.

               Beth and Carol hovering near her.

               Mrs. Dotson picks up the coffee maker, examines it, and puts 
               it down. She picks up the blender, examines it, and puts it 
               down.

                                     CAROL
                              (impatiently)
                         Is there something specific you're 
                         looking for?

                                     MRS. DOTSON
                         Yes.
                              (sheepishly)
                         Actually everything... I don't have 
                         anything.

                                     BETH
                         Nothing?

                                     MRS. DOTSON
                         I just moved to town.
                              (hesitating then 
                              confiding)
                         My husband passed away, and I, umm, 
                         didn't want to have our things... 
                         they were too familiar.

               Beth realizes why she's selling all her stuff -- it's too 
               familiar.

                                     BETH
                              (abruptly)
                         You can have it all for three hundred. 
                         The stuff in these boxes and 
                         everything inside.

                                     MRS. DOTSON
                              (taken aback)
                         Oh, my, I don't know... everything?

                                     BETH
                         Everything.
                              (hesitating)
                         Except the t.v.

               Mrs. Dotson searches Beth's face with a kind gaze. Beth smiles 
               nervously.

                                     BETH
                              (apologetically)
                         The t.v.s not for sale.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT/EXT. NICK'S SEDAN

               Nick's smoking, looking haggard. Between drags, he anxiously 
               taps a tempo on the steering wheel with his cigarette holding 
               hand.

               NICK'S POV

               The highway and the desert stretch out before him, the heat 
               waves of late afternoon shimmering above the blacktop.

               In the distance, the giant teepee souvenir shop rises out of 
               the horizon like a mirage.

               NICK

               An idea strikes him and his lips tighten into a small 
               determined smile.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TEEPEE GIFT SHOP - AFTERNOON

               A couple of vacationing families and a busload of elderly 
               sightseers poke through the stunning assortment of Native 
               American souvenirs.

               Nick stands at the counter talking to a plump elderly NAVAJO 
               WOMAN.

                                     NAVAJO WOMAN
                         Maybe some nice turquoise jewelry.

                                     NICK
                              (shaking his head)
                         I don't think she really wears 
                         jewelry.

               A little boy stares at the disheveled Nick. His mother hurries 
               him away.

                                     NAVAJO WOMAN
                         Maybe a nice Navajo rug?

                                     NICK
                              (incredulous)
                         As a present? No.

               He points past her.

                                     NICK
                         What about that?

               THEIR POV

               A huge beautifully feathered ceremonial headdress.

               NICK AND THE NAVAJO WOMAN

                                     NICK
                         That would make her laugh.

                                     NAVAJO WOMAN
                              (not amused)
                         That's authentic -- it's very 
                         expensive.

                                     NICK
                         You got something like it but fake?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FRONT LAWN - LATE AFTERNOON

               Beth and Mrs. Dotson are standing beside the now empty 
               blankets.

               In the BACKGROUND, Sid and Carol are packing boxes into Mrs. 
               Dotson's car.

               Mrs. Dotson has begun to fill out a check.

                                     MRS. DOTSON
                         I'm sorry, what's your name?

                                     BETH
                         Can you just leave the name blank? I 
                         won't have an account, so I'll have 
                         to find someplace to cash it for me.

               Mrs. Dotson looks at her. They stare into each other's eyes.

                                     MRS. DOTSON
                              (after a beat)
                         All right.

               Mrs. Dotson hands Beth the check. Beth sticks it in her back 
               pocket. After an awkward moment she extends her hand.

                                     BETH
                         Thanks a lot.

               Mrs. Dotson takes her hand. Sid and Carol walk up to them.

                                     SID
                              (cheerfully)
                         You're set.

               Mrs. Dotson lets go of Beth's hand. They turn to Sid and 
               Carol.

                                     MRS. DOTSON
                              (warmly chagrined)
                         You did all the work...

                                     SID
                              (good-naturedly)
                         Sure.
                              (mischieviously)
                         Now I've gotta finish painting, but 
                         Carol here would be happy to help 
                         you unload.

               Carol starts to protest and then checks herself for Beth's 
               sake.

                                     CAROL
                              (trapped, dryly)
                         Of course. I'll follow you in my 
                         car.

                                     SID
                              (to Mrs. Dotson)
                         And I'll be by tomorrow with my truck 
                         and the big things.

               He heads into the house. Beth stares after him. Mrs. Dotson 
               touches her shoulder, lightly, getting her attention.

                                     MRS. DOTSON
                              (to Beth)
                         Thank you.
                              (smiling)
                         You've given me a home.

               She looks to Carol.

                                     CAROL
                              (nicely)
                         I'll be right along.

               Mrs. Dotson walks off toward her car.

                                     CAROL
                              (to Beth)
                         This had to be history's most 
                         efficient tag sale.

               Beth laughs, distractedly.

                                     BETH
                         Yeah... I'm sorry Sid stuck you with 
                         unloading.

                                     CAROL
                         No problem.
                              (smiling to herself)
                         He kinda bites my butt, but he's 
                         okay.

                                     BETH
                         He is.

               Beth suddenly embraces Carol.

                                     BETH
                         Listen.
                              (breaking the embrace)
                         I'll probably be gone before you get 
                         back.

                         I thought maybe we could be roomies 
                         for a while. You know, while you 
                         figure out what's next.

                                     BETH
                              (shaking her head)
                         I can't.
                              (after a beat, 
                              admitting her feelings)
                         He gets to me... too much. If I don't 
                         go I'll end up with staying with 
                         him.

                                     CAROL
                              (gently)
                         You've done worse.

                                     BETH
                         Sure.

               They look at each other and start to laugh. Their laughter 
               builds -- a release of the strain of the last two days.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. NICK'S SEDAN - INTERSTATE - DAY

               Nick's driving fast, completely focused on the road ahead, 
               the wind ROARING through the open windows.

               A cheap plastic Indian headdress with brightly colored 
               synthetic feathers is perched on his head.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Sid's finished painting -- the room gleams. He pulls a 
               dropcloth off the bureau, then another one off of Beth's two 
               packed suitcases.

                                     BETH (O.S.)
                              (softly)
                         Sid?

               Sid turns and looks, smiling.

               SID'S POV

               Beth is standing in the doorway, a weariness having settled 
               over her. She steps into the room.

               BETH AND SID

                                     SID
                         Hi.

                                     BETH
                         I'm sorry about selling the sofa 
                         bed.

                                     SID
                         I didn't really need one. When my 
                         friends get drunk, they throw up and 
                         sleep on the floor.

                                     BETH
                         But I gave it to you.

               He puts his arms around her.

                                     SID
                         You gave me a lot more.

                                     BETH
                         No.
                              (holding him tightly)
                         It was all even in this department.

                                     SID
                              (softly)
                         ...Feel me?

                                     BETH
                              (whispering)
                         I know... You're hard again.

               Holding her tightly, Sid runs his fingers down her spine.

                                     SID
                         I want you all the time.

                                     BETH
                              (torn)
                         Shit.

               She kisses him. They kiss, long and hard. Abruptly, she breaks 
               the embrace and moves away from him.

                                     BETH
                              (ironically self-aware)
                         I just fleeced a widow.

                                     SID
                              (protesting)
                         No...

                                     BETH
                         It was all junk.

               She shivers.

                                     BETH
                         Shit. I've got to get some aspirin...
                              (shaking her head)
                         I didn't drink enough to be hung 
                         over.

               She walks away from Sid, out of the bedroom.

               INT. BETH'S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

               Beth gulps down aspirin. She stares at herself in the mirror, 
               wearily searching.

               IN THE MIRROR

               Sid appears in the doorway, his reflection small next to the 
               reflection of her face.

                                     SID
                         You just feel bad for her like I 
                         feel bad for her... 'cause her husband 
                         died.

                                     BETH
                              (doubting this)
                         Yeah?

               ANGLE TO INCLUDE SID AND BETH

                                     SID
                         That's about the saddest thing there 
                         is... losing someone you love.

               Beth is struck by a certainty that she's never lost anyone 
               she's loved because she's never really loved anyone.

                                     BETH
                         It's never happened to me.

               Sid hesitates, then speaks his heart.

                                     SID
                         If you died, I couldn't stand life.

                                     BETH
                         I...

               She steps forward and kisses him. She steps back.

                                     BETH
                              (businesslike)
                         I've got to go now.

               She walks out of the bathroom. Sid and THE CAMERA FOLLOW as 
               she hurries though the living room toward the bedroom.

               IN THE LIVING ROOM

                                     BETH
                         The new people'll be here.

               She disappears down the hall to the bedroom.

                                     SID
                              (following)
                         Go to my house.

                                     BETH (O.S.)
                         No.

               IN THE BEDROOM

               Beth picks up her suitcases. Sid steps into the doorway.

                                     SID
                         While you find a place.

                                     BETH
                         No. I gotta get out.

               She heads to the bedroom door.

                                     SID
                         I can talk to the realtors, I know 
                         they've got a place in Agawam.

               Beth stops.

                                     BETH
                              (shaking her head)
                         No... Agawam?... no. I don't know 
                         where I'm going. Somewhere else.

               She walks past him into the hallway. Sid and THE CAMERA 
               FOLLOW.

                                     SID
                         You can call me when you get there. 
                         I'll give you my number.

               IN THE LIVING ROOM

               She stops and puts down the suitcases.

                                     BETH
                              (gently)
                         Sid. I'm going away. You're making 
                         me way too important. You met me 
                         yesterday.

               He goes to her.

                                     SID
                         And today I love you.

               She steps back, shaking her head.

                                     BETH
                         Jesus... one day...

                                     SID
                         That doesn't matter. You know that. 
                         It can take a second.

               Beth loses control, upset with herself for having mixed 
               emotions, upset with her life, and upset he's making this 
               more difficult.

                                     BETH
                         No! That's... that's a fuckin' animal 
                         thing, I've done that.

                                     SID
                         Not with me.

                                     BETH
                         I meet men, go home with them and 
                         just stay. No decision involved -- 
                         it's just what I do. And then I don't 
                         have to live my life, I just lead 
                         theirs. I can't keep doing that.

                                     SID
                              (adamant)
                         We're not that way!

                                     BETH
                         What way are we?

                                     SID
                         We're passionate. We're comfortable.

                                     BETH
                         It's been passionate, it's been 
                         comfortable. But it hasn't been... 
                         important.
                              (after a beat)
                         Like you're making it!

                                     SID
                              (urgently)
                         It is important! You know that.

                                     BETH
                         No! It was a night! It wasn't real. 
                         It was fun, it was some great fucking! 
                         But it's just something that happened! 
                         It's not real!

                                     SID
                         It didn't "just happen"! You know 
                         we're it! I'm the one for you!

                                     BETH
                         The "one"?! I've had lots of "ones"! 
                         I look like a baby but I'm twenty-
                         fuckin'-- eight years old! You're 
                         just the latest!

                                     SID
                         No. I'm the last. You've found me. 
                         And it can go on forever.

                                     BETH
                         No!
                              (her heart breaking 
                              for him)
                         Oh, Sid... Forever?
                              (shaking her head)
                         You have to understand -- it's just 
                         talk.

                                     SID
                         It's not.

                                     BETH
                              (defiantly disbelieving)
                         It is. C'mon, these things you say... 
                         c'mon! What?! If I died you couldn't 
                         stand life? That's... that's...

                                     SID
                         That's true.

                                     BETH
                         No.

               Beth can't bear the risk of opening her soul to believe him -- 
               and she can't bear to hear the outpouring of his soul without 
               believing him. So she ends it.

                                     BETH
                              (after a beat, harshly)
                         You won't know when I die. You won't 
                         be there.

               She picks up her suitcases and heads for the door.

                                     SID
                              (following her, certain)
                         You'd want me there. If I wasn't 
                         there it wouldn't matter who was. 
                         You'd be alone.

                                     BETH
                         No.

               He grabs her arms and spins her to face him.

                                     SID
                              (imploring)
                         Beth... Beth... you love me...

                                     BETH
                              (defiantly)
                         No!

                                     SID
                         How do you feel? Think! You love me.

               She stares at him, breathing deeply, gathering herself. He 
               lets go of her arms and steps back.

                                     BETH
                              (her words carefully 
                              chosen)
                         I care about you.

                                     SID
                         You have to be with me.

                                     BETH
                         No.
                              (pause)
                         I care about you. But I'm an adult. 
                         I can say no.

               They stare at each other.

                                     SID
                              (w/ controlled anger)
                         That's what makes you an adult?

                                     BETH
                              (unwavering)
                         Yes.
                              (pause)
                         I can say no.
                              (pause)
                         No, I won't do that. No, I won't 
                         have that. No, I can't.

                                     SID
                              (needing to hear her 
                              say it)
                         You can say no to me?

                                     BETH
                         Yes.

               He looks away from her. She stares at his back.

                                     BETH
                         I'm going.

               She steps toward the door.

                                     SID
                         Beth!

               She stops.

                                     SID
                              (after a beat)
                         Have someplace to go.

                                     BETH
                              (simply)
                         I don't.

               She opens the door.

                                     SID
                         Why don't...

                                     BETH
                              (interrupting)
                         Don't tell me what to do.

               She goes out the door. Sid goes to the door.

               EXT. THE FRONT LAWN - CONTINUOUS

               Beth makes her way to her car. Sid stands in the doorway, 
               watching.

                                     SID
                         What are you gonna do?

               She turns and faces him.

                                     BETH
                         I don't know.

               Beth tosses her suitcases in the backseat. She gets into the 
               car and starts the engine.

               Sid stands, willing her to stop the car.

               Beth pulls out to the end of the driveway.

               INT. BETH'S PINTO

               She looks up at the rearview mirror.

               BETH'S POV

               Sid is framed in the doorway of her old home, waiting, 
               trusting that she can't leave, that they are destined.

               BETH

               Her eyes well with tears. Her face sets with resolve.

               THE HOUSE AND DRIVEWAY

               The car pulls out and disappears down the road. Sid stands 
               in the doorway for a long moment. He steps back into the 
               house and shuts the door.

                                                          SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. NICK'S CAR - DUSK

               Nick is driving, the cheap headdress still perched on his 
               head. Crumpled empty coffee cups are scattered about the 
               front seat. He reaches up and turns the rearview mirror.

               REARVIEW MIRROR

               Nick's face stares back at him. It's not a pretty sight.

               NICK

               Nick reaches into the back seat, fishes and comes up with 
               his necktie. He slips the still-knotted necktie over his 
               headdress and tightens it around his neck.

               Nick looks back to the road and suddenly swerves off an exit 
               ramp. The CAMERA LINGERS on the Exit Sign -- "Enfield AZ.".

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. KITCHEN - DUSK

               Sid silently goes through the motions of pulling the masking 
               tape from around the window sills of the freshly painted 
               room, his face a stony mask.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BETH'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

               Nick's car screeches to a stop in front of the house. He 
               leaps out of the car and runs toward the front door.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               The front door flings open. Nick charges into the room.

                                     NICK
                              (calling out)
                         Beth!
                              (bellowing)
                         Beth!!!

               Sid steps through the swinging door into the living room. 
               Nick freezes.

                                     SID
                              (coldly)
                         She's not here.

                                     NICK
                              (desperately)
                         Where is she?

                                     SID
                         She's gone.

                                     NICK
                         Shit!
                              (a moment of manners)
                         Excuse me.
                              (exploding)
                         Shiiiiit!!
                              (confrontationally)
                         Who are you?

                                     SID
                              (coldly)
                         The painter. You're Nick.

                                     NICK
                              (startled)
                         Yeah.

                                     SID
                         The Indian chief.

                                     NICK
                              (puzzled)
                         What?

               Then Nick, remembering the headdress, rips it off his head 
               and furiously tears it apart -- scattering a flurry of plastic 
               feathers. He hurls what's left of it across the room.

                                     NICK
                         Shit!

                                     SID
                              (accusingly)
                         You're too late. She's gone.

                                     NICK
                              (angrily)
                         I got that. Where'd she go?

                                     SID
                         She didn't say.

                                     NICK
                         Shit!

                                     SID
                              (bitterly)
                         She didn't know.

               Nick runs out the front door.

               EXT. NICK'S FRONT LAWN - CONTINUOUS

               Nick runs out into his lawn.

                                     NICK
                              (running; under his 
                              breath)
                         Be at Carol's... be at Carol's...

               The CAMERA FOLLOWING he races up to Carol's front door and 
               leans on the doorbell -- a loud tight buzzing.

               He pounds on the door, then stops, gasping for breath. No 
               one's home. He turns, leaning against the door for support, 
               staring out at tract house neighborhood.

                                     NICK
                              (spent)
                         I'm too late...

               Suddenly he bolts for his car.

               Nick yanks his car door open and disappears into it. In a 
               second he emerges with the bottle of scotch.

               It's empty. He eyes it for a moment then hurls it as far as 
               he can down the street -- it shatters explosively.

               He races to his front door and stops dead in his tracks at 
               the open doorway.

               INT. NICK'S LIVING ROOM

               Sid has covered the floor and remaining furniture with drop 
               cloths and is applying even strokes to the ceiling with a 
               long handled roller.

               Nick steps in and stares at Sid and his own nearly empty 
               drop-cloth covered home.

                                     NICK
                              (at the top of his 
                              lungs)
                         This really bothers me!

               Sid stares at him.

                                     SID
                              (after a moment, with 
                              mock politeness)
                         Will you do me a favor?

                                     NICK
                              (spitting out the 
                              word)
                         What?

                                     SID
                         Act normal.

               Nick advances on Sid.

                                     NICK
                              (adamantly)
                         Listen! I don't want to be normal. I 
                         don't have to be, I don't! This is 
                         my house. You're in my house. And 
                         I'm tired of going to my house and 
                         finding strangers!

               They're face to face in a stand-off.

                                     SID
                         It's not your house. You're gone. 
                         I'm painting --

               He puts the long handled roller right in Nick's face.

                                     SID
                         -- for the new people -- whose house 
                         it's going to be.
                              (pause)
                         You're gone. They're not here yet. 
                         I'm here.
                              (calmly)
                         I guess that makes this my house.

               Nick ponders this logic, Sid's size, and the roller in his 
               face.

                                     NICK
                              (politely)
                         May I look around?

                                     SID
                              (w/ a stony politeness)
                         Sure. Make yourself at home.

               Nick wanders around the nearly empty room, then, after a 
               beat...

               ...he pulls a dropcloth off an object in the corner, revealing 
               the television.

                                     NICK
                              (dismayed)
                         Nooo... she left the television.

                                     SID
                         Yeah.

                                     NICK
                         Too bad.

                                     SID
                              (pointedly)
                         She didn't seem to want it.

                                     NICK
                         That's foolish. That t.v. is a 
                         remarkable thing.

               They both stare at the television.

               The sweep of HEADLIGHTS turning into the driveway cross their 
               faces. They both race to the door.

               Carol gets out of her car. Nick hurries toward her.

               Sid is painting the ceiling. Nick bursts through the door.

                         with each other.

               Nick stares at her.

                         Beth looked young with him. They had 
                         a real connection.

               He exhales loudly and holds his head in his hands.

                                     NICK
                         It seems I'm blessed... in what I 
                         do. I do wrong, and it turns out 
                         right... that I've done right. So it 
                         really doesn't matter what I do.

               Nick takes a deep breath.

                         She'd head for her parents!

                                     CAROL
                         What?

                                     NICK
                         She'd head for her parents. Believe 
                         me.
                              (pause, then flatly)
                         They're in Florida. That's east.

               Nick stares at Sid, waiting.

                                     SID
                         I...

                                     NICK
                              (businesslike)
                         You start driving east on route forty. 
                         Keep going east and around eleven 
                         start checking every roadside motel. 
                         The budget ones... You do that all 
                         night, you'll find her.

                                     CAROL
                         How do you know she's on the highway?

                                     NICK
                         When you don't know where you're 
                         going, you drive on the highway.

               Sid looks to Carol, then around the drop cloth covered room.

                                     NICK
                              (cheerfully)
                         I'll finish painting.

                                     SID
                              (to Carol)
                         Do I have a chance?

               Nick and Sid both look to Carol.

                                     CAROL
                              (after a beat, shaking 
                              her head)
                         You've got a chance.

                                     SID
                              (determined)
                         Then I'm gone.

               Sid races out the door.

               Nick tosses a self-satisfied smile at Carol and walks past 
               her to the door.

               SOUND

               Sid's truck engine roars to life.

               NICK'S POV

               Sid peels out, driving up onto the lawn past Nick and Carol's 
               cars, out onto the street and out of sight.

               THE DOORWAY

               Carol steps into the doorway beside Nick.

                                     CAROL
                         So.
                              (dryly)
                         Start painting.

               Nick looks back into the room.

                                     NICK
                              (after a beat)
                         Fuck the ceiling.
                              (walking in)
                         Who looks up that often?

               Carol follows him into the room. Nick slumps on the sofa, 
               staring at the blank t.v.

                                     MAN'S VOICE
                              (happily)
                         This is it!

               A MAN and a WOMAN, both slightly portly Mexican-Americans in 
               their late forties, wearing their Sunday best, step over the 
               threshold and kiss.

               The man is carrying the woman cradled in his arms.

                                     CAROL
                              (politely)
                         Hello...?

                                     MAN
                              (surprised, breaking 
                              the kiss)
                         Oh. Hello.

               The four stare at each other in awkward silence, the woman 
               still cradled in the man's arms.

                                     MAN
                         I'm sorry. We thought it was going 
                         to be empty.

                                     NICK
                              (flatly)
                         It is.

                                     WOMAN
                              (cheerfully)
                         We're here to move in.

               The man puts her down on her feet.

                                     WOMAN
                         Are you the couple moving out?

                                     CAROL
                         No.

                                     NICK
                         No...

               Nick and Carol look to each other, at a loss. Nick looks 
               back to the couple.

                                     NICK
                              (improvising)
                         We're your new neighbors. From next 
                         door.

               Carol throws him a look.

                                     MAN
                         Well.
                              (putting on a good 
                              face)
                         It's nice to meet you.

               He holds out his hand to shake. After an instant of awkward 
               hesitation they all shake hands with too much enthusiasm.

                                     WOMAN
                              (cheerfully, while 
                              shaking hands)
                         It is... and it's so nice of you to 
                         greet us.

                                     CAROL
                         Thank you.

               They finish the handshakes -- there's an awkward pause.

                                     NICK
                         Actually, we're here for the t.v.

               He waits, half expecting this statement to be challenged. It 
               isn't.

                                     NICK
                              (confidently)
                         The people who left here -- our old 
                         neighbors -- left us that t.v.

               They all look at the t.v.

                                     MAN
                         Oh. It's very nice.

                                     CAROL
                         Yes. It is.

               There's an awkward pause.

                                     CAROL
                              (going to the t.v.)
                         Well, dear... we should carry it 
                         home.

               Nick and Carol lift the t.v.

                                     WOMAN
                         Do you need help?

                                     NICK
                         We can manage.

               They move toward the front door, Carol going backwards.

                                     CAROL
                         Thanks anyway.

               Nick looks to make eye contact with Carol. He can't. She's 
               looking back over her shoulder for obstacles. He smiles and 
               glances toward the couple.

               Nick and Carol go out the door, lugging the t.v.

                                     WOMAN
                              (calling out)
                         Nice meeting you.

               The man and woman look at each other. They look around the 
               room.

                                     MAN
                         They're not done painting.

                                     WOMAN
                         They'll finish.

               She stares out the front door.

                                     WOMAN
                              (whimsically)
                         I wonder where our furniture is?

               She looks back to him. He's staring at the ceiling.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE LAWN - CONTINUOUS

               They're lugging the t.v. across to Carol's -- Carol backing 
               up and Nick going forward. They arrive at the front door.

               Nick takes most of the weight of the t.v., while Carol fumbles 
               with her key into her front door lock with her free hand.

                                     CAROL
                         You're not going to be their new 
                         neighbor.

                                     NICK
                         It was just something to say.

               Carol gets the door open.

                                     CAROL
                         Good.

               Carol backs into the house, leading the way.

               INT. CAROL'S FOYER - CONTINUOUS

               They lug the t.v. toward the living room.

                                     CAROL
                         You look terrible.

                                     NICK
                         Yeah? Well, I had a big day.
                              (after a beat)
                         I went to my parent's house. Like 
                         you said to. And there was this 
                         ancient man, this giant man in the 
                         doorway.

               They step into the living room.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Carol leads them to a corner.

                                     NICK
                         And I thought, "It's my father. My 
                         how he's aged."

                                     CAROL
                         You were drunk...

               They gingerly put the t.v. down.

                                     NICK
                         Not at the house. At the house I was 
                         stone sober.

               Nick slumps down onto the sofa. Carol watches him, puzzled.

                                     NICK
                         He was very tall. He was too tall to 
                         be my father. He was wearing a long 
                         overcoat, and I thought, "it's a 
                         trick, he's on my mother's shoulders".

               He smiles at the memory.

                                     NICK
                         And then out from behind him came 
                         this beautiful young girl... Beth.

                                     CAROL
                         Beth?...

                                     NICK
                              (lost in reverie)
                         And they sang to me. They sang "London 
                         Bridge is Falling Down"...
                              (singing softly)
                         "Falling down, falling down.".

               Nick looks to Carol. She stares at him.

                                     NICK
                              (seriously)
                         It was very touching.

                                     CAROL
                         I'm sure.

                                     NICK
                              (defensively)
                         It was.

               Carol sits beside him.

                                     CAROL
                         Nick?...

                                     NICK
                         Yeah?

                                     CAROL
                         What you've been doing... you can't 
                         do anymore.

               Nick looks to Carol, puzzled.

                                     CAROL
                         You just can't do it.

                                     NICK
                              (after a beat, 
                              agreeably)
                         Okay.

                                     CAROL
                              (very skeptically)
                         Okay?

                                     NICK
                         Yeah. I understand.

                                     CAROL
                         No. I don't think so.

                                     NICK
                              (defensively)
                         I understand.

                                     CAROL
                              (determined)
                         It's not like you can't do it.

                                     NICK
                              (interjecting)
                         I'll stop.

                                     CAROL
                              (urgently)
                         It's that I don't want you to do it.

                                     NICK
                         I've stopped.

               She stares at Nick. He avoids her stare. She takes his face 
               in her hand and makes him look at her.

                                     CAROL
                              (staring in his eyes)
                         Nick.
                              (emphatic)
                         I don't want you to do it.

               Nick stares in her eyes.

                                     NICK
                              (calmly, after a beat)
                         Okay.

               She lets go of his face.

                                     CAROL
                         Shit.
                              (after a beat, wryly)
                         I hate talking to you.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SID'S TRUCK - NIGHT

               Through the windshield we see Sid driving slowly, looking 
               out at motel parking lots. Their neon signs reflect in the 
               windshield.

               EXT. STRIP OFF THE HIGHWAY

               Gas stations, fast food joints and motels.

               Sid and his truck pull away from the strip and up onto the 
               on ramp.

               EXT. HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

               Sid and his truck pull onto the highway.

               CREDITS ROLL

               As Sid's taillights disappear down the barren highway.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

     by Brad Mirman (second draft)

     --------------------------------------------------------------


     Over the BLACK we hear the SOUNDS of two people making love.  A
     MAN'S VOICE MOANS passionately.


     FADE IN:


     INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

     ANDREW MARSH lies on his back in bed.  He is a frail-looking
     man in his early sixties, with thinning gray hair.  On top of
     him is a much younger WOMAN.  Although her back is to us, we
     catch flashes of her face for a moment as she turns from side
     to side.  We see enough to know that this is a beautiful woman.

     She moves wildly, grinding her hips into him, her head arched
     back, her hands rubbing lightly over her breasts.  She reaches
     down, grabbing his hips and jerks them upwards, forcing him
     deeper inside her.  They move together -- faster -- and faster.

     The CAMERA slowly begins to PULL BACK.  As it does we see what
     we are watching is on a TELEVISION.

     Further back still.  We see TWO UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICERS
     standing before the television watching the act.

     The CAMERA begins to pan around the room.  Rain streaks down
     the windows of the room -- LIGHTNING flashes outside.  A VIDEO
     CAMERA is set up on a tripod.  More PLAIN CLOTHES POLICE,
     looking, dusting, talking.

     We continue to PAN.  We can now see it is the same room on the
     tape.  ON the bed lies the naked body of ANDREW MARSH, a sheet
     covering his lower torso.  His face is ashen, mouth open, his
     dull eyes looking out in a fixed stare.  The last instant of
     his life is etched upon a face frozen in pain.


     EXT.  RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

     LIGHTNING fills the night sky.  THUNDER BOOMS overhead.  The
     wind whips the RAIN furiously against anything in its path.
     The CAMERA moves slowly along rows of beautiful HOMES.  At the
     end is a cul-de-sac.  Several POLICE CARS are in the driveway,
     their RED LIGHTS FLASHING.

     A four-door SEDAN pulls into the driveway.  JOHN CARDENAS steps
     out into the rain.  He is a handsome Latin in his thirties,
     with hard, chiseled features and black, slicked-backed hair.
     He does not run through the rain -- he walks.

     DETECTIVE REESE, a man who looks more like an accountant than a
     homicide detective runs out to meet him.

                                                                 2


                         CARDENAS
               Is it Marsh?

                         REESE
               Yeah.

     Just a hint of sadness shows on Cardenas' face.  It lasts an
     instant, then it's gone.

                         REESE
               Sir, do you mind if we get out of the
               rain?

     Cardenas doesn't move.  He ignores the question.

                         CARDENAS
               Who found him?

                         REESE
               His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.

                         CARDENAS
               She was here?

                         REESE
               No.  She stopped by to pick up some
               papers.

                         CARDENAS
               Show me.

     Reese starts for the house.  Cardenas looks up into the night
     sky.  A FLASH of LIGHTNING fills the SCREEN.


     INT.  HOUSE, BEDROOM - CLOSE ON CAMERA - NIGHT

     Pull back to reveal a POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER snapping pictures of
     Marsh in bed.

     Cardenas enters followed by Reese.  He moves through the
     FORENSIC and MEDICAL TEAMS.  Anything Cardenas feels about the
     gruesome sight before him is hidden behind a mask of
     indifference.

     Standing by the bed is ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY, ROGER
     TROXELL, a short, baby-faced man.  Cardenas looks down at the
     body, then over at the MEDICAL EXAMINER, DR. HENRY McCURDY, a
     portly man with windblown cheeks and bloodshot eyes.

                         CARDENAS
               How long?
                                                                  3

                         MCCURDY
               About three hours.

                         CARDENAS
               Cause?

                         MCCURDY
               Not sure.  I'll have everything you
               need tomorrow.

                         REESE
               Take a look at this.

     Reese points to the nightstand drawer and Troxell opens it.  On
     top of the nightstand is a box of tissues and a bottle of nasal
     spray.  Inside are ROPES, HANDCUFFS and an assortment of SEXUAL
     AIDES.

                         TROXELL
               This guy was into some kinky shit.

     Cardenas looks at the various sexual devices, then walks out of
     the room.


     INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT

     JOANNE BRASLOW sits on chair.  Her eyes are tired -- red from
     crying.  She is mid thirties -- attractive, but her looks come
     more from effort than nature -- expensive hair cut -- the right
     cosmetics.  She has a corporate look to her.

     Cardenas steps into the hall and walks over to her.

                         CARDENAS
               Miss Braslow -- I'm District Attorney
               John Cardenas.  You arrived at what
               time tonight?

                         JOANNE
               A little after eleven.

                         CARDENAS
               Why did you come by?

                         JOANNE
               I had some papers to pick up.

                              CARDENAS
                    Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?

                              JOANNE
                    I assume his girlfriend.


                                                                      4

                              CARDENAS
                    Her name?

                              JOANNE
                    Rebecca Lawson.

                              CARDENAS
                    You wouldn't know her address, would
                    you?

                              JOANNE
                    No -- but I can get it for you.

                              CARDENAS
                    Thank you.


          INT.  HALLWAY, CITY HALL BUILDING - DAY

          Cardenas walks down the corridor with McCurdy.

                              MCCURDY
                    Marsh wasn't alone.  We found traces
                    of sperm on the sheets.  The
                    toxicology report says there were
                    high levels of cocaine in his blood.

                              CARDENAS
                    What'd he die of?

                              MCCURDY
                    The official cause of death was a
                    cardiac arrest.

                              CARDENAS
                    The official cause?

                              MCCURDY
                    That's what my report will read.

                              CARDENAS
                    But there's more?

          They reach a door and stop.

                              MCCURDY
                    It's speculative at this point.
                    Marsh had advanced Arterial disease.
                    His heart attack was induced by
                    excessive aerobic activity -- in
                    conjunction with the drug.

          McCurdy enters the room.  Cardenas thinks for a moment, then
          follows.


                                                                      5


          INT.  CARDENAS' OFFICE - DAY

          Spacious and sparsely furnished.  The walls are empty.  No
          commendations, plaques or photographs to add prestige to the
          office.  Cardenas steps into the room and looks at McCurdy who
          is already seated next to Reese and Troxell.

                              CARDENAS
                         (to McCurdy)
                    What are you saying, Henry?  That his
                    girlfriend fucked him to death?

                              MCCURDY
                    Yes.

          A trace of a grin shows on Cardenas' face.  He walks over to
          the window and stares outside.  Reese, Troxell and McCurdy wait
          as he thinks.  A beat.  Cardenas turns back to the room.

                              CARDENAS
                    What can we prove?

                              MCCURDY
                    We know Marsh had a head cold.   We
                    found cocaine mixed with water in a
                    nasal spray container on the
                    nightstand.  The coke would contract
                    the nasal membrane the same as any
                    decongestant, but for a much shorter
                    time.  He'd keep using more and more
                    -- never knowing what he was taking.

                              CARDENAS
                    Any prints on the nasal spray?

                              REESE
                    Marsh's and Rebecca Lawson's.

                              TROXELL
                    What if he did know what was in it?
                    A lot of users put it in nasal spray
                    bottles so they can use it in public.

                              MCCURDY
                    Cocaine is the last thing a man in
                    his condition would want.

                              CARDENAS
                    Can we put Rebecca Lawson at the
                    scene?

                                                                      6


                              REESE
                    A man across the street from Marsh
                    saw her drive up about four thirty
                    Sunday afternoon.  And her prints are
                    all over the place.

          Cardenas stands and walks to a DART BOARD on the wall.  He
          gathers the DARTS, moves back and tosses one.

                              TROXELL
                    Marsh's Cardiologist told me that
                    after Marsh was diagnosed with heart
                    disease he quit smoking, quit
                    drinking and started exercising every
                    day.  Does that sound like a guy
                    who'd start shoveling cocaine up his
                    nose?

                              CARDENAS
                    What did he say about Miss Lawson?

                              TROXELL
                    He can remember at least one occasion
                    -- and the receptionist can recall
                    two times when she accompanied Marsh
                    to the office.

          Cardenas throws another dart at the board.

                              CARDENAS
                    So she knew about his heart?

                              TROXELL
                    Had to.  I also interviewed three
                    women who were in past relationships
                    with Marsh.  There's no evidence that
                    he had anything but straight sex
                    prior to meeting Miss Lawson.

                              CARDENAS
                    What about the will?

                              TROXELL
                    That's the best part.  She gets it
                    all -- everything.


          EXT.  CEMETERY - MORNING

          Gray clouds hang over head.  A light drizzle falls.  A GROUP of
          MOURNERS hold umbrellas as they stand around the grave.

          In the b.g. the PRESS is visible, held back my private SECURITY
          GUARDS.

                                                                      7


          A WOMAN dressed in BLACK stands in the front of the MOUNERS,
          her face hidden behind a hat and veil.  RAYMOND SATTLER, a
          tall, distinguished-looking man in his sixties stands beside
          her.  He supports his weight with the aid of a CANE.  The
          service concludes.  Sattler along with several other PEOPLE
          offer her their condolences.  Joanne Braslow is there.  She
          does not go over to Rebecca.

          CARDENAS AND REESE stand off to the side by a large oak tree.
          Cardenas watches and waits.  He steps forward as Sattler leads
          the woman by.

                              CARDENAS
                    Miss Lawson?

          The Woman stops.  Her back is to Cardenas.

                              CARDENAS
                    I'm District Attorney, John Cardenas.

          REBECCA LAWSON removes her hat and veil and slowly turns
          around.  She is in her late twenties.  A deep pain fills her
          face -- controlled, but evident.  Her eyes are tired -- heavy
          from crying -- but no tears show now.  This is a woman whose
          grief is private and not displayed for others.  Although
          emotionally drained she is still stunningly beautiful.  So
          beautiful that even Cardenas' usually cool demeanor cannot hide
          how impressed he is.

                              SATTLER
                    I don't think that this is the time,
                    or the place.

                              CARDENAS
                    I just wanted to introduce myself and
                    inform Miss Lawson that there will be
                    an inquiry.

                              SATTLER
                    An inquiry into what?

                              CARDENAS
                    For starters I'd like to know why she
                    left the house and didn't report the
                    death?

                              SATTLER
                    Because he wasn't dead when she left,
                    and even if he was, not reporting a
                    natural death in a timely fashion
                    isn't a crime.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did I say it was a natural death?

                                                                      8


          Cardenas and Rebecca lock eyes.  Rebecca stares at him
          genuinely shocked by his accusation.  Cardenas nods and walks
          away.  In the b.g. we see Joanne staring at Rebecca with
          hostility.


          INT.  HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Large and homey.  A fire roars in the fireplace.  FRANK DULANEY
          sits on his couch as he goes over some PAPERWORK.  He is mid-
          thirties, powerful, self-assured.

          SHARON DULANEY enters.  She is an attractive woman in her early
          thirties.  She kisses him on the cheek then pushes his
          PAPERWORK aside and sits down on his lap.

                              SHARON
                    You're on vacation, remember?  You're
                    supposed to be relaxing.

                              DULANEY
                    I am relaxing.

                              SHARON
                         (pushing the papers
                          aside)
                    This is not relaxing.

                              DULANEY
                         (playfully)
                    Really?

                              SHARON
                    Really.

                              DULANEY
                         (playing along)
                    And I suppose you're going to show me
                    how to relax?

                              SHARON
                    If you want me to.

                              DULANEY
                    I'm always open to learning new
                    things.

          She kisses him -- soft, gentle kisses.  Dulaney puts his arms
          around her and kisses her harder.

                              DULANEY
                    I'm beginning to see what you mean.
                    Why don't we go upstairs and work on
                    the advanced course?

                                                                      9


                              SHARON
                    I can't.  I've got to finish a
                    counter offer on the Bergman
                    property.

          The moment is passing by.  A trace of frustration shows on
          Dulaney's face -- this is obviously not a new occurrence.

                              DULANEY
                    Can't it wait?

                              SHARON
                    No -- it has to be done by tomorrow.

          The moment is gone.  Dulaney forces an understanding smile.  He
          looks towards the door and sees his EIGHT YEAR OLD SON,
          MICHAEL.

                              DULANEY
                    Hey, Slugger.  Ready for bed?

          Michael walks over to this parents.

                              MICHAEL
                    Uh huh.

          The PHONE RINGS.  Dulaney answers it.

                              DULANEY
                         (into phone)
                    Hello?... Hi Raymond.... What?...
                    Well, I was sort of planning on...
                    Alright... Okay, goodbye.
                         (hangs up; to Sharon)
                    That was Sattler.  He thinks the
                    D.A.'s going to file on Rebecca
                    Lawson.  He wants me in the office
                    tomorrow morning.

                              SHARON
                    We're supposed to go to the lake.

                              DULANEY
                    I know.  What can I do?  He is the
                    boss.

                              SHARON
                    He could let you have your vacation.

                              MICHAEL
                    Dad -- is it true what they're saying
                    about that Miss Lawson Lady?


                                                                      10

                              DULANEY
                    What are they saying?

                              MICHAEL
                    The kids at school say she humped Mr.
                    Marsh to death.

                              DULANEY
                    Hey, you know better than that.  What
                    did I teach you to say when someone
                    is accused of doing something?

                              MICHAEL
                    She allegedly humped him to death?

          Dulaney grins.  Sharon is fighting the temptation to laugh.

                              SHARON
                    I swear -- the both of you.
                         (to Dulaney)
                    Some example you set.

                              DULANEY
                         (imitating her)
                    Some example you set.

          He makes a funny face at Michael who LAUGHS and makes one back.
          Dulaney grabs him and starts TICKLING him.  Michael SCREAMS
          with LAUGHTER as he tries to tickle him back.  Dulaney then
          starts TICKLING SHARON -- Michael helps him.  Sharon ROARS with
          LAUGHTER and falls to the floor.  The three of them roll around
          LAUGHING hysterically.


          INT.  SATTLER'S OFFICE - MORNING

          Sattler sits on a couch sipping a cup of coffee.  Dulaney sits
          across from him.

                              DULANEY
                    Andrew Marsh was a very wealthy man.
                    A trial like this is going to put
                    Cardenas in the spot-light.

                              SATTLER
                    We've already got press arriving from
                    over the country and she hasn't even
                    been charged yet.
                    Cardenas wants to see her in his
                    office tomorrow at ten.  I'd like you
                    to go with her.

                              DULANEY
                    I'm supposed to be on vacation.


                                                                      11

                              SATTLER
                    I know -- but she wants you to
                    represent her if Cardenas files.

                              DULANEY
                    Why?

                              SATTLER
                    Because I told her you were the best
                    criminal attorney we have.

                              DULANEY
                    Raymond, I'm the only criminal
                    attorney you have.

                              SATTLER
                         (jokingly)
                    Well, I guess that makes you the
                    best.
                         (candidly)
                    Look, Frank -- she stands to inherit
                    three million dollars.  As executors
                    of the estate and her attorneys that
                    could generate a lot of legal fees
                    for us.  All I'm asking you to do is
                    talk to her.

          Dulaney thinks about it for a moment.

                              DULANEY
                    Alright, I'll talk to her

                              SATTLER
                    She's waiting in the conference room.

          Dulaney stands and walks towards the door.

                              SATTLER
                         (continuing)
                    You know, I knew Andrew Marsh for
                    almost twenty years -- or thought I
                    did.  What do you think would make a
                    man in his condition do the things he
                    did?

          Dulaney stops at the door and looks back.

                              DULANEY
                    I think the question is:  What is it
                    about her that made him want to do
                    it?



                                                                      12

          INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          Rebecca is seated at the end of the conference table smoking a
          CIGARETTE.  Sunlight flows through a window and highlights her
          hair.  She is dressed in a fashionable business suit that
          clings to every curve of her body.

          Dulaney enters the room.  When he sees her he can't help but
          stare.  Rebecca notes his gaze.

                              DULANEY
                    Miss Lawson, I'm Frank Dulaney.

          She raises the cigarette to her lips.  Dulaney notices despite
          her outward composure her hand is shaking.

                              REBECCA
                         (nervously)
                    Are you going to represent me?

                              DULANEY
                    There are no charges against you. I'm
                    here to decide if I'm going to
                    represent you should that occur.
                         (beat)
                    Did you kill him?

          Rebecca appears hurt by the question.

                              REBECCA
                    You don't waste any time, do you?

          Dulaney doesn't answer.  He studies her -- his eyes probing
          hers.

                              REBECCA
                         (continuing)
                    Do you think I did it?

                              DULANEY
                    I don't know.  That's why I'm asking
                    you.

                              REBECCA
                    You must have some feeling.  Some
                    immediate impression.  A young,
                    attractive woman, involved with an
                    older man who leaves her everything
                    in his will.  And the things that
                    went on in that house.  Such wild
                    sex.  What kind of picture does that
                    paint?

                              DULANEY
                    Not a very good one I'm afraid.

                                                                      13


                              REBECCA
                    And that's exactly what the jury will
                    see when they look at me.  That's why
                    I need a very good lawyer, Mr.
                    Dulaney.

                              DULANEY
                    You're assuming the District Attorney
                    is going to file charges.

          Rebecca's anxiety begins to surface.  She feigns a weak smile.

                              REBECCA
                    He'll file.  He's an ambitious man.
                    Ambitious men build their careers on
                    the bodies of others.

                              DULANEY
                    You still haven't answered my
                    question.

          She takes a long drag of her cigarette before answering.  She
          looks at Dulaney.  Displaying emotions is not something that
          comes easily.  Tears well up in her eyes.

                              REBECCA
                         (emotionally)
                    I loved him.  A big part of my life
                    has been torn away from me, Mr.
                    Dulaney.  A part I can never get back
                    -- and on top of that people are
                    saying that I am somehow responsible
                    for it.  They've taken everything
                    that is good and caring about two
                    people in love and made it dirty.

          A single tear streams down her check.  She knows what he wants
          to hear her say -- and she resents having to say it.

                              REBECCA
                    No -- I didn't kill him.


          INT.  HALLWAY, D.A.'S OFFICE - DAY

          Cardenas walks down the hall, sipping a cup of coffee.  Troxell
          walks towards him excitedly.  They walk together.

                              TROXELL
                    I think I'm going to make your day.

                              CARDENAS
                    How?


                                                                      14

          Troxell points to an Office.  Through the glass partition we
          can see a MAN sitting at a table.  ALAN PALEY is a well-groomed
          man in his thirties who makes every effort to look good.

                              TROXELL
                    I've got this guy in my office.
                    Doctor Alan Paley.  Wait until you
                    hear what he has to say.

          Cardenas and Troxell enters the room.  Cardenas shakes hands
          with Paley and listens with great interest as he starts to
          talk.


          INT.  DULANEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Dulaney and Sharon are in bed.  Dulaney reads some PAPERS.
          Sharon finishes reading her MAGAZINE.  She puts it on the
          nightstand and looks at Dulaney.

                              SHARON
                    How can Cardenas possibly think he
                    can build a case against two
                    consenting adults?

                              DULANEY
                    He must have something or he wouldn't
                    be pressing so hard.

                              SHARON
                    If he files are you going to take the
                    case?

                              DULANEY
                    I don't know yet.  I want to hear
                    what she says at her statement
                    tomorrow.

                              SHARON
                    What's she like?

                              DULANEY
                    Attractive.  Bright.  Distant.
                    Charming when she wants to be.

          Dulaney's description seems to bother her.

                              SHARON
                    She sounds like quite a woman.

                              DULANEY
                         (joking)
                    Yeah -- but can she cook?

          Sharon hits him on the arm playfully.

                                                                      15


                              SHARON
                    The whole thing gives me the creeps.
                    I mean -- what if she really humped
                    him to death?

          Dulaney grins at her choice of words.

                              DULANEY
                    Humped

                              SHARON
                         (grinning)
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    I can think of worse ways to go--

          Dulaney rolls over, gathering her up in his arms.

                              DULANEY
                         (continuing)
                    --and speaking of humping.

          He reaches over to the nightstand and turns off the LIGHTS.


          EXT.  CITY HALL BUILDING MORNING

          As Dulaney and Rebecca walks up the steps they are engulfed by
          a CROWD of REPORTERS.  Dulaney puts his arm around Rebecca and
          ushers her through the crowd.


          INT.  CARDENAS' OFFICE - MORNING

          Dulaney and Rebecca sit on one side of a table.  Reese stands.
          Cardenas sits at his desk.

                              REBECCA
                    I didn't know that Andrew was dead
                    until Mr. Sattler called me at home
                    that night.

                              REESE
                    We have a witness who saw you go into
                    the house at four thirty.

                              DULANEY
                    She's not denying she was there.

                              REESE
                    Did you have sex?


                                                                      16

                              REBECCA
                    Yes.

                              REESE
                    What time did you leave?

                              REBECCA
                    Six thirty -- and he was very much
                    alive.

                              CARDENAS
                    Miss Lawson, do you use cocaine?

                              REBECCA
                    I have.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did you use it the night Marsh died?

                              REBECCA
                    No.  I haven't done it in years.

                              REESE
                    Did Marsh use it?

                              REBECCA
                    No -- never.

                              REESE
                    It had to get there somehow.

                              REBECCA
                    It didn't get there from me.

                              CARDENAS
                    Were you aware of Mr. Marsh's heart
                    condition?

                              REBECCA
                    No.

                              CARDENAS
                    Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his
                    nurse have told us that you
                    accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office
                    on at least two occasions.

                              REBECCA
                    That's correct -- but Andrew never
                    told me he had a heart condition.  He
                    said he had a heart arrhythmia and it
                    was nothing serious.

                              REESE
                    He never mentioned his heart disease?

                                                                      17


                              DULANEY
                    She just said that.

                              REESE
                    Why do you think he lied to you?

                              DULANEY
                    That's something only Marsh would
                    know.

                              REESE
                    I think Miss Lawson knew it too.  I
                    think she slipped him the coke and he
                    popped his cork giving her the high-
                    hard-one.

          Dulaney's anger shows.  He stands.

                              DULANEY
                    That's it.  My client doesn't have to
                    take this crap from you.

                              CARDENAS
                    Sit down, Frank.

                              DULANEY
                    No.  Miss Lawson came in here
                    voluntarily to answer your questions.
                    She doesn't have to sit here and be
                    insulted.  So, either you charge her
                    now or we're leaving.

          A beat.  Dulaney and Cardenas lock eyes.  Cardenas shrugs his
          shoulders.

                              CARDENAS
                    Fine.

          Dulaney motions for Rebecca to get up.  She stands and they
          walk to the door.  Reese looks at Cardenas.  Cardenas nods.

                              REESE
                    Rebecca Lawson, you're under arrest
                    for the murder of Andrew Marsh.

          Rebecca is stunned -- frightened.  She looks at Dulaney in
          disbelief.  Dulaney looks at Cardenas angrily.  Reese removes
          his handcuffs as he moves towards Rebecca.

                              REESE
                    You have the right to remain silent.
                    If you give up--


                                                                      18

                              CARDENAS
                         (to Reese)
                    I don't think the handcuffs will be
                    necessary.  You can finish giving
                    Miss Lawson her rights outside.

          Reese grabs Rebecca by the arm and leads her to the door.  She
          looks back at Frank, her face filled with fear -- her eyes
          welling with tears.

                              REBECCA
                         (frightened)
                    Frank!

                              DULANEY
                    I'll have you out in a few hours.

          Reese ushers her through the door.  A beat.  Dulaney and
          Cardenas are left alone.  Cardenas starts fishing through a can
          of NUTS, carefully extracting the cashews.  Dulaney continues
          to stand.

                              DULANEY
                    Lookin' to make the papers, John?

                              CARDENAS
                    Marsh left her close to three million
                    dollars in his will.  That's motive.
                    She admits to being there the night
                    of his death.  That's opportunity --
                    and her fingerprints are on the nasal
                    spray bottle.

                              DULANEY
                         (continuing)
                    You can't show intent.

          Cardenas looks at Dulaney wryly.  He knows that Dulaney is
          trying to discover his game plan.  Cardenas looks into his can
          of nuts and fishes for another cashew.

                              DULANEY
                         (continuing)
                    Can you?

                              CARDENAS
                    Take your pole out of the water,
                    Frank.  The fish ain't biting today.

                              DULANEY
                    You're bluffing.  John, it's me,
                    remember?  I've known you since your
                    name was Juan Carlos.

          Cardenas doesn't appreciate Dulaney mentioning his real name.

                                                                      19


                              DULANEY
                         (continuing)
                    C'mon -- think about it.  If she was
                    going to kill Marsh why leave the
                    nasal spray bottle there for the
                    police to find?

                              CARDENAS
                    She planned this.  She wanted us to
                    find the nasal spray.

                              DULANEY
                    Why would she want that?

                              CARDENAS
                    Because she's clever.  Because she
                    knows that even if we didn't find it
                    we'd have suspicions as to why a man
                    in Marsh's condition would use
                    cocaine.

                              DULANEY
                    Suspicions maybe -- but suspicions
                    aren't enough for a conviction.

                              CARDENAS
                    The M.E.'s report stated that Marsh's
                    nasal membranes showed no sign of
                    prior cocaine use.  Without the nasal
                    spray we would have still treated it
                    as a poisoning.  We would have looked
                    for motive and the trail would have
                    still led back to her.

                              DULANEY
                    I don't buy it and neither will a
                    jury.

                              CARDENAS
                    We're going all the way on this one,
                    Frank.  Tell your client she has
                    until the prelim to cop a plea for
                    murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.

                              DULANEY
                    I'll tell her but she won't take it.

                              CARDENAS
                    Then she's not as smart as I thought
                    she was.  You've seen her in the
                    depositions.  Tell me you don't have
                    any doubts?


                                                                      20

                              DULANEY
                    She's innocent.

                              CARDENAS
                    Aren't they all?

                              DULANEY
                    Yeah.  Well -- we'll let the
                    blindfolded lady with the scales
                    decide that.

          Dulaney gets up slowly and leaves.


          INT.  CITY JAIL, BOOKING COUNTER - AFTERNOON

          Dulaney waits at the counter.  A barred door slides open and
          Rebecca is led out by a WOMAN JAILER.  Even in these
          surroundings she maintains her composure.  She walks to the
          counter and waits silently.


          EXT.  CITY HALL BUILDING - AFTERNOON

          As Dulaney and Rebecca leave they are once again encircled by
          REPORTERS, screaming questions, asking them to verify Rebecca's
          arrest.  Dulaney plows through the crowd with Rebecca in tow.


          EXT.  RIVER - AFTERNOON

          Gray clouds hang overhead, threatening rain.  Tall birch trees
          line the river, the color of their leaves hinting that autumn
          is approaching.  Dulaney and Rebecca walk along a jogging path
          cut along the bank.

                              DULANEY
                    I want you to know right now that the
                    trial's going to be nasty.  Your sex
                    life is going to be dragged through
                    the mud.  They're going to say that
                    you enticed Marsh -- led him down a
                    dark path.

                              REBECCA
                    Andrew hardly needed leading.  He was
                    a very passionate man.  He was eager
                    to explore.  I gave him what he
                    wanted.  We fulfilled each others
                    needs.

                              DULANEY
                    This is a very small town -- people
                    here have very straight views on sex.


                                                                      21

                              REBECCA
                    I'm used to being on the outside
                    looking in.  The same men who will
                    publicly profess their moral outrage
                    for my sexual tastes are the same
                    ones who privately rest their sweaty
                    little hands on my legs and talk
                    about weekend trips together.

                              DULANEY
                    Those same men will be sitting on the
                    jury.

                              REBECCA
                    I am who I am.  I can't deny it,
                    anymore than you can deny who you
                    are.  I like sex different -- I like
                    it wild.  That's not a crime.
                         (emotional)
                    I loved Andrew.  We made love
                    together.  We made it differently,
                    but we still made love.  It was our
                    way.  It was private -- and now the
                    whole world wants to look in through
                    the pretense of justice.  If I was
                    some middle-aged divorcee who screwed
                    him once a week do you think this
                    would be happening to me?

          She stops walking and stares out over the River.

                              REBECCA
                    Have you ever seen animals make love,
                    Mr. Dulaney?  They have such passion
                    -- such savage emotion.  They
                    struggle, and snarl, and claw, but
                    neither hurts the other.  Not really.

                              DULANEY
                    No pain, no gain?

                              REBECCA
                    Something like that.

                              DULANEY
                    We're not animals.

          As Rebecca speaks, Dulaney seems captivated.


                                                                      22

                              REBECCA
                    Of course we are.  Our primal urges
                    are still there -- but we've taken
                    sex and intellectualized it, refined
                    it down to its most essential
                    components.  It's bland, easy,
                    mechanical.  There's great passion in
                    the struggle -- such craving in
                    denial.  Do you know what it's like
                    to yearn for something?  I'm not
                    talking about wanting, or needing.
                    I'm talking about an urge so deep
                    that your skin burns and every cell
                    in your body pulses with desire?

          Dulaney appears moved by the passion of her words -- but he's
          uncomfortable by it and quickly pushes it aside.

                              DULANEY
                         (awkwardly)
                    I think we're getting a little off
                    the subject here.

                              REBECCA
                    I thought the subject was sex?

                              DULANEY
                    As it pertains to you -- not me.
                         (beat)
                    Did you always know you had
                    different... tastes?

                              REBECCA
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    How?

                              REBECCA
                    I don't know if it's something I can
                    explain to you.

                              DULANEY
                    Why not?

                              REBECCA
                    Because -- it's beyond intellect.
                    It's emotion.  It's passion.  It has
                    to be experienced -- it can't be
                    imagined.

                              DULANEY
                    Try.

          Rebecca thinks for a moment.

                                                                      23


                              REBECCA
                    When I was growing up we had a
                    strawberry patch in our backyard. So
                    did this family down the road.  I
                    used to sneak in their yard and steal
                    their strawberries.  It wasn't easy.
                    The stone walls were high and I'd
                    scrape my knees as I climbed over.
                    On the other side were wild rose
                    bushes.  The thorns would dig into my
                    legs and cut my thighs as I lowered
                    myself down.

                              DULANEY
                    If you had what you wanted at home
                    why did you sneak into their yard?

                              REBECCA
                    Because -- somehow the fruit always
                    tasted that much sweeter because of
                    the pain it took to get to it.

          Dulaney appears lost in her words.  This isn't lost on Rebecca.
          She walks off.  Dulaney stares after her intrigued.


          INT.  DULANEY'S HOUSE, DINING ROOM - EVENING

          A light rain falls outside.  Dulaney picks at his food.  He
          stares out the window.  He seems oblivious to the conversation
          between Sharon and Michael.

                              MICHAEL
                    Albert's got the stomach flu.

                              SHARON
                    That's too bad.

                              MICHAEL
                    No, it's not.  Now I get to pitch.

                              SHARON
                    Michael, you shouldn't be happy when
                    someone else isn't feeling well.

                              MICHAEL
                    Not even if they're a dork?

                              SHARON
                    Not even if they're a dork.  You
                    should go by and see how he's
                    feeling.


                                                                      24

                              MICHAEL
                    No way.  Jerry Milner stopped by and
                    Albert puked right in front of him.

          Sharon tries to suppress a grin.

                              SHARON
                    Don't use language like that at the
                    dinner table.

                              MICHAEL
                    Sorry.

          Sharon looks at Dulaney.  He is still staring out the window,
          deep in thought.


          INT.  DEN - EVENING

          Dulaney is at his desk, looking at PHOTOGRAPHS of Marsh and the
          bedroom.  Sharon enters.

                              SHARON
                    Frank -- I know you're busy, but
                    Michael asked me after dinner if you
                    were angry with him.  He wanted to
                    know why you weren't talking to him.

                              DULANEY
                    I'll talk to him later.

                              SHARON
                    Why don't you talk to him now?

                              DULANEY
                    Because I go to trial in seven weeks.
                    I've got a lot of preparing to do.

                              SHARON
                         (angry)
                    No one's asking you not to work.  I
                    just think you could make some time
                    for your son.


          INT.  MICHAEL'S BEDROOM - EVENING

          Michael lies on his bed, doing his homework.  The door opens
          and Dulaney enters and sits beside him.

                              DULANEY
                    I'm sorry if it looks like I'm not
                    paying attention to you lately.


                                                                      25

          Michael looks at Dulaney somewhat confused.  Dulaney tries to
          explain it another way.

                              DULANEY
                         (continuing)
                    You know how it is sometimes when
                    you're out playing ball with your
                    friends?  How you're really
                    concentrating on what you're doing --
                    and you lose track of time and you
                    come home late and Mom yells at you?

                              MICHAEL
                    Yeah.

                              DULANEY
                    Well, that's kind of how I am right
                    now.

                              MICHAEL
                    Is Mom yelling at you too?

          Dulaney grins.

                              DULANEY
                    Yeah -- a little.

          Dulaney leans over and hugs Michael.

                              DULANEY
                    I love you.

                              MICHAEL
                    I love you too, Dad.


          INT.  DULANEY'S OFFICE - MORNING

          CHARLIE BIGGS is a tall, wiry black man.  Street-wise, but
          basically good humored.  He is tossing a NERF BALL through a
          basketball hoop mounted on the wall as Dulaney enters.

                              BIGGS
                    How you doin' Mister D?

                              DULANEY
                    Fine, Charlie.  You familiar with the
                    Marsh case?


                                                                      26

                              BIGGS
                    Yeah -- I hear they had 'em a real
                    dog and pony show going on up there -
                    -  I'll tell you, sometimes white
                    people are a real puzzle to me.  I
                    mean, did this old guy really think
                    he was gonna be able to keep up with
                    a sweet little number like that?

                              DULANEY
                    It could've happened to anyone.

                              BIGGS
                         (ghetto accent)
                    I'm sorry, man -- but I ain't ever
                    heard of no brother dying from
                    gettin' too much pussy.

          Dulaney grins in spite of himself.

                              DULANEY
                    We have to find out who else would
                    profit from Marsh's death -- and who
                    knew enough about his personal life
                    to know that putting cocaine in the
                    nasal spray would be fatal.

                              BIGGS
                    So -- where do we start?

                              DULANEY
                    I want you to hit all the dealers in
                    town.  Give them a list of people
                    close to Marsh and see if any of them
                    use.  Then I want you to check out a
                    Doctor Alan Paley.  He lives up in
                    Roseburg.

          Dulaney's SECRETARY'S VOICE crackles over the intercom.

                              SECRETARY (VO)
                    Mister Dulaney, I have Rebecca Lawson
                    on one.

          Dulaney picks up the phone.

                              DULANEY
                         (on the phone)
                    Hi... No, I don't... One o'clock is
                    fine... Alright La Brasa... Bye.

          Dulaney hangs up.  Biggs is staring at him with a grin.

                              BIGGS
                    La Brasa?

                                                                      27


                              DULANEY
                         (defensive)
                    I'm taking a client to lunch.  Where
                    should I go, Taco Bell?

          Biggs tosses the ball to Dulaney, then raises his hands
          indicating he is backing off.  He leaves.  Dulaney shoots from
          his desk.  SWOOSH!


          INT.  RESTAURANT - DAY

          Dimly lit.  Dark wood and leather.  Dulaney sits at a table
          with Rebecca.  She removes a CIGARETTE and holds it, waiting
          for Dulaney to light it.  Dulaney fumbles through his pockets
          and removes a book of MATCHES.  He lights one.  Rebecca doesn't
          lean forward to meet him.  He must go to her.  She looks into
          his eyes as she cups her hand over his.  A beat.  She lights
          the cigarette and takes a drag, then arches her neck back and
          blows a stream of smoke towards the ceiling.  SHE DOES NOT BLOW
          OUT THE MATCH OR REMOVE HER HAND FROM DULANEY'S.  She watches
          him as it burns down towards his fingers.  After a long moment
          she leans in and sensually blows out the match and releases his
          hand.

                              DULANEY
                    How'd you meet Marsh?

                              REBECCA
                    I was at a cocktail party.  Very
                    trendy.  Andrew was in Chicago on
                    business.  He had broken his wrist
                    the week before and was wearing it in
                    a sling.  He looked so helpless.

          A FOURSOME a few tables away are staring at her.  Rebecca sees
          them.

                              DULANEY
                    -- And then?

                              REBECCA
                    We started talking.  In fact, we
                    talked until four in the morning.  We
                    discovered we shared a lot of the
                    same interests.  After that we were
                    together all the time until he left.
                    He used to call me every night after
                    he came back.  Then after a few weeks
                    he invited me to come visit him.
                    I've never left.

                              DULANEY
                    Why didn't you live together?

                                                                      28


                              REBECCA
                    Andrew was worried about how it would
                    look.

          A COUPLE in a booth are looking at Rebecca and whispering.
          Rebecca and Dulaney notice them.

                              REBECCA
                    Can we get out of here?

                              DULANEY
                    Sure.  Where to?

          Rebecca stands up.  She doesn't answer.  She just walks off.


          EXT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

          Dulaney pulls up in his car behind Rebecca's.  They get out.
          Dulaney follows her as she walks to the door.

                              DULANEY
                    This is your house.

                              REBECCA
                         (walking towards the
                          door)
                    I know.

          Dulaney stops.

                              DULANEY
                    I don't think this is a good idea.

          Rebecca stops and turns towards him.

                              REBECCA
                    Why not?

                              DULANEY
                    Because, I'm your attorney.  I
                    shouldn't be going to your house.

                              REBECCA
                    Is it against the law?

                              DULANEY
                    No -- it just doesn't look right.

          Rebecca stares at him for a moment, then looks down the street
          to her left and back to her right, then back at Dulaney.

                              REBECCA
                    No one's looking.

                                                                      29


          She walks to her front door and opens it.  She enters, leaving
          the door open.  Dulaney waits for a moment, then follows.


          INT.  REBECCA'S, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

          Dulaney enters.  Rebecca is standing in the middle of the room.
          Her back is to Dulaney, but she knows he is there.  Dulaney
          looks around the room.  He stares at a group of PHOTOGRAPHS on
          the wall.  On the other WALL is a GIANT TELEVISION SCREEN.

          DULANEY'S POV - OF THE WALL

          filled with EROTIC PAINTINGS AND PHOTOGRAPHS -- sensual but not
          vulgar.

          Rebecca walks over and stands very close to him as he studies
          the artwork.

                              REBECCA
                    What do you think?

                              DULANEY
                    I think the photographer's probably a
                    voyeur.

                              REBECCA
                    I'm the photographer.

                              DULANEY
                    Oh -- Well, they're different.

                              REBECCA
                    That's not an answer.

                              DULANEY
                    It's not my taste.

                              REBECCA
                         (seductively)
                    Tastes can change.

          Rebecca looks up to the top of a high cabinet.  Sitting on top
          of the cabinet is a WHITE PERSIAN CAT.

                              REBECCA
                    There you are.

          She stands on her tip toes as she reaches up.  Dulaney watches
          her -- the arch of her back -- the hem of her skirt rising up
          her legs.  She lowers the cat down and walks to a chair and
          sits down.  The slit of her dress opens revealing her thighs.
          Dulaney's eyes trace along them.  Rebecca notes his gaze.


                                                                      30

                              REBECCA
                    What are you thinking?

          Dulaney looks up quickly.

                              DULANEY
                    Nothing.

                              REBECCA
                    Not true.  Shall I tell you what you
                    were thinking?  You were wondering if
                    I was wearing anything under my
                    skirt.

          The fact that he doesn't protest confirms that she is right.
          She runs her finger lightly along her thighs.

                              REBECCA
                    I am.

          Dulaney walks to the window and stares out.  Rebecca seems
          amused.  She puts the cat down and walks over to him.

                              REBECCA
                    Sorry.  I wasn't trying to embarrass
                    you.

          He slowly turns towards her.

                              DULANEY
                    Yes you were.

          Dulaney stares at her for a moment, then places his briefcase
          on the table and opens it.


          INT.  RESTAURANT - CLOSE ON STRAWBERRIES - NIGHT

          A fork digs into a large strawberry.  PULL BACK as we follow
          the strawberry into Sharon's mouth.

          Dulaney sits across from Sharon.  His eyes are on the
          strawberries.  His mind is someplace else -- and it isn't hard
          to guess where.

                              SHARON
                    --he said it might be too expensive
                    to add another room.  He suggested we
                    might convert the garage into a guest
                    room.  He's going to check with the
                    contractor and let me know.  I'll let
                    you know how much and we can decide.
                    Alright?


                                                                      31

          Dulaney looks up slowly.  It is not so much that he has heard
          the question -- it is more that he is aware that Sharon has
          stopped talking.  A beat.  Sharon isn't sure he has heard her.

                              SHARON
                    Is that alright, Frank?

                              DULANEY
                    Yeah -- fine.  Excuse me.  I'll be
                    right back.

          He stands and leaves the table.


          INT.  RESTAURANT, HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Dulaney walks to a PAY PHONE near the bathrooms.  He thinks for
          a moment, then dials a number.  Rebecca answers.

                              REBECCA (VO)
                    Hello?

                              DULANEY
                    Hi.  It's Frank.

                              REBECCA (VO)
                    Hi, Frank.

                              DULANEY
                         (awkwardly)
                    I just wanted to see if my secretary
                    called to confirm your appointment
                    tomorrow.

                              REBECCA (VO)
                    Yes -- she did.

                              DULANEY
                    Great.  I'll see you at the office at
                    nine.

                              REBECCA (VO)
                    No -- not at the office.  I've got a
                    better idea.


          EXT.  CABIN, KLAMATH LAKE - AFTERNOON

          An old wood cabin set on the shore of the lake.  Dulaney and
          Rebecca get out of the car and walk towards it.

                              REBECCA
                    I figured if we have to talk all day
                    we might as well do it someplace
                    nice.

                                                                      32

                         (looks at the cabin)
                    Isn't it beautiful?

                              DULANEY
                    Yeah.

                              REBECCA
                         (sadly)
                    Andrew loved this old cabin.
                         (fondly remembering)
                    He always dreamed about moving to
                    Tahiti -- living in a hut and
                    becoming a beach-bum.
                         (a sad smile)
                    I could never imagine myself doing
                    that -- but somehow when he talked
                    about it, he made it sound so alive -
                    - so wonderful.  Soft ocean breezes
                    and beautiful sunsets -- leaving the
                    world and it's problems behind.  I
                    wish he'd had a chance to do it.

          Her mind drifts away for a moment, locked on some distant
          memory.

                              REBECCA
                         (snapping out of it)
                    Sorry.

                              DULANEY
                    It's okay.


          EXT.  LAKE, FURTHER - DUSK

          Dulaney and Rebecca walk along the shore.  A soft wind blows
          through her hair.

                              DULANEY
                    Tell me about Doctor Paley?

                              REBECCA
                    I hardly know him.  He wanted me and
                    he couldn't have me.

                              DULANEY
                    It's going to be hard to convince a
                    jury that he's testifying against you
                    in a murder trial because you blew
                    him off.

                              REBECCA
                         (confidently)
                    It won't be that hard.


                                                                      33

          She walks off.


          EXT.  CABIN - DUSK

          Dulaney and Rebecca sit on an old porch swing.

                              REBECCA
                    Did you always want to be a lawyer?

                              DULANEY
                    No -- I wanted to be a professional
                    hockey player.

                              REBECCA
                    Really?

                              DULANEY
                    Yeah.

                              REBECCA
                    That seems so far away from who you
                    are now.  What happened?

                              DULANEY
                    I broke my ankle skating.  That ended
                    that dream.

                              REBECCA
                    It's hard to let go of a dream, isn't
                    it?  To let go of what you want?

          Dulaney stares at her -- she looks beautiful in the warm light
          of the setting sun.  Their eyes meet.  He starts to lean in
          towards her -- then stops.  He gets up and walks away.


          EXT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - EVENING

          Rebecca's car pulls up in front.  Dulaney gets out.

                              REBECCA
                    I'm going to put the car away.  You
                    can let yourself in.  There's a key
                    under the flower pot.

          Rebecca drives to the rear of the building.  Dulaney walks to
          the door.  He lifts the FLOWER POT -- removes a KEY -- opens
          the door and goes inside.

          ANGLE - DOWN THE STREET

          Detective Reese is parked in his car, watching the house.  He
          glances at his watch, then makes a note in his note pad.


                                                                      34


          INT.  REBECCA'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING

          Rebecca walks over to the STEREO and turns on the CASSETTE
          PLAYER.  The room fills with soft, sexy MUSIC.  Dulaney stands
          in the middle of the room -- his eyes following her every move.

                              REBECCA
                    Yes -- it would be nice.

                              DULANEY
                    What would?

                              REBECCA
                    You and me -- making love.

                              DULANEY
                    Is that what you think I was
                    thinking?

                              REBECCA
                    No -- that's what I know you were
                    thinking.

          Before Dulaney can start to protest she continues.  She slowly
          walks behind him.  Dulaney stares straight ahead.

                              REBECCA
                    How often do you make love to your
                    wife, Frank?  Once a week?  Sometimes
                    twice?  There once was passion,
                    wasn't there?  But now it's bland,
                    predictable.  Tell me, when you do it
                    -- do you always think of her?  Or do
                    you wonder what it would be like to
                    be with someone else?  Someone wild.
                    Someone who would force you to lose
                    control.

          Her words strip his thoughts bare.  He is vulnerable.

                              REBECCA
                         (continuing)
                    There's nothing wrong in admitting
                    that you want me, Frank.

                              DULANEY
                    You take a lot for granted.

          Dulaney starts for the door.  Rebecca's cool exterior fades,
          giving way to her vulnerable side.


                                                                      35

                              REBECCA
                    Please stay, Frank.  I don't want to
                    be alone.  I don't expect anything
                    from you -- no demands -- no
                    complications.  I just need to feel
                    close to someone.

          Dulaney turns back towards her.  A beat.  He thinks for a
          moment, then walks back into the room.  Rebecca smiles warmly,
          invitingly.

                              REBECCA
                    I'll be back in a minute.  Help
                    yourself to a drink.

          She disappears down the hall.  Dulaney stands were he is,
          wondering what he is doing there.  He walks over to the BAR and
          pours a SCOTCH.  He looks down the hall.

          HIS POV - REBECCA'S BEDROOM

          The bedroom door is open.  The room is DARK -- Lit only by the
          moon.  Rebecca slowly pulls her sweater off over her head.
          MOONLIGHT washes over her body, SILHOUETTING her.  She runs her
          hands lightly over her stomach -- working her way up to her
          round, full breasts.  She stops for a moment -- and we sense
          she knows Dulaney is watching her.

          Dulaney stares at her -- mesmerized.  He knows he should turn
          away, but he cannot control the urge that moves him to look.

          One by one Rebecca unsnaps the buttons of her jeans, revealing
          her sheer, white panties.  She bends forward slightly and
          slowly peels the jeans down to her ankles -- then steps out of
          them.

          We can see the desire on Dulaney's face.  He looks away.  The
          conflict inside him grows.  He looks back.

          Rebecca walks into the hall.  She is barefoot --  wearing a
          long, slinky dress -- her eyes catch Dulaney's.  If she wasn't
          aware he was watching her before -- she is now.  It doesn't
          seem to bother her.  She moves towards him slowly -- her eyes
          inviting his.

          Dulaney moves towards her.  They meet in the middle of the
          room.  She waits -- he moves closer -- so close that he can
          smell her.  She cranes her neck back, subtly tempting him to
          bring his lips to hers.  The longing overcomes him.  He kisses
          her lightly -- the kiss lingers for a moment, then she grabs
          him forcefully by the hair, arching his head back.  She bites
          his lip.


                                                                      36

                              REBECCA
                         (whispering)
                    My way.

          Dulaney ignores her.  He tries to kiss her again.  She turns
          her head away.

          She walks down the hall into the bedroom and closes the door.
          Dulaney follows.  He tries the door -- it's locked.  He starts
          to knock -- stops -- turns and walks back into the living room.
          He starts to leave -- stops.  He looks at the bedroom door.
          His passion builds -- his hunger for her devours him.  He moves
          quickly down the hall -- eyes filled with determination.  He
          breaks the door open with his shoulder.

          Rebecca is standing in the center of the room -- as if waiting
          for him.  He moves to her.  She can see the fire in his eyes.
          He takes her in his arms -- kisses her neck feverishly --
          feeding his craving for her.

                              REBECCA
                    My way.

          He is lost within her now and doesn't hear her.  She pulls his
          hair, jerking his head back.  Her eyes command him to follow
          her demand.

          Something in him snaps -- a new door opens.  He pushes her back
          onto the DRESSING CABINET.  He kisses her, running his hand up
          her thighs, hiking up her dress.  She wraps her legs around his
          waist.  They move along the cabinet -- knocking jars and
          bottles to the floor.  He lifts her -- carries her to the bed -
          - lays her down and rips her dress from her body.  Their
          passion is unleased.  They grope and claw for one another
          hungrily.  She pulls his shirt off and bites him on the
          shoulder.  His face tenses from the pain, but he MOANS with
          pleasure.


          INT.  DULANEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Dark.  Sharon is asleep.  The door opens and Dulaney enters
          quietly.  He walks towards the bathroom.


          INT.  DULANEY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Dulaney splashes a handful of water across his face.  He
          unbuttons his shirt and takes it off -- wincing as he does.  He
          turns his back to the mirror.  Several deep FINGERNAIL SCRAPES
          are dug into his back.  He looks at himself in the mirror.



                                                                      37

          INT.  HALLWAY, LAW OFFICES - MORNING

          Dulaney and Biggs walk down the hall to a water cooler.  Biggs
          pours himself a glass.

                              BIGGS
                    Before you ask there's nothing new on
                    the coke.

                              DULANEY
                    You've got to get me something I can
                    use, Charlie.

                              BIGGS
                    I'm trying.

          Sattler walks over with another MAN.  He ignores Biggs.

                              SATTLER
                    Frank -- this is Harvey Willows from
                    the L.A. Times.  He'd like to ask you
                    a few questions.

                              MAN
                    It's an incredible story going on
                    here.
                         (as if quoting a
                          headline)
                    Woman accused of using sex to kill
                    lover.

                              BIGGS
                    I'll say -- it's gonna give a whole
                    new meaning to the state nickname.

          Biggs LAUGHS and walks off.  Sattler glares at him.  Dulaney
          smirks.

                              MAN
                         (confused)
                    What's the state nickname?

                              DULANEY
                         (dryly)
                    The Beaver State.


          EXT.  RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

          Rows of new Town Houses line the street.  Dulaney drives up and
          walks towards the front door of one of them.  He KNOCKS.
          JOANNE BRASLOW answers.  She stares at Dulaney innocently.



                                                                      38

          INT.  JOANNE'S TOWN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Sparsely decorated.  Very trendy.  High tech furniture and
          designer lights.  Joanne sits on the couch -- Dulaney on one of
          the chairs.  There is COFFEE on the table.

                              JOANNE
                    I worked for Mr. Marsh for six years.
                    He was a good man -- until she came
                    along.

                              DULANEY
                    What changed?

                              JOANNE
                    He did.  Look, I know you can lead a
                    horse to water but you can't make him
                    drink -- but you hold a pail of water
                    in front of an old horse for long
                    enough  -- and well...

          Joanne stops as emotion fills her.  Her eyes well with tears.

                              DULANEY
                    You don't really believe what the
                    district attorney is saying about
                    Miss Lawson, do you?

                              JOANNE
                    I don't know.  It's incredible to
                    think that anyone could be capable of
                    doing that -- but if anyone could it
                    would be Rebecca.

                              DULANEY
                    I take it you don't like Miss Lawson
                    very much?

                              JOANNE
                    I really don't know her that well.
                    We would say hello to each other when
                    I would come to the house, but that
                    was about it.

                              DULANEY
                    If you don't know her that well what
                    makes you think she's capable of
                    murder?

                              JOANNE
                    Andrew was a kind and gentle man, but
                    he was thirty years older than her.
                    Where's the attraction to sleep with
                    someone like that -- to have the kind
                    of sex they had.

                                                                      39


                              DULANEY
                    How do you know what kind of sex they
                    had?

                              JOANNE
                    I wasn't lookin' through the keyhole
                    if that's what you're thinking.  I'd
                    come to house sometimes to pick up
                    papers or speak to Andrew.  I'd find
                    their little toys all over the place.

                              DULANEY
                    Did Mr. Marsh use drugs?

                              JOANNE
                    No.

                              DULANEY
                    What about Miss Lawson?

                              JOANNE
                    Yes -- cocaine.

          Dulaney is shocked by this.

                              DULANEY
                    How do you know that?

                              JOANNE
                    I was at the house one morning -- I
                    thought Miss Lawson was upstairs with
                    Mr. Marsh.  When I went into the
                    guest bathroom she was standing in
                    front of the mirror pouring this
                    white powder out of a vial.

          Dulaney looks like he's been kicked in the stomach.

                              JOANNE
                    Is something wrong.

          A beat.  Dulaney looks at her slowly.
                              DULANEY
                    What?  No -- nothing.  Thank you for
                    your time.

          He gets up and walks to the door.  Joanne stands and stares
          after him with a trace of a grin.


          INT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - DAY

          Rebecca opens the front door and Dulaney barges into the room.

                                                                      40


                              DULANEY
                    You lied to me!

                              REBECCA
                    What?

                              DULANEY
                    I just left Joanne Braslow.  She told
                    me she saw you doing cocaine at
                    Marsh's house!

                              REBECCA
                    She's mistaken.

                              DULANEY
                         (Yelling)
                    That's not good enough, Goddamit!

                              REBECCA
                    It isn't true.  You have to believe
                    me.

                              DULANEY
                    No, I don't have to believe you.  The
                    jury has to believe you and answers
                    like he's lying or she's mistaken
                    aren't going to convince them.

                              REBECCA
                    I don't use cocaine anymore.  If she
                    says she saw me doing it she's lying.

                              DULANEY
                    Why would she lie?

                              REBECCA
                    I don't know, Frank -- but don't you
                    think that's something we should find
                    out?

          Dulaney is confused, struggling to decide if he believes her.


          INT.  LAUNDRY ROOM, DULANEY HOUSE - DAY

          Sharon is getting a load of washing ready.  She picks up one of
          Dulaney's tee shirts and notices several thin stripes of BLOOD
          near the shoulder.


          INT.  DULANEY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

          RAIN falls.  Dulaney enters the room to find Michael on the
          PHONE.  Dulaney appears nervous -- anxious.

                                                                      41


                              DULANEY
                    Michael -- get off the phone.

                              MICHAEL
                    Why?

                              DULANEY
                         (impatiently)
                    Because I'm expecting a call.

                              MICHAEL
                    -- But it's Sunday.

                              DULANEY
                         (snapping)
                    I know what day it is!  Get off the
                    phone.

                              MICHAEL
                         (hurt; into phone)
                    I gotta go.  I'll call you later.

          Michael hangs up and leaves the room.  Dulaney stares at the
          phone -- struggling against himself.  He picks it up and dials.

                              REBECCA'S VOICE
                    This is Rebecca Lawson.  I'm not in
                    right now.  So if you please leave a
                    message--

          Dulaney slams down the phone.  He checks his watch.


          INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Dulaney wears another tee shirt as he sleeps.  Sharon is awake,
          staring up at the ceiling.  A beat.  She rolls over and
          carefully lifts up Dulaney's tee shirt.  She sees the scratches
          on his back.  She does not wake him.  She just lays there, deep
          in thought.


          INT.  HALLWAY, COURTHOUSE - MORNING

          Rebecca walks down the hall.  In the b.g. we see Dulaney
          walking quickly to join her.

                              DULANEY
                    I called you all weekend.  Where were
                    you?

                              REBECCA
                    I went out on the boat.


                                                                      42

                              DULANEY
                         (concerned)
                    Alone?

                              REBECCA
                    Of course.


          INT.  COURTROOM - MORNING

          The gallery is crowded with REPORTERS and SPECTATORS.  Dulaney
          sits beside Rebecca at the defense table.  Cardenas stands
          before the jury.

          Dulaney and Cardenas are seated at their respective tables.
          Rebecca sits beside Dulaney.  She is wearing a beautiful, well
          tailored dress.  She looks beautiful and has surprisingly made
          no attempt to down-play her looks.

          JUDGE BURNHAM, a confident BLACK MAN in his fifties sits behind
          the bench.  He is strong-willed -- tough but fair.  There is a
          rough edge to him from his childhood on the streets.


                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    This trial by its very nature is
                    explosive.  The press is going to
                    have a field day and I will not
                    tolerate any activity in my courtroom
                    that will fuel it.
                         (to Dulaney and
                          Cardenas)
                    Both of you are going to be delving
                    into very personal aspects of peoples
                    lives.  I warn you now.  When you do
                    so -- if you cannot establish a clear
                    line of relevancy early on in your
                    examinations I will stop you.  Is
                    that clear?

          Dulaney and Cardenas both nod.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Mr. Cardenas.

          Cardenas stands and walks towards the JURY.

                              CARDENAS
                         (points to Rebecca)
                    You all can see the defendant,
                    Rebecca Lawson.  But as this trial
                    proceeds you will see that she is not
                    only the defendant -- she is the
                    murder weapon itself.

                                                                      43

                         (stops and thinks for
                          a moment)
                    Is that possible?  Can a person
                    actually be a weapon?  The answer is
                    yes.  If I hit you and you die -- I
                    am the cause of your death.  But can
                    sex be called a weapon?  Yes.  And
                    what a deadly weapon Rebecca Lawson
                    made of it.  The State will prove
                    that Miss Lawson seduced Andrew Marsh
                    -- that she put increasing sexual
                    demands on him while she secretly
                    administered cocaine.  All the while
                    knowing that he had a severe heart
                    condition.
                         (beat)
                    She is a beautiful woman -- but when
                    this trial is over you will see her
                    no differently than a gun, or a knife
                    or any other instrument used as a
                    weapon.  She is a killer.  And the
                    worst kind -- one who disguised
                    herself as a loving partner.

          Cardenas walks back to the prosecution table and sits down.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Mr. Dulaney?

          Dulaney stands up and approaches the jury.

                              DULANEY
                    I know what you're thinking -- and
                    it's a mistake.  You look at Miss
                    Lawson and you see a beautiful woman
                    who was involved with an older man --
                    and you think she looks like the
                    type.  She could've done it.  And
                    that's exactly what the District
                    Attorney wants you to think.  Yes,
                    she is beautiful.  So what?  Does
                    that make her a killer?  Of course
                    not.  This case is not about
                    appearances.  It's about facts.
                         (beat)
                    As Mr. Cardenas presents his case you
                    will see that there are very few
                    facts -- that the bulk of the States
                    evidence is circumstantial.  I'm
                    confident that by the conclusion of
                    this trial you will not just have a
                    reasonable doubt.  You will have no
                    doubt at all --  that Rebecca Lawson
                    is innocent of the charges against
                    her.

                                                                      44



          INT.  COURTROOM - LATER - DAY

          McCurdy is on the witness stand.  Cardenas stands before him.

                              CARDENAS
                    Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of
                    death?

                              MCCURDY
                    A massive cardiac arrest.

                              CARDENAS
                    What was Mr. Marsh's physical
                    condition prior to his death?

                              MCCURDY
                    Very poor.  He was suffering from
                    severe arterial disease.

                              CARDENAS
                    Was the heart attack the result of
                    natural causes?

                              MCCURDY
                    No.

                              CARDENAS
                    What induced it?

                              MCCURDY
                    We found a high concentration of
                    cocaine in his blood.

                              CARDENAS
                    So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?

                              MCCURDY
                    I don't think so.  The membrane in
                    his nasal passage didn't show any
                    sign of long time usage.

                              CARDENAS
                    Then how did it get into his body?

                              MCCURDY
                    We found a bottle of Dristan nasal
                    spray on the nightstand.  It was
                    filled with water and cocaine.  Mr.
                    Marsh had a head cold at the time of
                    his death.  I believe he wasn't aware
                    that he was ingesting cocaine.


                                                                      45

          Cardenas holds up a bottle of NASAL SPRAY in a PLASTIC BAG.  He
          brings it over to McCurdy.

                              CARDENAS
                    Is this the bottle that was found on
                    the nightstand?

                              MCCURDY
                         (examines it)
                    Yes.

                              CARDENAS
                    Your Honor, the State enters this
                    evidence as exhibit A.
                         (to McCurdy)
                    Were any fingerprints found on the
                    bottle?

                              MCCURDY
                    Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb
                    print of Miss Lawson's.

                              CARDENAS
                    Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to
                    someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?

                              MCCURDY
                    Increase his heart rate.

                              CARDENAS
                    -- And if he were in the midst of
                    making love while under the influence
                    of cocaine?

                              MCCURDY
                    It would be an added stress to his
                    heart.

                              CARDENAS
                    What would be the effect if someone
                    secretly administered cocaine to Mr.
                    Marsh and then induced him to make
                    love?

                              MCCURDY
                    It would be the same as shooting a
                    gun at him.

                              CARDENAS
                    Thank you, Doctor McCurdy.
                         (to Dulaney)
                    Your witness.


                                                                      46

          Rebecca looks at Dulaney for his opinion of McCurdy's
          testimony.  Dulaney gives her a reassuring glance before he
          stands up and approaches McCurdy.

                              DULANEY
                    Can you say with any certainty that
                    Mr. Marsh didn't ingest the cocaine
                    himself?

                              MCCURDY
                    No -- but it seems highly unlikely
                    that a man in his condition would use
                    cocaine.

                              DULANEY
                    That's your opinion, Doctor -- but
                    I'm asking you if there is any
                    scientific test that can tell who
                    actually put the cocaine into the
                    Dristan bottle?

                              MCCURDY
                    No.

                              DULANEY
                    Thank you.


          INT.  COURTROOM - LATER - DAY

          Cardenas stands before DOCTOR TRAMMEL, a thin, pasty-faced man
          in his fifties.

                              CARDENAS
                    Doctor Trammel, when did you first
                    diagnose that Mr. Marsh had heart
                    disease?

                              DR. TRAMMEL
                    About a year and half ago.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did Mr. Marsh change his lifestyle
                    after that?

                              DR. TRAMMEL
                    Yes -- he stopped smoking and
                    drinking and exercised regularly.

                              CARDENAS
                    He did everything he could to take
                    care of his heart?

                              DR. TRAMMEL
                    Yes.

                                                                      47


                              CARDENAS
                    Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr.
                    Marsh to your office?

                              DR. TRAMMEL
                    Yes.

                              CARDENAS
                    Just one last question.  What does
                    the sign on your office door say?

                              DR. TRAMMEL
                    Doctor Steven Trammel.  Cardiologist.

          Cardenas walks back to his seat, signaling his examination of
          the witness is over.  Dulaney stands.

                              DULANEY
                    Dr. Trammel, did you ever speak to
                    Miss Lawson about Mr. Marsh's
                    condition?

                              DR. TRAMMEL
                    No.

                              DULANEY
                    Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he
                    had spoken to Miss Lawson about his
                    illness?

                              DR. TRAMMEL
                    No.

                              DULANEY
                    Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr.
                    Marsh inside during his examinations?

                              DR. TRAMMEL
                    No.

                              DULANEY
                    Then you have no way of knowing what
                    Mr. Marsh told Miss Lawson were the
                    reasons for his visits?

                              DR. TRAMMEL
                    No.  No, I don't.


          INT.  COURTROOM - LATER - DAY

          Joanne Braslow is on the stand.  She is wearing a smart
          business suit and large-framed glasses.  Her hair is pulled
          back tight.  Cardenas stands before her.

                                                                      48


                              CARDENAS
                    How long were you Mr Marsh's personal
                    secretary?

                              JOANNE
                    Six years.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use
                    Cocaine?

                              JOANNE
                    No -- never.

                              CARDENAS
                    What about Miss Lawson?

                              JOANNE
                    Yes.

                              CARDENAS
                    Tell the court about that, please.

                              JOANNE
                    I opened the bathroom door one day
                    and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine
                    out of a vial.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before
                    his death?

                              JOANNE
                    Yes.

                              CARDENAS
                    How did he look?

                              JOANNE
                    Horrible.  He was tired and pale.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did you talk about Miss Lawson?

                              JOANNE
                    Yes.

                              CARDENAS
                    What did Mr. Marsh say?


                                                                      49

                              JOANNE
                    He was worried.  He said that she was
                    acting stranger and stranger.  He
                    said that if this kept up she was
                    going to kill him.  That his heart
                    couldn't take it.

          There is an audible BUZZ from the crowd.  For the first time
          Rebecca's confident exterior seems to fade and is replaced with
          genuine concern.

                              CARDENAS
                    Thank you.
                         (to Dulaney)
                    Your witness.

          Cardenas sits down.  Dulaney gets up slowly and walks towards
          Joanne.

                              DULANEY
                    How do you know it was cocaine that
                    Miss Lawson had in the bathroom?

                              JOANNE
                    What other kind of white powder do
                    people keep in a vial?

                              DULANEY
                    Do you remember the date when you saw
                    Miss Lawson in the bathroom?

                              JOANNE
                    Yes--
                         (thinks a moment)
                    It was on a Friday.  I remember
                    because I was going to visit my
                    sister for her birthday.  It would be
                    October twenty-eighth.

                              DULANEY
                    Could you repeat the last part of
                    what Mr. Marsh said to you the day
                    before his death?

                              JOANNE
                    He said that if it kept up she was
                    going to kill him.  That his heart
                    couldn't take it.

                              DULANEY
                    Didn't Mr. Marsh also tell you that
                    Miss Lawson felt bored here and was
                    thinking about going back to Chicago
                    for awhile?


                                                                      50

                              JOANNE
                    Yes -- he mentioned it.

                              DULANEY
                    So, the woman he loved passionately
                    was thinking about leaving.  That
                    must cause tremendous anxiety.
                    Sleepless nights.  Incredible stress.

                              JOANNE
                    I suppose.

                              DULANEY
                    So, isn't it possible that he was
                    confiding in you about the pain he
                    was feeling about losing what might
                    be his last chance for love?  That
                    what he really was saying was that
                    the uncertainty of her leaving was
                    driving him crazy and if it didn't
                    stop it was going to kill him.  That
                    if she did leave his heart couldn't
                    take it.

          THE JURY waits anxiously for her answer.

          Joanne fidgets in his chair as she thinks.  She appears
          confused.

                              JOANNE
                    I don't know.  I'm not sure.

                              DULANEY
                    Well, think about it.  Isn't it
                    possible?

                              JOANNE
                         (begrudgingly)
                    Yes.  I suppose it's possible.

          Cardenas leans back in his seat frustrated.  Rebecca breathes a
          sigh of relief.


          INT.  UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON

          Quiet and desolate -- most of the city employees have left for
          the day.  Dulaney walks towards the back of the lot with
          Rebecca.

                              REBECCA
                    You were brilliant today.

                              DULANEY
                    It's only the beginning.

                                                                      51


                              REBECCA
                    Strong endings start with strong
                    beginnings.
                         (growing excitement)
                    I love the way you twist what people
                    say around --  manipulating their own
                    words against them.

          They reach Rebecca's car.

                              DULANEY
                    Can I see you later?

                              REBECCA
                    You can see me now.

          Rebecca presses against him, raising her knee gently into his
          groin -- as she kisses him passionately.  Dulaney is lost in
          her kiss for a moment, then breaks it off and looks around.

          Rebecca smiles -- takes off her shoes and stands on the hood of
          her car.  She takes one of the shoes and hits the PARKING LOT
          OVERHEAD LIGHT FIXTURE.  The BULB breaks sending the area in
          darkness.

                              DULANEY
                    What are you doing?

          She steps down and kisses him again.  For a moment he tries to
          resist.

                              REBECCA
                    I want you inside me.

          His desire fills him.  He pushes her back onto the hood of her
          car, hiking up her dress with his hands, as she reaches down
          and unbuttons his pants.


          INT.  REBECCA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          The room is dimly lit.  Dulaney is in bed.  He appears to be
          deep in thought.  Rebecca enters wearing a sheer, silk bathrobe
          and carrying a tea service on a tray.  He places it on the bed
          and sits beside him.

                              REBECCA
                    Something wrong?

                              DULANEY
                    Paley could be a problem tomorrow.


                                                                      52

                              REBECCA
                    I'm sure you'll be able to handle
                    him.

                              DULANEY
                    I'm glad you have such confidence in
                    me.

                              REBECCA
                    Don't worry about Paley.  He can't
                    touch me.  No one can.  I've thought
                    it all out.

                              DULANEY
                         (sits up; very
                          concerned)
                    What does that mean?  You've been
                    thinking about the case?  Or you
                    thought everything out before you
                    killed Marsh?

          The question hurts Rebecca -- it shows on her face.  She looks
          away from him.  A beat.  Dulaney thinks.  He feels bad for
          asking such a question.

                              DULANEY
                    I'm sorry.
                         (she doesn't look at
                          him)
                    Rebecca -- I'm sorry.  Really.

          He takes her hand.  She slowly looks at him and smiles.  She
          points to the tea service.

                              REBECCA
                    Sugar or honey?

                              DULANEY
                    Honey.

          She lifts a PLASTIC BOTTLE of HONEY and starts to pour it into
          a cup.  She stops and smiles seductively at Dulaney, then parts
          her bathrobe and slowly draws a liquid line with it along her
          thigh.  She reaches out -- grabs him by the hair and gently
          pulls him forward.  He kisses her knee and slowly runs his
          tongue along her thigh, following the trail upwards.  She
          arches her back -- closes her eyes -- breathes deeply from the
          pleasure of his touch.


          INT.  DULANEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Dark.  The door opens -- light from the hall streaks into the
          room.  Sharon is asleep.  Dulaney enters quietly.  He watches
          her.  He looks over at the nightstand.

                                                                      53


          HIS POV

          A PHOTOGRAPH of Dulaney and Sharon on vacation.  Dulaney is
          carrying her on a beach.  He is wearing a LARGE SOMBRERO.  They
          are both laughing.
          Dulaney looks back at Sharon.  He is a man lost within himself.
          He walks to the bathroom.  Sharon opens her eyes and stares at
          him.


          INT.  COURTROOM - MORNING

          Court is in session.  Cardenas stands.

                              CARDENAS
                    The State calls Doctor Alan Paley.

          Doctor Paley stands and walks towards the witness stand.

          CARDENAS AND PALEY - MOMENTS LATER

          Paley has been sworn in.  Cardenas examines him.

                              CARDENAS
                    Where did you meet Miss Lawson?

                              DR. PALEY
                    At a dinner party -- about eight
                    months ago.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did you ever see her again after
                    that?

                              DR. PALEY
                    Yes -- several times.

                              CARDENAS
                    What eventually happened to your
                    relationship with Miss Lawson?

                              DR. PALEY
                    We stopped seeing each other.

                              CARDENAS
                    Why?

                              DR. PALEY
                    Well -- I realized that she wasn't
                    interested in me.  She was just
                    trying to get information out of me.


                                                                      54

                              CARDENAS
                    What kind of information?

                              DR. PALEY
                    She said that she was working on a
                    novel and she wanted to know what
                    kinds of drugs would be harmful to
                    someone with a bad heart.

          WHISPERS from the crowd fill the room.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did you suggest any?

                              DR. PALEY
                    Yes -- Insulin and others.

                              CARDENAS
                    What did she say?

                              DR. PALEY
                    She said that those weren't any good
                    -- because their use would be
                    detected and the police would know
                    the victim had been poisoned.  She
                    wanted to know if there was a drug
                    that would induce a heart attack but
                    could also be used to enhance a
                    sexual high.

                              CARDENAS
                    -- And what did you suggest?

                              DR. PALEY
                    Cocaine.

          More GASPS from the crowd.  Rebecca's remains calm, but her
          eyes glare at Paley hatefully.

                              CARDENAS
                         (to Dulaney)
                    Your witness.

          Cardenas sits down.  Dulaney approaches Paley with a smile.

                              DULANEY
                    Dr. Paley, where were you the last
                    time you saw Miss Lawson?

                              DR. PALEY
                    We had dinner at a restaurant.


                                                                      55

                              DULANEY
                    Isn't it true that later that night
                    you tried to force yourself on Miss
                    Lawson in the parking lot?

                              DR. PALEY
                    No.

                              DULANEY
                    You didn't grab her and try to kiss
                    her?

                              DR. PALEY
                    No.

                              DULANEY
                    If necessary I can bring in the valet
                    parking attendant and two customers
                    who witnessed the occurrence.

          Paley thinks for a moment.  He is nervous.

                              DR. PALEY
                    Well -- as I remember it, we had an
                    argument.

                              DULANEY
                    And the argument was about the fact
                    that you wanted to be romantically
                    involved and she did not.

                              DR. PALEY
                         (hesitantly)
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    And after that didn't you
                    continuously harass Miss Lawson?

                              DR. PALEY
                    No.

          Dulaney walks back to his desk and removes a TAPE PLAYER from a
          cardboard box.

                              DULANEY
                    Your Honor, this is a tape from Miss
                    Lawson's answering machine.  I would
                    like to play it now.

                              CARDENAS
                    Objection.  Your Honor, we don't know
                    where this tape is from.  Who made it
                    -- or under what circumstances it was
                    made.

                                                                      56


          Dulaney takes out two pieces of PAPER and approaches the bench.

                              DULANEY
                    These are reports from two
                    independent audio labs.  They each
                    state that the voices were recorded
                    over the phone and that no
                    alterations have been made.

          Judge Burnham studies the paper.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    I'll allow it.

          Dulaney walks back to his desk and presses the PLAY BUTTON.  We
          HEAR a BEEP, then...

                              DR. PALEY'S VOICE
                    Rebecca -- I know you're there,
                    Godammit.  Answer the phone, you
                    bitch!  You can't treat me like this!

          We HEAR a PHONE slam down.  Another BEEP.

                              DR. PALEY'S VOICE
                    You want to play games with me?  Who
                    the fuck do you think you are? Okay -
                    - we'll play.  You'll be sorry.

          Dulaney stops the machine.  He takes a dramatic pause, letting
          the words on the tape sink in.

          Cardenas is dismayed and tries to hide his frustration.
          Dulaney approaches Paley who is now very nervous.

                              DULANEY
                         (quoting)
                    You'll be sorry?

                              DR. PALEY
                    I was angry.

                              DULANEY
                    You're still angry, aren't you?
                    Isn't it true that your whole story
                    is nothing more than a vindictive
                    attempt on your behalf to get back at
                    Miss Lawson?

                              DR. PALEY
                    No -- she asked me about cocaine.

                              DULANEY
                    I suggest it never happened.

                                                                      57


                              DR. PALEY
                         (angrily)
                    You can suggest anything you want.
                    It happened.

                              DULANEY
                    No further questions.

          Dr. Paley's temper explodes.  He is a loose cannon.

                              DR. PALEY
                    I may have been infatuated with her -
                    - but I wouldn't perjure myself.

                              DULANEY
                    That's all Dr. Paley.


          INT.  REBECCA'S BEDROOM - EVENING

          RAIN FALLS, streaking along the bedroom windows.  CANDLES light
          the room.  Dulaney and Rebecca are on the bed.  She sits on top
          of him, writhing back and forth -- lost in the rhythm of their
          love making.

          CLOSE ON DULANEY - LATER

          He is asleep, laying on his back -- the sheets pulled up to his
          waist.  LIGHTNING FLASHES outside -- a CLAP of THUNDER follows.
          He stirs and wakes up.

          HIS POV

          Another FLASH OF LIGHTNING illuminates Rebecca, who is standing
          over him in a sexy silk ROBE.  Dulaney starts to sit up but
          something restrains him.  He is HANDCUFFED to the BRASS HEAD
          BOARD.

                              DULANEY
                    What the...  What are you doing?

          She sits next to him -- looks at him fondly -- gently strokes
          his face with her hand.

                              DULANEY
                         (nervously)
                    Rebecca -- take these off.

                              REBECCA
                    Tonight we open new doors.


                                                                      58

          She slowly drags the tip of her finger up his stomach -- to his
          chest.  Dulaney follows it with his eyes.  Rebecca picks up a
          LARGE CANDLE on the nightstand and moves it slowly -- back and
          forth over his chest.

                              DULANEY
                    What are you going you doing?

                              REBECCA
                    Are you scared?

          He doesn't answer.  He doesn't have to.  She can see the fear
          in his eyes.  She tilts the candle -- a stream of WAX pours out
          on his chest.  Dulaney winces with pain, his body arching on
          the bed, his hands straining against his restraints.

          She smiles -- a wicked smile, then pours more wax, making a
          thin trail of LITTLE BEADS that moves down his chest towards
          his stomach.  Dulaney's face cringes.  He stares at her through
          eyes filled with fear.

                              REBECCA
                         (whispering)
                    I love you, Frank.  I love your
                    strength -- be strong for me now.

          She continues to pour the wax in little BEADS, filling his
          navel and working her way towards his groin.

                              DULANEY
                         (pleading)
                    Rebecca -- please.  No more.

          Rebecca stares at him warmly -- fondly.

                              REBECCA
                    I told you in the beginning that it
                    was my way.  My way can be many
                    things -- pleasure or pain.

          She lifts a bottle of white vinegar and holds it over his burn.
          He tenses as she pours it on his chest.  -- then relaxes when
          he realizes it's water.  He breathes a SIGH of relief.

                              REBECCA
                    You see how life is, Frank?  We judge
                    things.  We look at things from the
                    outside and assume we know what's on
                    the inside.

          She takes a sip from the bottle.


                                                                      59

                              REBECCA
                    Water.  But you assumed it was
                    vinegar -- because you were only
                    looking at the outside.

          Her meaning isn't lost on Dulaney.  She watches him -- as if
          studying him -- then slowly -- very slowly,  she pulls on the
          belt of her ROBE.  The robe parts revealing the beauty of her
          body.  She gently lowers herself on top of him -- pressing her
          breasts against him.  Dulaney's breathing quickens in
          excitement.  Rebecca moves her head to his chest -- kissing his
          burns softly while her fingers caress lightly over his stomach.
          She gradually moves her head down -- lower -- and lower.

          CLOSE ON DULANEY

          he stares at the ceiling -- his mind a maze of confusion.  Soon
          the power of her touch fills him -- overpowering him.  His eyes
          close.  The pain that only moments ago filled his body is
          replaced with pleasure.


          INT.  DULANEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          It's late.  Dulaney enters quietly and heads for the stairs.  A
          LIGHT comes on.  Sharon is sitting on the couch waiting.

                              SHARON
                    Late night?

          Her voice startles Dulaney.

                              DULANEY
                    Yeah -- what are you doing up?

                              SHARON
                    We have to talk.

                              DULANEY
                    What's wrong?

                              SHARON
                    That's what I was hoping you'd tell
                    me.

          Dulaney enters the living room.

                              DULANEY
                    Sharon, it's late.  Can we get to the
                    point?

                              SHARON
                    Where have you been?


                                                                      60

                              DULANEY
                    Working.  Charlie and I were going
                    over some statements.

                              SHARON
                    Charlie called at eleven thirty
                    looking for you.
                         (beat)
                    You were with her, weren't you?

                              DULANEY
                    Yes.

                              SHARON
                    Why did you lie to me?

                              DULANEY
                    Because I knew you'd think exactly
                    what you're thinking.

          Sharon springs off the couch.

                              SHARON
                    This isn't a courtroom.  Don't try to
                    turn this around on me.

                              DULANEY
                    I'm not.

                              SHARON
                    You're sleeping with her, aren't you?

                              DULANEY
                    No.

                              SHARON
                    It's bad enough that you are.  It's
                    even worse that you can stand here
                    and lie to me.

          She starts to walks out of the room.  Dulaney grabs her by the
          arm.

                              DULANEY
                    Sharon...

          She swings around and slaps him across the face, then stares at
          him angrily, her eyes filled with tears.

                              SHARON
                    You bastard!  Do you think I'm some
                    kind of idiot?  That I don't have
                    fuckin' eyes.  I see.  I feel.  I
                    hurt.


                                                                      61

          She walks out of the room, leaving Dulaney alone with his
          thoughts.


          INT.  COURTROOM - DAY

          ESTER CRAWFORD is on the stand.  She is a BLACK WOMAN in her
          thirties -- thin and tired-looking, although we get the
          impression she once was pretty.  She is dressed in what is
          obviously her Sunday dress.  Cardenas questions her.

                              CARDENAS
                    Mrs. Crawford, you were Mr. Marsh's
                    maid for nine years?

                              ESTER
                    Yes.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever
                    argue?

                              ESTER
                    Like cats and dogs.

                              CARDENAS
                    What did they argue about?

                              ESTER
                    You name it -- they argued about it.
                    Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her
                    happy -- but it seemed that no matter
                    what he did it was never enough for
                    her.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did they argue the day before he
                    died?

                              ESTER
                    Well -- he died on a Sunday and I
                    have the weekends off -- but they
                    were ripping at each other with both
                    barrels Friday afternoon.

                              CARDENAS
                    What was the nature of the argument?

                              ESTER
                    Sex.

                              CARDENAS
                    Could you be more specific?


                                                                      62

                              ESTER
                    She was calling Mr. Marsh an old man
                    -- making discourteous insinuations
                    about his sexual abilities.  She said
                    that she had needs and that if he
                    couldn't fulfill them she'd find
                    someone who could.

          Dulaney jots down a note.  Cardenas continues.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use
                    cocaine?

                              ESTER
                    No -- never.

                              CARDENAS
                         (to Dulaney)
                    Your witness.

          Cardenas sits down.  Dulaney approaches Ester with a smile.

                              DULANEY
                    Did you go to college, Mrs. Crawford?

                              ESTER
                    No.

                              DULANEY
                    High school?

                              ESTER
                    No.

                              CARDENAS
                    Your Honor, I fail to see what Mrs
                    Crawford's educational background has
                    to do with this case.

                              DULANEY
                    I was just about to make my point,
                    Your Honor.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Do it quickly, Mr. Dulaney.

                              DULANEY
                         (reading from note
                          pad)
                    "Discourteous insinuations about his
                    sexual abilities."  Who told you to
                    say that?


                                                                      63

          Ester doesn't answer, but her eyes drift past Dulaney and focus
          on Troxell.  Dulaney follows her stare.

                              DULANEY
                    Did Mr. Troxell help you with that
                    phrase?

          Troxell and Cardenas squirm a little.

                              ESTER
                    I heard him say it.

                              DULANEY
                    Then -- those are not your own words?

                              ESTER
                    No.

                              DULANEY
                    What else did the District Attorney's
                    Office tell you to say?

                              CARDENAS
                    Objection, Your Honor.  The fact that
                    Mrs. Crawford heard Mr. Troxell
                    reconstruct her sentence and decided
                    to rephrase her words in a more
                    intelligent manner for the court
                    doesn't mean the incident never
                    happened.

                              DULANEY
                         (to Cardenas)
                    I'm just curious to see if Mr.
                    Troxell reconstructed anything else.

                              CARDENAS
                    Your Honor -- please!

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    I'll see both of you in my chambers.
                    Right now.


          INT.  JUDGE BURNHAM'S CHAMBERS - MOMENTS LATER

          Judge Burnham lights a cigarette and sits on the edge of his
          desk.  Dulaney and Cardenas stand before him.


                                                                      64

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Mr. Dulaney, before you cast
                    aspersions on the District Attorney's
                    Office by suggesting they've coaxed
                    this witness to say things that
                    aren't true -- you better have more
                    than a hunch.  Do you?

                              DULANEY
                    No, Your Honor.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Maybe you don't know what it's like
                    where Mrs. Crawford comes from -- but
                    I do.  I came from a neighborhood
                    just like hers.  This is a whole
                    other world for her.  She's a poor
                    working woman who has been thrust
                    into a room full of highly educated
                    and mostly unsympathetic people.  So,
                    she puts on her best dress, fixes her
                    hair and tries to present herself as
                    intelligently as possible.
                         (beat)
                    Being poor and having pride is not a
                    crime, Mr. Dulaney -- and before you
                    attempt to impeach another witness'
                    testimony in my courtroom -- your
                    foundations better be based on
                    something other than semantics.


          EXT.  COURTHOUSE - AFTERNOON

          Dulaney walks down the steps.  Cardenas joins him.

                              CARDENAS
                    I'm surprised you can walk after the
                    way Burnham chewed your ass out this
                    afternoon.

          Cardenas grins.  His comment was meant as a friendly jab
          between old friends.  Dulaney doesn't see it that way.

                              DULANEY
                         (coldly)
                    I've got work to do.

                              CARDENAS
                    Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's
                    between rounds.

                              DULANEY
                    I didn't hear it.


                                                                      65

                              CARDENAS
                    What's happening to you, Frank?
                    You're acting like you're on trial
                    here.  This has become personal to
                    you.

                              DULANEY
                    Back off, John.

          Cardenas studies him for a moment.

                              CARDENAS
                    You're sleeping with her, aren't you?

          Dulaney forces a laugh.  It's not a very convincing one.

                              DULANEY
                    That's ridiculous.

                              CARDENAS
                    I'm talking to you as a friend now.
                    Don't ruin your life, your career for
                    her.  She'll spit you out when this
                    is over.

                              DULANEY
                    You don't know what you're talking
                    about.

                              CARDENAS
                    Really?  What does an attorney speak
                    to his client about at her house
                    until three o'clock in the morning?

                              DULANEY
                    You've been following me?

                              CARDENAS
                    Her.  It's an obvious move.  I'm
                    building a case against her,
                    remember?

          Something in Dulaney snaps.  He grabs Cardenas and pushes him
          up against the wall.  Cardenas pushes back.

                              CARDENAS
                    If your head wasn't up your ass you
                    would have thought of it too.  You're
                    losing perspective.  Get out while
                    you can -- before she takes you down
                    with her.



                                                                      66

          INT.  HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

          Dulaney walks towards his office.  Biggs walks quickly down the
          hall and joins him.

                              BIGGS
                    I've been waiting for you to get
                    back.

                              DULANEY
                    You got something on the coke?

                              BIGGS
                    No -- but I got something.

          Biggs steps into Dulaney's office.  Dulaney follows.


          INT.  DULANEY'S OFFICE - MORNING

          Biggs picks up a remote control off the desk and sits on the
          couch.  Dulaney sits at his desk.

                              BIGGS
                    During lunch I was watching some of
                    Marsh's home videos.

          Biggs clicks the control.  On the TV we see Rebecca on top of
          Marsh in the bedroom.

                              BIGGS
                    He was really into recording this
                    stuff.  The D.A.'s office found a box
                    full of tapes.

          Watching Rebecca with Marsh bothers Dulaney.

                              BIGGS
                    This girl has really got some moves,
                    huh?

          Dulaney stands up and turns off the television.

                              DULANEY
                    If you want to get your kicks go to a
                    video store and rent a porno movie.

          Biggs studies Dulaney for a moment.  Dulaney's reaction bothers
          him.  He turns the TV back on and fast forwards the tape.  The
          screen turns to SNOW where the tape has been recorded over.

                              BIGGS
                    This tape was recorded over an
                    existing recording.


                                                                      67

                              DULANEY
                    Over what?

          Biggs raises a hand signaling patience.  SNOW still fills the
          TV screen.

                              BIGGS
                    I would have missed it -- but the
                    phone rang and I let it play while I
                    talked.  It looks like blank tape --
                    but it isn't.  It's been erased
                    without any input signal coming in.

                              DULANEY
                    So, what good is it to us if it's
                    been erased?

                              BIGGS
                    It's very good -- because when the
                    D.A's office saw it they assumed it
                    was the end of the tape, otherwise
                    they would have buried it.

                              DULANEY
                    Why?

                              BIGGS
                    Because it hasn't all been erased.

          Biggs looks at the screen.  A beat.  The SNOW dissolves and a
          picture fades in.  The PICTURE LASTS only about five seconds.
          We see Rebecca from the back as she straddles Marsh, grinding
          up and down on the bed -- her hair flowing down her back.
          Marsh raises his hand.  His WRIST IS IN A CAST.  She turns her
          head to the side and as she does we see that it is not Rebecca
          -- but Joanne Braslow.  The Tape clicks off.

          Dulaney stares at the blank screen.

                              DULANEY
                         (quoting Joanne)
                    Where's the attraction to sleep with
                    someone like that.


          EXT.  PARKING LOT - DUSK

          Joanne Braslow walks to her BMW 325i.  She is about to open the
          door when Dulaney approaches her.

                              DULANEY
                    I need to speak with you.


                                                                      68

                              JOANNE
                    I don't think we have anything more
                    to talk about, Mr. Dulaney.

          She starts to get in the car.

                              DULANEY
                    You were sleeping with Marsh.

          She stops -- appears shocked that he knows this.  There is now
          a different quality to her -- an edge.

                              JOANNE
                    Who told you that?

                              DULANEY
                    He video taped you.

                              JOANNE
                    That bastard!

                              DULANEY
                    I thought he was a kind, gentle man?

          Joanne doesn't appreciate Dulaney throwing her words back in
          her face.

                              JOANNE
                    Yes, I slept with him but that was a
                    long time ago.

                              DULANEY
                    You're lying.  Marsh was wearing a
                    cast on the tape.  It was right
                    before he went to Chicago and met
                    Miss Lawson.  He dumped you for her,
                    didn't he?

          Joanne can't hold back the emotion that is building.

                              JOANNE
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    It must have been horrible.  Having
                    to go there -- seeing them together -
                    - knowing he was sleeping with her in
                    the same bed he did with you.

                              JOANNE
                    I was jealous.  Of course I was hurt.
                    He switched me off like a little toy
                    he was finished playing with.  But I
                    didn't kill him.


                                                                      69

          Dulaney studies her.

                              JOANNE
                         (continuing)
                    I'm a practical woman Mr. Dulaney.
                    Killing Andrew wasn't in my best
                    interest.  As it is I'm out of a job
                    and I'm not in his will.

                              DULANEY
                    Money isn't the only reason people
                    commit murder, Miss Braslow.

          Dulaney walks off.  Joanne stares after him.  Her face is cold,
          showing no sign of emotion.


          INT.  COURTROOM - DAY

          Dulaney sits beside Rebecca, but he seems distant.  Cardenas
          stands up.

                              CARDENAS
                    The State calls Jeffery Roston.

          As soon as she hears the name Rebecca's face becomes tense,
          nervous.  Dulaney notices it.  He checks a list.

                              DULANEY
                    Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston
                    listed as a prosecution witness.

                              CARDENAS
                    The State's investigation just
                    uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday
                    afternoon in Chicago.

          Judge Burnham motions for Dulaney and Cardenas to approach the
          bench.

                              CARDENAS
                    Your Honor, Mr. Roston is an ex-lover
                    of Miss Lawson's.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Why didn't the State's investigation
                    uncover Mr. Roston earlier?

                              CARDENAS
                    He was away on an extended vacation
                    and just returned two days ago.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Alright -- I'm going to allow his
                    testimony.

                                                                      70


                              DULANEY
                    But Your Honor--

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    That's it, Mr. Dulaney.  Take a seat.

          Dulaney walks back to his chair.  Rebecca appears genuinely
          nervous.


          INT.  COURTROOM - LATER

          Cardenas stands before ROSTON a handsome man with salt and
          pepper hair in his late fifties.

                              CARDENAS
                    Mr. Roston, what was your
                    relationship with Miss Lawson?

                              ROSTON
                    We were lovers.

                              CARDENAS
                    How long were you together?

                              ROSTON
                    For about one year.

                              CARDENAS
                    How would you describe your sex life
                    with Miss Lawson?

                              ROSTON
                    Intense.

                              CARDENAS
                    I know this is a very personal
                    subject, but could you be a little
                    more specific?

                              ROSTON
                    It was wild.  She was constantly
                    trying to get me more and more worked
                    up -- kinky things.  I tried to
                    satisfy her the best I could, but it
                    was difficult in my condition.

                              CARDENAS
                    What kind of condition are you
                    referring to?

                              ROSTON
                    I had a bad heart.


                                                                      71

          There is an AUDIBLE GASP from the crowd.  Cardenas waits,
          giving the jury plenty of time to digest the implications of
          Roston's last statement.

          Dulaney looks at Rebecca dumbfounded.  He tries to control his
          surprise from the eyes of the jury, but he can't.  He stares
          ahead with a blank expression as he listens to the rest of the
          testimony.

                              CARDENAS
                    What happened next?

                              ROSTON
                    I had bypass surgery.

                              CARDENAS
                    And how are you now?

                              ROSTON
                    Fine.  The doctors say if I keep
                    taking care of myself I can live to
                    be a very old man.

                              CARDENAS
                    How did your relationship with Miss
                    Lawson progress after the surgery?

                              ROSTON
                    It didn't.

                              CARDENAS
                    Why not?

                              ROSTON
                    She left me.

          Dulaney slowly turns and looks at Rebecca.  The anger and his
          sense of betrayal show on his face.

                              CARDENAS
                    Why did she say she was leaving?

                              ROSTON
                    She didn't.  She just left.

                              CARDENAS
                    Why do you think she left you?

                              ROSTON
                    Well -- I think that after the
                    operation she realized that...

          It takes Dulaney a few seconds to object to the question.  He
          is clearly preoccupied with the implications of Roston's
          testimony.

                                                                      72


                              DULANEY
                    Objection.  The question calls for a
                    conclusion on the part of the
                    witness.

                              CARDENAS
                    Your Honor, Mr. Roston lived with the
                    defendant for many months.  I feel
                    that his opinion is valid in
                    substantiating the character of the
                    Miss Lawson.

                              DULANEY
                    The opinion of a scorned lover is
                    hardly an objective view.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Objection sustained.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did Miss Lawson ever give you any
                    indication why she was leaving?

                              DULANEY
                    Objection.  The witness has already
                    stated that Miss Lawson left without
                    an explanation.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Mr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on
                    to another line of questioning.

                              CARDENAS
                    When you say your sexual relations
                    with Miss Lawson were intense what
                    exactly do you mean?

                              ROSTON
                    It was like she was trying to push me
                    as far as she could.  She called it
                    opening new doors.

                              CARDENAS
                    Can you give the court an example?

                              ROSTON
                    It was like sex was a game to her.
                    She got off on the control.  She
                    always used to tell me it had to be
                    her way.

          This strikes a chord with Dulaney.


                                                                      73

                              ROSTON
                         (continuing)
                    It's hard to resist a woman as
                    beautiful as she is.

                              CARDENAS
                    What would she do that made it hard
                    to resist?

                              ROSTON
                    She's a woman who is very much aware
                    of her own sexuality.  Sometimes I
                    felt she could read my mind.  It was
                    uncanny how she knew exactly what I
                    wanted.  A few nights before my heart
                    surgery Rebecca woke me.  She had
                    handcuffed me to the bed.

          There are a few SNICKERS from the crowd.  Dulaney is thinking
          about the familiarity of Roston's testimony.  Judge Burnham
          BANGS his GAVEL.  The crowd becomes silent.

                              ROSTON
                    She told me that tonight we were
                    going to open new doors.  I asked her
                    to stop -- to take off the handcuffs,
                    but she wouldn't listen.

                              CARDENAS
                    What did she say?

          Roston is clearly uncomfortable having to relate this part of
          his life.

                              CARDENAS
                    Mr. Roston I know this is difficult
                    for you, but it's important you tell
                    the court what she did.

                              ROSTON
                    She said she was going to fuck me
                    like I've never been fucked before.

          More noise from the Crowd.  Judge Burnham is annoyed.  He BANGS
          his gavel again.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Due to the sensitive nature of this
                    witness' testimony and the inability
                    of the spectators to allow him to
                    complete it, I am clearing the
                    courtroom.

          Sounds of protest fill the room as the BAILIFFS start to usher
          out the crowd.

                                                                      74



          INT.  COURTROOM LATER

          The gallery is empty.  Only Dulaney, Rebecca, Cardenas,
          Troxell, Roston, Judge Burnham, The Jury and Court Officials
          remain.

                              CARDENAS
                    What did she do next, Mr. Roston?

                              ROSTON
                    She started touching herself and
                    telling me how much she wanted me.
                    She reached down and put me inside
                    her.  My doctor had warned me about
                    exerting myself -- but you really
                    don't think of those things at a
                    moment like that.  You just think
                    about how beautiful this woman is --
                    how much you want her.  How deeply
                    you want to please her.
                         (beat)
                    At first it started off slowly -- but
                    the rhythm built and built.    Every
                    time I got close to an orgasm she
                    would stop.  Eventually I started to
                    have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just
                    kept going -- faster and faster.  No
                    matter what I said she wouldn't stop.
                    I really thought for a moment I was
                    going to die.

                              CARDENAS
                    If you knew it was bad for you why
                    did you do it?

                              ROSTON
                    I couldn't help myself.  You get lost
                    inside a women like her.  It was like
                    a drug.  It was the best sex I ever
                    had.

                              CARDENAS
                    What happened after that?

                              ROSTON
                    I woke up the next morning and she
                    was gone.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did you change your will while you
                    were with Miss Lawson?


                                                                      75

                              ROSTON
                    Yes.

                              CARDENAS
                    Who was your primary beneficiary?

                              ROSTON
                    She was.

                              CARDENAS
                    Thank you.  The State rests.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Mister Dulaney?

          Dulaney is stunned -- deep in thought.  He doesn't appear to
          hear the question.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Mister Dulaney?

          Dulaney looks at the jury.  What he sees isn't good.  He thinks
          for a moment.  He leans over and quickly speaks with Rebecca.
          We cannot hear them -- but their conversation is heated.
          Rebecca says something.  Dulaney looks at Roston.  A beat.
          Dulaney stands.

                              DULANEY
                    Mr. Roston, you said it was the best
                    sex you ever had.  Is that the best
                    sex with a woman, or a man?

          Cardenas bolts from his seat.

                              CARDENAS
                    Objection!

                              DULANEY
                    I'll rephrase the question.  Mr.
                    Roston isn't it true you are
                    bisexual?

                              CARDENAS
                    Objection!  Mr. Roston's sexual
                    preferences are not at issue in this
                    trial.

                              DULANEY
                    Your Honor, I'm trying to establish
                    the sense of betrayal Miss Lawson
                    felt when she discovered the man she
                    lived with was a different person
                    than she thought he was.

          Judge Burnham thinks for a moment.

                                                                      76


                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    The witness will answer the question.

                              DULANEY
                    Mr. Roston?

                              ROSTON
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    And your sexual tastes were something
                    that you hid from Miss Lawson?

                              ROSTON
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    And didn't Miss Lawson come home one
                    day and find you in bed with your
                    male lover?

                              ROSTON
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    And she left shortly after that?

          A pause.  Roston thinks, struggling to make a decision.

                              ROSTON
                    No.  We worked things out.  It was
                    three weeks later when I told her
                    about the heart surgery that she
                    left.

          Roston looks around the court room.  He is embarrassed, filled
          with emotion.

                              DULANEY
                    Would it be fair to say that when she
                    did find out it was a shock to her?

                              ROSTON
                         (very upset)
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    No further questions.

          Roston looks at the jury -- their disapproving stares.  He is
          on the verge of tears.



                                                                      77

          INT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

          Rebecca opens the door.  A tired-looking Dulaney enters.  They
          walk to the couch together in silence.  Dulaney sits.  Rebecca
          lifts a BOTTLE of CHAMPAGNE out of an ice bucket.

                              DULANEY
                    What's that for?

                              REBECCA
                    To celebrate how masterfully you
                    destroyed Roston today.

                              DULANEY
                    Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life
                    in open court.

                              REBECCA
                         (suddenly ice cold)
                    Fuck him!  He tried to shatter mine.

                              DULANEY
                    He was only doing what he thought was
                    right.

                              REBECCA
                    You're too weak, Frank.  When you
                    want something you have to do what-
                    ever it takes to get it.  If
                    something gets in your way you remove
                    it.

          Dulaney stares at her.  The person he sees has no feelings --
          no empathy for anyone.

                              DULANEY
                    You killed him -- didn't you?

                              REBECCA
                    I knew you were thinking that.  I
                    could see it in your eyes today in
                    the courtroom.  You're wrong, Frank.
                    I need you to believe that.

                              DULANEY
                    You don't need anybody.

                              REBECCA
                    I do need you.  No matter what you
                    think of me -- I didn't do it.

                                                                      78

                         (beat)
                    I could see the looks on the juror's
                    faces.  To the men I represent what
                    they can never have.  I'm a cold,
                    heartless bitch -- and this is their
                    chance for pay-back for every woman
                    that's ever blown them off in a bar.
                    To the old women I'm a vulgar whore
                    and to the young ones I remind them
                    of what they'll never be.  It doesn't
                    matter to them that I'm innocent.
                    They've already convicted me.

                              DULANEY
                    I'm dropping the case.

                              REBECCA
                         (matter of factly)
                    No -- you're not.

          Rebecca picks up a REMOTE CONTROL from the coffee table and
          pushes a button.

          CLOSE ON TELEVISION

          A TAPE of Dulaney making love to Rebecca fills the screen.  It
          is wild, passionate.

          CLOSE ON DULANEY

          he is dumbfounded as he watches.  The implications of what this
          tape could do to him run through his mind.

          Something in Dulaney snaps.  He grabs Rebecca.  They struggle,
          falling down onto the coffee table.  The CHAMPAGNE bottle
          crashes to the floor.  Rebecca rolls off the table to the
          floor.  She sits up and moves away from Dulaney by pushing
          herself backwards.  Dulaney lunges at her.  His hand grabbing
          her ankle.  Rebecca kicks -- breaks free -- stands up.  Dulaney
          gets to his feet -- runs after her.  He grabs her by the throat
          and smashes her into the wall.  He slaps her across the face.
          A thin stream of blood flows from the corner of her mouth.  She
          smiles.

                              REBECCA
                    It gets easier, doesn't it?  Once you
                    open the door it never closes.

          Dulaney realizes what he is doing.  He stares at her in horror,
          then walks towards the door. He stops.  Goes back to the VHS
          machine.  He pushes the EJECT BUTTON on the VCR, removes the
          tape and destroys it.


                                                                      79

                              REBECCA
                    I've got another copy.  How do you
                    think your wife would feel if she saw
                    this -- not to mention your
                    colleagues?

          Dulaney's temper is near the breaking point again, he strains
          to control himself.

                              REBECCA
                    You can think whatever you want,
                    Frank -- but I didn't kill Andrew,
                    and I'm not going to prison for
                    something I didn't do.

                              DULANEY
                    You're a monster.

                              REBECCA
                    No -- I'm a survivor.


          INT.  DULANEY'S HOUSE, DINNING ROOM - NIGHT

          Dulaney, Sharon and Michael sit at the table eating dinner.
          There is a tense silence.  Although Michael does not know what
          is going on he can sense the tension.  The DOORBELL RINGS.

                              DULANEY
                    I'll get it.


          INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Dulaney answers the front door and Biggs rushes in excited.

                              BIGGS
                    I'm sorry to barge in -- but I
                    figured after that bombshell that got
                    laid on you today you could use some
                    good news?

                              DULANEY
                    You got something on the Coke?

          Biggs grins.

                              BIGGS
                    Do I?  I talked to one of the dealers
                    I put the word out to.  He's been
                    following the trial pretty closely.
                    He said at one time he wanted to be a
                    lawyer before he became a dealer.


                                                                      80

                              DULANEY
                    Charlie -- are you going to make a
                    point soon?

                              BIGGS
                    Right now.  Guess who's been buying
                    Coke from him for the last five and
                    half years?

          Dulaney shrugs his shoulders indicating he doesn't have a clue.

                              BIGGS
                    Marsh's secretary -- Joanne Braslow.

          Confusion fills Dulaney's face.


          INT.  COURTROOM - MORNING

          Court is in session.  Rebecca looks around the courtroom,
          trying to get a feel of the CROWD'S opinion.  Dulaney is not
          there.  She looks at the door anxiously.  The rooms waits.  A
          beat.  Dulaney enters -- sits beside Rebecca -- but acts as if
          she isn't there.


          INT.  COURTROOM - LATER

          Dulaney stands at the witness stand in front of an ORIENTAL MAN
          in his thirties.

                              DULANEY
                    Dr. Wong -- what type of medicine do
                    you practice?

                              DR. WONG
                    Oriental medicine.

                              DULANEY
                    --And is Miss Lawson a patient of
                    yours?

                              DR. WONG
                    Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a
                    year.

                              DULANEY
                    Why does she come to you?

                              DR. WONG
                    She suffers from severe menstrual
                    cramps.


                                                                      81

                              DULANEY
                    Did you ever prescribe any medication
                    for her cramps?

                              DR. WONG
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    What did you prescribe for her?

                              DR. WONG
                    Chinese peony root.

                              DULANEY
                    Would you describe for the court what
                    Chinese peony root looks like?

                              DR. WONG
                    It's a white powder that comes in a
                    vial.

          There is a MOAN from the CROWD.  Cardenas looks at Troxell.

                              DULANEY
                    How do you instruct your patients to
                    take it?

                              DR. WONG
                    I tell them to pour an amount the
                    size of a quarter into the their hand
                    and mix it with water.

                              DULANEY
                    A previous witness stated that she
                    saw Miss Lawson pouring a white
                    powder into her hand on October
                    twenty-eighth.  According to your
                    records when did you prescribe the
                    drug?

          Dr. Wong checks his records.

                              DR. WONG
                    October twenty-seventh.

                              DULANEY
                    One last question, Doctor.  If
                    someone didn't know better, would it
                    be easy to mistake the peony root for
                    cocaine?

                              DR. WONG
                    Yes -- quite easy.


                                                                      82

                              DULANEY
                         (to Cardenas)
                    Your witness.

          Cardenas realizes there is nothing to gain by examining this
          witness.

                              CARDENAS
                    No questions.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    You may call your next witness.

                              DULANEY
                    The defense calls Miss Margaret
                    Sellers.

          Cardenas looks worried as he watches an attractive woman in her
          mid twenties approach the stand.

          DULANEY AND MISS SELLERS

          Miss Sellers appears a little nervous.  Dulaney smiles warmly.

                              DULANEY
                    Miss Sellers, do you know Dr. Alan
                    Paley?

                              MISS SELLERS
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    Where did you meet him?

                              MISS SELLERS
                    I'm a nurse.  I used to work at
                    Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr.
                    Paley's on staff there.

                              DULANEY
                    What was the nature of your
                    relationship with Dr. Paley.

                              MISS SELLERS
                    We dated for about a month last year.

                              DULANEY
                    Then what happened?

                              MISS SELLERS
                    I realized he wasn't serious.  He was
                    seeing other women -- asking other
                    nurses at the hospital out, so I
                    ended it.


                                                                      83

                              DULANEY
                    -- And what did Dr. Paley do after
                    you stopped seeing him?

                              MISS SELLERS
                    He used to call me -- tell me that I
                    couldn't just walk out on him.  He
                    said that if I didn't come back he'd
                    make my life miserable.

                              DULANEY
                    Did he make your life miserable?

                              MISS SELLERS
                    Yes -- he did.

                              DULANEY
                    How?

          Cardenas stands again.

                              CARDENAS
                    Objection!  May I remind Mr. Dulaney
                    that the person on trial here is Miss
                    Lawson -- not Dr. Paley.

                              DULANEY
                    Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a
                    pattern in Dr. Paley's behavior with
                    women.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Objection overruled.  The witness
                    will answer the question.

                              MISS SELLERS
                    He'd call me in the middle of the
                    night.  Show up at my house and bang
                    on the door.  Finally after two weeks
                    I went to his office one day to tell
                    him to stop.

                              DULANEY
                    What did he say?

                              MISS SELLERS
                    He laughed -- and basically said he
                    would decide when it was over.

                              DULANEY
                    Do you remember his exact words?


                                                                      84

                              MISS SELLERS
                    Yes.  He said, "If you want to play
                    games, we'll play -- and you'll be
                    sorry."

          Another BUZZ from the CROWD.   Cardenas inwardly cringes.

                              DULANEY
                    What happened next?

                              MISS SELLERS
                    While I was seeing Dr. Paley I
                    mentioned to him one night that
                    someone was stealing drugs from the
                    third floor dispensary.   Three days
                    after I spoke to him in his office he
                    went to the Head Nurse and told her
                    he had witnessed me stealing drugs.

                              DULANEY
                    What happened?

                              MISS SELLERS
                    There was an inquiry.  It was his
                    word against mine.  They believed
                    him.  I was fired.


          INT.  DULANEY'S OFFICE - DUSK

          Dulaney is at his desk.  Biggs enters excited.

                              BIGGS
                    Joanne Braslow is getting more and
                    more interesting.  I followed her
                    today to an attorney's office.
                    Joseph Koehler.

                              DULANEY
                    Joe Koehler.  I know him.  He's an
                    estate attorney -- and he's very
                    expensive.

                              BIGGS
                    What would Joanne Braslow need with
                    an estate attorney?  She wasn't even
                    mentioned in Marsh's will.

          Dulaney thinks for a moment.  He grins as an idea enters his
          mind.

                              DULANEY
                    Not this will.


                                                                      85

          INT.  FILE ROOM - EVENING

          Dulaney and Biggs sit at a table going through a stack of
          papers.  Dulaney traces his finger along a piece of paper.

                              DULANEY
                    Here it is!  According to the old
                    will Joanne Braslow was to inherit
                    two hundred and fifty thousand
                    dollars.

                              BIGGS
                    What good does that do -- it's the
                    old will?

                              DULANEY
                    Under the law a person cannot profit
                    from their own wrong doing.  Since
                    Rebecca Lawson is the sole
                    beneficiary of the new will, if she
                    is found guilty the will is void and
                    Joanne Braslow could make a very good
                    case to have the old will reinstated.

                              BIGGS
                    She kills the old man and makes it
                    look like Miss Lawson did it.  Pretty
                    slick.


          INT.  DULANEY'S HOUSE, BATHROOM - EVENING

          Dulaney is washing up for dinner.  He speaks to Sharon who is
          in the bedroom.

                              DULANEY
                    I was thinking that when the trial is
                    over we'd all go skiing for a
                    weekend.

                              SHARON
                    Maybe it would be a good idea if you
                    just took Michael.

          Sharon leaves the room.  Dulaney reaches for his TOOTHBRUSH --
          picks up a TUBE of TOOTH PASTE.  It is empty.  He stares at the
          EMPTY TUBE.

                              DULANEY
                         (to himself)
                    Drug store.


          INT.  COURTROOM - MORNING


                                                                      86

          Dulaney looks worn, tired -- the tension between him and
          Rebecca shows.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Mr. Dulaney, are you ready to call
                    your next witness?

          Dulaney doesn't seem to hear him.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Mr. Dulaney, are you with us?

          Dulaney snaps out of it.

                              DULANEY
                    Yes, Your Honor.  The defense recalls
                    Joanne Braslow.

          As Joanne walks towards the stand Dulaney looks over at
          Rebecca.  It's as if he is trying to make up his mind about
          her.  Joanne takes her seat.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Miss Braslow, I'd like to remind you
                    that you are still under oath.

                              DULANEY
                    How often do you use cocaine?

          Cardenas shoots out of his seat.

                              CARDENAS
                    Objection, Your Honor.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                         (impatiently)
                    Counsel approach the bench.

          Dulaney and Cardenas walk over to the bench.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Mr. Dulaney, I'm getting tired of
                    seeing you this close to me.

          Judge Burnham looks at Cardenas indicating he will hear his
          argument now.

                              CARDENAS
                    Whether or not Miss Braslow uses
                    drugs is not an issue here.


                                                                      87

                              DULANEY
                    Your Honor -- the prosecution has
                    introduced cocaine as one of the
                    contributing reasons Mr. Marsh died.
                    How it may have been introduced into
                    the household is of vital importance.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Are you able to back up this
                    allegation -- or are you fishing?

                              DULANEY
                    I can back it up.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    You better.
                         (to Joanne)
                    Please answer the question.

                              JOANNE
                    I've tried it.

                              DULANEY
                    You've tried it?  Isn't it true that
                    you've been in and out of Rehab
                    centers for the last four years?

          This is clearly embarrassing for her.

                              JOANNE
                    I've been to a few -- yes.

                              DULANEY
                    You don't like Miss Lawson much do
                    you?

                              JOANNE
                         (hesitantly)
                    No.

                              DULANEY
                    You don't like her because you were
                    involved with Mr. Marsh before she
                    came along.  Isn't that true?

                              JOANNE
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    You resented the fact that she told
                    you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?

                              JOANNE
                    Yes.


                                                                      88

          Dulaney moves the questions along, quickening their pace,
          building a rhythm.

                              DULANEY
                    And you resented that he cared for
                    her in a way he once cared for you?

                              JOANNE
                         (breaking down)
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    --And that Mr. Marsh paid less
                    attention to you?

                              JOANNE
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    --and that he changed his will?

                              JOANNE
                    Yes.

          She has blurted out the answer before the full implications of
          the question has dawned on her.  Her face reveals her mistake.

          Cardenas can only watch uncomfortably from his seat.

                              DULANEY
                    In his previous will Mr. Marsh left
                    you two hundred and fifty thousand
                    dollars -- then he cut you out.  Why
                    do you think he did that?

                              JOANNE
                    She talked him into it.  She wanted
                    everything.

                              DULANEY
                    Two hundred and fifty thousand
                    dollars is a lot of money.  That must
                    have made you pretty angry?

                              JOANNE
                    Yes.

          Dulaney picks up a small PIECE OF PAPER and walks towards
          Joanne.

                              DULANEY
                    You testified that you returned to
                    Mr. Marsh's house at eleven o'clock
                    the night of his murder.  Is that
                    correct?

                                                                      89


                              JOANNE
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    Well - I'm a little confused.
                         (holds up the paper)
                    This is a charge receipt from Rosen's
                    Drug Store where Mr. Marsh had an
                    account.  It's dated the day of the
                    murder.
                         (hands it to her)
                    Is this your signature?

                              JOANNE
                         (nervously studies
                          it)
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    There's an item you picked up that's
                    marked.  Will you read it?

                              JOANNE
                    Dristan nasal spray.

                              DULANEY
                    Would you read for us the time of the
                    purchase?

                              JOANNE
                    Three fifteen.

                              DULANEY
                    A.M -- or P.M.?

                              JOANNE
                    P.M.

                              DULANEY
                    You see that's what bothers me.  No
                    other bottle of nasal spray was found
                    in the house.  The police looked.
                    There was only the one bottle.  But
                    you say you didn't arrive until after
                    Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he
                    was using the nasal spray prior to
                    his death.  How do you think it got
                    there?

                              JOANNE
                    I don't know.


                                                                      90

                              DULANEY
                    Isn't it true that you stopped by the
                    house after you left the drug store
                    and dropped off the items you bought?

                              JOANNE
                         (nervously)
                    No.

                              DULANEY
                    Isn't it true that you put the
                    cocaine in the bottle?

                              JOANNE
                    No!  Why would I want to kill him?

                              DULANEY
                    Because you were jealous.  Because he
                    cut you out of the will.  Because you
                    have a cocaine habit to feed --
                    because you know that if Rebecca
                    Lawson is found guilty the new will
                    is void -- and there's a very good
                    chance the old one would be honored.

          SILENCE fills the room.  Members of the JURY look at Rebecca,
          they are confused -- doubt fills their minds.

                              DULANEY
                    The defense rests.


          INT.  DULANEY'S DEN - EVENING

          Dark.  Dulaney is standing by the window, watching the RAIN
          FALL outside.  Sharon enters.

                              SHARON
                    We can't go on like this, Frank.

          Dulaney continues to stare out the window.

                              DULANEY
                    I know.

                              SHARON
                    Talk to me.

          He shakes his NO.

                              SHARON
                    Please -- this is ripping us apart.


                                                                      91

                              DULANEY
                         (emotionally)
                    I can't talk about it now.

          She senses his pain and moves to him, wrapping her arms around
          his shoulders.

                              SHARON
                    Don't shut me out.  Let me in.

          He turns and faces her.  She can see the pain on his face.

                              DULANEY
                    You wouldn't like what you'd see.
                    You don't know me anymore.  I don't
                    know me anymore.

                              SHARON
                    We can't pretend this isn't
                    happening.

                              DULANEY
                    Please -- not now.

                              SHARON
                    Why didn't you come to me?

                              DULANEY
                    I don't know.

                              SHARON
                    You used to like to touch me -- to
                    make love to me.

                              DULANEY
                    It's more involved than that.

                              SHARON
                    It was a place to start.

                              DULANEY
                    You think that's the answer?  Sex?
                    Is that what you want?  You want me
                    to make love to you?

                              SHARON
                    I don't want our lives ruined because
                    of this.  I love you, Frank.  I want
                    this to work -- but you have to help
                    me.  You have to come back from where
                    ever it is you are.


                                                                      92

          Dulaney's confusion and emotion begins to surface.  She kisses
          him, softly, gently.  Dulaney closes his eyes.  He kisses her
          harder - and harder.  His passion builds -- his anger grows.
          He runs his arm over his desk, brushing everything to the
          floor.

          He grabs her and firmly pushes her down on the desk.  He kisses
          her forcefully, his lips pressed hard against hers.  She
          struggles against him.  His hands tear at her blouse.  It is
          rough, angry sex and it frightens Sharon.

                              SHARON
                         (screaming)
                    Frank -- stop it!  Stop it!

                              DULANEY
                    Is this what you want -- huh?  Is it?

          She is crying now -- struggling futilely against him.

                              SHARON
                    Let me go!  Godammit, Frank let go!

                              MICHAEL (OS)
                         (racked with fear)
                    Daddy -- stop it!

          Dulaney stops and looks.

          Michael is standing in the doorway, his face filled with fear
          and incomprehension.  Tears streak down his face.

          Dulaney freezes as the full power of his actions overwhelm him.
          His face floods with anguish as he tries to grasp the total
          effect of his behavior.

                              DULANEY
                         (softly)
                    Oh -- Jesus.

          Filled with pain and embarrassment Dulaney runs from the room.


          EXT.  BAND SHELL, PARK - NIGHT

          RAIN falls in sheets.  Dulaney sits inside the small structure,
          huddled against one of the pillars.  He is a tragic figure,
          desperately trying to claw his way back to the world he once
          knew.



                                                                      93

          EXT.  DULANEY'S HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT

          RAIN continues to fall.  Dulaney is standing across the street,
          staring at the house.  He crosses over and is half way to the
          door when he stops.  He starts to leave.

          The front door opens and Sharon steps out onto the porch.

                              SHARON
                    Frank?

          He turns around slowly.  He can't bring himself to look at her.
          She walks out into the rain.  He lifts his head.  Tears flow
          down his face and he cries.  When she begins to cry with him
          he breaks down.

                              DULANEY
                         (ashamed)
                    I'm sorry.  God -- I'm so sorry.

          He slowly drops to his knees -- holding on to her as if she
          were a strong tree in a wind-storm.

                              DULANEY
                    Help me.  Please -- help me.


          INT.  COURTROOM - DAY

          Dulaney sits beside Rebecca. There is tension between them.  He
          does not look at her.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Mr. Dulaney.

          Dulaney stands and walks over to the jury.

                              DULANEY
                    The Prosecution's case is built on
                    theory -- speculation.  Could Rebecca
                    Lawson have done this?  Is it
                    possible that she did that? Where are
                    the facts?  The evidence.  The State
                    has presented two spurned lovers and
                    a jealous secretary.  Hardly what I
                    would call impartial witnesses.
                    Where is one shred of conclusive,
                    irrefutable evidence?  I don't see it
                    -- and I don't think you do either.
                    Do you know why?  Because there isn't
                    any.

                                                                      94

                         (beat)
                    What's the issue here?  That Rebecca
                    Lawson likes wild sex?  No.  But the
                    District Attorney is trying to make
                    you think if Rebecca Lawson could
                    stray from the path of normal,
                    accepted sexual behavior, then she
                    could be capable of murder.  Did she
                    force Andrew Marsh to make love to
                    her?  Did she hold a gun to his head?
                    No.  Andrew Marsh wanted her -- and
                    why wouldn't he?  She's beautiful,
                    alluring -- the type of woman men
                    dream about.

          As Dulaney continues we sense he is applying his closing
          arguments to himself.

                              DULANEY
                    It's human nature.  We want what we
                    want -- when we want it.  We don't
                    think about the consequences of our
                    actions.  When desire fills us we all
                    do things that we know are bad for
                    us.  We live for the moment.
                         (beat)
                    Here was an exciting young woman who
                    unlocked doors.  Doors that led into
                    a new world.  A world he entered
                    willingly -- eagerly.  He wanted to
                    please her -- and so, he did not tell
                    her of his illness.  I know it might
                    be difficult for you to understand
                    wanting something so badly that you
                    are willing to risk everything -- but
                    that's what passion does to you.
                    It's a fire -- uncontrollable.  It
                    consumes you -- and the only thing
                    you can do is let it burn.  Andrew
                    Marsh let it burn.  It was his life -
                    - his choice -- and maybe his mistake
                    -- but making love is not a crime.
                         (beat)
                    We all have fires inside us -- secret
                    desires.  We guard them --hold them
                    in the cages that we've built.  When
                    someone comes along and opens the
                    gate, they rush out and feed blindly
                    on their pleasure.  Rebecca Lawson
                    loved Andrew Marsh.  She didn't kill
                    him -- if anything did, it was his
                    own passion.


                                                                      95

          Dulaney walks back to his table and sits down.  Rebecca looks
          at him warmly.  Dulaney does not look at her.  Cardenas stands
          to address the jury.

                              CARDENAS
                    It's true -- we all have fires
                    burning inside us.  Rebecca Lawson
                    was very aware of the fire burning
                    inside Andrew Marsh -- and she stoked
                    those flames -- fanning them until
                    they burned so hot that reason and
                    judgement left him.  Is making love a
                    crime?  Of course not -- but the
                    question isn't as simple as that.
                    Rebecca Lawson used her seductive
                    qualities to entice Andrew Marsh.
                    She used sex as a catalyst and
                    cocaine as the terminus.  The
                    combination of the two provided the
                    conclusion of a premeditated act.
                         (beat)
                    She asked Dr. Paley about cocaine.
                    Her fingerprints were found on the
                    nasal spray bottle that contained the
                    cocaine -- and she was the sole
                    beneficiary of Andrew Marsh's will.
                    She planned it from beginning to end.
                    She knew about his heart.  She
                    secretly administered cocaine, then
                    used wild and physically demanding
                    sex to induce a heart attack.
                         (beat)
                    Making love is an act of passion
                    between two people to affirm their
                    vows of love.  This was not an act of
                    love -- this was an act of greed.
                    This was betrayal.  Rebecca Lawson
                    killed Andrew Marsh -- and I'm
                    counting on you to punish her for
                    that crime.


          INT.  WAITING ROOM, COURTHOUSE - DAY

          Dulaney sits on one side of the room -- Rebecca on the other.
          The room is quiet -- tense.  A MAN enters and nods to him.

                              DULANEY
                         (to man)
                    They're back already?  It's only been
                    three hours.



                                                                      96

          INT.  COURTROOM - DAY

          Dulaney sits beside Rebecca.  In the row behind them is Sattler
          and Biggs.

          The JURY enters.  Their faces betray nothing.  One by one they
          file into their seats.

          Cardenas sits with Troxell -- both of them watching anxiously.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
                    have you reached a verdict?

          The JURY FOREMAN stands.

                              JURY FOREMAN
                    We have, Your Honor.

          The BAILIFF walks over and takes the VERDICT SLIP from the
          FOREMAN, then walks over to Judge Burnham and hands it to him.
          Judge Burnham reads the decision.  He hands it back to the
          Bailiff who takes it to the COURT CLERK.

          ON REBECCA

          She waits nervously for the Court Clerk to read the verdict.

          ON CARDENAS

          he taps his pen against the desk anxiously.

          ON THE COURT CLERK

          He opens the verdict slip and looks at it.  He stands slowly.

                              COURT CLERK
                    The jury finds the defendant -- not
                    guilty.

          Relief floods Rebecca's face.  Dulaney shows no emotion.
          Sattler and Biggs shakes hands, then lean forward to
          congratulate Dulaney.

          Rebecca turns to Dulaney to hug him -- before she can, Dulaney
          has picked up his briefcase and is leaving the courtroom.


          INT.  UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON

          Dulaney walks towards his car with Biggs.  There is no sense of
          victory or elation.

                              BIGGS
                    What are you gonna do now?

                                                                      97


                              DULANEY
                    Take some time off.

                              BIGGS
                    You think the D.A.'s gonna file on
                    Joanne?

                              DULANEY
                    I don't know.

          Dulaney reaches his car.

                              DULANEY
                    You did a good job, Charlie.

                              BIGGS
                    Thanks, Mister D.

          Biggs walks away.  Dulaney takes out his keys, opens the door
          to his car.  He is about to get in when he senses someone
          behind him.  He turns around.

          Joanne steps out from behind a pillar.  She stares at Dulaney
          hatefully.  Her hand is inside her purse.

                              JOANNE
                    That bastard should have left me
                    something.  I worked for him for six
                    years -- and he goes and gives it all
                    to her.

          Dulaney looks around the parking lot.  He is alone.  Joanne is
          obviously very high on something.  Her mind seems to wander,
          her eyes drift.

                              JOANNE
                    You take what people say and make it
                    ugly.  You make others believe what
                    you want them to.  She should have
                    been found guilty.  She shouldn't
                    have gotten off.

                              DULANEY
                    Then you would have gotten your
                    money?

                              JOANNE
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    You killed him -- didn't you, Joanne?


                                                                      98

                              JOANNE
                    Do you think if I did I'd be stupid
                    enough to tell you?

          Dulaney looks her hand fidgeting in her purse.

                              DULANEY
                    What do you have in your purse?

                              JOANNE
                    What do you think I've got?  A gun?
                    Maybe I'm gonna kill you too.  Maybe
                    I'll blow your head off right now.

          Her hand starts to come out of the purse.  Suddenly, Biggs
          appears, rushing her from behind a pillar.  He grabs her hand
          and pushes her against a car.

          He pulls her hand from the purse.  She is holding a piece of
          paper.

                              JOANNE
                         (crying)
                    I'm gonna go to jail.  I know they're
                    gonna make it look like I did it.
                    They gotta put it on someone.

                              DULANEY
                    Why'd you come here?

                              JOANNE
                         (holds up the letter)
                    To show you this.  It's a letter from
                    that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to
                    me the day after I saw him.  He's the
                    one who told me I could get the money
                    if Miss Lawson went to jail.

                              DULANEY
                    You didn't know about it before that?

                              JOANNE
                    No.

          Dulaney is suddenly very confused.

                              DULANEY
                    Then why did you go see Mr. Koehler
                    in the first place?

                              JOANNE
                    Because he called me.

          Dulaney is stunned.  He looks at Biggs with a knowing stare.


                                                                      99


          EXT.  HOUSE - EVENING

          It is RAINING lightly.  Dulaney waits at the door of a nice two
          story home.  It is answered by a heavy-set man in his fifties,
          JOSEPH KOEHLER.

                              DULANEY
                    Hi, Joe.

                              KOEHLER
                    Frank -- what are you doing here?

                              DULANEY
                    I need to ask you a question.  What
                    made you get in touch with Joanne
                    Braslow?

                              KOEHLER
                    You know I can't talk about that.

                              DULANEY
                    I'm not asking for names or
                    specifics.  I just want to know what
                    prompted you to make the call?

                              KOEHLER
                    Sorry.

          Koehler starts to close the door, Dulaney sticks his foot
          inside, blocking it.  His face is filled with determination.
          Koehler sees it.

                              DULANEY
                    Please -- I need your help.

          Koehler thinks for a moment.  He can sense Dulaney's need.

                              KOEHLER
                    All I can tell you is I was contacted
                    by an interested party on Miss
                    Braslow's behalf.


          INT.  DULANEY'S CAR - NIGHT

          Dulaney stares through the windshield, straining to see the
          road through the heavy rain.  His CAR PHONE RINGS.

                              DULANEY
                    Hello?

                              REBECCA (VO)
                    Frank -- It's Rebecca.  I need to see
                    you right away.  I've got the tape.

                                                                      100


          A calmness spreads over his face.

                              DULANEY
                    I'll be right there.


          EXT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          RAIN FALLS.  LIGHTNING fills the sky.  Dulaney drives up --
          finds a PARKING SPOT down the street --  gets out of his car
          and runs to the door.  As he KNOCKS as loud CLAP on THUNDER
          BOOMS overhead.  Dulaney waits impatiently.  He lifts the
          FLOWER POT, removes the key and opens the door.


          INT.  DEN - NIGHT

          The dim glow of a DESK LAMP is the only source of light.
          Dulaney moves through the room slowly.

                              DULANEY
                    Rebecca?

          Two CHAMPAGNE BOTTLES are on the floor by the couch.  Dulaney
          looks on the coffee table.

          HIS POV - COFFEE TABLE

          A VIAL is open and on its side.  A RAZOR BLADE and STRAW lay
          next to it.  A pile of WHITE POWDER has been dumped out.
          Several lines of cocaine have been drawn.

          Dulaney starts to move towards the living room.  He is almost
          at the door when the BIG SCREEN TELEVISION TURNS ON.  We see
          the tape of Dulaney and Rebecca making love.

                              REBECCA (OS)
                    Is this what you're looking for,
                    Frank?

          Dulaney turns around to find Rebecca standing behind him, a
          remote control in her hand.

                              DULANEY
                         (distant)
                    You killed him.  You killed him --
                    and I got you off.

                              REBECCA
                    That's crazy.


                                                                      101

                              DULANEY
                    Is it?  Joanne Braslow was perfect,
                    wasn't she?  You knew we'd see her on
                    the tape and find out about her coke
                    problem.  After that, the digging
                    should have been easy -- but we
                    missed the will.  You knew we were
                    following her, so you called Koehler
                    and had him contact her.  That put us
                    right back on track.  All we needed
                    then was to prove that she had an
                    opportunity.  The drug store took
                    care of that.  She dropped off the
                    stuff and you came back and killed
                    him.  Didn't you?

          She shrugs her shoulders.  His frustration clearly amuses her.
          She grins slightly, almost taunting him.

                              DULANEY
                    I want the tape.

          Dulaney starts into the living room.

                              REBECCA
                    I've been thinking about that.  I've
                    decided to give it to you after I've
                    collected the inheritance.  You can
                    take that one if you want -- but
                    there's another copy.

                              DULANEY
                    That wasn't the deal.

                              REBECCA
                         (provoking him)
                    So, sue me.
                         (as cold as ice)
                    Things have changed.  I think you
                    should go home -- and after you leave
                    I see no reason for us to ever have
                    contact again.

                              DULANEY
                         (growing angrier)
                    I'm not leaving without that tape.

                              REBECCA
                    Don't push me, Frank.  I might lose
                    my temper and send it out just for
                    spite.

          Dulaney loses control.


                                                                      102

                              DULANEY
                    You fuckin' bitch!

          He grabs her by the shoulders and pushes her into the wall.
          Rebecca struggles, but it is little use -- he is a man consumed
          with rage.  Dulaney continues to smash her into the wall.

          Rebecca reaches onto the desk -- lifts up a FOUNTAIN PEN and
          stabs it into Dulaney's shoulder at the base of his neck.
          Dulaney SCREAMS and lets go.  Rebecca starts to runs into the
          living room.  Dulaney follows.


          INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Dulaney catches Rebecca -- grabs her -- spins her around --
          then backhands her across the face, knocking her to the ground.
          In the b.g. the VIDEO of them in bed plays on the screen.
          Dulaney sits on top of her and grabs her by the hair.  He
          repeatedly smashes her head onto the floor.

                              MAN'S VOICE
                    Let her go!

          Dulaney stops.  He looks behind him.

          HIS POV

          Standing in the bedroom doorway is Dr. Paley.  He is holding a
          GUN at Dulaney.

          Dulaney stares at him with disbelief as he staggers to his
          feet, his hand holding the wound on his shoulder.  A short,
          breathless LAUGH drifts out of Dulaney as he starts to put it
          all together.  Rebecca stands up, holding her head as she tries
          to catch her breath.

                              DR. PALEY
                         (to Rebecca)
                    Are you alright?

          Rebecca NODS.  Her face hardens.

                              REBECCA
                    You've got to kill him, Alan.

                              DR. PALEY
                    What?


                                                                      103

                              DULANEY
                    She's right, Paley.  You've got to
                    kill me.  She doesn't have to --
                    she's free -- she can't be tried
                    again -- but you, you planned it with
                    her.  You supplied the Coke.  You're
                    an accessory to murder.

                              REBECCA
                    Shoot him.

          Paley struggles to make a decision.  The gun shakes in his
          hand.  Suddenly, the whole scheme becomes clear to Dulaney.

                              DULANEY
                    Don't you see what she's doing?  She
                    needs you to kill me.  She's planned
                    it that way from the start.  That's
                    why she phoned me tonight.

                              DR. PALEY
                    You called him?

                              REBECCA
                    No -- he's lying.

                              DULANEY
                    How's it supposed to work Rebecca?
                    You and Paley celebrate your victory.
                    You get me over here and provoke a
                    fight so he has to rush in and save
                    you -- but then he's given himself
                    away as your accomplice -- now he has
                    to kill me.
                         (to Paley)
                    After that I figure she'll tell the
                    Police that you broke in.  That you
                    were crazed because we humiliated you
                    in court?

                              REBECCA
                    Don't listen to him.  Can't you see
                    he's trying to turn you against me.

                                                                      104


                              DULANEY
                         (continuing; to
                          Paley)
                    Here's the good part.  The truth dies
                    with me and she turns State's
                    evidence against you.  It won't
                    matter what you say.  No one will
                    believe your version -- you've
                    already discredited yourself in
                    court.  You'll go away forever and
                    she'll have the money all for
                    herself.  She's played us both
                    perfectly.

          Paley is becoming more and more confused.  Dulaney moves
          towards him.  Paley lowers the gun slightly.

                              REBECCA
                    Alan, listen to me.  If you don't
                    kill him it's over.  Everything we
                    did will be for nothing.

                              DR. PALEY
                    Shut up, Rebecca.

                              DULANEY
                    She's good isn't she?  But maybe with
                    you it's the real thing.
                         (points to the
                          screen)
                    I'm sure all those nights she was
                    fuckin' me she was thinking of you.

          Confusion crowds Paley's mind.

                              DULANEY
                    I'm sure that every orgasm she had
                    with me was faked.

                              DR. PALEY
                    That's enough.

                              DULANEY
                    I mean she only screwed me two or
                    three times a night because she had
                    to -- I'm sure she didn't enjoy it.

                              REBECCA
                         (softly)
                    I love you, Alan.  You have to
                    believe I love you.  Kill him!  Kill
                    him and we can be together forever!


                                                                      105

                              DULANEY
                    That's right, she loves you.  Just
                    like she loved Roston and Marsh and
                    me.  Don't be a fool.  You're nothing
                    to her.  The second you pull that
                    trigger she'll turn on you.

          Betrayal fills Paley's face.  His eyes fill with tears.

                              DR. PALEY
                         (to Rebecca)
                    I loved you.

                              REBECCA
                         (tense)
                    Alan, don't let him do this.  You're
                    everything to me.
                         (she moves closer)
                    Give me the gun.  Give me the gun and
                    I'll do it for you.

          Paley stares at her -- his mind races.  Pain fills his face as
          he fights to make a decision.  Suddenly, his face tenses.  He
          starts to raise the gun at Dulaney -- then just as suddenly he
          turns it on Rebecca and FIRES.

          The bullet hits Rebecca in the chest.  The force blows her off
          her feet.

          Paley stares at her blankly.  He slowly lowers the gun and
          drops it to the floor, then staggers over to Rebecca.

          ON REBECCA

          she stares up through glazed, dead eyes.

          Paley takes her pulse.  He breaks down, weeping over her body,
          his tears signaling to Dulaney that she is dead.


          EXT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT

          Police cars are lined up outside, their RED LIGHTS FLASHING.


          INT.  REBECCA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Members of the POLICE FORCE, along with FORENSIC PEOPLE go over
          the area.  Dulaney sits on the couch.  He looks indifferent --
          as if all emotion has been sucked out of him.  Troxell is
          beside him, taking notes.  Dulaney looks up.

          A BODYBAG on a stretcher is being wheeled out of the room.


                                                                      106

          Dulaney follows it with his eyes.  Cardenas enters from the
          bedroom.  They lock eyes.

                              CARDENAS
                    Paley's confessed to the whole thing.
                    It's like he's got no will to live
                    now that she's gone.
                         (thinks for a moment)
                    She almost got away with it.  Ironic,
                    huh?  Do you believe in karma, Frank?

          Dulaney doesn't answer.

                              CARDENAS
                    Well -- call it what you want.  Fate.
                    Destiny.  We usually get what we
                    deserve in the end.

          A beat.  Dulaney looks at him wearily.

                              DULANEY
                    Can I go?

                              CARDENAS
                         (to Troxell)
                    You get his statement?

                              TROXELL
                    Yeah.

                              CARDENAS
                    Then you can go.

          Dulaney gets up and starts for the door.  Cardenas watches him.

                              CARDENAS
                    Frank?

          Dulaney turns around slowly.  Cardenas reaches into his
          RAINCOAT pocket and take out a VHS TAPE.

                              CARDENAS
                    I found this video in her room.  It
                    has your name on it.

          The two men lock eyes.  There is a long silence between them.
          Dulaney waits for Cardenas' next move.

                              CARDENAS
                         (holding it out)
                    I assume it's yours.

     Dulaney knows that Cardenas has seen it.  A hint of a grateful
     smile shows on his face.  He takes the tape.


                                                                      107

                              DULANEY
                    Thanks.


     EXT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     A light RAIN falls.  Dulaney walks out and heads towards the
     street.  He stops -- looks back at the condo -- then walks down
     the street towards his car.


     FADE TO BLACK

     --------------------------------------------------------------
B O D Y   O F   E V I D E N C E

     by Brad Mirman (second draft)

     --------------------------------------------------------------


     Over the BLACK we hear the SOUNDS of two people making love.  A
     MAN'S VOICE MOANS passionately.


     FADE IN:


     INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

     ANDREW MARSH lies on his back in bed.  He is a frail-looking
     man in his early sixties, with thinning gray hair.  On top of
     him is a much younger WOMAN.  Although her back is to us, we
     catch flashes of her face for a moment as she turns from side
     to side.  We see enough to know that this is a beautiful woman.

     She moves wildly, grinding her hips into him, her head arched
     back, her hands rubbing lightly over her breasts.  She reaches
     down, grabbing his hips and jerks them upwards, forcing him
     deeper inside her.  They move together -- faster -- and faster.

     The CAMERA slowly begins to PULL BACK.  As it does we see what
     we are watching is on a TELEVISION.

     Further back still.  We see TWO UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICERS
     standing before the television watching the act.

     The CAMERA begins to pan around the room.  Rain streaks down
     the windows of the room -- LIGHTNING flashes outside.  A VIDEO
     CAMERA is set up on a tripod.  More PLAIN CLOTHES POLICE,
     looking, dusting, talking.

     We continue to PAN.  We can now see it is the same room on the
     tape.  ON the bed lies the naked body of ANDREW MARSH, a sheet
     covering his lower torso.  His face is ashen, mouth open, his
     dull eyes looking out in a fixed stare.  The last instant of
     his life is etched upon a face frozen in pain.


     EXT.  RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

     LIGHTNING fills the night sky.  THUNDER BOOMS overhead.  The
     wind whips the RAIN furiously against anything in its path.
     The CAMERA moves slowly along rows of beautiful HOMES.  At the
     end is a cul-de-sac.  Several POLICE CARS are in the driveway,
     their RED LIGHTS FLASHING.

     A four-door SEDAN pulls into the driveway.  JOHN CARDENAS steps
     out into the rain.  He is a handsome Latin in his thirties,
     with hard, chiseled features and black, slicked-backed hair.
     He does not run through the rain -- he walks.

     DETECTIVE REESE, a man who looks more like an accountant than a
     homicide detective runs out to meet him.

                                                                 2


                         CARDENAS
               Is it Marsh?

                         REESE
               Yeah.

     Just a hint of sadness shows on Cardenas' face.  It lasts an
     instant, then it's gone.

                         REESE
               Sir, do you mind if we get out of the
               rain?

     Cardenas doesn't move.  He ignores the question.

                         CARDENAS
               Who found him?

                         REESE
               His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.

                         CARDENAS
               She was here?

                         REESE
               No.  She stopped by to pick up some
               papers.

                         CARDENAS
               Show me.

     Reese starts for the house.  Cardenas looks up into the night
     sky.  A FLASH of LIGHTNING fills the SCREEN.


     INT.  HOUSE, BEDROOM - CLOSE ON CAMERA - NIGHT

     Pull back to reveal a POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER snapping pictures of
     Marsh in bed.

     Cardenas enters followed by Reese.  He moves through the
     FORENSIC and MEDICAL TEAMS.  Anything Cardenas feels about the
     gruesome sight before him is hidden behind a mask of
     indifference.

     Standing by the bed is ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY, ROGER
     TROXELL, a short, baby-faced man.  Cardenas looks down at the
     body, then over at the MEDICAL EXAMINER, DR. HENRY McCURDY, a
     portly man with windblown cheeks and bloodshot eyes.

                         CARDENAS
               How long?
                                                                  3

                         MCCURDY
               About three hours.

                         CARDENAS
               Cause?

                         MCCURDY
               Not sure.  I'll have everything you
               need tomorrow.

                         REESE
               Take a look at this.

     Reese points to the nightstand drawer and Troxell opens it.  On
     top of the nightstand is a box of tissues and a bottle of nasal
     spray.  Inside are ROPES, HANDCUFFS and an assortment of SEXUAL
     AIDES.

                         TROXELL
               This guy was into some kinky shit.

     Cardenas looks at the various sexual devices, then walks out of
     the room.


     INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT

     JOANNE BRASLOW sits on chair.  Her eyes are tired -- red from
     crying.  She is mid thirties -- attractive, but her looks come
     more from effort than nature -- expensive hair cut -- the right
     cosmetics.  She has a corporate look to her.

     Cardenas steps into the hall and walks over to her.

                         CARDENAS
               Miss Braslow -- I'm District Attorney
               John Cardenas.  You arrived at what
               time tonight?

                         JOANNE
               A little after eleven.

                         CARDENAS
               Why did you come by?

                         JOANNE
               I had some papers to pick up.

                              CARDENAS
                    Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?

                              JOANNE
                    I assume his girlfriend.


                                                                      4

                              CARDENAS
                    Her name?

                              JOANNE
                    Rebecca Lawson.

                              CARDENAS
                    You wouldn't know her address, would
                    you?

                              JOANNE
                    No -- but I can get it for you.

                              CARDENAS
                    Thank you.


          INT.  HALLWAY, CITY HALL BUILDING - DAY

          Cardenas walks down the corridor with McCurdy.

                              MCCURDY
                    Marsh wasn't alone.  We found traces
                    of sperm on the sheets.  The
                    toxicology report says there were
                    high levels of cocaine in his blood.

                              CARDENAS
                    What'd he die of?

                              MCCURDY
                    The official cause of death was a
                    cardiac arrest.

                              CARDENAS
                    The official cause?

                              MCCURDY
                    That's what my report will read.

                              CARDENAS
                    But there's more?

          They reach a door and stop.

                              MCCURDY
                    It's speculative at this point.
                    Marsh had advanced Arterial disease.
                    His heart attack was induced by
                    excessive aerobic activity -- in
                    conjunction with the drug.

          McCurdy enters the room.  Cardenas thinks for a moment, then
          follows.


                                                                      5


          INT.  CARDENAS' OFFICE - DAY

          Spacious and sparsely furnished.  The walls are empty.  No
          commendations, plaques or photographs to add prestige to the
          office.  Cardenas steps into the room and looks at McCurdy who
          is already seated next to Reese and Troxell.

                              CARDENAS
                         (to McCurdy)
                    What are you saying, Henry?  That his
                    girlfriend fucked him to death?

                              MCCURDY
                    Yes.

          A trace of a grin shows on Cardenas' face.  He walks over to
          the window and stares outside.  Reese, Troxell and McCurdy wait
          as he thinks.  A beat.  Cardenas turns back to the room.

                              CARDENAS
                    What can we prove?

                              MCCURDY
                    We know Marsh had a head cold.   We
                    found cocaine mixed with water in a
                    nasal spray container on the
                    nightstand.  The coke would contract
                    the nasal membrane the same as any
                    decongestant, but for a much shorter
                    time.  He'd keep using more and more
                    -- never knowing what he was taking.

                              CARDENAS
                    Any prints on the nasal spray?

                              REESE
                    Marsh's and Rebecca Lawson's.

                              TROXELL
                    What if he did know what was in it?
                    A lot of users put it in nasal spray
                    bottles so they can use it in public.

                              MCCURDY
                    Cocaine is the last thing a man in
                    his condition would want.

                              CARDENAS
                    Can we put Rebecca Lawson at the
                    scene?

                                                                      6


                              REESE
                    A man across the street from Marsh
                    saw her drive up about four thirty
                    Sunday afternoon.  And her prints are
                    all over the place.

          Cardenas stands and walks to a DART BOARD on the wall.  He
          gathers the DARTS, moves back and tosses one.

                              TROXELL
                    Marsh's Cardiologist told me that
                    after Marsh was diagnosed with heart
                    disease he quit smoking, quit
                    drinking and started exercising every
                    day.  Does that sound like a guy
                    who'd start shoveling cocaine up his
                    nose?

                              CARDENAS
                    What did he say about Miss Lawson?

                              TROXELL
                    He can remember at least one occasion
                    -- and the receptionist can recall
                    two times when she accompanied Marsh
                    to the office.

          Cardenas throws another dart at the board.

                              CARDENAS
                    So she knew about his heart?

                              TROXELL
                    Had to.  I also interviewed three
                    women who were in past relationships
                    with Marsh.  There's no evidence that
                    he had anything but straight sex
                    prior to meeting Miss Lawson.

                              CARDENAS
                    What about the will?

                              TROXELL
                    That's the best part.  She gets it
                    all -- everything.


          EXT.  CEMETERY - MORNING

          Gray clouds hang over head.  A light drizzle falls.  A GROUP of
          MOURNERS hold umbrellas as they stand around the grave.

          In the b.g. the PRESS is visible, held back my private SECURITY
          GUARDS.

                                                                      7


          A WOMAN dressed in BLACK stands in the front of the MOUNERS,
          her face hidden behind a hat and veil.  RAYMOND SATTLER, a
          tall, distinguished-looking man in his sixties stands beside
          her.  He supports his weight with the aid of a CANE.  The
          service concludes.  Sattler along with several other PEOPLE
          offer her their condolences.  Joanne Braslow is there.  She
          does not go over to Rebecca.

          CARDENAS AND REESE stand off to the side by a large oak tree.
          Cardenas watches and waits.  He steps forward as Sattler leads
          the woman by.

                              CARDENAS
                    Miss Lawson?

          The Woman stops.  Her back is to Cardenas.

                              CARDENAS
                    I'm District Attorney, John Cardenas.

          REBECCA LAWSON removes her hat and veil and slowly turns
          around.  She is in her late twenties.  A deep pain fills her
          face -- controlled, but evident.  Her eyes are tired -- heavy
          from crying -- but no tears show now.  This is a woman whose
          grief is private and not displayed for others.  Although
          emotionally drained she is still stunningly beautiful.  So
          beautiful that even Cardenas' usually cool demeanor cannot hide
          how impressed he is.

                              SATTLER
                    I don't think that this is the time,
                    or the place.

                              CARDENAS
                    I just wanted to introduce myself and
                    inform Miss Lawson that there will be
                    an inquiry.

                              SATTLER
                    An inquiry into what?

                              CARDENAS
                    For starters I'd like to know why she
                    left the house and didn't report the
                    death?

                              SATTLER
                    Because he wasn't dead when she left,
                    and even if he was, not reporting a
                    natural death in a timely fashion
                    isn't a crime.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did I say it was a natural death?

                                                                      8


          Cardenas and Rebecca lock eyes.  Rebecca stares at him
          genuinely shocked by his accusation.  Cardenas nods and walks
          away.  In the b.g. we see Joanne staring at Rebecca with
          hostility.


          INT.  HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Large and homey.  A fire roars in the fireplace.  FRANK DULANEY
          sits on his couch as he goes over some PAPERWORK.  He is mid-
          thirties, powerful, self-assured.

          SHARON DULANEY enters.  She is an attractive woman in her early
          thirties.  She kisses him on the cheek then pushes his
          PAPERWORK aside and sits down on his lap.

                              SHARON
                    You're on vacation, remember?  You're
                    supposed to be relaxing.

                              DULANEY
                    I am relaxing.

                              SHARON
                         (pushing the papers
                          aside)
                    This is not relaxing.

                              DULANEY
                         (playfully)
                    Really?

                              SHARON
                    Really.

                              DULANEY
                         (playing along)
                    And I suppose you're going to show me
                    how to relax?

                              SHARON
                    If you want me to.

                              DULANEY
                    I'm always open to learning new
                    things.

          She kisses him -- soft, gentle kisses.  Dulaney puts his arms
          around her and kisses her harder.

                              DULANEY
                    I'm beginning to see what you mean.
                    Why don't we go upstairs and work on
                    the advanced course?

                                                                      9


                              SHARON
                    I can't.  I've got to finish a
                    counter offer on the Bergman
                    property.

          The moment is passing by.  A trace of frustration shows on
          Dulaney's face -- this is obviously not a new occurrence.

                              DULANEY
                    Can't it wait?

                              SHARON
                    No -- it has to be done by tomorrow.

          The moment is gone.  Dulaney forces an understanding smile.  He
          looks towards the door and sees his EIGHT YEAR OLD SON,
          MICHAEL.

                              DULANEY
                    Hey, Slugger.  Ready for bed?

          Michael walks over to this parents.

                              MICHAEL
                    Uh huh.

          The PHONE RINGS.  Dulaney answers it.

                              DULANEY
                         (into phone)
                    Hello?... Hi Raymond.... What?...
                    Well, I was sort of planning on...
                    Alright... Okay, goodbye.
                         (hangs up; to Sharon)
                    That was Sattler.  He thinks the
                    D.A.'s going to file on Rebecca
                    Lawson.  He wants me in the office
                    tomorrow morning.

                              SHARON
                    We're supposed to go to the lake.

                              DULANEY
                    I know.  What can I do?  He is the
                    boss.

                              SHARON
                    He could let you have your vacation.

                              MICHAEL
                    Dad -- is it true what they're saying
                    about that Miss Lawson Lady?


                                                                      10

                              DULANEY
                    What are they saying?

                              MICHAEL
                    The kids at school say she humped Mr.
                    Marsh to death.

                              DULANEY
                    Hey, you know better than that.  What
                    did I teach you to say when someone
                    is accused of doing something?

                              MICHAEL
                    She allegedly humped him to death?

          Dulaney grins.  Sharon is fighting the temptation to laugh.

                              SHARON
                    I swear -- the both of you.
                         (to Dulaney)
                    Some example you set.

                              DULANEY
                         (imitating her)
                    Some example you set.

          He makes a funny face at Michael who LAUGHS and makes one back.
          Dulaney grabs him and starts TICKLING him.  Michael SCREAMS
          with LAUGHTER as he tries to tickle him back.  Dulaney then
          starts TICKLING SHARON -- Michael helps him.  Sharon ROARS with
          LAUGHTER and falls to the floor.  The three of them roll around
          LAUGHING hysterically.


          INT.  SATTLER'S OFFICE - MORNING

          Sattler sits on a couch sipping a cup of coffee.  Dulaney sits
          across from him.

                              DULANEY
                    Andrew Marsh was a very wealthy man.
                    A trial like this is going to put
                    Cardenas in the spot-light.

                              SATTLER
                    We've already got press arriving from
                    over the country and she hasn't even
                    been charged yet.
                    Cardenas wants to see her in his
                    office tomorrow at ten.  I'd like you
                    to go with her.

                              DULANEY
                    I'm supposed to be on vacation.


                                                                      11

                              SATTLER
                    I know -- but she wants you to
                    represent her if Cardenas files.

                              DULANEY
                    Why?

                              SATTLER
                    Because I told her you were the best
                    criminal attorney we have.

                              DULANEY
                    Raymond, I'm the only criminal
                    attorney you have.

                              SATTLER
                         (jokingly)
                    Well, I guess that makes you the
                    best.
                         (candidly)
                    Look, Frank -- she stands to inherit
                    three million dollars.  As executors
                    of the estate and her attorneys that
                    could generate a lot of legal fees
                    for us.  All I'm asking you to do is
                    talk to her.

          Dulaney thinks about it for a moment.

                              DULANEY
                    Alright, I'll talk to her

                              SATTLER
                    She's waiting in the conference room.

          Dulaney stands and walks towards the door.

                              SATTLER
                         (continuing)
                    You know, I knew Andrew Marsh for
                    almost twenty years -- or thought I
                    did.  What do you think would make a
                    man in his condition do the things he
                    did?

          Dulaney stops at the door and looks back.

                              DULANEY
                    I think the question is:  What is it
                    about her that made him want to do
                    it?



                                                                      12

          INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          Rebecca is seated at the end of the conference table smoking a
          CIGARETTE.  Sunlight flows through a window and highlights her
          hair.  She is dressed in a fashionable business suit that
          clings to every curve of her body.

          Dulaney enters the room.  When he sees her he can't help but
          stare.  Rebecca notes his gaze.

                              DULANEY
                    Miss Lawson, I'm Frank Dulaney.

          She raises the cigarette to her lips.  Dulaney notices despite
          her outward composure her hand is shaking.

                              REBECCA
                         (nervously)
                    Are you going to represent me?

                              DULANEY
                    There are no charges against you. I'm
                    here to decide if I'm going to
                    represent you should that occur.
                         (beat)
                    Did you kill him?

          Rebecca appears hurt by the question.

                              REBECCA
                    You don't waste any time, do you?

          Dulaney doesn't answer.  He studies her -- his eyes probing
          hers.

                              REBECCA
                         (continuing)
                    Do you think I did it?

                              DULANEY
                    I don't know.  That's why I'm asking
                    you.

                              REBECCA
                    You must have some feeling.  Some
                    immediate impression.  A young,
                    attractive woman, involved with an
                    older man who leaves her everything
                    in his will.  And the things that
                    went on in that house.  Such wild
                    sex.  What kind of picture does that
                    paint?

                              DULANEY
                    Not a very good one I'm afraid.

                                                                      13


                              REBECCA
                    And that's exactly what the jury will
                    see when they look at me.  That's why
                    I need a very good lawyer, Mr.
                    Dulaney.

                              DULANEY
                    You're assuming the District Attorney
                    is going to file charges.

          Rebecca's anxiety begins to surface.  She feigns a weak smile.

                              REBECCA
                    He'll file.  He's an ambitious man.
                    Ambitious men build their careers on
                    the bodies of others.

                              DULANEY
                    You still haven't answered my
                    question.

          She takes a long drag of her cigarette before answering.  She
          looks at Dulaney.  Displaying emotions is not something that
          comes easily.  Tears well up in her eyes.

                              REBECCA
                         (emotionally)
                    I loved him.  A big part of my life
                    has been torn away from me, Mr.
                    Dulaney.  A part I can never get back
                    -- and on top of that people are
                    saying that I am somehow responsible
                    for it.  They've taken everything
                    that is good and caring about two
                    people in love and made it dirty.

          A single tear streams down her check.  She knows what he wants
          to hear her say -- and she resents having to say it.

                              REBECCA
                    No -- I didn't kill him.


          INT.  HALLWAY, D.A.'S OFFICE - DAY

          Cardenas walks down the hall, sipping a cup of coffee.  Troxell
          walks towards him excitedly.  They walk together.

                              TROXELL
                    I think I'm going to make your day.

                              CARDENAS
                    How?


                                                                      14

          Troxell points to an Office.  Through the glass partition we
          can see a MAN sitting at a table.  ALAN PALEY is a well-groomed
          man in his thirties who makes every effort to look good.

                              TROXELL
                    I've got this guy in my office.
                    Doctor Alan Paley.  Wait until you
                    hear what he has to say.

          Cardenas and Troxell enters the room.  Cardenas shakes hands
          with Paley and listens with great interest as he starts to
          talk.


          INT.  DULANEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Dulaney and Sharon are in bed.  Dulaney reads some PAPERS.
          Sharon finishes reading her MAGAZINE.  She puts it on the
          nightstand and looks at Dulaney.

                              SHARON
                    How can Cardenas possibly think he
                    can build a case against two
                    consenting adults?

                              DULANEY
                    He must have something or he wouldn't
                    be pressing so hard.

                              SHARON
                    If he files are you going to take the
                    case?

                              DULANEY
                    I don't know yet.  I want to hear
                    what she says at her statement
                    tomorrow.

                              SHARON
                    What's she like?

                              DULANEY
                    Attractive.  Bright.  Distant.
                    Charming when she wants to be.

          Dulaney's description seems to bother her.

                              SHARON
                    She sounds like quite a woman.

                              DULANEY
                         (joking)
                    Yeah -- but can she cook?

          Sharon hits him on the arm playfully.

                                                                      15


                              SHARON
                    The whole thing gives me the creeps.
                    I mean -- what if she really humped
                    him to death?

          Dulaney grins at her choice of words.

                              DULANEY
                    Humped

                              SHARON
                         (grinning)
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    I can think of worse ways to go--

          Dulaney rolls over, gathering her up in his arms.

                              DULANEY
                         (continuing)
                    --and speaking of humping.

          He reaches over to the nightstand and turns off the LIGHTS.


          EXT.  CITY HALL BUILDING MORNING

          As Dulaney and Rebecca walks up the steps they are engulfed by
          a CROWD of REPORTERS.  Dulaney puts his arm around Rebecca and
          ushers her through the crowd.


          INT.  CARDENAS' OFFICE - MORNING

          Dulaney and Rebecca sit on one side of a table.  Reese stands.
          Cardenas sits at his desk.

                              REBECCA
                    I didn't know that Andrew was dead
                    until Mr. Sattler called me at home
                    that night.

                              REESE
                    We have a witness who saw you go into
                    the house at four thirty.

                              DULANEY
                    She's not denying she was there.

                              REESE
                    Did you have sex?


                                                                      16

                              REBECCA
                    Yes.

                              REESE
                    What time did you leave?

                              REBECCA
                    Six thirty -- and he was very much
                    alive.

                              CARDENAS
                    Miss Lawson, do you use cocaine?

                              REBECCA
                    I have.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did you use it the night Marsh died?

                              REBECCA
                    No.  I haven't done it in years.

                              REESE
                    Did Marsh use it?

                              REBECCA
                    No -- never.

                              REESE
                    It had to get there somehow.

                              REBECCA
                    It didn't get there from me.

                              CARDENAS
                    Were you aware of Mr. Marsh's heart
                    condition?

                              REBECCA
                    No.

                              CARDENAS
                    Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his
                    nurse have told us that you
                    accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office
                    on at least two occasions.

                              REBECCA
                    That's correct -- but Andrew never
                    told me he had a heart condition.  He
                    said he had a heart arrhythmia and it
                    was nothing serious.

                              REESE
                    He never mentioned his heart disease?

                                                                      17


                              DULANEY
                    She just said that.

                              REESE
                    Why do you think he lied to you?

                              DULANEY
                    That's something only Marsh would
                    know.

                              REESE
                    I think Miss Lawson knew it too.  I
                    think she slipped him the coke and he
                    popped his cork giving her the high-
                    hard-one.

          Dulaney's anger shows.  He stands.

                              DULANEY
                    That's it.  My client doesn't have to
                    take this crap from you.

                              CARDENAS
                    Sit down, Frank.

                              DULANEY
                    No.  Miss Lawson came in here
                    voluntarily to answer your questions.
                    She doesn't have to sit here and be
                    insulted.  So, either you charge her
                    now or we're leaving.

          A beat.  Dulaney and Cardenas lock eyes.  Cardenas shrugs his
          shoulders.

                              CARDENAS
                    Fine.

          Dulaney motions for Rebecca to get up.  She stands and they
          walk to the door.  Reese looks at Cardenas.  Cardenas nods.

                              REESE
                    Rebecca Lawson, you're under arrest
                    for the murder of Andrew Marsh.

          Rebecca is stunned -- frightened.  She looks at Dulaney in
          disbelief.  Dulaney looks at Cardenas angrily.  Reese removes
          his handcuffs as he moves towards Rebecca.

                              REESE
                    You have the right to remain silent.
                    If you give up--


                                                                      18

                              CARDENAS
                         (to Reese)
                    I don't think the handcuffs will be
                    necessary.  You can finish giving
                    Miss Lawson her rights outside.

          Reese grabs Rebecca by the arm and leads her to the door.  She
          looks back at Frank, her face filled with fear -- her eyes
          welling with tears.

                              REBECCA
                         (frightened)
                    Frank!

                              DULANEY
                    I'll have you out in a few hours.

          Reese ushers her through the door.  A beat.  Dulaney and
          Cardenas are left alone.  Cardenas starts fishing through a can
          of NUTS, carefully extracting the cashews.  Dulaney continues
          to stand.

                              DULANEY
                    Lookin' to make the papers, John?

                              CARDENAS
                    Marsh left her close to three million
                    dollars in his will.  That's motive.
                    She admits to being there the night
                    of his death.  That's opportunity --
                    and her fingerprints are on the nasal
                    spray bottle.

                              DULANEY
                         (continuing)
                    You can't show intent.

          Cardenas looks at Dulaney wryly.  He knows that Dulaney is
          trying to discover his game plan.  Cardenas looks into his can
          of nuts and fishes for another cashew.

                              DULANEY
                         (continuing)
                    Can you?

                              CARDENAS
                    Take your pole out of the water,
                    Frank.  The fish ain't biting today.

                              DULANEY
                    You're bluffing.  John, it's me,
                    remember?  I've known you since your
                    name was Juan Carlos.

          Cardenas doesn't appreciate Dulaney mentioning his real name.

                                                                      19


                              DULANEY
                         (continuing)
                    C'mon -- think about it.  If she was
                    going to kill Marsh why leave the
                    nasal spray bottle there for the
                    police to find?

                              CARDENAS
                    She planned this.  She wanted us to
                    find the nasal spray.

                              DULANEY
                    Why would she want that?

                              CARDENAS
                    Because she's clever.  Because she
                    knows that even if we didn't find it
                    we'd have suspicions as to why a man
                    in Marsh's condition would use
                    cocaine.

                              DULANEY
                    Suspicions maybe -- but suspicions
                    aren't enough for a conviction.

                              CARDENAS
                    The M.E.'s report stated that Marsh's
                    nasal membranes showed no sign of
                    prior cocaine use.  Without the nasal
                    spray we would have still treated it
                    as a poisoning.  We would have looked
                    for motive and the trail would have
                    still led back to her.

                              DULANEY
                    I don't buy it and neither will a
                    jury.

                              CARDENAS
                    We're going all the way on this one,
                    Frank.  Tell your client she has
                    until the prelim to cop a plea for
                    murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.

                              DULANEY
                    I'll tell her but she won't take it.

                              CARDENAS
                    Then she's not as smart as I thought
                    she was.  You've seen her in the
                    depositions.  Tell me you don't have
                    any doubts?


                                                                      20

                              DULANEY
                    She's innocent.

                              CARDENAS
                    Aren't they all?

                              DULANEY
                    Yeah.  Well -- we'll let the
                    blindfolded lady with the scales
                    decide that.

          Dulaney gets up slowly and leaves.


          INT.  CITY JAIL, BOOKING COUNTER - AFTERNOON

          Dulaney waits at the counter.  A barred door slides open and
          Rebecca is led out by a WOMAN JAILER.  Even in these
          surroundings she maintains her composure.  She walks to the
          counter and waits silently.


          EXT.  CITY HALL BUILDING - AFTERNOON

          As Dulaney and Rebecca leave they are once again encircled by
          REPORTERS, screaming questions, asking them to verify Rebecca's
          arrest.  Dulaney plows through the crowd with Rebecca in tow.


          EXT.  RIVER - AFTERNOON

          Gray clouds hang overhead, threatening rain.  Tall birch trees
          line the river, the color of their leaves hinting that autumn
          is approaching.  Dulaney and Rebecca walk along a jogging path
          cut along the bank.

                              DULANEY
                    I want you to know right now that the
                    trial's going to be nasty.  Your sex
                    life is going to be dragged through
                    the mud.  They're going to say that
                    you enticed Marsh -- led him down a
                    dark path.

                              REBECCA
                    Andrew hardly needed leading.  He was
                    a very passionate man.  He was eager
                    to explore.  I gave him what he
                    wanted.  We fulfilled each others
                    needs.

                              DULANEY
                    This is a very small town -- people
                    here have very straight views on sex.


                                                                      21

                              REBECCA
                    I'm used to being on the outside
                    looking in.  The same men who will
                    publicly profess their moral outrage
                    for my sexual tastes are the same
                    ones who privately rest their sweaty
                    little hands on my legs and talk
                    about weekend trips together.

                              DULANEY
                    Those same men will be sitting on the
                    jury.

                              REBECCA
                    I am who I am.  I can't deny it,
                    anymore than you can deny who you
                    are.  I like sex different -- I like
                    it wild.  That's not a crime.
                         (emotional)
                    I loved Andrew.  We made love
                    together.  We made it differently,
                    but we still made love.  It was our
                    way.  It was private -- and now the
                    whole world wants to look in through
                    the pretense of justice.  If I was
                    some middle-aged divorcee who screwed
                    him once a week do you think this
                    would be happening to me?

          She stops walking and stares out over the River.

                              REBECCA
                    Have you ever seen animals make love,
                    Mr. Dulaney?  They have such passion
                    -- such savage emotion.  They
                    struggle, and snarl, and claw, but
                    neither hurts the other.  Not really.

                              DULANEY
                    No pain, no gain?

                              REBECCA
                    Something like that.

                              DULANEY
                    We're not animals.

          As Rebecca speaks, Dulaney seems captivated.


                                                                      22

                              REBECCA
                    Of course we are.  Our primal urges
                    are still there -- but we've taken
                    sex and intellectualized it, refined
                    it down to its most essential
                    components.  It's bland, easy,
                    mechanical.  There's great passion in
                    the struggle -- such craving in
                    denial.  Do you know what it's like
                    to yearn for something?  I'm not
                    talking about wanting, or needing.
                    I'm talking about an urge so deep
                    that your skin burns and every cell
                    in your body pulses with desire?

          Dulaney appears moved by the passion of her words -- but he's
          uncomfortable by it and quickly pushes it aside.

                              DULANEY
                         (awkwardly)
                    I think we're getting a little off
                    the subject here.

                              REBECCA
                    I thought the subject was sex?

                              DULANEY
                    As it pertains to you -- not me.
                         (beat)
                    Did you always know you had
                    different... tastes?

                              REBECCA
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    How?

                              REBECCA
                    I don't know if it's something I can
                    explain to you.

                              DULANEY
                    Why not?

                              REBECCA
                    Because -- it's beyond intellect.
                    It's emotion.  It's passion.  It has
                    to be experienced -- it can't be
                    imagined.

                              DULANEY
                    Try.

          Rebecca thinks for a moment.

                                                                      23


                              REBECCA
                    When I was growing up we had a
                    strawberry patch in our backyard. So
                    did this family down the road.  I
                    used to sneak in their yard and steal
                    their strawberries.  It wasn't easy.
                    The stone walls were high and I'd
                    scrape my knees as I climbed over.
                    On the other side were wild rose
                    bushes.  The thorns would dig into my
                    legs and cut my thighs as I lowered
                    myself down.

                              DULANEY
                    If you had what you wanted at home
                    why did you sneak into their yard?

                              REBECCA
                    Because -- somehow the fruit always
                    tasted that much sweeter because of
                    the pain it took to get to it.

          Dulaney appears lost in her words.  This isn't lost on Rebecca.
          She walks off.  Dulaney stares after her intrigued.


          INT.  DULANEY'S HOUSE, DINING ROOM - EVENING

          A light rain falls outside.  Dulaney picks at his food.  He
          stares out the window.  He seems oblivious to the conversation
          between Sharon and Michael.

                              MICHAEL
                    Albert's got the stomach flu.

                              SHARON
                    That's too bad.

                              MICHAEL
                    No, it's not.  Now I get to pitch.

                              SHARON
                    Michael, you shouldn't be happy when
                    someone else isn't feeling well.

                              MICHAEL
                    Not even if they're a dork?

                              SHARON
                    Not even if they're a dork.  You
                    should go by and see how he's
                    feeling.


                                                                      24

                              MICHAEL
                    No way.  Jerry Milner stopped by and
                    Albert puked right in front of him.

          Sharon tries to suppress a grin.

                              SHARON
                    Don't use language like that at the
                    dinner table.

                              MICHAEL
                    Sorry.

          Sharon looks at Dulaney.  He is still staring out the window,
          deep in thought.


          INT.  DEN - EVENING

          Dulaney is at his desk, looking at PHOTOGRAPHS of Marsh and the
          bedroom.  Sharon enters.

                              SHARON
                    Frank -- I know you're busy, but
                    Michael asked me after dinner if you
                    were angry with him.  He wanted to
                    know why you weren't talking to him.

                              DULANEY
                    I'll talk to him later.

                              SHARON
                    Why don't you talk to him now?

                              DULANEY
                    Because I go to trial in seven weeks.
                    I've got a lot of preparing to do.

                              SHARON
                         (angry)
                    No one's asking you not to work.  I
                    just think you could make some time
                    for your son.


          INT.  MICHAEL'S BEDROOM - EVENING

          Michael lies on his bed, doing his homework.  The door opens
          and Dulaney enters and sits beside him.

                              DULANEY
                    I'm sorry if it looks like I'm not
                    paying attention to you lately.


                                                                      25

          Michael looks at Dulaney somewhat confused.  Dulaney tries to
          explain it another way.

                              DULANEY
                         (continuing)
                    You know how it is sometimes when
                    you're out playing ball with your
                    friends?  How you're really
                    concentrating on what you're doing --
                    and you lose track of time and you
                    come home late and Mom yells at you?

                              MICHAEL
                    Yeah.

                              DULANEY
                    Well, that's kind of how I am right
                    now.

                              MICHAEL
                    Is Mom yelling at you too?

          Dulaney grins.

                              DULANEY
                    Yeah -- a little.

          Dulaney leans over and hugs Michael.

                              DULANEY
                    I love you.

                              MICHAEL
                    I love you too, Dad.


          INT.  DULANEY'S OFFICE - MORNING

          CHARLIE BIGGS is a tall, wiry black man.  Street-wise, but
          basically good humored.  He is tossing a NERF BALL through a
          basketball hoop mounted on the wall as Dulaney enters.

                              BIGGS
                    How you doin' Mister D?

                              DULANEY
                    Fine, Charlie.  You familiar with the
                    Marsh case?


                                                                      26

                              BIGGS
                    Yeah -- I hear they had 'em a real
                    dog and pony show going on up there -
                    -  I'll tell you, sometimes white
                    people are a real puzzle to me.  I
                    mean, did this old guy really think
                    he was gonna be able to keep up with
                    a sweet little number like that?

                              DULANEY
                    It could've happened to anyone.

                              BIGGS
                         (ghetto accent)
                    I'm sorry, man -- but I ain't ever
                    heard of no brother dying from
                    gettin' too much pussy.

          Dulaney grins in spite of himself.

                              DULANEY
                    We have to find out who else would
                    profit from Marsh's death -- and who
                    knew enough about his personal life
                    to know that putting cocaine in the
                    nasal spray would be fatal.

                              BIGGS
                    So -- where do we start?

                              DULANEY
                    I want you to hit all the dealers in
                    town.  Give them a list of people
                    close to Marsh and see if any of them
                    use.  Then I want you to check out a
                    Doctor Alan Paley.  He lives up in
                    Roseburg.

          Dulaney's SECRETARY'S VOICE crackles over the intercom.

                              SECRETARY (VO)
                    Mister Dulaney, I have Rebecca Lawson
                    on one.

          Dulaney picks up the phone.

                              DULANEY
                         (on the phone)
                    Hi... No, I don't... One o'clock is
                    fine... Alright La Brasa... Bye.

          Dulaney hangs up.  Biggs is staring at him with a grin.

                              BIGGS
                    La Brasa?

                                                                      27


                              DULANEY
                         (defensive)
                    I'm taking a client to lunch.  Where
                    should I go, Taco Bell?

          Biggs tosses the ball to Dulaney, then raises his hands
          indicating he is backing off.  He leaves.  Dulaney shoots from
          his desk.  SWOOSH!


          INT.  RESTAURANT - DAY

          Dimly lit.  Dark wood and leather.  Dulaney sits at a table
          with Rebecca.  She removes a CIGARETTE and holds it, waiting
          for Dulaney to light it.  Dulaney fumbles through his pockets
          and removes a book of MATCHES.  He lights one.  Rebecca doesn't
          lean forward to meet him.  He must go to her.  She looks into
          his eyes as she cups her hand over his.  A beat.  She lights
          the cigarette and takes a drag, then arches her neck back and
          blows a stream of smoke towards the ceiling.  SHE DOES NOT BLOW
          OUT THE MATCH OR REMOVE HER HAND FROM DULANEY'S.  She watches
          him as it burns down towards his fingers.  After a long moment
          she leans in and sensually blows out the match and releases his
          hand.

                              DULANEY
                    How'd you meet Marsh?

                              REBECCA
                    I was at a cocktail party.  Very
                    trendy.  Andrew was in Chicago on
                    business.  He had broken his wrist
                    the week before and was wearing it in
                    a sling.  He looked so helpless.

          A FOURSOME a few tables away are staring at her.  Rebecca sees
          them.

                              DULANEY
                    -- And then?

                              REBECCA
                    We started talking.  In fact, we
                    talked until four in the morning.  We
                    discovered we shared a lot of the
                    same interests.  After that we were
                    together all the time until he left.
                    He used to call me every night after
                    he came back.  Then after a few weeks
                    he invited me to come visit him.
                    I've never left.

                              DULANEY
                    Why didn't you live together?

                                                                      28


                              REBECCA
                    Andrew was worried about how it would
                    look.

          A COUPLE in a booth are looking at Rebecca and whispering.
          Rebecca and Dulaney notice them.

                              REBECCA
                    Can we get out of here?

                              DULANEY
                    Sure.  Where to?

          Rebecca stands up.  She doesn't answer.  She just walks off.


          EXT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

          Dulaney pulls up in his car behind Rebecca's.  They get out.
          Dulaney follows her as she walks to the door.

                              DULANEY
                    This is your house.

                              REBECCA
                         (walking towards the
                          door)
                    I know.

          Dulaney stops.

                              DULANEY
                    I don't think this is a good idea.

          Rebecca stops and turns towards him.

                              REBECCA
                    Why not?

                              DULANEY
                    Because, I'm your attorney.  I
                    shouldn't be going to your house.

                              REBECCA
                    Is it against the law?

                              DULANEY
                    No -- it just doesn't look right.

          Rebecca stares at him for a moment, then looks down the street
          to her left and back to her right, then back at Dulaney.

                              REBECCA
                    No one's looking.

                                                                      29


          She walks to her front door and opens it.  She enters, leaving
          the door open.  Dulaney waits for a moment, then follows.


          INT.  REBECCA'S, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

          Dulaney enters.  Rebecca is standing in the middle of the room.
          Her back is to Dulaney, but she knows he is there.  Dulaney
          looks around the room.  He stares at a group of PHOTOGRAPHS on
          the wall.  On the other WALL is a GIANT TELEVISION SCREEN.

          DULANEY'S POV - OF THE WALL

          filled with EROTIC PAINTINGS AND PHOTOGRAPHS -- sensual but not
          vulgar.

          Rebecca walks over and stands very close to him as he studies
          the artwork.

                              REBECCA
                    What do you think?

                              DULANEY
                    I think the photographer's probably a
                    voyeur.

                              REBECCA
                    I'm the photographer.

                              DULANEY
                    Oh -- Well, they're different.

                              REBECCA
                    That's not an answer.

                              DULANEY
                    It's not my taste.

                              REBECCA
                         (seductively)
                    Tastes can change.

          Rebecca looks up to the top of a high cabinet.  Sitting on top
          of the cabinet is a WHITE PERSIAN CAT.

                              REBECCA
                    There you are.

          She stands on her tip toes as she reaches up.  Dulaney watches
          her -- the arch of her back -- the hem of her skirt rising up
          her legs.  She lowers the cat down and walks to a chair and
          sits down.  The slit of her dress opens revealing her thighs.
          Dulaney's eyes trace along them.  Rebecca notes his gaze.


                                                                      30

                              REBECCA
                    What are you thinking?

          Dulaney looks up quickly.

                              DULANEY
                    Nothing.

                              REBECCA
                    Not true.  Shall I tell you what you
                    were thinking?  You were wondering if
                    I was wearing anything under my
                    skirt.

          The fact that he doesn't protest confirms that she is right.
          She runs her finger lightly along her thighs.

                              REBECCA
                    I am.

          Dulaney walks to the window and stares out.  Rebecca seems
          amused.  She puts the cat down and walks over to him.

                              REBECCA
                    Sorry.  I wasn't trying to embarrass
                    you.

          He slowly turns towards her.

                              DULANEY
                    Yes you were.

          Dulaney stares at her for a moment, then places his briefcase
          on the table and opens it.


          INT.  RESTAURANT - CLOSE ON STRAWBERRIES - NIGHT

          A fork digs into a large strawberry.  PULL BACK as we follow
          the strawberry into Sharon's mouth.

          Dulaney sits across from Sharon.  His eyes are on the
          strawberries.  His mind is someplace else -- and it isn't hard
          to guess where.

                              SHARON
                    --he said it might be too expensive
                    to add another room.  He suggested we
                    might convert the garage into a guest
                    room.  He's going to check with the
                    contractor and let me know.  I'll let
                    you know how much and we can decide.
                    Alright?


                                                                      31

          Dulaney looks up slowly.  It is not so much that he has heard
          the question -- it is more that he is aware that Sharon has
          stopped talking.  A beat.  Sharon isn't sure he has heard her.

                              SHARON
                    Is that alright, Frank?

                              DULANEY
                    Yeah -- fine.  Excuse me.  I'll be
                    right back.

          He stands and leaves the table.


          INT.  RESTAURANT, HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Dulaney walks to a PAY PHONE near the bathrooms.  He thinks for
          a moment, then dials a number.  Rebecca answers.

                              REBECCA (VO)
                    Hello?

                              DULANEY
                    Hi.  It's Frank.

                              REBECCA (VO)
                    Hi, Frank.

                              DULANEY
                         (awkwardly)
                    I just wanted to see if my secretary
                    called to confirm your appointment
                    tomorrow.

                              REBECCA (VO)
                    Yes -- she did.

                              DULANEY
                    Great.  I'll see you at the office at
                    nine.

                              REBECCA (VO)
                    No -- not at the office.  I've got a
                    better idea.


          EXT.  CABIN, KLAMATH LAKE - AFTERNOON

          An old wood cabin set on the shore of the lake.  Dulaney and
          Rebecca get out of the car and walk towards it.

                              REBECCA
                    I figured if we have to talk all day
                    we might as well do it someplace
                    nice.

                                                                      32

                         (looks at the cabin)
                    Isn't it beautiful?

                              DULANEY
                    Yeah.

                              REBECCA
                         (sadly)
                    Andrew loved this old cabin.
                         (fondly remembering)
                    He always dreamed about moving to
                    Tahiti -- living in a hut and
                    becoming a beach-bum.
                         (a sad smile)
                    I could never imagine myself doing
                    that -- but somehow when he talked
                    about it, he made it sound so alive -
                    - so wonderful.  Soft ocean breezes
                    and beautiful sunsets -- leaving the
                    world and it's problems behind.  I
                    wish he'd had a chance to do it.

          Her mind drifts away for a moment, locked on some distant
          memory.

                              REBECCA
                         (snapping out of it)
                    Sorry.

                              DULANEY
                    It's okay.


          EXT.  LAKE, FURTHER - DUSK

          Dulaney and Rebecca walk along the shore.  A soft wind blows
          through her hair.

                              DULANEY
                    Tell me about Doctor Paley?

                              REBECCA
                    I hardly know him.  He wanted me and
                    he couldn't have me.

                              DULANEY
                    It's going to be hard to convince a
                    jury that he's testifying against you
                    in a murder trial because you blew
                    him off.

                              REBECCA
                         (confidently)
                    It won't be that hard.


                                                                      33

          She walks off.


          EXT.  CABIN - DUSK

          Dulaney and Rebecca sit on an old porch swing.

                              REBECCA
                    Did you always want to be a lawyer?

                              DULANEY
                    No -- I wanted to be a professional
                    hockey player.

                              REBECCA
                    Really?

                              DULANEY
                    Yeah.

                              REBECCA
                    That seems so far away from who you
                    are now.  What happened?

                              DULANEY
                    I broke my ankle skating.  That ended
                    that dream.

                              REBECCA
                    It's hard to let go of a dream, isn't
                    it?  To let go of what you want?

          Dulaney stares at her -- she looks beautiful in the warm light
          of the setting sun.  Their eyes meet.  He starts to lean in
          towards her -- then stops.  He gets up and walks away.


          EXT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - EVENING

          Rebecca's car pulls up in front.  Dulaney gets out.

                              REBECCA
                    I'm going to put the car away.  You
                    can let yourself in.  There's a key
                    under the flower pot.

          Rebecca drives to the rear of the building.  Dulaney walks to
          the door.  He lifts the FLOWER POT -- removes a KEY -- opens
          the door and goes inside.

          ANGLE - DOWN THE STREET

          Detective Reese is parked in his car, watching the house.  He
          glances at his watch, then makes a note in his note pad.


                                                                      34


          INT.  REBECCA'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING

          Rebecca walks over to the STEREO and turns on the CASSETTE
          PLAYER.  The room fills with soft, sexy MUSIC.  Dulaney stands
          in the middle of the room -- his eyes following her every move.

                              REBECCA
                    Yes -- it would be nice.

                              DULANEY
                    What would?

                              REBECCA
                    You and me -- making love.

                              DULANEY
                    Is that what you think I was
                    thinking?

                              REBECCA
                    No -- that's what I know you were
                    thinking.

          Before Dulaney can start to protest she continues.  She slowly
          walks behind him.  Dulaney stares straight ahead.

                              REBECCA
                    How often do you make love to your
                    wife, Frank?  Once a week?  Sometimes
                    twice?  There once was passion,
                    wasn't there?  But now it's bland,
                    predictable.  Tell me, when you do it
                    -- do you always think of her?  Or do
                    you wonder what it would be like to
                    be with someone else?  Someone wild.
                    Someone who would force you to lose
                    control.

          Her words strip his thoughts bare.  He is vulnerable.

                              REBECCA
                         (continuing)
                    There's nothing wrong in admitting
                    that you want me, Frank.

                              DULANEY
                    You take a lot for granted.

          Dulaney starts for the door.  Rebecca's cool exterior fades,
          giving way to her vulnerable side.


                                                                      35

                              REBECCA
                    Please stay, Frank.  I don't want to
                    be alone.  I don't expect anything
                    from you -- no demands -- no
                    complications.  I just need to feel
                    close to someone.

          Dulaney turns back towards her.  A beat.  He thinks for a
          moment, then walks back into the room.  Rebecca smiles warmly,
          invitingly.

                              REBECCA
                    I'll be back in a minute.  Help
                    yourself to a drink.

          She disappears down the hall.  Dulaney stands were he is,
          wondering what he is doing there.  He walks over to the BAR and
          pours a SCOTCH.  He looks down the hall.

          HIS POV - REBECCA'S BEDROOM

          The bedroom door is open.  The room is DARK -- Lit only by the
          moon.  Rebecca slowly pulls her sweater off over her head.
          MOONLIGHT washes over her body, SILHOUETTING her.  She runs her
          hands lightly over her stomach -- working her way up to her
          round, full breasts.  She stops for a moment -- and we sense
          she knows Dulaney is watching her.

          Dulaney stares at her -- mesmerized.  He knows he should turn
          away, but he cannot control the urge that moves him to look.

          One by one Rebecca unsnaps the buttons of her jeans, revealing
          her sheer, white panties.  She bends forward slightly and
          slowly peels the jeans down to her ankles -- then steps out of
          them.

          We can see the desire on Dulaney's face.  He looks away.  The
          conflict inside him grows.  He looks back.

          Rebecca walks into the hall.  She is barefoot --  wearing a
          long, slinky dress -- her eyes catch Dulaney's.  If she wasn't
          aware he was watching her before -- she is now.  It doesn't
          seem to bother her.  She moves towards him slowly -- her eyes
          inviting his.

          Dulaney moves towards her.  They meet in the middle of the
          room.  She waits -- he moves closer -- so close that he can
          smell her.  She cranes her neck back, subtly tempting him to
          bring his lips to hers.  The longing overcomes him.  He kisses
          her lightly -- the kiss lingers for a moment, then she grabs
          him forcefully by the hair, arching his head back.  She bites
          his lip.


                                                                      36

                              REBECCA
                         (whispering)
                    My way.

          Dulaney ignores her.  He tries to kiss her again.  She turns
          her head away.

          She walks down the hall into the bedroom and closes the door.
          Dulaney follows.  He tries the door -- it's locked.  He starts
          to knock -- stops -- turns and walks back into the living room.
          He starts to leave -- stops.  He looks at the bedroom door.
          His passion builds -- his hunger for her devours him.  He moves
          quickly down the hall -- eyes filled with determination.  He
          breaks the door open with his shoulder.

          Rebecca is standing in the center of the room -- as if waiting
          for him.  He moves to her.  She can see the fire in his eyes.
          He takes her in his arms -- kisses her neck feverishly --
          feeding his craving for her.

                              REBECCA
                    My way.

          He is lost within her now and doesn't hear her.  She pulls his
          hair, jerking his head back.  Her eyes command him to follow
          her demand.

          Something in him snaps -- a new door opens.  He pushes her back
          onto the DRESSING CABINET.  He kisses her, running his hand up
          her thighs, hiking up her dress.  She wraps her legs around his
          waist.  They move along the cabinet -- knocking jars and
          bottles to the floor.  He lifts her -- carries her to the bed -
          - lays her down and rips her dress from her body.  Their
          passion is unleased.  They grope and claw for one another
          hungrily.  She pulls his shirt off and bites him on the
          shoulder.  His face tenses from the pain, but he MOANS with
          pleasure.


          INT.  DULANEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Dark.  Sharon is asleep.  The door opens and Dulaney enters
          quietly.  He walks towards the bathroom.


          INT.  DULANEY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Dulaney splashes a handful of water across his face.  He
          unbuttons his shirt and takes it off -- wincing as he does.  He
          turns his back to the mirror.  Several deep FINGERNAIL SCRAPES
          are dug into his back.  He looks at himself in the mirror.



                                                                      37

          INT.  HALLWAY, LAW OFFICES - MORNING

          Dulaney and Biggs walk down the hall to a water cooler.  Biggs
          pours himself a glass.

                              BIGGS
                    Before you ask there's nothing new on
                    the coke.

                              DULANEY
                    You've got to get me something I can
                    use, Charlie.

                              BIGGS
                    I'm trying.

          Sattler walks over with another MAN.  He ignores Biggs.

                              SATTLER
                    Frank -- this is Harvey Willows from
                    the L.A. Times.  He'd like to ask you
                    a few questions.

                              MAN
                    It's an incredible story going on
                    here.
                         (as if quoting a
                          headline)
                    Woman accused of using sex to kill
                    lover.

                              BIGGS
                    I'll say -- it's gonna give a whole
                    new meaning to the state nickname.

          Biggs LAUGHS and walks off.  Sattler glares at him.  Dulaney
          smirks.

                              MAN
                         (confused)
                    What's the state nickname?

                              DULANEY
                         (dryly)
                    The Beaver State.


          EXT.  RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

          Rows of new Town Houses line the street.  Dulaney drives up and
          walks towards the front door of one of them.  He KNOCKS.
          JOANNE BRASLOW answers.  She stares at Dulaney innocently.



                                                                      38

          INT.  JOANNE'S TOWN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Sparsely decorated.  Very trendy.  High tech furniture and
          designer lights.  Joanne sits on the couch -- Dulaney on one of
          the chairs.  There is COFFEE on the table.

                              JOANNE
                    I worked for Mr. Marsh for six years.
                    He was a good man -- until she came
                    along.

                              DULANEY
                    What changed?

                              JOANNE
                    He did.  Look, I know you can lead a
                    horse to water but you can't make him
                    drink -- but you hold a pail of water
                    in front of an old horse for long
                    enough  -- and well...

          Joanne stops as emotion fills her.  Her eyes well with tears.

                              DULANEY
                    You don't really believe what the
                    district attorney is saying about
                    Miss Lawson, do you?

                              JOANNE
                    I don't know.  It's incredible to
                    think that anyone could be capable of
                    doing that -- but if anyone could it
                    would be Rebecca.

                              DULANEY
                    I take it you don't like Miss Lawson
                    very much?

                              JOANNE
                    I really don't know her that well.
                    We would say hello to each other when
                    I would come to the house, but that
                    was about it.

                              DULANEY
                    If you don't know her that well what
                    makes you think she's capable of
                    murder?

                              JOANNE
                    Andrew was a kind and gentle man, but
                    he was thirty years older than her.
                    Where's the attraction to sleep with
                    someone like that -- to have the kind
                    of sex they had.

                                                                      39


                              DULANEY
                    How do you know what kind of sex they
                    had?

                              JOANNE
                    I wasn't lookin' through the keyhole
                    if that's what you're thinking.  I'd
                    come to house sometimes to pick up
                    papers or speak to Andrew.  I'd find
                    their little toys all over the place.

                              DULANEY
                    Did Mr. Marsh use drugs?

                              JOANNE
                    No.

                              DULANEY
                    What about Miss Lawson?

                              JOANNE
                    Yes -- cocaine.

          Dulaney is shocked by this.

                              DULANEY
                    How do you know that?

                              JOANNE
                    I was at the house one morning -- I
                    thought Miss Lawson was upstairs with
                    Mr. Marsh.  When I went into the
                    guest bathroom she was standing in
                    front of the mirror pouring this
                    white powder out of a vial.

          Dulaney looks like he's been kicked in the stomach.

                              JOANNE
                    Is something wrong.

          A beat.  Dulaney looks at her slowly.
                              DULANEY
                    What?  No -- nothing.  Thank you for
                    your time.

          He gets up and walks to the door.  Joanne stands and stares
          after him with a trace of a grin.


          INT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - DAY

          Rebecca opens the front door and Dulaney barges into the room.

                                                                      40


                              DULANEY
                    You lied to me!

                              REBECCA
                    What?

                              DULANEY
                    I just left Joanne Braslow.  She told
                    me she saw you doing cocaine at
                    Marsh's house!

                              REBECCA
                    She's mistaken.

                              DULANEY
                         (Yelling)
                    That's not good enough, Goddamit!

                              REBECCA
                    It isn't true.  You have to believe
                    me.

                              DULANEY
                    No, I don't have to believe you.  The
                    jury has to believe you and answers
                    like he's lying or she's mistaken
                    aren't going to convince them.

                              REBECCA
                    I don't use cocaine anymore.  If she
                    says she saw me doing it she's lying.

                              DULANEY
                    Why would she lie?

                              REBECCA
                    I don't know, Frank -- but don't you
                    think that's something we should find
                    out?

          Dulaney is confused, struggling to decide if he believes her.


          INT.  LAUNDRY ROOM, DULANEY HOUSE - DAY

          Sharon is getting a load of washing ready.  She picks up one of
          Dulaney's tee shirts and notices several thin stripes of BLOOD
          near the shoulder.


          INT.  DULANEY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

          RAIN falls.  Dulaney enters the room to find Michael on the
          PHONE.  Dulaney appears nervous -- anxious.

                                                                      41


                              DULANEY
                    Michael -- get off the phone.

                              MICHAEL
                    Why?

                              DULANEY
                         (impatiently)
                    Because I'm expecting a call.

                              MICHAEL
                    -- But it's Sunday.

                              DULANEY
                         (snapping)
                    I know what day it is!  Get off the
                    phone.

                              MICHAEL
                         (hurt; into phone)
                    I gotta go.  I'll call you later.

          Michael hangs up and leaves the room.  Dulaney stares at the
          phone -- struggling against himself.  He picks it up and dials.

                              REBECCA'S VOICE
                    This is Rebecca Lawson.  I'm not in
                    right now.  So if you please leave a
                    message--

          Dulaney slams down the phone.  He checks his watch.


          INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Dulaney wears another tee shirt as he sleeps.  Sharon is awake,
          staring up at the ceiling.  A beat.  She rolls over and
          carefully lifts up Dulaney's tee shirt.  She sees the scratches
          on his back.  She does not wake him.  She just lays there, deep
          in thought.


          INT.  HALLWAY, COURTHOUSE - MORNING

          Rebecca walks down the hall.  In the b.g. we see Dulaney
          walking quickly to join her.

                              DULANEY
                    I called you all weekend.  Where were
                    you?

                              REBECCA
                    I went out on the boat.


                                                                      42

                              DULANEY
                         (concerned)
                    Alone?

                              REBECCA
                    Of course.


          INT.  COURTROOM - MORNING

          The gallery is crowded with REPORTERS and SPECTATORS.  Dulaney
          sits beside Rebecca at the defense table.  Cardenas stands
          before the jury.

          Dulaney and Cardenas are seated at their respective tables.
          Rebecca sits beside Dulaney.  She is wearing a beautiful, well
          tailored dress.  She looks beautiful and has surprisingly made
          no attempt to down-play her looks.

          JUDGE BURNHAM, a confident BLACK MAN in his fifties sits behind
          the bench.  He is strong-willed -- tough but fair.  There is a
          rough edge to him from his childhood on the streets.


                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    This trial by its very nature is
                    explosive.  The press is going to
                    have a field day and I will not
                    tolerate any activity in my courtroom
                    that will fuel it.
                         (to Dulaney and
                          Cardenas)
                    Both of you are going to be delving
                    into very personal aspects of peoples
                    lives.  I warn you now.  When you do
                    so -- if you cannot establish a clear
                    line of relevancy early on in your
                    examinations I will stop you.  Is
                    that clear?

          Dulaney and Cardenas both nod.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Mr. Cardenas.

          Cardenas stands and walks towards the JURY.

                              CARDENAS
                         (points to Rebecca)
                    You all can see the defendant,
                    Rebecca Lawson.  But as this trial
                    proceeds you will see that she is not
                    only the defendant -- she is the
                    murder weapon itself.

                                                                      43

                         (stops and thinks for
                          a moment)
                    Is that possible?  Can a person
                    actually be a weapon?  The answer is
                    yes.  If I hit you and you die -- I
                    am the cause of your death.  But can
                    sex be called a weapon?  Yes.  And
                    what a deadly weapon Rebecca Lawson
                    made of it.  The State will prove
                    that Miss Lawson seduced Andrew Marsh
                    -- that she put increasing sexual
                    demands on him while she secretly
                    administered cocaine.  All the while
                    knowing that he had a severe heart
                    condition.
                         (beat)
                    She is a beautiful woman -- but when
                    this trial is over you will see her
                    no differently than a gun, or a knife
                    or any other instrument used as a
                    weapon.  She is a killer.  And the
                    worst kind -- one who disguised
                    herself as a loving partner.

          Cardenas walks back to the prosecution table and sits down.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Mr. Dulaney?

          Dulaney stands up and approaches the jury.

                              DULANEY
                    I know what you're thinking -- and
                    it's a mistake.  You look at Miss
                    Lawson and you see a beautiful woman
                    who was involved with an older man --
                    and you think she looks like the
                    type.  She could've done it.  And
                    that's exactly what the District
                    Attorney wants you to think.  Yes,
                    she is beautiful.  So what?  Does
                    that make her a killer?  Of course
                    not.  This case is not about
                    appearances.  It's about facts.
                         (beat)
                    As Mr. Cardenas presents his case you
                    will see that there are very few
                    facts -- that the bulk of the States
                    evidence is circumstantial.  I'm
                    confident that by the conclusion of
                    this trial you will not just have a
                    reasonable doubt.  You will have no
                    doubt at all --  that Rebecca Lawson
                    is innocent of the charges against
                    her.

                                                                      44



          INT.  COURTROOM - LATER - DAY

          McCurdy is on the witness stand.  Cardenas stands before him.

                              CARDENAS
                    Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of
                    death?

                              MCCURDY
                    A massive cardiac arrest.

                              CARDENAS
                    What was Mr. Marsh's physical
                    condition prior to his death?

                              MCCURDY
                    Very poor.  He was suffering from
                    severe arterial disease.

                              CARDENAS
                    Was the heart attack the result of
                    natural causes?

                              MCCURDY
                    No.

                              CARDENAS
                    What induced it?

                              MCCURDY
                    We found a high concentration of
                    cocaine in his blood.

                              CARDENAS
                    So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?

                              MCCURDY
                    I don't think so.  The membrane in
                    his nasal passage didn't show any
                    sign of long time usage.

                              CARDENAS
                    Then how did it get into his body?

                              MCCURDY
                    We found a bottle of Dristan nasal
                    spray on the nightstand.  It was
                    filled with water and cocaine.  Mr.
                    Marsh had a head cold at the time of
                    his death.  I believe he wasn't aware
                    that he was ingesting cocaine.


                                                                      45

          Cardenas holds up a bottle of NASAL SPRAY in a PLASTIC BAG.  He
          brings it over to McCurdy.

                              CARDENAS
                    Is this the bottle that was found on
                    the nightstand?

                              MCCURDY
                         (examines it)
                    Yes.

                              CARDENAS
                    Your Honor, the State enters this
                    evidence as exhibit A.
                         (to McCurdy)
                    Were any fingerprints found on the
                    bottle?

                              MCCURDY
                    Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb
                    print of Miss Lawson's.

                              CARDENAS
                    Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to
                    someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?

                              MCCURDY
                    Increase his heart rate.

                              CARDENAS
                    -- And if he were in the midst of
                    making love while under the influence
                    of cocaine?

                              MCCURDY
                    It would be an added stress to his
                    heart.

                              CARDENAS
                    What would be the effect if someone
                    secretly administered cocaine to Mr.
                    Marsh and then induced him to make
                    love?

                              MCCURDY
                    It would be the same as shooting a
                    gun at him.

                              CARDENAS
                    Thank you, Doctor McCurdy.
                         (to Dulaney)
                    Your witness.


                                                                      46

          Rebecca looks at Dulaney for his opinion of McCurdy's
          testimony.  Dulaney gives her a reassuring glance before he
          stands up and approaches McCurdy.

                              DULANEY
                    Can you say with any certainty that
                    Mr. Marsh didn't ingest the cocaine
                    himself?

                              MCCURDY
                    No -- but it seems highly unlikely
                    that a man in his condition would use
                    cocaine.

                              DULANEY
                    That's your opinion, Doctor -- but
                    I'm asking you if there is any
                    scientific test that can tell who
                    actually put the cocaine into the
                    Dristan bottle?

                              MCCURDY
                    No.

                              DULANEY
                    Thank you.


          INT.  COURTROOM - LATER - DAY

          Cardenas stands before DOCTOR TRAMMEL, a thin, pasty-faced man
          in his fifties.

                              CARDENAS
                    Doctor Trammel, when did you first
                    diagnose that Mr. Marsh had heart
                    disease?

                              DR. TRAMMEL
                    About a year and half ago.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did Mr. Marsh change his lifestyle
                    after that?

                              DR. TRAMMEL
                    Yes -- he stopped smoking and
                    drinking and exercised regularly.

                              CARDENAS
                    He did everything he could to take
                    care of his heart?

                              DR. TRAMMEL
                    Yes.

                                                                      47


                              CARDENAS
                    Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr.
                    Marsh to your office?

                              DR. TRAMMEL
                    Yes.

                              CARDENAS
                    Just one last question.  What does
                    the sign on your office door say?

                              DR. TRAMMEL
                    Doctor Steven Trammel.  Cardiologist.

          Cardenas walks back to his seat, signaling his examination of
          the witness is over.  Dulaney stands.

                              DULANEY
                    Dr. Trammel, did you ever speak to
                    Miss Lawson about Mr. Marsh's
                    condition?

                              DR. TRAMMEL
                    No.

                              DULANEY
                    Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he
                    had spoken to Miss Lawson about his
                    illness?

                              DR. TRAMMEL
                    No.

                              DULANEY
                    Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr.
                    Marsh inside during his examinations?

                              DR. TRAMMEL
                    No.

                              DULANEY
                    Then you have no way of knowing what
                    Mr. Marsh told Miss Lawson were the
                    reasons for his visits?

                              DR. TRAMMEL
                    No.  No, I don't.


          INT.  COURTROOM - LATER - DAY

          Joanne Braslow is on the stand.  She is wearing a smart
          business suit and large-framed glasses.  Her hair is pulled
          back tight.  Cardenas stands before her.

                                                                      48


                              CARDENAS
                    How long were you Mr Marsh's personal
                    secretary?

                              JOANNE
                    Six years.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use
                    Cocaine?

                              JOANNE
                    No -- never.

                              CARDENAS
                    What about Miss Lawson?

                              JOANNE
                    Yes.

                              CARDENAS
                    Tell the court about that, please.

                              JOANNE
                    I opened the bathroom door one day
                    and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine
                    out of a vial.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before
                    his death?

                              JOANNE
                    Yes.

                              CARDENAS
                    How did he look?

                              JOANNE
                    Horrible.  He was tired and pale.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did you talk about Miss Lawson?

                              JOANNE
                    Yes.

                              CARDENAS
                    What did Mr. Marsh say?


                                                                      49

                              JOANNE
                    He was worried.  He said that she was
                    acting stranger and stranger.  He
                    said that if this kept up she was
                    going to kill him.  That his heart
                    couldn't take it.

          There is an audible BUZZ from the crowd.  For the first time
          Rebecca's confident exterior seems to fade and is replaced with
          genuine concern.

                              CARDENAS
                    Thank you.
                         (to Dulaney)
                    Your witness.

          Cardenas sits down.  Dulaney gets up slowly and walks towards
          Joanne.

                              DULANEY
                    How do you know it was cocaine that
                    Miss Lawson had in the bathroom?

                              JOANNE
                    What other kind of white powder do
                    people keep in a vial?

                              DULANEY
                    Do you remember the date when you saw
                    Miss Lawson in the bathroom?

                              JOANNE
                    Yes--
                         (thinks a moment)
                    It was on a Friday.  I remember
                    because I was going to visit my
                    sister for her birthday.  It would be
                    October twenty-eighth.

                              DULANEY
                    Could you repeat the last part of
                    what Mr. Marsh said to you the day
                    before his death?

                              JOANNE
                    He said that if it kept up she was
                    going to kill him.  That his heart
                    couldn't take it.

                              DULANEY
                    Didn't Mr. Marsh also tell you that
                    Miss Lawson felt bored here and was
                    thinking about going back to Chicago
                    for awhile?


                                                                      50

                              JOANNE
                    Yes -- he mentioned it.

                              DULANEY
                    So, the woman he loved passionately
                    was thinking about leaving.  That
                    must cause tremendous anxiety.
                    Sleepless nights.  Incredible stress.

                              JOANNE
                    I suppose.

                              DULANEY
                    So, isn't it possible that he was
                    confiding in you about the pain he
                    was feeling about losing what might
                    be his last chance for love?  That
                    what he really was saying was that
                    the uncertainty of her leaving was
                    driving him crazy and if it didn't
                    stop it was going to kill him.  That
                    if she did leave his heart couldn't
                    take it.

          THE JURY waits anxiously for her answer.

          Joanne fidgets in his chair as she thinks.  She appears
          confused.

                              JOANNE
                    I don't know.  I'm not sure.

                              DULANEY
                    Well, think about it.  Isn't it
                    possible?

                              JOANNE
                         (begrudgingly)
                    Yes.  I suppose it's possible.

          Cardenas leans back in his seat frustrated.  Rebecca breathes a
          sigh of relief.


          INT.  UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON

          Quiet and desolate -- most of the city employees have left for
          the day.  Dulaney walks towards the back of the lot with
          Rebecca.

                              REBECCA
                    You were brilliant today.

                              DULANEY
                    It's only the beginning.

                                                                      51


                              REBECCA
                    Strong endings start with strong
                    beginnings.
                         (growing excitement)
                    I love the way you twist what people
                    say around --  manipulating their own
                    words against them.

          They reach Rebecca's car.

                              DULANEY
                    Can I see you later?

                              REBECCA
                    You can see me now.

          Rebecca presses against him, raising her knee gently into his
          groin -- as she kisses him passionately.  Dulaney is lost in
          her kiss for a moment, then breaks it off and looks around.

          Rebecca smiles -- takes off her shoes and stands on the hood of
          her car.  She takes one of the shoes and hits the PARKING LOT
          OVERHEAD LIGHT FIXTURE.  The BULB breaks sending the area in
          darkness.

                              DULANEY
                    What are you doing?

          She steps down and kisses him again.  For a moment he tries to
          resist.

                              REBECCA
                    I want you inside me.

          His desire fills him.  He pushes her back onto the hood of her
          car, hiking up her dress with his hands, as she reaches down
          and unbuttons his pants.


          INT.  REBECCA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          The room is dimly lit.  Dulaney is in bed.  He appears to be
          deep in thought.  Rebecca enters wearing a sheer, silk bathrobe
          and carrying a tea service on a tray.  He places it on the bed
          and sits beside him.

                              REBECCA
                    Something wrong?

                              DULANEY
                    Paley could be a problem tomorrow.


                                                                      52

                              REBECCA
                    I'm sure you'll be able to handle
                    him.

                              DULANEY
                    I'm glad you have such confidence in
                    me.

                              REBECCA
                    Don't worry about Paley.  He can't
                    touch me.  No one can.  I've thought
                    it all out.

                              DULANEY
                         (sits up; very
                          concerned)
                    What does that mean?  You've been
                    thinking about the case?  Or you
                    thought everything out before you
                    killed Marsh?

          The question hurts Rebecca -- it shows on her face.  She looks
          away from him.  A beat.  Dulaney thinks.  He feels bad for
          asking such a question.

                              DULANEY
                    I'm sorry.
                         (she doesn't look at
                          him)
                    Rebecca -- I'm sorry.  Really.

          He takes her hand.  She slowly looks at him and smiles.  She
          points to the tea service.

                              REBECCA
                    Sugar or honey?

                              DULANEY
                    Honey.

          She lifts a PLASTIC BOTTLE of HONEY and starts to pour it into
          a cup.  She stops and smiles seductively at Dulaney, then parts
          her bathrobe and slowly draws a liquid line with it along her
          thigh.  She reaches out -- grabs him by the hair and gently
          pulls him forward.  He kisses her knee and slowly runs his
          tongue along her thigh, following the trail upwards.  She
          arches her back -- closes her eyes -- breathes deeply from the
          pleasure of his touch.


          INT.  DULANEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Dark.  The door opens -- light from the hall streaks into the
          room.  Sharon is asleep.  Dulaney enters quietly.  He watches
          her.  He looks over at the nightstand.

                                                                      53


          HIS POV

          A PHOTOGRAPH of Dulaney and Sharon on vacation.  Dulaney is
          carrying her on a beach.  He is wearing a LARGE SOMBRERO.  They
          are both laughing.
          Dulaney looks back at Sharon.  He is a man lost within himself.
          He walks to the bathroom.  Sharon opens her eyes and stares at
          him.


          INT.  COURTROOM - MORNING

          Court is in session.  Cardenas stands.

                              CARDENAS
                    The State calls Doctor Alan Paley.

          Doctor Paley stands and walks towards the witness stand.

          CARDENAS AND PALEY - MOMENTS LATER

          Paley has been sworn in.  Cardenas examines him.

                              CARDENAS
                    Where did you meet Miss Lawson?

                              DR. PALEY
                    At a dinner party -- about eight
                    months ago.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did you ever see her again after
                    that?

                              DR. PALEY
                    Yes -- several times.

                              CARDENAS
                    What eventually happened to your
                    relationship with Miss Lawson?

                              DR. PALEY
                    We stopped seeing each other.

                              CARDENAS
                    Why?

                              DR. PALEY
                    Well -- I realized that she wasn't
                    interested in me.  She was just
                    trying to get information out of me.


                                                                      54

                              CARDENAS
                    What kind of information?

                              DR. PALEY
                    She said that she was working on a
                    novel and she wanted to know what
                    kinds of drugs would be harmful to
                    someone with a bad heart.

          WHISPERS from the crowd fill the room.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did you suggest any?

                              DR. PALEY
                    Yes -- Insulin and others.

                              CARDENAS
                    What did she say?

                              DR. PALEY
                    She said that those weren't any good
                    -- because their use would be
                    detected and the police would know
                    the victim had been poisoned.  She
                    wanted to know if there was a drug
                    that would induce a heart attack but
                    could also be used to enhance a
                    sexual high.

                              CARDENAS
                    -- And what did you suggest?

                              DR. PALEY
                    Cocaine.

          More GASPS from the crowd.  Rebecca's remains calm, but her
          eyes glare at Paley hatefully.

                              CARDENAS
                         (to Dulaney)
                    Your witness.

          Cardenas sits down.  Dulaney approaches Paley with a smile.

                              DULANEY
                    Dr. Paley, where were you the last
                    time you saw Miss Lawson?

                              DR. PALEY
                    We had dinner at a restaurant.


                                                                      55

                              DULANEY
                    Isn't it true that later that night
                    you tried to force yourself on Miss
                    Lawson in the parking lot?

                              DR. PALEY
                    No.

                              DULANEY
                    You didn't grab her and try to kiss
                    her?

                              DR. PALEY
                    No.

                              DULANEY
                    If necessary I can bring in the valet
                    parking attendant and two customers
                    who witnessed the occurrence.

          Paley thinks for a moment.  He is nervous.

                              DR. PALEY
                    Well -- as I remember it, we had an
                    argument.

                              DULANEY
                    And the argument was about the fact
                    that you wanted to be romantically
                    involved and she did not.

                              DR. PALEY
                         (hesitantly)
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    And after that didn't you
                    continuously harass Miss Lawson?

                              DR. PALEY
                    No.

          Dulaney walks back to his desk and removes a TAPE PLAYER from a
          cardboard box.

                              DULANEY
                    Your Honor, this is a tape from Miss
                    Lawson's answering machine.  I would
                    like to play it now.

                              CARDENAS
                    Objection.  Your Honor, we don't know
                    where this tape is from.  Who made it
                    -- or under what circumstances it was
                    made.

                                                                      56


          Dulaney takes out two pieces of PAPER and approaches the bench.

                              DULANEY
                    These are reports from two
                    independent audio labs.  They each
                    state that the voices were recorded
                    over the phone and that no
                    alterations have been made.

          Judge Burnham studies the paper.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    I'll allow it.

          Dulaney walks back to his desk and presses the PLAY BUTTON.  We
          HEAR a BEEP, then...

                              DR. PALEY'S VOICE
                    Rebecca -- I know you're there,
                    Godammit.  Answer the phone, you
                    bitch!  You can't treat me like this!

          We HEAR a PHONE slam down.  Another BEEP.

                              DR. PALEY'S VOICE
                    You want to play games with me?  Who
                    the fuck do you think you are? Okay -
                    - we'll play.  You'll be sorry.

          Dulaney stops the machine.  He takes a dramatic pause, letting
          the words on the tape sink in.

          Cardenas is dismayed and tries to hide his frustration.
          Dulaney approaches Paley who is now very nervous.

                              DULANEY
                         (quoting)
                    You'll be sorry?

                              DR. PALEY
                    I was angry.

                              DULANEY
                    You're still angry, aren't you?
                    Isn't it true that your whole story
                    is nothing more than a vindictive
                    attempt on your behalf to get back at
                    Miss Lawson?

                              DR. PALEY
                    No -- she asked me about cocaine.

                              DULANEY
                    I suggest it never happened.

                                                                      57


                              DR. PALEY
                         (angrily)
                    You can suggest anything you want.
                    It happened.

                              DULANEY
                    No further questions.

          Dr. Paley's temper explodes.  He is a loose cannon.

                              DR. PALEY
                    I may have been infatuated with her -
                    - but I wouldn't perjure myself.

                              DULANEY
                    That's all Dr. Paley.


          INT.  REBECCA'S BEDROOM - EVENING

          RAIN FALLS, streaking along the bedroom windows.  CANDLES light
          the room.  Dulaney and Rebecca are on the bed.  She sits on top
          of him, writhing back and forth -- lost in the rhythm of their
          love making.

          CLOSE ON DULANEY - LATER

          He is asleep, laying on his back -- the sheets pulled up to his
          waist.  LIGHTNING FLASHES outside -- a CLAP of THUNDER follows.
          He stirs and wakes up.

          HIS POV

          Another FLASH OF LIGHTNING illuminates Rebecca, who is standing
          over him in a sexy silk ROBE.  Dulaney starts to sit up but
          something restrains him.  He is HANDCUFFED to the BRASS HEAD
          BOARD.

                              DULANEY
                    What the...  What are you doing?

          She sits next to him -- looks at him fondly -- gently strokes
          his face with her hand.

                              DULANEY
                         (nervously)
                    Rebecca -- take these off.

                              REBECCA
                    Tonight we open new doors.


                                                                      58

          She slowly drags the tip of her finger up his stomach -- to his
          chest.  Dulaney follows it with his eyes.  Rebecca picks up a
          LARGE CANDLE on the nightstand and moves it slowly -- back and
          forth over his chest.

                              DULANEY
                    What are you going you doing?

                              REBECCA
                    Are you scared?

          He doesn't answer.  He doesn't have to.  She can see the fear
          in his eyes.  She tilts the candle -- a stream of WAX pours out
          on his chest.  Dulaney winces with pain, his body arching on
          the bed, his hands straining against his restraints.

          She smiles -- a wicked smile, then pours more wax, making a
          thin trail of LITTLE BEADS that moves down his chest towards
          his stomach.  Dulaney's face cringes.  He stares at her through
          eyes filled with fear.

                              REBECCA
                         (whispering)
                    I love you, Frank.  I love your
                    strength -- be strong for me now.

          She continues to pour the wax in little BEADS, filling his
          navel and working her way towards his groin.

                              DULANEY
                         (pleading)
                    Rebecca -- please.  No more.

          Rebecca stares at him warmly -- fondly.

                              REBECCA
                    I told you in the beginning that it
                    was my way.  My way can be many
                    things -- pleasure or pain.

          She lifts a bottle of white vinegar and holds it over his burn.
          He tenses as she pours it on his chest.  -- then relaxes when
          he realizes it's water.  He breathes a SIGH of relief.

                              REBECCA
                    You see how life is, Frank?  We judge
                    things.  We look at things from the
                    outside and assume we know what's on
                    the inside.

          She takes a sip from the bottle.


                                                                      59

                              REBECCA
                    Water.  But you assumed it was
                    vinegar -- because you were only
                    looking at the outside.

          Her meaning isn't lost on Dulaney.  She watches him -- as if
          studying him -- then slowly -- very slowly,  she pulls on the
          belt of her ROBE.  The robe parts revealing the beauty of her
          body.  She gently lowers herself on top of him -- pressing her
          breasts against him.  Dulaney's breathing quickens in
          excitement.  Rebecca moves her head to his chest -- kissing his
          burns softly while her fingers caress lightly over his stomach.
          She gradually moves her head down -- lower -- and lower.

          CLOSE ON DULANEY

          he stares at the ceiling -- his mind a maze of confusion.  Soon
          the power of her touch fills him -- overpowering him.  His eyes
          close.  The pain that only moments ago filled his body is
          replaced with pleasure.


          INT.  DULANEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          It's late.  Dulaney enters quietly and heads for the stairs.  A
          LIGHT comes on.  Sharon is sitting on the couch waiting.

                              SHARON
                    Late night?

          Her voice startles Dulaney.

                              DULANEY
                    Yeah -- what are you doing up?

                              SHARON
                    We have to talk.

                              DULANEY
                    What's wrong?

                              SHARON
                    That's what I was hoping you'd tell
                    me.

          Dulaney enters the living room.

                              DULANEY
                    Sharon, it's late.  Can we get to the
                    point?

                              SHARON
                    Where have you been?


                                                                      60

                              DULANEY
                    Working.  Charlie and I were going
                    over some statements.

                              SHARON
                    Charlie called at eleven thirty
                    looking for you.
                         (beat)
                    You were with her, weren't you?

                              DULANEY
                    Yes.

                              SHARON
                    Why did you lie to me?

                              DULANEY
                    Because I knew you'd think exactly
                    what you're thinking.

          Sharon springs off the couch.

                              SHARON
                    This isn't a courtroom.  Don't try to
                    turn this around on me.

                              DULANEY
                    I'm not.

                              SHARON
                    You're sleeping with her, aren't you?

                              DULANEY
                    No.

                              SHARON
                    It's bad enough that you are.  It's
                    even worse that you can stand here
                    and lie to me.

          She starts to walks out of the room.  Dulaney grabs her by the
          arm.

                              DULANEY
                    Sharon...

          She swings around and slaps him across the face, then stares at
          him angrily, her eyes filled with tears.

                              SHARON
                    You bastard!  Do you think I'm some
                    kind of idiot?  That I don't have
                    fuckin' eyes.  I see.  I feel.  I
                    hurt.


                                                                      61

          She walks out of the room, leaving Dulaney alone with his
          thoughts.


          INT.  COURTROOM - DAY

          ESTER CRAWFORD is on the stand.  She is a BLACK WOMAN in her
          thirties -- thin and tired-looking, although we get the
          impression she once was pretty.  She is dressed in what is
          obviously her Sunday dress.  Cardenas questions her.

                              CARDENAS
                    Mrs. Crawford, you were Mr. Marsh's
                    maid for nine years?

                              ESTER
                    Yes.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever
                    argue?

                              ESTER
                    Like cats and dogs.

                              CARDENAS
                    What did they argue about?

                              ESTER
                    You name it -- they argued about it.
                    Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her
                    happy -- but it seemed that no matter
                    what he did it was never enough for
                    her.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did they argue the day before he
                    died?

                              ESTER
                    Well -- he died on a Sunday and I
                    have the weekends off -- but they
                    were ripping at each other with both
                    barrels Friday afternoon.

                              CARDENAS
                    What was the nature of the argument?

                              ESTER
                    Sex.

                              CARDENAS
                    Could you be more specific?


                                                                      62

                              ESTER
                    She was calling Mr. Marsh an old man
                    -- making discourteous insinuations
                    about his sexual abilities.  She said
                    that she had needs and that if he
                    couldn't fulfill them she'd find
                    someone who could.

          Dulaney jots down a note.  Cardenas continues.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use
                    cocaine?

                              ESTER
                    No -- never.

                              CARDENAS
                         (to Dulaney)
                    Your witness.

          Cardenas sits down.  Dulaney approaches Ester with a smile.

                              DULANEY
                    Did you go to college, Mrs. Crawford?

                              ESTER
                    No.

                              DULANEY
                    High school?

                              ESTER
                    No.

                              CARDENAS
                    Your Honor, I fail to see what Mrs
                    Crawford's educational background has
                    to do with this case.

                              DULANEY
                    I was just about to make my point,
                    Your Honor.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Do it quickly, Mr. Dulaney.

                              DULANEY
                         (reading from note
                          pad)
                    "Discourteous insinuations about his
                    sexual abilities."  Who told you to
                    say that?


                                                                      63

          Ester doesn't answer, but her eyes drift past Dulaney and focus
          on Troxell.  Dulaney follows her stare.

                              DULANEY
                    Did Mr. Troxell help you with that
                    phrase?

          Troxell and Cardenas squirm a little.

                              ESTER
                    I heard him say it.

                              DULANEY
                    Then -- those are not your own words?

                              ESTER
                    No.

                              DULANEY
                    What else did the District Attorney's
                    Office tell you to say?

                              CARDENAS
                    Objection, Your Honor.  The fact that
                    Mrs. Crawford heard Mr. Troxell
                    reconstruct her sentence and decided
                    to rephrase her words in a more
                    intelligent manner for the court
                    doesn't mean the incident never
                    happened.

                              DULANEY
                         (to Cardenas)
                    I'm just curious to see if Mr.
                    Troxell reconstructed anything else.

                              CARDENAS
                    Your Honor -- please!

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    I'll see both of you in my chambers.
                    Right now.


          INT.  JUDGE BURNHAM'S CHAMBERS - MOMENTS LATER

          Judge Burnham lights a cigarette and sits on the edge of his
          desk.  Dulaney and Cardenas stand before him.


                                                                      64

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Mr. Dulaney, before you cast
                    aspersions on the District Attorney's
                    Office by suggesting they've coaxed
                    this witness to say things that
                    aren't true -- you better have more
                    than a hunch.  Do you?

                              DULANEY
                    No, Your Honor.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Maybe you don't know what it's like
                    where Mrs. Crawford comes from -- but
                    I do.  I came from a neighborhood
                    just like hers.  This is a whole
                    other world for her.  She's a poor
                    working woman who has been thrust
                    into a room full of highly educated
                    and mostly unsympathetic people.  So,
                    she puts on her best dress, fixes her
                    hair and tries to present herself as
                    intelligently as possible.
                         (beat)
                    Being poor and having pride is not a
                    crime, Mr. Dulaney -- and before you
                    attempt to impeach another witness'
                    testimony in my courtroom -- your
                    foundations better be based on
                    something other than semantics.


          EXT.  COURTHOUSE - AFTERNOON

          Dulaney walks down the steps.  Cardenas joins him.

                              CARDENAS
                    I'm surprised you can walk after the
                    way Burnham chewed your ass out this
                    afternoon.

          Cardenas grins.  His comment was meant as a friendly jab
          between old friends.  Dulaney doesn't see it that way.

                              DULANEY
                         (coldly)
                    I've got work to do.

                              CARDENAS
                    Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's
                    between rounds.

                              DULANEY
                    I didn't hear it.


                                                                      65

                              CARDENAS
                    What's happening to you, Frank?
                    You're acting like you're on trial
                    here.  This has become personal to
                    you.

                              DULANEY
                    Back off, John.

          Cardenas studies him for a moment.

                              CARDENAS
                    You're sleeping with her, aren't you?

          Dulaney forces a laugh.  It's not a very convincing one.

                              DULANEY
                    That's ridiculous.

                              CARDENAS
                    I'm talking to you as a friend now.
                    Don't ruin your life, your career for
                    her.  She'll spit you out when this
                    is over.

                              DULANEY
                    You don't know what you're talking
                    about.

                              CARDENAS
                    Really?  What does an attorney speak
                    to his client about at her house
                    until three o'clock in the morning?

                              DULANEY
                    You've been following me?

                              CARDENAS
                    Her.  It's an obvious move.  I'm
                    building a case against her,
                    remember?

          Something in Dulaney snaps.  He grabs Cardenas and pushes him
          up against the wall.  Cardenas pushes back.

                              CARDENAS
                    If your head wasn't up your ass you
                    would have thought of it too.  You're
                    losing perspective.  Get out while
                    you can -- before she takes you down
                    with her.



                                                                      66

          INT.  HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

          Dulaney walks towards his office.  Biggs walks quickly down the
          hall and joins him.

                              BIGGS
                    I've been waiting for you to get
                    back.

                              DULANEY
                    You got something on the coke?

                              BIGGS
                    No -- but I got something.

          Biggs steps into Dulaney's office.  Dulaney follows.


          INT.  DULANEY'S OFFICE - MORNING

          Biggs picks up a remote control off the desk and sits on the
          couch.  Dulaney sits at his desk.

                              BIGGS
                    During lunch I was watching some of
                    Marsh's home videos.

          Biggs clicks the control.  On the TV we see Rebecca on top of
          Marsh in the bedroom.

                              BIGGS
                    He was really into recording this
                    stuff.  The D.A.'s office found a box
                    full of tapes.

          Watching Rebecca with Marsh bothers Dulaney.

                              BIGGS
                    This girl has really got some moves,
                    huh?

          Dulaney stands up and turns off the television.

                              DULANEY
                    If you want to get your kicks go to a
                    video store and rent a porno movie.

          Biggs studies Dulaney for a moment.  Dulaney's reaction bothers
          him.  He turns the TV back on and fast forwards the tape.  The
          screen turns to SNOW where the tape has been recorded over.

                              BIGGS
                    This tape was recorded over an
                    existing recording.


                                                                      67

                              DULANEY
                    Over what?

          Biggs raises a hand signaling patience.  SNOW still fills the
          TV screen.

                              BIGGS
                    I would have missed it -- but the
                    phone rang and I let it play while I
                    talked.  It looks like blank tape --
                    but it isn't.  It's been erased
                    without any input signal coming in.

                              DULANEY
                    So, what good is it to us if it's
                    been erased?

                              BIGGS
                    It's very good -- because when the
                    D.A's office saw it they assumed it
                    was the end of the tape, otherwise
                    they would have buried it.

                              DULANEY
                    Why?

                              BIGGS
                    Because it hasn't all been erased.

          Biggs looks at the screen.  A beat.  The SNOW dissolves and a
          picture fades in.  The PICTURE LASTS only about five seconds.
          We see Rebecca from the back as she straddles Marsh, grinding
          up and down on the bed -- her hair flowing down her back.
          Marsh raises his hand.  His WRIST IS IN A CAST.  She turns her
          head to the side and as she does we see that it is not Rebecca
          -- but Joanne Braslow.  The Tape clicks off.

          Dulaney stares at the blank screen.

                              DULANEY
                         (quoting Joanne)
                    Where's the attraction to sleep with
                    someone like that.


          EXT.  PARKING LOT - DUSK

          Joanne Braslow walks to her BMW 325i.  She is about to open the
          door when Dulaney approaches her.

                              DULANEY
                    I need to speak with you.


                                                                      68

                              JOANNE
                    I don't think we have anything more
                    to talk about, Mr. Dulaney.

          She starts to get in the car.

                              DULANEY
                    You were sleeping with Marsh.

          She stops -- appears shocked that he knows this.  There is now
          a different quality to her -- an edge.

                              JOANNE
                    Who told you that?

                              DULANEY
                    He video taped you.

                              JOANNE
                    That bastard!

                              DULANEY
                    I thought he was a kind, gentle man?

          Joanne doesn't appreciate Dulaney throwing her words back in
          her face.

                              JOANNE
                    Yes, I slept with him but that was a
                    long time ago.

                              DULANEY
                    You're lying.  Marsh was wearing a
                    cast on the tape.  It was right
                    before he went to Chicago and met
                    Miss Lawson.  He dumped you for her,
                    didn't he?

          Joanne can't hold back the emotion that is building.

                              JOANNE
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    It must have been horrible.  Having
                    to go there -- seeing them together -
                    - knowing he was sleeping with her in
                    the same bed he did with you.

                              JOANNE
                    I was jealous.  Of course I was hurt.
                    He switched me off like a little toy
                    he was finished playing with.  But I
                    didn't kill him.


                                                                      69

          Dulaney studies her.

                              JOANNE
                         (continuing)
                    I'm a practical woman Mr. Dulaney.
                    Killing Andrew wasn't in my best
                    interest.  As it is I'm out of a job
                    and I'm not in his will.

                              DULANEY
                    Money isn't the only reason people
                    commit murder, Miss Braslow.

          Dulaney walks off.  Joanne stares after him.  Her face is cold,
          showing no sign of emotion.


          INT.  COURTROOM - DAY

          Dulaney sits beside Rebecca, but he seems distant.  Cardenas
          stands up.

                              CARDENAS
                    The State calls Jeffery Roston.

          As soon as she hears the name Rebecca's face becomes tense,
          nervous.  Dulaney notices it.  He checks a list.

                              DULANEY
                    Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston
                    listed as a prosecution witness.

                              CARDENAS
                    The State's investigation just
                    uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday
                    afternoon in Chicago.

          Judge Burnham motions for Dulaney and Cardenas to approach the
          bench.

                              CARDENAS
                    Your Honor, Mr. Roston is an ex-lover
                    of Miss Lawson's.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Why didn't the State's investigation
                    uncover Mr. Roston earlier?

                              CARDENAS
                    He was away on an extended vacation
                    and just returned two days ago.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Alright -- I'm going to allow his
                    testimony.

                                                                      70


                              DULANEY
                    But Your Honor--

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    That's it, Mr. Dulaney.  Take a seat.

          Dulaney walks back to his chair.  Rebecca appears genuinely
          nervous.


          INT.  COURTROOM - LATER

          Cardenas stands before ROSTON a handsome man with salt and
          pepper hair in his late fifties.

                              CARDENAS
                    Mr. Roston, what was your
                    relationship with Miss Lawson?

                              ROSTON
                    We were lovers.

                              CARDENAS
                    How long were you together?

                              ROSTON
                    For about one year.

                              CARDENAS
                    How would you describe your sex life
                    with Miss Lawson?

                              ROSTON
                    Intense.

                              CARDENAS
                    I know this is a very personal
                    subject, but could you be a little
                    more specific?

                              ROSTON
                    It was wild.  She was constantly
                    trying to get me more and more worked
                    up -- kinky things.  I tried to
                    satisfy her the best I could, but it
                    was difficult in my condition.

                              CARDENAS
                    What kind of condition are you
                    referring to?

                              ROSTON
                    I had a bad heart.


                                                                      71

          There is an AUDIBLE GASP from the crowd.  Cardenas waits,
          giving the jury plenty of time to digest the implications of
          Roston's last statement.

          Dulaney looks at Rebecca dumbfounded.  He tries to control his
          surprise from the eyes of the jury, but he can't.  He stares
          ahead with a blank expression as he listens to the rest of the
          testimony.

                              CARDENAS
                    What happened next?

                              ROSTON
                    I had bypass surgery.

                              CARDENAS
                    And how are you now?

                              ROSTON
                    Fine.  The doctors say if I keep
                    taking care of myself I can live to
                    be a very old man.

                              CARDENAS
                    How did your relationship with Miss
                    Lawson progress after the surgery?

                              ROSTON
                    It didn't.

                              CARDENAS
                    Why not?

                              ROSTON
                    She left me.

          Dulaney slowly turns and looks at Rebecca.  The anger and his
          sense of betrayal show on his face.

                              CARDENAS
                    Why did she say she was leaving?

                              ROSTON
                    She didn't.  She just left.

                              CARDENAS
                    Why do you think she left you?

                              ROSTON
                    Well -- I think that after the
                    operation she realized that...

          It takes Dulaney a few seconds to object to the question.  He
          is clearly preoccupied with the implications of Roston's
          testimony.

                                                                      72


                              DULANEY
                    Objection.  The question calls for a
                    conclusion on the part of the
                    witness.

                              CARDENAS
                    Your Honor, Mr. Roston lived with the
                    defendant for many months.  I feel
                    that his opinion is valid in
                    substantiating the character of the
                    Miss Lawson.

                              DULANEY
                    The opinion of a scorned lover is
                    hardly an objective view.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Objection sustained.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did Miss Lawson ever give you any
                    indication why she was leaving?

                              DULANEY
                    Objection.  The witness has already
                    stated that Miss Lawson left without
                    an explanation.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Mr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on
                    to another line of questioning.

                              CARDENAS
                    When you say your sexual relations
                    with Miss Lawson were intense what
                    exactly do you mean?

                              ROSTON
                    It was like she was trying to push me
                    as far as she could.  She called it
                    opening new doors.

                              CARDENAS
                    Can you give the court an example?

                              ROSTON
                    It was like sex was a game to her.
                    She got off on the control.  She
                    always used to tell me it had to be
                    her way.

          This strikes a chord with Dulaney.


                                                                      73

                              ROSTON
                         (continuing)
                    It's hard to resist a woman as
                    beautiful as she is.

                              CARDENAS
                    What would she do that made it hard
                    to resist?

                              ROSTON
                    She's a woman who is very much aware
                    of her own sexuality.  Sometimes I
                    felt she could read my mind.  It was
                    uncanny how she knew exactly what I
                    wanted.  A few nights before my heart
                    surgery Rebecca woke me.  She had
                    handcuffed me to the bed.

          There are a few SNICKERS from the crowd.  Dulaney is thinking
          about the familiarity of Roston's testimony.  Judge Burnham
          BANGS his GAVEL.  The crowd becomes silent.

                              ROSTON
                    She told me that tonight we were
                    going to open new doors.  I asked her
                    to stop -- to take off the handcuffs,
                    but she wouldn't listen.

                              CARDENAS
                    What did she say?

          Roston is clearly uncomfortable having to relate this part of
          his life.

                              CARDENAS
                    Mr. Roston I know this is difficult
                    for you, but it's important you tell
                    the court what she did.

                              ROSTON
                    She said she was going to fuck me
                    like I've never been fucked before.

          More noise from the Crowd.  Judge Burnham is annoyed.  He BANGS
          his gavel again.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Due to the sensitive nature of this
                    witness' testimony and the inability
                    of the spectators to allow him to
                    complete it, I am clearing the
                    courtroom.

          Sounds of protest fill the room as the BAILIFFS start to usher
          out the crowd.

                                                                      74



          INT.  COURTROOM LATER

          The gallery is empty.  Only Dulaney, Rebecca, Cardenas,
          Troxell, Roston, Judge Burnham, The Jury and Court Officials
          remain.

                              CARDENAS
                    What did she do next, Mr. Roston?

                              ROSTON
                    She started touching herself and
                    telling me how much she wanted me.
                    She reached down and put me inside
                    her.  My doctor had warned me about
                    exerting myself -- but you really
                    don't think of those things at a
                    moment like that.  You just think
                    about how beautiful this woman is --
                    how much you want her.  How deeply
                    you want to please her.
                         (beat)
                    At first it started off slowly -- but
                    the rhythm built and built.    Every
                    time I got close to an orgasm she
                    would stop.  Eventually I started to
                    have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just
                    kept going -- faster and faster.  No
                    matter what I said she wouldn't stop.
                    I really thought for a moment I was
                    going to die.

                              CARDENAS
                    If you knew it was bad for you why
                    did you do it?

                              ROSTON
                    I couldn't help myself.  You get lost
                    inside a women like her.  It was like
                    a drug.  It was the best sex I ever
                    had.

                              CARDENAS
                    What happened after that?

                              ROSTON
                    I woke up the next morning and she
                    was gone.

                              CARDENAS
                    Did you change your will while you
                    were with Miss Lawson?


                                                                      75

                              ROSTON
                    Yes.

                              CARDENAS
                    Who was your primary beneficiary?

                              ROSTON
                    She was.

                              CARDENAS
                    Thank you.  The State rests.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Mister Dulaney?

          Dulaney is stunned -- deep in thought.  He doesn't appear to
          hear the question.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Mister Dulaney?

          Dulaney looks at the jury.  What he sees isn't good.  He thinks
          for a moment.  He leans over and quickly speaks with Rebecca.
          We cannot hear them -- but their conversation is heated.
          Rebecca says something.  Dulaney looks at Roston.  A beat.
          Dulaney stands.

                              DULANEY
                    Mr. Roston, you said it was the best
                    sex you ever had.  Is that the best
                    sex with a woman, or a man?

          Cardenas bolts from his seat.

                              CARDENAS
                    Objection!

                              DULANEY
                    I'll rephrase the question.  Mr.
                    Roston isn't it true you are
                    bisexual?

                              CARDENAS
                    Objection!  Mr. Roston's sexual
                    preferences are not at issue in this
                    trial.

                              DULANEY
                    Your Honor, I'm trying to establish
                    the sense of betrayal Miss Lawson
                    felt when she discovered the man she
                    lived with was a different person
                    than she thought he was.

          Judge Burnham thinks for a moment.

                                                                      76


                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    The witness will answer the question.

                              DULANEY
                    Mr. Roston?

                              ROSTON
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    And your sexual tastes were something
                    that you hid from Miss Lawson?

                              ROSTON
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    And didn't Miss Lawson come home one
                    day and find you in bed with your
                    male lover?

                              ROSTON
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    And she left shortly after that?

          A pause.  Roston thinks, struggling to make a decision.

                              ROSTON
                    No.  We worked things out.  It was
                    three weeks later when I told her
                    about the heart surgery that she
                    left.

          Roston looks around the court room.  He is embarrassed, filled
          with emotion.

                              DULANEY
                    Would it be fair to say that when she
                    did find out it was a shock to her?

                              ROSTON
                         (very upset)
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    No further questions.

          Roston looks at the jury -- their disapproving stares.  He is
          on the verge of tears.



                                                                      77

          INT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

          Rebecca opens the door.  A tired-looking Dulaney enters.  They
          walk to the couch together in silence.  Dulaney sits.  Rebecca
          lifts a BOTTLE of CHAMPAGNE out of an ice bucket.

                              DULANEY
                    What's that for?

                              REBECCA
                    To celebrate how masterfully you
                    destroyed Roston today.

                              DULANEY
                    Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life
                    in open court.

                              REBECCA
                         (suddenly ice cold)
                    Fuck him!  He tried to shatter mine.

                              DULANEY
                    He was only doing what he thought was
                    right.

                              REBECCA
                    You're too weak, Frank.  When you
                    want something you have to do what-
                    ever it takes to get it.  If
                    something gets in your way you remove
                    it.

          Dulaney stares at her.  The person he sees has no feelings --
          no empathy for anyone.

                              DULANEY
                    You killed him -- didn't you?

                              REBECCA
                    I knew you were thinking that.  I
                    could see it in your eyes today in
                    the courtroom.  You're wrong, Frank.
                    I need you to believe that.

                              DULANEY
                    You don't need anybody.

                              REBECCA
                    I do need you.  No matter what you
                    think of me -- I didn't do it.

                                                                      78

                         (beat)
                    I could see the looks on the juror's
                    faces.  To the men I represent what
                    they can never have.  I'm a cold,
                    heartless bitch -- and this is their
                    chance for pay-back for every woman
                    that's ever blown them off in a bar.
                    To the old women I'm a vulgar whore
                    and to the young ones I remind them
                    of what they'll never be.  It doesn't
                    matter to them that I'm innocent.
                    They've already convicted me.

                              DULANEY
                    I'm dropping the case.

                              REBECCA
                         (matter of factly)
                    No -- you're not.

          Rebecca picks up a REMOTE CONTROL from the coffee table and
          pushes a button.

          CLOSE ON TELEVISION

          A TAPE of Dulaney making love to Rebecca fills the screen.  It
          is wild, passionate.

          CLOSE ON DULANEY

          he is dumbfounded as he watches.  The implications of what this
          tape could do to him run through his mind.

          Something in Dulaney snaps.  He grabs Rebecca.  They struggle,
          falling down onto the coffee table.  The CHAMPAGNE bottle
          crashes to the floor.  Rebecca rolls off the table to the
          floor.  She sits up and moves away from Dulaney by pushing
          herself backwards.  Dulaney lunges at her.  His hand grabbing
          her ankle.  Rebecca kicks -- breaks free -- stands up.  Dulaney
          gets to his feet -- runs after her.  He grabs her by the throat
          and smashes her into the wall.  He slaps her across the face.
          A thin stream of blood flows from the corner of her mouth.  She
          smiles.

                              REBECCA
                    It gets easier, doesn't it?  Once you
                    open the door it never closes.

          Dulaney realizes what he is doing.  He stares at her in horror,
          then walks towards the door. He stops.  Goes back to the VHS
          machine.  He pushes the EJECT BUTTON on the VCR, removes the
          tape and destroys it.


                                                                      79

                              REBECCA
                    I've got another copy.  How do you
                    think your wife would feel if she saw
                    this -- not to mention your
                    colleagues?

          Dulaney's temper is near the breaking point again, he strains
          to control himself.

                              REBECCA
                    You can think whatever you want,
                    Frank -- but I didn't kill Andrew,
                    and I'm not going to prison for
                    something I didn't do.

                              DULANEY
                    You're a monster.

                              REBECCA
                    No -- I'm a survivor.


          INT.  DULANEY'S HOUSE, DINNING ROOM - NIGHT

          Dulaney, Sharon and Michael sit at the table eating dinner.
          There is a tense silence.  Although Michael does not know what
          is going on he can sense the tension.  The DOORBELL RINGS.

                              DULANEY
                    I'll get it.


          INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Dulaney answers the front door and Biggs rushes in excited.

                              BIGGS
                    I'm sorry to barge in -- but I
                    figured after that bombshell that got
                    laid on you today you could use some
                    good news?

                              DULANEY
                    You got something on the Coke?

          Biggs grins.

                              BIGGS
                    Do I?  I talked to one of the dealers
                    I put the word out to.  He's been
                    following the trial pretty closely.
                    He said at one time he wanted to be a
                    lawyer before he became a dealer.


                                                                      80

                              DULANEY
                    Charlie -- are you going to make a
                    point soon?

                              BIGGS
                    Right now.  Guess who's been buying
                    Coke from him for the last five and
                    half years?

          Dulaney shrugs his shoulders indicating he doesn't have a clue.

                              BIGGS
                    Marsh's secretary -- Joanne Braslow.

          Confusion fills Dulaney's face.


          INT.  COURTROOM - MORNING

          Court is in session.  Rebecca looks around the courtroom,
          trying to get a feel of the CROWD'S opinion.  Dulaney is not
          there.  She looks at the door anxiously.  The rooms waits.  A
          beat.  Dulaney enters -- sits beside Rebecca -- but acts as if
          she isn't there.


          INT.  COURTROOM - LATER

          Dulaney stands at the witness stand in front of an ORIENTAL MAN
          in his thirties.

                              DULANEY
                    Dr. Wong -- what type of medicine do
                    you practice?

                              DR. WONG
                    Oriental medicine.

                              DULANEY
                    --And is Miss Lawson a patient of
                    yours?

                              DR. WONG
                    Yes.  I've been seeing her for over a
                    year.

                              DULANEY
                    Why does she come to you?

                              DR. WONG
                    She suffers from severe menstrual
                    cramps.


                                                                      81

                              DULANEY
                    Did you ever prescribe any medication
                    for her cramps?

                              DR. WONG
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    What did you prescribe for her?

                              DR. WONG
                    Chinese peony root.

                              DULANEY
                    Would you describe for the court what
                    Chinese peony root looks like?

                              DR. WONG
                    It's a white powder that comes in a
                    vial.

          There is a MOAN from the CROWD.  Cardenas looks at Troxell.

                              DULANEY
                    How do you instruct your patients to
                    take it?

                              DR. WONG
                    I tell them to pour an amount the
                    size of a quarter into the their hand
                    and mix it with water.

                              DULANEY
                    A previous witness stated that she
                    saw Miss Lawson pouring a white
                    powder into her hand on October
                    twenty-eighth.  According to your
                    records when did you prescribe the
                    drug?

          Dr. Wong checks his records.

                              DR. WONG
                    October twenty-seventh.

                              DULANEY
                    One last question, Doctor.  If
                    someone didn't know better, would it
                    be easy to mistake the peony root for
                    cocaine?

                              DR. WONG
                    Yes -- quite easy.


                                                                      82

                              DULANEY
                         (to Cardenas)
                    Your witness.

          Cardenas realizes there is nothing to gain by examining this
          witness.

                              CARDENAS
                    No questions.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    You may call your next witness.

                              DULANEY
                    The defense calls Miss Margaret
                    Sellers.

          Cardenas looks worried as he watches an attractive woman in her
          mid twenties approach the stand.

          DULANEY AND MISS SELLERS

          Miss Sellers appears a little nervous.  Dulaney smiles warmly.

                              DULANEY
                    Miss Sellers, do you know Dr. Alan
                    Paley?

                              MISS SELLERS
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    Where did you meet him?

                              MISS SELLERS
                    I'm a nurse.  I used to work at
                    Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr.
                    Paley's on staff there.

                              DULANEY
                    What was the nature of your
                    relationship with Dr. Paley.

                              MISS SELLERS
                    We dated for about a month last year.

                              DULANEY
                    Then what happened?

                              MISS SELLERS
                    I realized he wasn't serious.  He was
                    seeing other women -- asking other
                    nurses at the hospital out, so I
                    ended it.


                                                                      83

                              DULANEY
                    -- And what did Dr. Paley do after
                    you stopped seeing him?

                              MISS SELLERS
                    He used to call me -- tell me that I
                    couldn't just walk out on him.  He
                    said that if I didn't come back he'd
                    make my life miserable.

                              DULANEY
                    Did he make your life miserable?

                              MISS SELLERS
                    Yes -- he did.

                              DULANEY
                    How?

          Cardenas stands again.

                              CARDENAS
                    Objection!  May I remind Mr. Dulaney
                    that the person on trial here is Miss
                    Lawson -- not Dr. Paley.

                              DULANEY
                    Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a
                    pattern in Dr. Paley's behavior with
                    women.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Objection overruled.  The witness
                    will answer the question.

                              MISS SELLERS
                    He'd call me in the middle of the
                    night.  Show up at my house and bang
                    on the door.  Finally after two weeks
                    I went to his office one day to tell
                    him to stop.

                              DULANEY
                    What did he say?

                              MISS SELLERS
                    He laughed -- and basically said he
                    would decide when it was over.

                              DULANEY
                    Do you remember his exact words?


                                                                      84

                              MISS SELLERS
                    Yes.  He said, "If you want to play
                    games, we'll play -- and you'll be
                    sorry."

          Another BUZZ from the CROWD.   Cardenas inwardly cringes.

                              DULANEY
                    What happened next?

                              MISS SELLERS
                    While I was seeing Dr. Paley I
                    mentioned to him one night that
                    someone was stealing drugs from the
                    third floor dispensary.   Three days
                    after I spoke to him in his office he
                    went to the Head Nurse and told her
                    he had witnessed me stealing drugs.

                              DULANEY
                    What happened?

                              MISS SELLERS
                    There was an inquiry.  It was his
                    word against mine.  They believed
                    him.  I was fired.


          INT.  DULANEY'S OFFICE - DUSK

          Dulaney is at his desk.  Biggs enters excited.

                              BIGGS
                    Joanne Braslow is getting more and
                    more interesting.  I followed her
                    today to an attorney's office.
                    Joseph Koehler.

                              DULANEY
                    Joe Koehler.  I know him.  He's an
                    estate attorney -- and he's very
                    expensive.

                              BIGGS
                    What would Joanne Braslow need with
                    an estate attorney?  She wasn't even
                    mentioned in Marsh's will.

          Dulaney thinks for a moment.  He grins as an idea enters his
          mind.

                              DULANEY
                    Not this will.


                                                                      85

          INT.  FILE ROOM - EVENING

          Dulaney and Biggs sit at a table going through a stack of
          papers.  Dulaney traces his finger along a piece of paper.

                              DULANEY
                    Here it is!  According to the old
                    will Joanne Braslow was to inherit
                    two hundred and fifty thousand
                    dollars.

                              BIGGS
                    What good does that do -- it's the
                    old will?

                              DULANEY
                    Under the law a person cannot profit
                    from their own wrong doing.  Since
                    Rebecca Lawson is the sole
                    beneficiary of the new will, if she
                    is found guilty the will is void and
                    Joanne Braslow could make a very good
                    case to have the old will reinstated.

                              BIGGS
                    She kills the old man and makes it
                    look like Miss Lawson did it.  Pretty
                    slick.


          INT.  DULANEY'S HOUSE, BATHROOM - EVENING

          Dulaney is washing up for dinner.  He speaks to Sharon who is
          in the bedroom.

                              DULANEY
                    I was thinking that when the trial is
                    over we'd all go skiing for a
                    weekend.

                              SHARON
                    Maybe it would be a good idea if you
                    just took Michael.

          Sharon leaves the room.  Dulaney reaches for his TOOTHBRUSH --
          picks up a TUBE of TOOTH PASTE.  It is empty.  He stares at the
          EMPTY TUBE.

                              DULANEY
                         (to himself)
                    Drug store.


          INT.  COURTROOM - MORNING


                                                                      86

          Dulaney looks worn, tired -- the tension between him and
          Rebecca shows.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Mr. Dulaney, are you ready to call
                    your next witness?

          Dulaney doesn't seem to hear him.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Mr. Dulaney, are you with us?

          Dulaney snaps out of it.

                              DULANEY
                    Yes, Your Honor.  The defense recalls
                    Joanne Braslow.

          As Joanne walks towards the stand Dulaney looks over at
          Rebecca.  It's as if he is trying to make up his mind about
          her.  Joanne takes her seat.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Miss Braslow, I'd like to remind you
                    that you are still under oath.

                              DULANEY
                    How often do you use cocaine?

          Cardenas shoots out of his seat.

                              CARDENAS
                    Objection, Your Honor.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                         (impatiently)
                    Counsel approach the bench.

          Dulaney and Cardenas walk over to the bench.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Mr. Dulaney, I'm getting tired of
                    seeing you this close to me.

          Judge Burnham looks at Cardenas indicating he will hear his
          argument now.

                              CARDENAS
                    Whether or not Miss Braslow uses
                    drugs is not an issue here.


                                                                      87

                              DULANEY
                    Your Honor -- the prosecution has
                    introduced cocaine as one of the
                    contributing reasons Mr. Marsh died.
                    How it may have been introduced into
                    the household is of vital importance.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Are you able to back up this
                    allegation -- or are you fishing?

                              DULANEY
                    I can back it up.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    You better.
                         (to Joanne)
                    Please answer the question.

                              JOANNE
                    I've tried it.

                              DULANEY
                    You've tried it?  Isn't it true that
                    you've been in and out of Rehab
                    centers for the last four years?

          This is clearly embarrassing for her.

                              JOANNE
                    I've been to a few -- yes.

                              DULANEY
                    You don't like Miss Lawson much do
                    you?

                              JOANNE
                         (hesitantly)
                    No.

                              DULANEY
                    You don't like her because you were
                    involved with Mr. Marsh before she
                    came along.  Isn't that true?

                              JOANNE
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    You resented the fact that she told
                    you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?

                              JOANNE
                    Yes.


                                                                      88

          Dulaney moves the questions along, quickening their pace,
          building a rhythm.

                              DULANEY
                    And you resented that he cared for
                    her in a way he once cared for you?

                              JOANNE
                         (breaking down)
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    --And that Mr. Marsh paid less
                    attention to you?

                              JOANNE
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    --and that he changed his will?

                              JOANNE
                    Yes.

          She has blurted out the answer before the full implications of
          the question has dawned on her.  Her face reveals her mistake.

          Cardenas can only watch uncomfortably from his seat.

                              DULANEY
                    In his previous will Mr. Marsh left
                    you two hundred and fifty thousand
                    dollars -- then he cut you out.  Why
                    do you think he did that?

                              JOANNE
                    She talked him into it.  She wanted
                    everything.

                              DULANEY
                    Two hundred and fifty thousand
                    dollars is a lot of money.  That must
                    have made you pretty angry?

                              JOANNE
                    Yes.

          Dulaney picks up a small PIECE OF PAPER and walks towards
          Joanne.

                              DULANEY
                    You testified that you returned to
                    Mr. Marsh's house at eleven o'clock
                    the night of his murder.  Is that
                    correct?

                                                                      89


                              JOANNE
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    Well - I'm a little confused.
                         (holds up the paper)
                    This is a charge receipt from Rosen's
                    Drug Store where Mr. Marsh had an
                    account.  It's dated the day of the
                    murder.
                         (hands it to her)
                    Is this your signature?

                              JOANNE
                         (nervously studies
                          it)
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    There's an item you picked up that's
                    marked.  Will you read it?

                              JOANNE
                    Dristan nasal spray.

                              DULANEY
                    Would you read for us the time of the
                    purchase?

                              JOANNE
                    Three fifteen.

                              DULANEY
                    A.M -- or P.M.?

                              JOANNE
                    P.M.

                              DULANEY
                    You see that's what bothers me.  No
                    other bottle of nasal spray was found
                    in the house.  The police looked.
                    There was only the one bottle.  But
                    you say you didn't arrive until after
                    Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he
                    was using the nasal spray prior to
                    his death.  How do you think it got
                    there?

                              JOANNE
                    I don't know.


                                                                      90

                              DULANEY
                    Isn't it true that you stopped by the
                    house after you left the drug store
                    and dropped off the items you bought?

                              JOANNE
                         (nervously)
                    No.

                              DULANEY
                    Isn't it true that you put the
                    cocaine in the bottle?

                              JOANNE
                    No!  Why would I want to kill him?

                              DULANEY
                    Because you were jealous.  Because he
                    cut you out of the will.  Because you
                    have a cocaine habit to feed --
                    because you know that if Rebecca
                    Lawson is found guilty the new will
                    is void -- and there's a very good
                    chance the old one would be honored.

          SILENCE fills the room.  Members of the JURY look at Rebecca,
          they are confused -- doubt fills their minds.

                              DULANEY
                    The defense rests.


          INT.  DULANEY'S DEN - EVENING

          Dark.  Dulaney is standing by the window, watching the RAIN
          FALL outside.  Sharon enters.

                              SHARON
                    We can't go on like this, Frank.

          Dulaney continues to stare out the window.

                              DULANEY
                    I know.

                              SHARON
                    Talk to me.

          He shakes his NO.

                              SHARON
                    Please -- this is ripping us apart.


                                                                      91

                              DULANEY
                         (emotionally)
                    I can't talk about it now.

          She senses his pain and moves to him, wrapping her arms around
          his shoulders.

                              SHARON
                    Don't shut me out.  Let me in.

          He turns and faces her.  She can see the pain on his face.

                              DULANEY
                    You wouldn't like what you'd see.
                    You don't know me anymore.  I don't
                    know me anymore.

                              SHARON
                    We can't pretend this isn't
                    happening.

                              DULANEY
                    Please -- not now.

                              SHARON
                    Why didn't you come to me?

                              DULANEY
                    I don't know.

                              SHARON
                    You used to like to touch me -- to
                    make love to me.

                              DULANEY
                    It's more involved than that.

                              SHARON
                    It was a place to start.

                              DULANEY
                    You think that's the answer?  Sex?
                    Is that what you want?  You want me
                    to make love to you?

                              SHARON
                    I don't want our lives ruined because
                    of this.  I love you, Frank.  I want
                    this to work -- but you have to help
                    me.  You have to come back from where
                    ever it is you are.


                                                                      92

          Dulaney's confusion and emotion begins to surface.  She kisses
          him, softly, gently.  Dulaney closes his eyes.  He kisses her
          harder - and harder.  His passion builds -- his anger grows.
          He runs his arm over his desk, brushing everything to the
          floor.

          He grabs her and firmly pushes her down on the desk.  He kisses
          her forcefully, his lips pressed hard against hers.  She
          struggles against him.  His hands tear at her blouse.  It is
          rough, angry sex and it frightens Sharon.

                              SHARON
                         (screaming)
                    Frank -- stop it!  Stop it!

                              DULANEY
                    Is this what you want -- huh?  Is it?

          She is crying now -- struggling futilely against him.

                              SHARON
                    Let me go!  Godammit, Frank let go!

                              MICHAEL (OS)
                         (racked with fear)
                    Daddy -- stop it!

          Dulaney stops and looks.

          Michael is standing in the doorway, his face filled with fear
          and incomprehension.  Tears streak down his face.

          Dulaney freezes as the full power of his actions overwhelm him.
          His face floods with anguish as he tries to grasp the total
          effect of his behavior.

                              DULANEY
                         (softly)
                    Oh -- Jesus.

          Filled with pain and embarrassment Dulaney runs from the room.


          EXT.  BAND SHELL, PARK - NIGHT

          RAIN falls in sheets.  Dulaney sits inside the small structure,
          huddled against one of the pillars.  He is a tragic figure,
          desperately trying to claw his way back to the world he once
          knew.



                                                                      93

          EXT.  DULANEY'S HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT

          RAIN continues to fall.  Dulaney is standing across the street,
          staring at the house.  He crosses over and is half way to the
          door when he stops.  He starts to leave.

          The front door opens and Sharon steps out onto the porch.

                              SHARON
                    Frank?

          He turns around slowly.  He can't bring himself to look at her.
          She walks out into the rain.  He lifts his head.  Tears flow
          down his face and he cries.  When she begins to cry with him
          he breaks down.

                              DULANEY
                         (ashamed)
                    I'm sorry.  God -- I'm so sorry.

          He slowly drops to his knees -- holding on to her as if she
          were a strong tree in a wind-storm.

                              DULANEY
                    Help me.  Please -- help me.


          INT.  COURTROOM - DAY

          Dulaney sits beside Rebecca. There is tension between them.  He
          does not look at her.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Mr. Dulaney.

          Dulaney stands and walks over to the jury.

                              DULANEY
                    The Prosecution's case is built on
                    theory -- speculation.  Could Rebecca
                    Lawson have done this?  Is it
                    possible that she did that? Where are
                    the facts?  The evidence.  The State
                    has presented two spurned lovers and
                    a jealous secretary.  Hardly what I
                    would call impartial witnesses.
                    Where is one shred of conclusive,
                    irrefutable evidence?  I don't see it
                    -- and I don't think you do either.
                    Do you know why?  Because there isn't
                    any.

                                                                      94

                         (beat)
                    What's the issue here?  That Rebecca
                    Lawson likes wild sex?  No.  But the
                    District Attorney is trying to make
                    you think if Rebecca Lawson could
                    stray from the path of normal,
                    accepted sexual behavior, then she
                    could be capable of murder.  Did she
                    force Andrew Marsh to make love to
                    her?  Did she hold a gun to his head?
                    No.  Andrew Marsh wanted her -- and
                    why wouldn't he?  She's beautiful,
                    alluring -- the type of woman men
                    dream about.

          As Dulaney continues we sense he is applying his closing
          arguments to himself.

                              DULANEY
                    It's human nature.  We want what we
                    want -- when we want it.  We don't
                    think about the consequences of our
                    actions.  When desire fills us we all
                    do things that we know are bad for
                    us.  We live for the moment.
                         (beat)
                    Here was an exciting young woman who
                    unlocked doors.  Doors that led into
                    a new world.  A world he entered
                    willingly -- eagerly.  He wanted to
                    please her -- and so, he did not tell
                    her of his illness.  I know it might
                    be difficult for you to understand
                    wanting something so badly that you
                    are willing to risk everything -- but
                    that's what passion does to you.
                    It's a fire -- uncontrollable.  It
                    consumes you -- and the only thing
                    you can do is let it burn.  Andrew
                    Marsh let it burn.  It was his life -
                    - his choice -- and maybe his mistake
                    -- but making love is not a crime.
                         (beat)
                    We all have fires inside us -- secret
                    desires.  We guard them --hold them
                    in the cages that we've built.  When
                    someone comes along and opens the
                    gate, they rush out and feed blindly
                    on their pleasure.  Rebecca Lawson
                    loved Andrew Marsh.  She didn't kill
                    him -- if anything did, it was his
                    own passion.


                                                                      95

          Dulaney walks back to his table and sits down.  Rebecca looks
          at him warmly.  Dulaney does not look at her.  Cardenas stands
          to address the jury.

                              CARDENAS
                    It's true -- we all have fires
                    burning inside us.  Rebecca Lawson
                    was very aware of the fire burning
                    inside Andrew Marsh -- and she stoked
                    those flames -- fanning them until
                    they burned so hot that reason and
                    judgement left him.  Is making love a
                    crime?  Of course not -- but the
                    question isn't as simple as that.
                    Rebecca Lawson used her seductive
                    qualities to entice Andrew Marsh.
                    She used sex as a catalyst and
                    cocaine as the terminus.  The
                    combination of the two provided the
                    conclusion of a premeditated act.
                         (beat)
                    She asked Dr. Paley about cocaine.
                    Her fingerprints were found on the
                    nasal spray bottle that contained the
                    cocaine -- and she was the sole
                    beneficiary of Andrew Marsh's will.
                    She planned it from beginning to end.
                    She knew about his heart.  She
                    secretly administered cocaine, then
                    used wild and physically demanding
                    sex to induce a heart attack.
                         (beat)
                    Making love is an act of passion
                    between two people to affirm their
                    vows of love.  This was not an act of
                    love -- this was an act of greed.
                    This was betrayal.  Rebecca Lawson
                    killed Andrew Marsh -- and I'm
                    counting on you to punish her for
                    that crime.


          INT.  WAITING ROOM, COURTHOUSE - DAY

          Dulaney sits on one side of the room -- Rebecca on the other.
          The room is quiet -- tense.  A MAN enters and nods to him.

                              DULANEY
                         (to man)
                    They're back already?  It's only been
                    three hours.



                                                                      96

          INT.  COURTROOM - DAY

          Dulaney sits beside Rebecca.  In the row behind them is Sattler
          and Biggs.

          The JURY enters.  Their faces betray nothing.  One by one they
          file into their seats.

          Cardenas sits with Troxell -- both of them watching anxiously.

                              JUDGE BURNHAM
                    Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
                    have you reached a verdict?

          The JURY FOREMAN stands.

                              JURY FOREMAN
                    We have, Your Honor.

          The BAILIFF walks over and takes the VERDICT SLIP from the
          FOREMAN, then walks over to Judge Burnham and hands it to him.
          Judge Burnham reads the decision.  He hands it back to the
          Bailiff who takes it to the COURT CLERK.

          ON REBECCA

          She waits nervously for the Court Clerk to read the verdict.

          ON CARDENAS

          he taps his pen against the desk anxiously.

          ON THE COURT CLERK

          He opens the verdict slip and looks at it.  He stands slowly.

                              COURT CLERK
                    The jury finds the defendant -- not
                    guilty.

          Relief floods Rebecca's face.  Dulaney shows no emotion.
          Sattler and Biggs shakes hands, then lean forward to
          congratulate Dulaney.

          Rebecca turns to Dulaney to hug him -- before she can, Dulaney
          has picked up his briefcase and is leaving the courtroom.


          INT.  UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON

          Dulaney walks towards his car with Biggs.  There is no sense of
          victory or elation.

                              BIGGS
                    What are you gonna do now?

                                                                      97


                              DULANEY
                    Take some time off.

                              BIGGS
                    You think the D.A.'s gonna file on
                    Joanne?

                              DULANEY
                    I don't know.

          Dulaney reaches his car.

                              DULANEY
                    You did a good job, Charlie.

                              BIGGS
                    Thanks, Mister D.

          Biggs walks away.  Dulaney takes out his keys, opens the door
          to his car.  He is about to get in when he senses someone
          behind him.  He turns around.

          Joanne steps out from behind a pillar.  She stares at Dulaney
          hatefully.  Her hand is inside her purse.

                              JOANNE
                    That bastard should have left me
                    something.  I worked for him for six
                    years -- and he goes and gives it all
                    to her.

          Dulaney looks around the parking lot.  He is alone.  Joanne is
          obviously very high on something.  Her mind seems to wander,
          her eyes drift.

                              JOANNE
                    You take what people say and make it
                    ugly.  You make others believe what
                    you want them to.  She should have
                    been found guilty.  She shouldn't
                    have gotten off.

                              DULANEY
                    Then you would have gotten your
                    money?

                              JOANNE
                    Yes.

                              DULANEY
                    You killed him -- didn't you, Joanne?


                                                                      98

                              JOANNE
                    Do you think if I did I'd be stupid
                    enough to tell you?

          Dulaney looks her hand fidgeting in her purse.

                              DULANEY
                    What do you have in your purse?

                              JOANNE
                    What do you think I've got?  A gun?
                    Maybe I'm gonna kill you too.  Maybe
                    I'll blow your head off right now.

          Her hand starts to come out of the purse.  Suddenly, Biggs
          appears, rushing her from behind a pillar.  He grabs her hand
          and pushes her against a car.

          He pulls her hand from the purse.  She is holding a piece of
          paper.

                              JOANNE
                         (crying)
                    I'm gonna go to jail.  I know they're
                    gonna make it look like I did it.
                    They gotta put it on someone.

                              DULANEY
                    Why'd you come here?

                              JOANNE
                         (holds up the letter)
                    To show you this.  It's a letter from
                    that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to
                    me the day after I saw him.  He's the
                    one who told me I could get the money
                    if Miss Lawson went to jail.

                              DULANEY
                    You didn't know about it before that?

                              JOANNE
                    No.

          Dulaney is suddenly very confused.

                              DULANEY
                    Then why did you go see Mr. Koehler
                    in the first place?

                              JOANNE
                    Because he called me.

          Dulaney is stunned.  He looks at Biggs with a knowing stare.


                                                                      99


          EXT.  HOUSE - EVENING

          It is RAINING lightly.  Dulaney waits at the door of a nice two
          story home.  It is answered by a heavy-set man in his fifties,
          JOSEPH KOEHLER.

                              DULANEY
                    Hi, Joe.

                              KOEHLER
                    Frank -- what are you doing here?

                              DULANEY
                    I need to ask you a question.  What
                    made you get in touch with Joanne
                    Braslow?

                              KOEHLER
                    You know I can't talk about that.

                              DULANEY
                    I'm not asking for names or
                    specifics.  I just want to know what
                    prompted you to make the call?

                              KOEHLER
                    Sorry.

          Koehler starts to close the door, Dulaney sticks his foot
          inside, blocking it.  His face is filled with determination.
          Koehler sees it.

                              DULANEY
                    Please -- I need your help.

          Koehler thinks for a moment.  He can sense Dulaney's need.

                              KOEHLER
                    All I can tell you is I was contacted
                    by an interested party on Miss
                    Braslow's behalf.


          INT.  DULANEY'S CAR - NIGHT

          Dulaney stares through the windshield, straining to see the
          road through the heavy rain.  His CAR PHONE RINGS.

                              DULANEY
                    Hello?

                              REBECCA (VO)
                    Frank -- It's Rebecca.  I need to see
                    you right away.  I've got the tape.

                                                                      100


          A calmness spreads over his face.

                              DULANEY
                    I'll be right there.


          EXT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          RAIN FALLS.  LIGHTNING fills the sky.  Dulaney drives up --
          finds a PARKING SPOT down the street --  gets out of his car
          and runs to the door.  As he KNOCKS as loud CLAP on THUNDER
          BOOMS overhead.  Dulaney waits impatiently.  He lifts the
          FLOWER POT, removes the key and opens the door.


          INT.  DEN - NIGHT

          The dim glow of a DESK LAMP is the only source of light.
          Dulaney moves through the room slowly.

                              DULANEY
                    Rebecca?

          Two CHAMPAGNE BOTTLES are on the floor by the couch.  Dulaney
          looks on the coffee table.

          HIS POV - COFFEE TABLE

          A VIAL is open and on its side.  A RAZOR BLADE and STRAW lay
          next to it.  A pile of WHITE POWDER has been dumped out.
          Several lines of cocaine have been drawn.

          Dulaney starts to move towards the living room.  He is almost
          at the door when the BIG SCREEN TELEVISION TURNS ON.  We see
          the tape of Dulaney and Rebecca making love.

                              REBECCA (OS)
                    Is this what you're looking for,
                    Frank?

          Dulaney turns around to find Rebecca standing behind him, a
          remote control in her hand.

                              DULANEY
                         (distant)
                    You killed him.  You killed him --
                    and I got you off.

                              REBECCA
                    That's crazy.


                                                                      101

                              DULANEY
                    Is it?  Joanne Braslow was perfect,
                    wasn't she?  You knew we'd see her on
                    the tape and find out about her coke
                    problem.  After that, the digging
                    should have been easy -- but we
                    missed the will.  You knew we were
                    following her, so you called Koehler
                    and had him contact her.  That put us
                    right back on track.  All we needed
                    then was to prove that she had an
                    opportunity.  The drug store took
                    care of that.  She dropped off the
                    stuff and you came back and killed
                    him.  Didn't you?

          She shrugs her shoulders.  His frustration clearly amuses her.
          She grins slightly, almost taunting him.

                              DULANEY
                    I want the tape.

          Dulaney starts into the living room.

                              REBECCA
                    I've been thinking about that.  I've
                    decided to give it to you after I've
                    collected the inheritance.  You can
                    take that one if you want -- but
                    there's another copy.

                              DULANEY
                    That wasn't the deal.

                              REBECCA
                         (provoking him)
                    So, sue me.
                         (as cold as ice)
                    Things have changed.  I think you
                    should go home -- and after you leave
                    I see no reason for us to ever have
                    contact again.

                              DULANEY
                         (growing angrier)
                    I'm not leaving without that tape.

                              REBECCA
                    Don't push me, Frank.  I might lose
                    my temper and send it out just for
                    spite.

          Dulaney loses control.


                                                                      102

                              DULANEY
                    You fuckin' bitch!

          He grabs her by the shoulders and pushes her into the wall.
          Rebecca struggles, but it is little use -- he is a man consumed
          with rage.  Dulaney continues to smash her into the wall.

          Rebecca reaches onto the desk -- lifts up a FOUNTAIN PEN and
          stabs it into Dulaney's shoulder at the base of his neck.
          Dulaney SCREAMS and lets go.  Rebecca starts to runs into the
          living room.  Dulaney follows.


          INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Dulaney catches Rebecca -- grabs her -- spins her around --
          then backhands her across the face, knocking her to the ground.
          In the b.g. the VIDEO of them in bed plays on the screen.
          Dulaney sits on top of her and grabs her by the hair.  He
          repeatedly smashes her head onto the floor.

                              MAN'S VOICE
                    Let her go!

          Dulaney stops.  He looks behind him.

          HIS POV

          Standing in the bedroom doorway is Dr. Paley.  He is holding a
          GUN at Dulaney.

          Dulaney stares at him with disbelief as he staggers to his
          feet, his hand holding the wound on his shoulder.  A short,
          breathless LAUGH drifts out of Dulaney as he starts to put it
          all together.  Rebecca stands up, holding her head as she tries
          to catch her breath.

                              DR. PALEY
                         (to Rebecca)
                    Are you alright?

          Rebecca NODS.  Her face hardens.

                              REBECCA
                    You've got to kill him, Alan.

                              DR. PALEY
                    What?


                                                                      103

                              DULANEY
                    She's right, Paley.  You've got to
                    kill me.  She doesn't have to --
                    she's free -- she can't be tried
                    again -- but you, you planned it with
                    her.  You supplied the Coke.  You're
                    an accessory to murder.

                              REBECCA
                    Shoot him.

          Paley struggles to make a decision.  The gun shakes in his
          hand.  Suddenly, the whole scheme becomes clear to Dulaney.

                              DULANEY
                    Don't you see what she's doing?  She
                    needs you to kill me.  She's planned
                    it that way from the start.  That's
                    why she phoned me tonight.

                              DR. PALEY
                    You called him?

                              REBECCA
                    No -- he's lying.

                              DULANEY
                    How's it supposed to work Rebecca?
                    You and Paley celebrate your victory.
                    You get me over here and provoke a
                    fight so he has to rush in and save
                    you -- but then he's given himself
                    away as your accomplice -- now he has
                    to kill me.
                         (to Paley)
                    After that I figure she'll tell the
                    Police that you broke in.  That you
                    were crazed because we humiliated you
                    in court?

                              REBECCA
                    Don't listen to him.  Can't you see
                    he's trying to turn you against me.

                                                                      104


                              DULANEY
                         (continuing; to
                          Paley)
                    Here's the good part.  The truth dies
                    with me and she turns State's
                    evidence against you.  It won't
                    matter what you say.  No one will
                    believe your version -- you've
                    already discredited yourself in
                    court.  You'll go away forever and
                    she'll have the money all for
                    herself.  She's played us both
                    perfectly.

          Paley is becoming more and more confused.  Dulaney moves
          towards him.  Paley lowers the gun slightly.

                              REBECCA
                    Alan, listen to me.  If you don't
                    kill him it's over.  Everything we
                    did will be for nothing.

                              DR. PALEY
                    Shut up, Rebecca.

                              DULANEY
                    She's good isn't she?  But maybe with
                    you it's the real thing.
                         (points to the
                          screen)
                    I'm sure all those nights she was
                    fuckin' me she was thinking of you.

          Confusion crowds Paley's mind.

                              DULANEY
                    I'm sure that every orgasm she had
                    with me was faked.

                              DR. PALEY
                    That's enough.

                              DULANEY
                    I mean she only screwed me two or
                    three times a night because she had
                    to -- I'm sure she didn't enjoy it.

                              REBECCA
                         (softly)
                    I love you, Alan.  You have to
                    believe I love you.  Kill him!  Kill
                    him and we can be together forever!


                                                                      105

                              DULANEY
                    That's right, she loves you.  Just
                    like she loved Roston and Marsh and
                    me.  Don't be a fool.  You're nothing
                    to her.  The second you pull that
                    trigger she'll turn on you.

          Betrayal fills Paley's face.  His eyes fill with tears.

                              DR. PALEY
                         (to Rebecca)
                    I loved you.

                              REBECCA
                         (tense)
                    Alan, don't let him do this.  You're
                    everything to me.
                         (she moves closer)
                    Give me the gun.  Give me the gun and
                    I'll do it for you.

          Paley stares at her -- his mind races.  Pain fills his face as
          he fights to make a decision.  Suddenly, his face tenses.  He
          starts to raise the gun at Dulaney -- then just as suddenly he
          turns it on Rebecca and FIRES.

          The bullet hits Rebecca in the chest.  The force blows her off
          her feet.

          Paley stares at her blankly.  He slowly lowers the gun and
          drops it to the floor, then staggers over to Rebecca.

          ON REBECCA

          she stares up through glazed, dead eyes.

          Paley takes her pulse.  He breaks down, weeping over her body,
          his tears signaling to Dulaney that she is dead.


          EXT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT

          Police cars are lined up outside, their RED LIGHTS FLASHING.


          INT.  REBECCA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Members of the POLICE FORCE, along with FORENSIC PEOPLE go over
          the area.  Dulaney sits on the couch.  He looks indifferent --
          as if all emotion has been sucked out of him.  Troxell is
          beside him, taking notes.  Dulaney looks up.

          A BODYBAG on a stretcher is being wheeled out of the room.


                                                                      106

          Dulaney follows it with his eyes.  Cardenas enters from the
          bedroom.  They lock eyes.

                              CARDENAS
                    Paley's confessed to the whole thing.
                    It's like he's got no will to live
                    now that she's gone.
                         (thinks for a moment)
                    She almost got away with it.  Ironic,
                    huh?  Do you believe in karma, Frank?

          Dulaney doesn't answer.

                              CARDENAS
                    Well -- call it what you want.  Fate.
                    Destiny.  We usually get what we
                    deserve in the end.

          A beat.  Dulaney looks at him wearily.

                              DULANEY
                    Can I go?

                              CARDENAS
                         (to Troxell)
                    You get his statement?

                              TROXELL
                    Yeah.

                              CARDENAS
                    Then you can go.

          Dulaney gets up and starts for the door.  Cardenas watches him.

                              CARDENAS
                    Frank?

          Dulaney turns around slowly.  Cardenas reaches into his
          RAINCOAT pocket and take out a VHS TAPE.

                              CARDENAS
                    I found this video in her room.  It
                    has your name on it.

          The two men lock eyes.  There is a long silence between them.
          Dulaney waits for Cardenas' next move.

                              CARDENAS
                         (holding it out)
                    I assume it's yours.

     Dulaney knows that Cardenas has seen it.  A hint of a grateful
     smile shows on his face.  He takes the tape.


                                                                      107

                              DULANEY
                    Thanks.


     EXT.  REBECCA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     A light RAIN falls.  Dulaney walks out and heads towards the
     street.  He stops -- looks back at the condo -- then walks down
     the street towards his car.


     FADE TO BLACK

THE BODYGUARD

 Written by LAWRENCE KASDAN



   Clean Shooting Draft

       February 1992




  FOR EDUCATIONAL
   PURPOSES ONLY

    SCREEN IS BLACK
    In the darkness we hear dripping water, the echoing
    approach of two sets of footsteps. There is the sound of
    a sudden, quick scuffle, a heavy fall of bodies.
    THREE BOOMING GUNSHOTS. Two from one gun, one from
    another. So fast and close, they're barely distinguish-
    able. The sound of the SHOTS ECHOES against concrete
    walls and dies away. Silence.
    SLOW, SLOW, FADE IN:

1   INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE (NEW YORK) - NIGHT                   1

    FRANK FARMER'S FACE -
    mid to late 30s, peers intently over a smoking gun.     He
    is The Bodyguard.
    ANGLE - HIT MAN
    dead on his  feet, leans against a car. A gun drops
    heavily from  his hand. His life ebbs as he slides slowly
    down the car  door to his knees then falls forward, face
    down on the  cement floor.
    A SLOW PULL BACK reveals that FRANK is lying on top of
    KLINGMAN. Protectively pressed body to body on the
    filthy cement floor of the garage. Klingman, a handsome,
    50-year-old arbitrageur, gasps in barely controlled fear
    as his Armani suit soaks up a black pool of oil. There
    is no movement.
    The two men are lying near the right front fender of a
    black limousine. Blood spreads from the body of the hit
    man, a few yards away. Klingman starts to raise himself
    up but Farmer keeps him pressed to the floor, still
    alert for any further threat.
    MAIN TITLES BEGIN.
    A beat, and VOICES are heard O.S.   Farmer wheels, snub-
    nosed .357 aimed at them.
                            FRANK
               Freeze!
    ANGLE - DOORWAY TO GARAGE
    A uniformed chauffeur freezes in his tracks.   Farmer
    lowers his weapon and speaks.
                            FRANK
                      (calm, but an order)
               Call 911.

                                                                     2.


     CAMERA has CRANED UP TO a high, almost-frozen WIDE SHOT of
     the scene. It TRACKS AWAY INTO darkness.

2    EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT                                   2

     Passing traffic reveals the storefront of a TV showroom.
     Inside, behind the reflections of the city lights, all
     the TV sets are showing the same picture, the glittering
     image of a woman singing. (We will recognize the woman
     as Rachel Marron.) We cut tighter and tighter on the
     image until it is almost broken up into its scanning
     lines. Through the city noise comes the sound of her
     song "I have Nothing."


2A   INT. DAN'S APARTMENT - DESK TOP - NIGHT                    2A
     A battered old desk.  Scattered across the top -- a pile
     of blank white paper, a jar of glue, a stack of
     magazines, a pair of scissors, a TV remote control,
     softly in the b.g., a TV is playing the same image we saw
     in the store window, the same song.
     Hands appear. Male hands. They open a drawer and remove
     a pair of translucent rubber gloves. Carefully they put the
     gloves on. The SNAPPING of the rubber is the only sound.
     The hands pick a magazine off the stack: Screen Stars.
     They put the magazine down and pick up the scissors. A
     headline on the cover reads: "RACHEL MARRON'S GREATEST
     TRIUMPH!" The scissors start to cut. Meticulously they
     excise the name "RACHEL MARRON" from the page. With the
     care of a surgeon.

3    EXT. HOLLYWOOD PREMIERE - NIGHT                            3
     A tumultuous crash of screaming, pushing bodies. Arms
     stretch out, cameras flash, sunguns flare, microphones
     are thrust forward. A deafening cacophony of "Rachel!
     Rachel! Rachel! Over here! Over here! This way,
     Rachel! Rachel! Rachel!" We cannot see the object of
     this frenzy. We catch a brief glimpse of an attractive,
     well-dressed young woman (NICKI), exiting with the other
     celebrities, as she is pushed and casually jostled aside
     by the mass of surging fans and media. Her face is calm
     and impassive as she watches from the sidelines.

5    INT. KLINGMAN'S OFFICE DEN - NIGHT                         5
     In a paneled room tastefully hung with a few choice paint-
     ings that reflect Klingman's success as an arbitrageur,
     he pours two snifters of brandy as he speaks with Farmer.

                                                                   3.

                          KLINGMAN
             Your hands ever shake, Frank?
                           FRANK
             Sometimes.   It's just adrenaline.
                          KLINGMAN
             ... How did you know?
                          FRANK
             I saw him washing the car.
                          KLINGMAN
             I saw him.
                          FRANK
             They don't wash cars on the
             parking levels.
    He hands a glass of brandy to Frank, who looks at it.
                          KLINGMAN
             You know, I'd like you to stay on.
    He passes a small sealed envelope to Frank.
                          FRANK
             I'm not good in permanent
             positions, my feet go to sleep.
    The two men smile at each other. They raise their glasses
    in a joint salutation -- Klingman drinks. Frank doesn't.

6   INT. DARKENED ROOM - DESK TOP - NIGHT                      6
    The rubber-gloved hands are glueing the word "TIME" onto
    a message that is taking the classic form of a ransom
    note. Each word has been cut from a different page and
    is in a different typeface. The note is being assembled
    with such care that it has an unusually neat appearance
    and is quite easy to read. It reads:
             MARRON BITCH -- YOU HAVE EVERYTHING
             I HAVE NOTHING. THE TIME TO DIE IS ...

7   EXT. CHARITY CONCERT - EVENING                             7
    A blur of hands and faces. Excited fans. Pieces of paper,
    autograph books, notes are thrust forward INTO the CAMERA.
    Again, a mass chanting "Rachel! Rachel! Rachel!"
    Hands of Rachel's entourage accept some of the proffered
    items.
    In CLOSEUP, we see Rachel's hands signing "Best wishes,

                                                                     4.

     Rachel Marron" on an out-stretched open palm. In the
     midst of the urgent forest of hands and paper, a be-
     ribboned black doll is thrust forward, bearing the legend
     "RACHEL, WE LOVE YOU."

8    EXT. FRANK FARMER'S HOUSE - EVENING                        8

     SLAM of a CAR DOOR. Frank gets out of a cab with two
     suitcases. His house is a modest stucco affair on a
     small lot. He goes up the walk and puts down his suit-
     cases. He looks at rampant foliage and overgrown grass.
     Supermarket circulars cover his doorstep. He picks up a
     few and fishes a bunch of keys from his pocket. A
     curious neighbor peers from behind a net curtain. As the
     door opens, we are aware of a further pile of mail
     inside. Frank's feet push the letters aside and go
     inside. The door shuts.

10   INT. FARMER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT                              10
     Farmer has carefully set a place for himself at the table
     in a breakfast nook. A bottle of red wine is open with a
     glass beside it.
     At the stove he stirs and flavors a Boeuf Bourgignon and
     reads a Time magazine. He adds a splash of wine. He
     lifts the pot from the stove and tries a piece of meat.
     At the table, he looks at the place setting and absently
     eats another piece of meat. Finally he sets the pot on
     the plate and eats from it directly while glancing
     through the magazine.

11   INT. DRESSING ROOM - CLOSEUP - CORNER OF DRESSING TABLE    11
     Lots of people are schmoozing in the dressing room.
     There's a loud buzz of excited chatter. Hands are stack-
     ing flowers, good luck messages, cards and cables by the
     mirror. Through the blur and bustle, we glimpse the doll
     with its embroidered ribbon message "RACHEL, WE LOVE YOU."
     Hands casually move it to one side, among the flowers
     resting on the small portable TV set. On the screen is
     an image of Rachel performing on stage, acknowledging
     applause, bowing.
     The doll EXPLODES, SHATTERING the TV, the MIRROR and the
     LIGHT BULBS.
     The SCREEN GOES BLACK, amid SHOUTS, SCREAMS and
     CONFUSION.
     TITLES END.

                                                                      5.


12   EXT. FRANK FARMER'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY                 12
     Frank lounges in his shorts under the single tree, sun-
     glasses on, a glass of iced tea by his side. Strains of
     "DON'T WALK AWAY RENEE" come from a beat-up transistor
     RADIO.

     An old-fashioned lawn sprinkler lazily waves water back
     and forth over the freshly cut grass.  Throwing knives
     lay scattered nearby. A wooden post is  sticking out of
     the ground in front of the fence at the back of the yard.
     BILL DEVANEY, fiftyish, a distinguished-looking black
     gentleman, stands nearby trying to engage Frank in a
     conversation that up to this point hasn't been going well.
     He's Rachel's personal manager.
                           DEVANEY
              So, you won't protect Rachel Marron
              just because she's in show business?
                           FRANK
              I don't do celebrities.
                           DEVANEY
              But the biggest money's in show
              business people.
     Frank says nothing. His  eyes are  closed behind the sun-
     glasses. Devaney picks  up one of  the throwing knives.
     He holds it carefully by the blade  and throws it. It
     misses the post by three feet and  clatters against the
     fence.
     Frank opens his eyes, sees what's going on and closes his
     eyes again.
                           DEVANEY
                     (picking up another
                      knife)
              Do you really do these things?
                           FRANK
              Isn't she the one who collects
              dolls?
     This is enough to distract Devaney from his knife-throwing.
                           DEVANEY
                     (exasperated)
              Farmer, Rachel Marron is one of the
              most famous people in America. She's
              won every music award invented. She's
              got the number one song in the country
              right now and she'll probably be
              nominated for an Oscar in her very

                                                           6.

         first picture. And you want to know
         'Isn't she the one...?' Christ,
         man, where've you been?
                      FRANK
         You mean she doesn't collect dolls?

                        DEVANEY
                  (defeated)
         Yes.    She collects dolls.
                      FRANK
         I thought I knew who she was.
Devaney tries to size up whether Frank is kidding him or
not. Frank's face betrays nothing. Devaney gestures with
a knife.
                      DEVANEY
         You're probably deadly with these
         things, aren't you?
                       FRANK
         Deadly.
                       DEVANEY
         Show me.
Frank doesn't move.
                      DEVANEY
         Why are you resisting this job?
         $2,000 bucks a week.
                (no response)
         $2,500.
                      FRANK
         There are several good men
         available for that kind of money.
         Have you talked to Fitzgerald or
         Racine? Portman?
                       DEVANEY
         Yeah.   Portman was interested...
He senses an opening and sits down beside Frank for what
he takes to be the first serious talk.
                      DEVANEY
         ... but we're told you're the best.
                      FRANK
         There's no such thing.
                      DEVANEY
         Farmer, we're talking about a
         very frightened lady. With a

                                                                 7.

         seven-year old son. Believe me,
         I wouldn't be here if I didn't
         think this was for real.
                (long pause)
         Farmer, she begged me to get you.
Frank sits up finally and looks at Devaney a long time.
He picks up five throwing knives and stands up.
                      FRANK
         All right. I'll come and I'll look
         the situation over. If I take it,
         it's three thousand a week.
                      DEVANEY
                (whistles)
         Okay. You must be very deadly
         for three grand a week.
Frank is now about twenty feet from the wooden post.     He
throws one of the knives. It misses the post and
clatters against the fence.
                        FRANK
         Shit.
Devaney's face drops.   Frank examines the next knife.
                      FRANK
                (mumbling)
         I know it's something like...
The second knife gets away from him at the top of his arc
and disappears into some bushes about three feet from
Devaney. Devaney stands up in a hurry and moves behind
Frank.
                        FRANK
         Sorry.
Frank raises his hand to throw again, then stops and
motions Devaney off to the side.
                      FRANK
         Better not stand right behind me.
Devaney smiles weakly. Frank lets the third knife go
with one smooth motion.
The knife sinks an inch into the center of the post.     THUMP.
Frank's hand arching again.     Throwing the remaining knives.
Both knives stick in the post forming a straight vertical
line with the first one.

                                                                     8.

13   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - WAVERLY LANE (BEL AIR) - DAY          13
     Frank stops his nondescript Chevy across the quiet street
     from the closed, unmanned gate at the bottom of the Marron
     driveway.
     FRANK'S POV

     as he looks over the gate, the wall, the heavy vegetation
     and the rising grounds beyond.
     (NOTE: The use of the term FRANK'S POV, is not to be
     taken simply as a camera direction. Rather, it re-
     presents a recurring attempt to make the audience see in
     the special way Frank sees. Frank lives by constant
     vigilance, heightened awareness. It is his genius and
     his burden. The audience must be put in the position of
     looking, searching, scanning with him.)
     He has a curious sense of being watched, a kind of prick-
     ling on the back of his neck. As he looks around, a
     black Toyota 4X4, parked some way down the road, drives
     rapidly off -- too fast to get a clear look. He watches
     it go.
     Frank pulls up   to the gate and gets out of his car. He
     grabs a bar of   the gate and pulls. The whole gate
     rattles. Frank    gets back in his car and pushes a button
     on the intercom   box at the side of the gate. A MAN'S
     VOICE CRACKLES   out of the BOX. Transmission is terrible.
                             MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
              Yes?
                           FRANK
              Frank Farmer to see Miss Marron.
                             MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
              What?
                           FRANK
              Alexander Graham Bell to see Miss
              Marron!
                           MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
                     (obviously has not heard)
              Have you got an appointment?
                           FRANK
              The atomic number of zinc is 30.
                             MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
              All right.
     There is a LOUD BUZZING and the gate swings arthritically
     open.

                                                                     9.


14   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - DRIVEWAY - DAY                        14
     FRANK'S POV
     as he moves up the winding drive through heavily land-
     scaped grounds. Plenty of potential hiding places. The
     mansion is at the top of the hill. The grounds behind
     the mansion fall away.

15   EXT. MANSION - CIRCULAR DRIVE/ENTRANCE AREA - DAY          15
     The mansion is huge. On and on it goes. Frank drives
     PAST the garage area where HENRY, the chauffeur, is
     polishing the mascot on the limousine. One of his arms
     is bandaged. Henry peers at Frank, puts down his cloth
     and walks toward the entrance where Frank is parking.
     Frank gets out, looks around. A painter's truck is
     parked nearby, two painters unloading equipment from it.
                           HENRY
              Can I help you?
                           FRANK
              Are you the man on the intercom?
                            HENRY
              No.   Can I help you?
                           FRANK
              My name is Edison. I have an
              appointment with Miss Marron.
                            HENRY
              Oh.   And that was arranged by...?
                           FRANK
                     (impressed)
              Mr. Devaney.
                           HENRY
              Go right ahead, Mr. Edison.
                           FRANK
              What happened to your arm?
                           HENRY
                     (looking at his arm)
              A doll.
     He goes back to the limousine.
     Frank RINGS the DOORBELL, although the door is not shut.
     EMMA, a fiftyish housekeeper, appears. A man in cover-
     alls comes out past her, carrying a length of timber.

                                                                     10.

                           FRANK
              Henry Ford, to see Mr. Devaney.
                           EMMA
              Come in, please.


16   INT. MARRON MANSION - DAY                                  16
     Frank steps into the foyer with Emma. She is a warm,
     matronly woman who does a fine job running the house
     without standing on custom.
                           EMMA
              I'll tell you quite honestly,
              Mr. Ford, I don't know where
              Mr. Devaney is. Did he say he'd
              be here?
                           FRANK
              Yes.
                           EMMA
              Then he probably is.   Let me look.
     She leads Frank into a large, unused formal parlor. There
     are dustsheets over the furniture and the walls are being
     repainted. On a number of TV screens scattered around,
     Rachel's latest video (the one we saw in the opening
     titles) is continuously playing. The sound of the song
     itself -- "I HAVE NOTHING" -- comes softly from concealed
     speakers.
                            EMMA
               Please make yourself at home. Can
               I get you anything?
     Frank demurs and Emma disappears back through the foyer.
     Frank watches her go, then moves off into the house in
     the opposite direction. It's obviously undergoing a
     major redecoration. Painters, decorators and designers
     come and go, oblivious to Frank's presence.

17   INT. MARRON MANSION - VARIOUS ROOMS - DAY                  17
     The deeper Frank walks into the house, the warmer and
     more lived-in rooms appear.

18   INT. MARRON MANSION - SUN ROOM - DAY                       18
     Frank steps into a tiled room that overlooks the pool
     area. One wall is all glass. On the opposite wall are
     shelves containing the trophies of Rachel Marron's career:
     A Tony award, three Grammy's, gold and platinum records,
     other statuettes and plaques. Among the framed photo-
     graphs of Rachel accepting awards etc., is one of her and

                                                                     11.

     her small son, FLETCHER, dressed in a tuxedo. Both are
     goofing off for the camera with obvious affection. Frank
     looks down at the pool.
     FRANK'S POV
     Dwarfed by the pool, the only person in sight is seven-
     year old Fletcher, the little boy from the photograph,
     dark-haired and fragile. He is crouched at the side of
     the pool with the remote control unit for a foot-long
     speedboat which is cutting across the water. A nanny
     sits, some way off, embroidering.
     Frank's attention is distracted. A heavier BASS MUSICAL
     BEAT comes from somewhere nearby in the house, another
     Rachel Marron number, but this time up-tempo and bouncy.
     Frank follows the sound.

19   INT. FAMILY ROOM - DAY                                     19
     Frank walks into the rear of the room that the noise is
     coming from.
     It is large and comfortable with plenty of seating, a
     bar, a wall of stereo gear and a projection booth. It
     is packed with people, props and video equipment. There
     is lots of activity, a general air of barely-organized
     chaos. MUSIC BLARES out.
     A group of six dancers, is rehearsing an energetic dance
     number for a music video, directed by their choreographer
     RORY. Sunlight throws them in a silhouette against the
     glass wall at the end of the room. A video cameraman
     circles them, taping the rehearsal, which appears on a
     large-screen TV behind them.
     In one corner, a pretty black girl is being pinned into a
     proposed costume for the video. Several people are stand-
     ing around, tending to the video and playback gear. All
     the chairs face the far end of the room and it isn't
     immediately apparent how many more people are hidden among
     the big cushions.
     As Frank sits on the barstool at the back, a large swivel
     chair turns to reveal Devaney. He waves to Frank and
     makes his way over to him.
     On the other side of the room, a brawny, heavyset man in his
     late thirties rises to look at Frank. He has a twenty inch
     neck. Devaney signals to him  that everything is all right.
     The brawny man looks at Frank a moment more, then sits down.
     Frank looks around the room. A shelf laden with vitamins.
     Guitars of various makes. A flute. A gold record being
     used as a coaster. People smoking and chatting through
     the rehearsal.

                                                              12.


In one of the chairs, a pretty  woman in her  mid-thirties
(NICKI, the woman we saw at the  premiere) is  knitting.
She glances occasionally at the  dancers. A   man sits next
to a phone busily discussing a  contract with  someone at
the other end of the line.

The music climaxes and abruptly stops. The dancers hold
their dramatic final poses for a second, then relax again.
APPLAUSE. The CLAPPING from the front sofa is loudest.
Then LAUGHTER.
From elsewhere in the room comes the voice of the VIDEO
DIRECTOR.

                      DIRECTOR (O.S.)
         Playback, everybody!
Rachel's voice comes from the sofa.
                      RACHEL (O.S.)
         Come here, Rory!
The choreographer skips to the sofa and disappears from
sight. Sound of kissing, laughter.
The video rewinds on the big screen and the dancers gather
round it expectantly.
                      RACHEL (O.S.)
         Sugar, that's gonna be great.    I
         love the ending...
Devaney moves to the front of the room. The PLAYBACK
STARTS behind him. There are several overlapping
conversations going on.
                      DEVANEY
         Rachel...
                      RACHEL (O.S.)
         Nicki, how'd you like the number?
         You like the end routine?
                      DIRECTOR (O.S.)
         Rachel. You wanna see it back
         from the beginning or just the
         ending...
NICKI, responds to Rachel's question.
                      NICKI
         It was just great, Rory...
But Rachel is already replying to the video director.

                                                               13.

                      RACHEL (O.S.)
         I wanna see it all. Tony?      I'll
         bet Tony loved it.
The brawny man, Tony, shrugs and stands to look at Frank
as he speaks.

                       TONY
         Ehh!
                      RACHEL (O.S.)
         Don't worry, Rory. Tony doesn't
         appreciate great art.
The pinned-up girl has been brought forward for Rachel's
approval, elbowing Devaney a little to one side.

                      DRESS DESIGNER
                (showing the costume)
         What do you think, Rachel?
                      DEVANEY
         Rachel, Frank Farmer is...
                      RACHEL (O.S.)
         Devaney, do you think this is me?
                      DEVANEY
                (not looking)
         It's terrific...
Devaney is now facing the unseen Rachel.
                      DEVANEY
         Rachel, Frank Farmer is here.
Devaney nods in Frank's direction.     Nicki looks at Frank.
                       RACHEL (O.S.)
         Who's here?
                      DEVANEY
         Frank Farmer.
                (getting no response)
         The bodyguard.
                      RACHEL (O.S.)
         I think Rory should be my
         bodyguard.
                (to dress designer)
         Let's see the back again...
                      DEVANEY
         Rachel, raise your butt out of
         there and meet this man.
RACHEL MARRON finally rises from the sofa.     It's a bit of

                                                             14.

a shock to see that she is only about thirty years old.
A young woman. Not beautiful, not ugly. Unique only in
that she is immediately interesting. A Superstar.
                      RACHEL
         Well, I'm up.

Rachel and Frank look across the room at each other.
Frank comes forward.
                      DEVANEY
         Frank Farmer, Rachel Marron.
Rachel offers her hand and they shake.    Rachel looks him
up and down.

                      RACHEL
         You don't look like a bodyguard.
                      FRANK
         What did you expect?
                      RACHEL
         I don't know. Tough guy maybe.
                      FRANK
         This is my disguise.
                      RACHEL
                (smiling)
         Well, his timing's good.
                      DEVANEY
         This is Nicki, Rachel's sister
         and personal secretary.
                      NICKI
         Nice to meet you, Mr. Farmer.
                      DEVANEY
                (indicating)
         ... Tony Scibelli.
Tony nods but makes no move to shake hands.
Rachel dismisses the Dress Designer.
                      RACHEL
                (to designer)
         The back's still not right...
SPECTOR, still on the phone, offers a perfunctory wave.
                      DEVANEY
         ... Sy Spector, Rachel's publicist.

                                                              15.

                      RACHEL
         Can we get you a drink?
                      FRANK
         Orange juice.
                       RACHEL
         Straight?   Nicki.
Nicki goes to the bar. Rachel sits and motions for
Frank to sit opposite her.
                      RACHEL
         Rory, I'll be with you in a second.
Rory gets up, and goes over to his dancers at the big
screen video.
                      RACHEL
         Listen, this whole thing is Bill's
         idea... This sudden obsession with
         protecting me. Tony has always
         handled my security and we've done
         just fine.
                      SPECTOR (O.S.)
                (into the phone)
         Yes, I'll hold but not long...
                      RORY (O.S.)
         Rachel, you want to run through
         your steps before we go again...?
                      RACHEL
         I'll be with you in a second.
Nicki hands Frank his orange juice.   She looks at Frank as
she speaks.
                      NICKI
         I think Bill's right, Rachel. It's
         time you took more precautions.
Spector enters the conversation.
                      SPECTOR
                (one hand covers
                 the phone)
         Nicki, I'm sure Mr. Farmer would
         tell you the number of nuts
         writing fan letters jumps every
         time Rachel is on the cover of
         a magazine.
                      DEVANEY
         Not like this.

                                                             16.

An ASSISTANT hands Rachel a small sheaf of phone messages,
some papers for signature and a pen. Rachel checks
through them and signs as she talks.
                      RACHEL
         Relax guys, I said I'd do  it. You
         see what I'm dealing with  here?
         I'm willing to go along,  as long
         as we all understand each  other.
         I'm not going to let this  alter
         my life one little bit.
                (to assistant)
         Who was this?
                      ASSISTANT
                (overlapping Devaney)
         Oh. That was Clive's office.
         They called three times...
                      DEVANEY
         Honey, that's not going to be a
         problem.
                      DEVANEY (CONT'D)
                (to Frank)
         Rachel runs a very informal
         household, we're all on a first
         name basis...
Spector has finished up on the phone and jumps in.
                      SPECTOR
         ...And I'm sure you'll blend in
         just fine. You can select whatever
         alarm systems you want for the
         house. Some kind of improved
         security for the gate. What else,
         Rachel?
Rachel stands and starts to wander over to Rory and
the dancers.
Frank looks at Devaney.   Devaney doesn't like the tone
this is taking.
                      RACHEL
         I think I'm safe when I'm here at
         the house so I guess the main thing
         will be when I go out. Tony will
         be able to fill you in on all that.
         You two will have to work something
         out. I don't want both of you
         falling all over me everywhere I
         go. The most important thing is
         this -- I will not allow Fletcher
         to be affected by this thing...

                                                              17.

Rory puts his arm around her waist and stands behind her,
starting to run through her steps with her in slow motion.
                      SPECTOR
                (punching phone)
         I was just going to cover that.
         We'll have to tell the child you
         have some other function...
                      RACHEL
         I don't want him to think   he's in
         prison. So the house and    grounds
         must not be altered in any   way.
         He shouldn't be aware that   you're
         here. Is that clear?

Frank looks at her a long time, glancing up at Devaney
once.
                      FRANK
         Miss Marron...
                      RACHEL
         Rachel.
                      FRANK
         There's been a mistake. A
         misunderstanding. If you'll show
         me the quickest way out, we'll
         save each other a lot of trouble.
Frank's on his way. Someone brings a silver headpiece on
a stand to Rachel. She ignores it, still looking at Frank.
                      TONY
         You can go past the pool.
                      DEVANEY
         Shut up, Tony.
                      FARMER
         Nice meeting you.
                      DEVANEY
         Farmer, will you wait a minute?
                      SPECTOR
         Bill, I don't think we should be
         begging this guy for his services.
                      DEVANEY
         Sy, I'm handling this.
Rachel looks on coolly as Frank slides open the glass door.
                      DEVANEY
         Farmer, will you wait a minute?

                                                                      18.



20   EXT. MARRON GROUNDS - BACK LAWN - DAY                       20
     Frank is walking rapidly away from the window wall, down
     the slope. Devaney is scurrying to keep up.

                           DEVANEY
              Farmer, will you wait a minute? I
              should have told you more. I'm
              sorry but I was afraid she wouldn't
              go through with it. I thought I'd
              let the two of you work it out...
              come to an understanding.
                            FRANK
              We did.
     Frank starts to walk off.   Devaney is grasping at straws.
                           DEVANEY
              She's not a bad person, and whether
              she knows it or not, she needs you.
                     (a beat)
              You've come this far... Would you
              just wait here for one minute. I
              want to show you something. Please,
              Farmer.
     Devaney runs back to the house.

21   EXT. POOL AREA - DAY                                        21
     Fletcher, happy to have someone to talk to,  walks up to
     Frank with his remote-control speed boat.   Frank would
     like to walk away, but Fletcher blocks his  way. Frank
     looks at Fletcher's frail little, nut-brown  figure. The
     watching nanny continues her embroidering,  some way off.
                            FLETCHER
              Hi!
                           FRANK
                     (continuing to walk)
              Hi.
                           FLETCHER
              How are you today?
                           FRANK
                     (wants to keep walking)
              All right. How 'bout yourself?
                           FLETCHER
              Oh, I'm fine. Do you like boats?

                                                             19.

Frank gives up.    He's not going to get out of here.   He
stops.
                         FRANK
         No.     I don't like boats.
                         FLETCHER
         You don't!     Why not?
                      FRANK
         Oh, I don't know.
                      FLETCHER
         Sure you do, but you don't want
         to tell me.

Frank considers him, then slips out of his sport coat.
He crouches down so that he is eye-level with Fletcher.
                      FRANK
         You're a smart kid.
Fletcher nods.
                      FRANK
         I'll tell you. One time I was
         stuck on a boat with some people
         for four months.
                        FLETCHER
         A lifeboat?
                      FRANK
         Nope. A big white yacht.      Do you
         know what a yacht is?
                         FLETCHER
                   (thinks about this)
         Yeah.     My mom rented this huge
         yacht    once, and we took a trip.
         It was    great. Everyone threw up
         except    me. I love 'em.
                      FRANK
                (standing to leave)
         Well, nobody's perfect.
Fletcher squints up at him, the sun in his eyes.
                      FLETCHER
         You're the bodyguard, aren't you?
Frank is surprised.
                      FRANK
         What do you know about it?

                                                                     20.

                           FLETCHER
              I've got ears.
                           FRANK
              I'll remember that.
     Devaney trots into the pool area, out of breath. He is
     holding a bulging manila file. As he sees Fletcher, he
     holds the file casually at his side.
     Frank sees Fletcher looking at the file.
                           DEVANEY
              How are you, Fletch?
                     (to Frank)
              I'm glad you waited.    Let's go
              over here.
                           FRANK
                     (to Fletcher)
              Nice meeting you.
     Fletcher looks after them silently.

22   EXT. PATIO - DAY                                           22
     Devaney slides the file across the table at Frank, open-
     ing it. Inside are letters of every size and condition.
     Repeatedly throughout this scene Frank's gaze is drawn to
     Fletcher, who has started his boat again.
                           DEVANEY
              This is just in the last six months.
                           FRANK
                     (looks at the pile)
              Have you ever tried having these
              professionally assessed?
     Devaney shakes his head no.
     Frank begins to look through the letters, flipping them by
     the corner of the page. From many different sources, some
     are scrawled, some typed, some assembled from cutouts.
     Many are soiled and torn, others immaculate. Occasionally,
     one will have a photo of Rachel with crude markings on it.
     Spector enters sucking on a popsicle. He comes to stand
     over Frank's shoulder, peering nonchalantly at the piles
     of letters.
                           SPECTOR
              Devaney says you were in the Secret
              Service.
     Frank nods.

                                                            21.


Frank goes through them quickly, with an expert eye. He
sometimes pauses to read one more carefully. A few he
removes from the stack and places in the center of the
table.
                      SPECTOR
         Ever guard the main man?
                      FRANK
         I was two years with Carter and
         four years with Reagan.
Frank sets another letter in the center pile.   He stops,
smiling at it.

                      FRANK
         This is a little old lady in
         Akron. She's written to
         everybody I've ever worked for.
He continues to turn until something stops him. Several
letters are paper-clipped together. They are the pasted-
up type we saw being assembled on the desk top.
                      SPECTOR
         Reagan got shot.
His chatter is beginning to annoy Frank.
                      FRANK
         Not on my shift.
Spector emits a gratuitous laugh, acknowledges the joke.
                        SPECTOR
         That's good.
Frank goes back to his letters.   He taps the stack in
the center of the table.
                      FRANK
         At first glance, these don't
         bother me. But keep them. You
         never know.
He separates one letter from the others.
                      FRANK
         This could be something.
Devaney searches Frank's face.
                      DEVANEY
         You think it could be the same
         guy? The one who rigged the doll?

                                                                      22.

                           FRANK
              I don't know. Did you tell Miss
              Marron about it? Does she know
              about the doll?
     Devaney and Spector exchange looks.   This is evidently a
     sore point between them.

                           SPECTOR
              We said there'd been some electrical
              problem while she was on stage.
              Short circuit. Look, she doesn't
              need that kind of worry right now.
              It would upset her.
                           FRANK
              What about the police?
                           SPECTOR
              There was no reason for the police.
              No one got hurt.
                           FRANK
              What about the chauffeur?
                           SPECTOR
              It was nothing. It was just our
              people there.
     Frank turns and watches Fletcher by the pool.   Devaney's
     eyes are still on Frank's face.
                           DEVANEY
              Sy, I think we should show him
              the room.

23   INT. ROOM - DAY                                             23
     Frank follows Spector and Devaney into the room. He
     glances around, taking in the murals, the decor, the
     kitsch attempt at fornicatorial splendour right from
     the pages of a tabloid layout.
                           FRANK
              Is this her bedroom?
                           SPECTOR
              Yes.
                           DEVANEY
              No. She sleeps in a room next to
              Fletcher's down the hall. Sy had
              this done for a magazine layout,
                           SPECTOR
              'Superstars in their Boudoirs.'

                                                     23.

         Did you see it?
                      FRANK
         No.
                      DEVANEY
         Rachel never liked it.

                      SPECTOR
         She didn't have to like it...
Devaney gently lays the cut-out letter on the bed.
                      DEVANEY
         We found the letter here.

                      FRANK
         Somebody was in here?
                      DEVANEY
         Somebody broke in and ...
         masturbated on the bed.
                      FRANK
         And she doesn't know about this
         either?
Devaney shakes his head.
                      SPECTOR
         Are you kidding? This would really
         freak her out.
                      DEVANEY
         What do you think?
                      FRANK
         Someone penetrates the house, gets
         upstairs and jerks off on the bed
         ... I'd say that qualifies as a
         problem.
                      DEVANEY
         What kind of problem?
                      SPECTOR
                (agitated)
         Of fuck, we don't need this now...
                      FRANK
         This house is wide open.
                      SPECTOR
         Excuse me?
                      FRANK
         I said this house is wide open

                                                                     24.

              and you people have no clue what
              real security is or what it takes
              to achieve it.
                           DEVANEY
                     (does a quick read
                      on Frank)
              Frank, I totally respect what
              you're telling me. Tell me how
              you want to work and I'll
              accommodate you.
                           FRANK
              Look, I can't protect her. I won't
              be responsible for her safety if
              she doesn't know what's going on.

                           DEVANEY
              I'll talk to her, I'll make her
              understand. I can do that.
                            SPECTOR
              No.   I'll talk to her.
     Spector exits the room in a huff.

24   EXT. MARRON HOUSE FRONT - DAY                              24
     Frank emerges with Devaney and crosses toward his car.
                           DEVANEY
              ...She won't give you any static,
              Frank, you've got my word on that.
     Frank is still focused on Fletcher.
                           FRANK
              Sure she will.
                           DEVANEY
              So what job's perfect? You're
              a bodyguard, aren't you?
     Slowly, Frank faces him.
                            FRANK
                      (quietly)
              Yeah.
     As they reach the car, Devaney is relieved.   He dares a
     perfect smile.
                           FRANK
              Devaney, if you ever lie to me
              again, I'll take you apart.

                                                                     25.


25   INT. MARRON MANSION - FRANK'S ROOM - DAY                   25
     Henry Dupres is leaning against the doorjamb. The room
     is comfortable, a guest bedroom. Frank flops one
     battered suitcase onto the bed and opens it. He pulls
     open some drawers in the dresser and starts putting away
     his clothes.
                           HENRY
              Why'd you say your name was
              Edison?
                           FRANK
              I wanted to see how hard it
              was to get in.

                           HENRY
              And it wasn't, was it?
     Henry unconsciously flexes his fingers, easing the muscles
     in his hands. Frank notices and pulls out a small tube of
     ointment from a pouch he's unpacking. He hands it to Henry.
                           FRANK
              Put this on your arm.    It'll help
              the ache.
     Henry takes it but is noncommittal.
                           FRANK
              I'll bet you can fill up a whole
              day just washing the cars and
              driving Rachel Marron around town.
                           HENRY
              That's my job.
                           FRANK
              We're adding to your duties.
                           HENRY
              Huh?
                           FRANK
              You're my new assistant.
     Frank removes three boxes of cartridges from the suitcase
     and puts them in the back of a dresser drawer as Henry
     watches.
                           HENRY
              Says who?
                           FRANK
              Henry, I've spent a lot of time
              guarding people all over the world

                                                                   26.

              and I've found one thing to be
              true. No matter how incompetent
              the assassins, no matter how much
              they miss their target by, there's
              one person who always gets hit.
                           HENRY
              Who?
                           FRANK
              The cocky black chauffeur.
     Henry considers this for a moment and smiles.
     OVER scenes 26-28, we hear the VOICE of CNN's MARTIN
     GROVE from "Showbiz Today."

                           MARTIN GROVE (V.O.)
              It's Oscar time again, folks, and
              with Academy members marking their
              ballots today for this year's
              nominations; some canny tipsters in
              Vegas have announced their picks
              for the Awards.
                           MARTIN GROVE (V.O.)(CONT'D)
              Echoing the prevailing buzz in
              Hollywood, the Vegas Hilton is
              gambling on one sure thing at
              least. Newcomer Rachel Marron
              is tipped at 3 to 1 to lead this
              year's Best Actress runners.
                           MARTIN GROVE (V.O.)(CONT'D)
              The sultry singer made a notable
              acting debut last fall in Queen
              Of The Night, singing the hit song
              'I Have Nothing'. The lady may
              end up eating her words if she
              takes home that statuette March
              20th...

26   EXT. PERIMETER OF ESTATE - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY           26
     The fortification of the estate begins as Frank and
     Henry walk the grounds. Frank talks and points, Henry
     takes notes on a pad. Frank gestures at the stonework
     of the gate, points at the top of the stone wall along
     Waverly Lane. At the tall hedges which separate the
     estate from its neighbors, Frank gestures to take in
     the entire length of the hedged border. Henry stops
     in amazement. Frank keeps walking.

27   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - POOL AREA - DAY                     27

                                                                     27.

     Fletcher stands at the edge of the terrace, staring down
     across the rear grounds.
     FLETCHER'S POV
     Frank and Henry are down there conferring about the
     fence.

     RACHEL
     appears beside Fletcher, looks down there too, then leads
     her son purposefully away. Fletcher isn't happy about it.

28   INT. MARRON MANSION - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY                  28

     Frank tours the house with Emma and Henry. Frank opens
     various doors, fidgets with locking mechanisms. Emma
     finds it all exciting.

29   INT. MARRON ESTATE - POOL HOUSE/BALLET STUDIO - DAY        29
     A small room at one end of the pool house has been fitted
     with a wall mirror and ballet exercise barre. A STEREO
     plays exercising MUSIC.
     Nicki, dressed in leotards, is doing pre-aerobic stretch-
     ing exercises. Frank appears outside the window. Nicki
     waves him in. Unseen by Frank, a huge St. Bernard lays
     in the front of the door. He muscles his way in, the dog
     never moves, just slides along the floor as Frank pushes
     the door open. Frank looks the room over.
                           FRANK
              Unusual tactic for a guard dog,
              but effective.
     Nicki smiles, gesturing him in.
                           NICKI
              You can look around if you like.
     Frank indicates it won't be necessary.   Nicki stops
     working out.
                           FRANK
              I'm sorry to disturb you.
                           NICKI
              That's all right. It's an excuse
              to rest. It's my private place.
              I'm the only one who works out
              around here.
     Frank glances at photos on one wall. Most are of Nicki
     from years ago; some show her performing with a band.

                                                                     28.


                           NICKI
              My own ego wall. No platinum
              records.
     Frank spots a picture of two girls.

                           FRANK
              You and Rachel?
                           NICKI
              When I was a kid, I put a little
              band together. We played high
              school dances, stuff like that.
              Then Rachel joined the act. As
              you can imagine, she was quite a
              little entertainer. Even then,
              she had a way of stopping the show.
              So I kind of quit. Professionally,
              anyway.
                           FRANK
              You never went back?
                           NICKI
              It was pretty obvious who the
              star in our family was.
     Frank looks back at the picture.    Nicki smiles.

30   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - GARAGE AREA - DAY                     30
     Frank and Henry walk toward the closed garages.
                           HENRY
              That depends on what you call a
              'hint.'
                           FRANK
              I don't want anyone on the street
              to be able to look at the cars and
              know who owns them.
     Henry leans in a doorway and hits a master switch. The
     three doors of the garage start to rise in sequence.
                           HENRY
              I don't think there's anything
              here you'd call a 'hint.'
     One at a time the doors go up to reveal:
     First garage -- the Cadillac limousine we've seen earlier.
     License: RACHEL 2
     Second garage -- a gray Mercedes.    License:   RACHEL 3

                                                                     29.


     Third garage -- a Jaguar XKE in an outrageous pink. No
     other car in the world is this color. License: RACHEL 1
     Frank looks at Henry, who is laughing and shakes his head.
     He walks toward the Jag.

     Frank releases the hood. He looks inside for a moment,
     then reaches into the guts of the engine. He fiddles for
     a second, then stands up holding some wires and slams the
     hood shut again. He gestures toward the other two cars.
                           FRANK
              Get new plates for those two.


31   EXT. GATE AREA - DAY                                       31
     The fortification continues as workmen use a bulldozer to
     clear away the stonework around the entrance.

32   EXT. DRIVEWAY OF MARRON ESTATE - DAY                       32
     Sitting beside Henry, Frank teaches him how to spin the
     limo in a 180 degree 'skid turn,' sending up clouds of
     dust. A group of roadies watching bursts into spontan-
     eous applause.

33   EXT. GATE AREA - DAY                                       33
     Fletcher sits on the grass about halfway to the house,
     watching the activity with delighted interest.
     He turns as he spots something beyond the hedge.
     FLETCHER'S POV
     Workmen put up a seven-foot cyclone fence. Across the
     road, a black Toyota 4 X 4 is stopped. It slowly pulls
     away. We can't see inside it.

34   EXT. GATE AREA - DAY                                       34
     One worker pries a small boulder out of a hole with a
     crowbar. His partner picks up the rock and tosses it
     on a small pile of rocks. The boulder bounces down the
     backside of the pile.

35   INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - DAY                                35
     Rachel, looking out her window at Fletcher and the work-
     men, sees the rock stop a yard from him. Fletcher
     scrambles away, much as a kid might dance back from a

                                                                     30.

     wave on a beach.   The sight disturbs Rachel.
                             RACHEL
              Fletcher!    C'mon. Back in here!
     As she speaks, some workmen test the remote control on a
     window shutter. It descends in front of Rachel's face.
     She is not amused. Fletcher passes Frank on his way to
     join Rachel. He mutters almost under his breath.
                           FLETCHER
              I think he's got a black 4 X 4. Could
              be a Chevy. More like a Toyota.
     Frank stares at Fletcher, then looks back to the street.


36   INT. F.B.I. LOS ANGELES OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY     36
     The room is dark. An opaque projector throws an image
     onto a screen; it is a letter threatening Rachel's life.
     We hear voices. One is Frank's; the other two belong
     to special agents RAY COURT and TERRY MINELLA.
     The letter is one of the pasted-up threats we saw being
     assembled earlier. It reads:
              MARRON BITCH -- YOU HAVE EVERYTHING
              I HAVE NOTHING. THE TIME IS COMING
              WHEN YOU SHALL DIE...
     Reading as fast as possible, we pick up some vicious
     threats and obscenities, but we don't have time to read
     it all before we...
                                                CUT TO:
     FRANK'S FACE
     illuminated by the screen.
                              COURT (O.S.)
              This    is another of the ones we
              think    are worth pursuing. Lots of
              work    went into it. No prints.
              We're    doing lab work on it. It
              could    be nothing.
     MINELLA'S FACE
     is illuminated above the projector.
                           MINELLA
              This is the one you think is tied
              to the doll?
                           FRANK (O.S.)
              That's what her manager thinks.

                                                                     31.


                           COURT (O.S.)
              This 'I Have Nothing' business is
              a natural with the record and
              movie and all.
     The projector light goes off and the room light goes on.
     The room is practically bare.
     Ray Court, a prematurely white-haired, career civil
     servant, raises the window shade. Sunlight streams
     in. On Court's lapel is a tiny P.T. Boat pin.
     Terry Minella, a slight, dark 35-year-old, offers Frank
     a cigarette; Frank declines, Minella lights up.

                           COURT
              I sort of lost track of you after
              Washington.
                             FRANK
              Yeah.
                           COURT
              How's the private stuff?
                             FRANK
                       (noncommittal)
              Fine.
                           COURT
              Big money, I bet? Huh?
     Frank shrugs.    Court looks at Minella knowingly.

37   INT. FEDERAL BUILDING - DAY                                37
     Minella and Court walk Frank to the lobby.
                           COURT
              Shit. I knew it. It is big money.
              Fuck! You need an assistant? I'm
              ready to get out. I've lost my
              tolerance for assholic behavior.
              You should see the jerk we're
              covering now...
                           COURT
              'Hellfire Henry' Kent...
                             MINELLA
              Shh!    Somebody wants to pop him...
                           COURT
              Which isn't exactly surprising,
              considering what the shithead's

                                                                     32.

              been saying.
                           MINELLA
              Yeah!  Do everyone a favor...
                     (he coughs,
                      ironically)
              As you know, we're nonpolitical
              these days.
     The three men laugh easily together.   They have reached
     the lobby doors.
                           COURT
                     (to Frank)
              We'll put this stuff through
              Washington. Behavioral Sciences
              should have something in a few days.
                           FRANK
              Thanks.
                     (a pause)
              Ray?
                             COURT
              Yeah?
                           FRANK
              Why am I getting all this
              cooperation?
                           MINELLA
              She's a big star. Important
              people care about her.
                           COURT
              Politics and show business are
              practically the same these days...
              Got any crowd photos we can use?
                           FRANK
              I'm trying to keep her away from
              crowds.
                             COURT
              Good luck.

38   INT. THE IVY - DAY                                         38
     It's busy. Lots of customers arriving, leaving and
     seated at tables. Waiters criss-cross the terrace. Near
     the entrance, Rachel is saying goodbye to a middle-aged
     WOMAN. Frank stands nearby with Nicki. The Woman says
     something to Rachel, who turns and looks at Frank.
     Rachel whispers something to the Woman and they both
     laugh. They kiss and Rachel moves toward the entrance.

                                                                    33.

                           WOMAN
                     (an afterthought;
                      phony)
              Goodbye, Nicki. So great to see you.
     Nicki waves and follows Rachel. Frank stays very close
     without seeming to walk with Rachel.

     A little girl darts into their path and approaches Rachel.
     Rachel glances at Frank, who has stopped with her, then
     she signs an autograph for the girl. The girl's mother,
     close behind her, hands a small camera casually to Nicki
     to be photographed as she and her daughter pose with
     Rachel. Frank watches Nicki quietly comply.
     Rachel, Spector and Frank all reach the front entrance
     together, and Frank slips out first, glancing around.
     Rachel comes out and passes within inches of him.
                           RACHEL
              I'm surprised you didn't plug them.

39   EXT. THE IVY - DAY                                        39
     Rachel attracts the usual stares from passersby. As
     they reach the limousine, Frank continues scanning the
     street. Tony stares at him, uncomprehending.
                           TONY
                     (impatiently)
              Hey, let's go.
     Frank takes a last look then gets into the front seat
     next to Tony.
                           FRANK
                     (across Tony)
              O.K. Henry, let's go.
     Tony looks at Frank, eyes narrowing.
     From across the street, we see the limo pull away. As
     the shot clears, the dark shape of another vehicle
     appears, slowly moving into frame over the top of the
     camera.

40   INT. FRONT SEAT OF LIMO - DAY                             40
     Frank sits beside Tony, next to the door.   Tony speaks
     to him in a near whisper.
                           TONY
              Let me set you straight on a few
              things. For starters, I love this
              lady... What I do for her I do for

                                                           34.

         love. I'm not some hired fuckin'
         gun who is out to make her life
         miserable.
While Tony speaks, Frank's eyes dart to the side mirror;
his gaze never leaves it.

FRANK'S POV - BLACK TOYOTA
appears in the rearview mirror.
BACK TO SCENE
                      TONY
         I do things the way she likes.
         Her happiness is everything to me.

Frank speaks while concentrating on the mirror.
                      FRANK
         No problem. I'd like to know how
         you handle things, Tony.
                      TONY
         I handle things fine, Frank. You
         watch me and you'll learn something.
                      FRANK
                (to Henry)
         Turn left.
                        HENRY
         Is that him?
Frank shakes his head, he's not sure.   Tony reacts.
                      TONY
         Hey, what's going on?
                        FRANK
         Shortcut.
FRANK'S POV - TOYOTA IN REARVIEW MIRROR
As the limo turns, the 4 X 4 follows them into the turn.
ANGLE - FRANK
whispers to Henry.
                      FRANK
         Slow down, very slow.
                      HENRY
         You want me to do a one-eighty?

                                                                    35.

                           FRANK
              No, just slow down.
     The car slows.
     ANGLE - SPECTOR AND RACHEL IN BACK

     They look up from some papers.
                           SPECTOR
              Why are we stopping?    Are we here?
     Behind them, THROUGH the rear window, the 4 X 4 can be
     seen. Sensing something, it makes a sudden TIRE-
     SCREECHING left turn, disappearing behind them.


41   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - DAY                                  41
     The limo enters the gate where workmen are rigging a
     large fence.

42   INT. LIMO - DAY                                           42
     Frank speaks to Henry.
                           FRANK
              Stop here... Take them to the
              house.
     Frank jumps out and jumps a hedge, racing toward the lawn
     and work area.
     ANGLE - TONY, RACHEL AND SPECTOR
     As the car pulls away they see Frank running wildly across
     the property.
                           TONY
              What's with him?

43   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - DAY                                  43
     As Frank comes through some bushes, he suddenly catches a
     glimpse of the 4 X 4 through the trees. It starts to
     accelerate.
     As it pulls away (it is too far to record the license
     number), he breaks into a full run toward the other end
     of the property.
     Leaping hedges, Frank crashes through tropical vegetation.
     CRASHING through a bamboo forest, he scurries down a
     steep wooded slope toward the road below. The 4 X 4 can
     be glimpsed through the trees as he runs to head it off.

                                                                    36.


     A retaining wall about   14 feet high rises from the road
     to the slope. Without    a pause, as the car speeds beneath,
     Frank leaps and drops   the full distance to the road. The
     4 X 4 ROARS PAST just   missing him and turns a corner.
     Hitting hard, Frank allows his knees to take the force of
     the fall, deliberately rolling once before he springs
     into a crouched upright position.
     But the 4 X 4 speeds around a corner and is gone.

44   INT. MARRON ESTATE - DAY                                  44
     The fortification  continues as workmen tighten screws,
     install electrical  wiring, test alarms. As Frank watches
     over the work, we  see him show Henry how to wear a SURV
     KIT communications  system.
                           FRANK
              Keep this loose.
     Fletcher comes to take a look too.   He peers up at Frank,
     expectantly.
                           FLETCHER
              Tell me about the car?
                              FRANK
              Toyota.     Black.
                           FLETCHER
              Four wheel drive? Late model?
     Frank nods.   Fletcher looks pleased.
                           FRANK
              One snag though.
     Fletcher's face falls.
                              FLETCHER
              What?
                           FRANK
              360,000 of them in Los Angeles.    I
              checked. Nice work, though.
                           FLETCHER
                     (shrugging)
              Well, nobody's perfect, Frank.
              Are they?
                     (gesturing to the
                      SURV KIT)
              Can I try that?

                                                                     37.


45   EXT. MARRON ESTATE POOLSIDE - DAY                          45
     Rachel has been watching Fletcher and Frank down the
     hill. Now she leans back on the chaise lounge where
     she is sunning, trying to listen to a new song on a
     Walkman.

     There is the SCREECHING howl of a DRILL on METAL from
     the direction of the house. Rachel jumps up and yells
     toward the house.
                           RACHEL
              Shut up you assholes!


46   INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - DAY                                46
     A mild-looking OLD LOCKSMITH is working on Rachel's
     window. Rachel walks in from the pool, starting to
     peel off the swimsuit. She stops, startled, as she sees
     him. This is the last straw. She blows up.
                           RACHEL
                     (clutching the
                      swimsuit)
              You! You! Out! Out!        Now!   Out
              of here! Get out!
     Terrified, the Old Locksmith drops his tools and begins
     backing out of the room.
                           OLD LOCKSMITH
              Yes, ma'am. Thank you. I'm a real
              fan of yours, Miss Marron.
     Still angry, but disarmed, Rachel makes a face.
                           RACHEL
              Then you can take your tools with you.
     She turns to the window, in what she imagines is
     Frank's general direction, and, like a little girl,
     suddenly sticks out her tongue.

47   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - GATE/GUARD HOUSE - DAY                47
     In a BIG CLOSEUP ON a black and white TV screen, we see
     Devaney's immaculate convertible Mercedes 500SL as it
     roars up the drive. Frank, Henry and Fletcher watch in
     the newly-erected guard house. The area is greatly
     changed. There is a uniformed guard with an impressive
     array of switches, lights and phones at his command.
     There are several TV screens; one of them shows a series
     of endlessly-panning shots from cameras at the rear of

                                                                     38.

     the grounds. On the other, the Mercedes kicks up dust
     from the last few curves in the drive. Fletcher shakes
     his head. He's seen it all before.
                           HENRY
              Is that Devaney?

                           FLETCHER
                     (to Frank)
              She's got him by the short ones,
              doesn't she, Frank?
     Frank squelches a smile at Henry.   Where did he learn
     that?
                           FRANK
              Yeah, she makes him nervous.
     They watch as Devaney SCREECHES to a STOP, gets out and
     hurries inside.

48   INT. FAMILY ROOM - DAY                                     48
     Nicki is cutting fruit at the bar. Rachel, very tense,
     is taking the fruit and dropping it into a yogurt drink
     she's making in a blender.
     Rory, her choreographer, stands behind her, massaging her
     neck and shoulders. Spector is perched on a bar stool
     like a vulture. Devaney hurries into the room; Nicki
     gives him a look.
                           RACHEL
              I want him gone.
                           DEVANEY
              What is it now?
                           NICKI
              He told Rachel no Sunday brunch
              at Charlie's.
                           DEVANEY
              No Sunday brunch. That's why you
              called me up here?
                           RACHEL
              That is not it! It's my money
              and my life and I want him out
              of here.
                              DEVANEY
              Where is he?
     Nicki indicates through the glass door.    Devaney walks
     over to it.

                                                         39.


                      NICKI
         On the patio.
                      RACHEL
         He's through messing with my life.

                      DEVANEY
         Rachel, I'm getting goddamn sick
         of running up here every time he
         steps on your toes.
                (leaning out the
                 glass door)
         Farmer! Would you come in here
         a minute?

Devaney walks back toward Rachel.
                      RACHEL
         Did you know he was nuts?
                      SPECTOR
         Do you know who couldn't get
         past the gates yesterday?
                        RACHEL
         Who?
                      SPECTOR
         Robin Leach, that's who.
Rory sniggers into the back of Rachel's hair, fighting
off a laugh. Rachel has difficulty keeping a straight
face, too. Spector glares at them as Frank enters from
the sliding door.
                      SPECTOR
         You think that's funny? The
         man talks to 20 million people
         and he can't even get in here.
                      FRANK
         Did he have an appointment?
Devaney turns to him.
                      DEVANEY
         Farmer, what is this about
         brunch at Charlie's? Rachel's
         been going there every Sunday
         for the last five years.
                      FRANK
         I don't want her doing anything
         she's always done.

                                                           40.

                      RACHEL
                (mimicking him)
         'I don't want her doing anything
         she's always done.' The guy's a
         fanatic.
                      DEVANEY
         So are the guys he's protecting
         you from.
                      RACHEL
         Excuse me if I don't faint.
                      NICKI
         Think of Fletcher --

Rachel turns ON the BLENDER, drowning out Nicki's voice.
Frank looks at Rachel coolly. She stares at him
petulantly, then turns OFF the BLENDER.
                      RACHEL
         Do you know he's got the phones
         bugged?
                      SPECTOR
         Oh Jesus, Bill.
                      RACHEL
         Maybe he gets off listening to my
         calls. All that heavy breathing...
                      DEVANEY
                (interrupting)
         What do you want from my life?
                      RACHEL
         I want some peace around here.
                      SPECTOR
         That's right.
Devaney looks at Frank imploringly.
                      FRANK
         We're almost done.
                      RACHEL
         And I want to be able to eat
         brunch with my friends.
                      FRANK
         Go on Tuesday this week.
Spector looks at him as though he were a Martian.

                                                                       41.

                            SPECTOR
                      (stretching it out)
               Tuesday -- morning -- brunch.
               Where did you find this guy?
      Rachel turns ON the BLENDER and stares at Frank.


48A   EXT. THRIFT SHOP - VALLEY - DAY                             48A
      Rachel's limousine is parked opposite the shop.    It's
      a decidedly downscale area. A little way  off, a   group
      of unemployed youths hang around, eyeing the limo   with
      interest. Henry sits  at the wheel. Tony  stands   by the
      open window, leaning against the car.

                            HENRY
                      (looking at the
                       youths)
               I wish Rachel didn't keep coming
               here. It makes me nervous.
                            TONY
               Me too. 'Cept I'm not nervous
               'cos I got you with me.

49    INT. THRIFT SHOP - CLOSE ON CLOTHES HANGER - DAY            49
      SCREECHING as it's slid along a metal rack.
      Rachel is shopping for bargains, moving along racks of
      discarded clothing.
                            RACHEL
               Louise, you've got too much great
               stuff.
                            OWNER
                      (from the back of
                       the shop, laughing)
               Take it all, darlin'.
      Frank leans casually against a wall, not watching Rachel,
      but watching the shop, watching the street outside.
      Rachel finds something she likes.
                             RACHEL
               Wooo!   Let me try this on.
      She flicks a glance to Frank; he's not looking at her.
      She pulls back the curtain of the makeshift changing
      booth, then stops dramatically.

                                                            42.

                      RACHEL
                (to Frank, indicating
                 the open booth)
         Farmer, do you want to come in
         here with me? Just to be safe?
Frank glances at her, then resumes his surveillance of
the shop. Rachel's head bobs up and down above the
curtain as she changes.
                      RACHEL
         You probably won't believe this,
         but I have a reputation for being
         a bitch.
Frank says nothing. He gazes outside through the store-
front window and sees Henry and Tony horsing around next
to the limo. A few small boys stand around the car. One
of them is climbing onto the hood.
                      RACHEL
         I didn't used to be. But you get
         known for being a certain way --
         a way people think you are -- and
         pretty soon you get like that.
         Can't help it.
Frank smiles knowingly.   Rachel notices.
                      RACHEL
         You don't think so? You're such
         an expert on famous people?
                      FRANK
         I've seen a few.
                      RACHEL
         And you disagree?
                      FRANK
                (very flat)
         You can be as you choose to be.
         It's an act of discipline
         sometimes, but it can be done.
Rachel stops in her tracks... then opens the curtains and
looks at herself in the mirror. Also reflected in the
mirror is Frank.
                      RACHEL
         That why you never stay with one
         of your clients? They too
         undisciplined for you? Or is it
         you're afraid you'll start to
         care about them?

                                                         43.

                      FRANK
                (without interest)
         That's right.
Rachel turns to Frank.
                      RACHEL
         Can't you answer straight just
         once? Why don't you talk to
         me? I'm not such a bad lady.
                      FRANK
         You're too clever for me.   I can't
         keep up.
Frank continues to search the shop and street with his
gaze. Rachel steps closer to him.
                      RACHEL
         Look at me, Farmer!
Frank turns and looks at her.
                      RACHEL
         You don't approve of me, do you?
                      FRANK
         Disapproval's a luxury I can't
         afford. Gets in the way.
                      RACHEL
         Don't like emotions getting to you,
         huh? Never mix business with
         pleasure?
                      FRANK
         That's right.
It's a stand-off. After a moment, Rachel motions to
an outfit on a rack just behind him.
                      RACHEL
         Grab that would you?
Frank takes a beat.   Looks out the window.
                      FRANK
         I'm here to keep you alive... not
         to help you shop.
Fuming, Rachel sizes things up, then grabs it herself,
whipping the curtain shut behind her.
A smile plays across Frank's face.

                                                                     44.

50   INT. DARKENED ROOM - CLOSEUP - NIGHT                       50
     We see a man's hands remove a video cassette from its
     sleeve. The cover reads "RACHEL MARRON - THE #1 HITS."
     The CASSETTE is gently eased into the slot of the video
     player.

     Rachel's image appears on the screen, singing softly,
     intensely, passionately into the camera. WE TRACK INTO
     the image, as if a little hypnotized by it.
     ANGLE FRANK
     Frank sits alone in his room, lit by the glow of the TV,
     dressed in a business-style blue suit and tie. He's
     watching Rachel's videos. Scattered around the video
     player are a collection of other Rachel Marron CD's,
     tapes and videos. Frank has been noting down lyrics on
     the yellow legal pad on his lap. Some of the phrases
     are circled.
     As he watches, we see a subtle change in his expression.
     It is as if he really were looking at Rachel for the first
     time, here, watching her sing. For a second, she seems to
     be singing to him alone, passionate and vulnerable.
     He opens a small box and removes a tiny enamelled Russian
     Orthodox-type cross. He fastens the clasp, checking that
     it holds, then looks back to the screen.

51   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - NIGHT                                 51
     Rachel's SONG PLAYS OVER the moonlit estate.

52   INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                              52
     The room is surprisingly bare and simple, almost empty
     apart from Rachel's collection of old and faded dolls
     on the shelves and on the bed. Rachel is getting dressed
     for the evening. A hairdresser stands behind her,
     fussing with her hair. Rachel hears the MUSIC coming
     from outside and moves to the window. (The hairdresser
     moves with her, still busy with the brush.) Gazing
     across the garden, she sees the light in Frank's room
     and hears her own voice singing out from there too.

53   EXT. MARRON HOUSE - NIGHT                                  53
     Frank is showing Henry how to check the underside of the
     limo with an angled mirror on a stick. Both are crouched
     beside the vehicle. A noise makes them look up. Rachel,
     dressed to the nines and looking very sexy, emerges from
     the house with Spector and Devaney. Spector's carrying a
     videotape. Tony follows as they head for the car, where

                                                          45.

Frank and Henry are waiting. Fletcher stands in the
doorway, flanked by uniformed security guards. He waves
at Frank.
                      FRANK
                (to Henry)
         I thought it was dinner.

Henry shrugs.
                      FRANK
                (to Spector)
         Are we going somewhere else?
                      SPECTOR
         The Mayan, Frank.

                      FRANK
         What's the Mayan?
Spector starts to climb into the limo.
                      SPECTOR
         It's a club, Frank. Come on,
         Henry, let's go.
                      FRANK
         Spector, you've got to tell me
         about these things.
                       SPECTOR
         I just did.
He disappears inside the limo.
Rachel tugs at Frank's lapels, looks him up and down,
brushing something off his shoulder. Frank's annoyed.
                      RACHEL
         Nice suit, Frank.
Rachel is about to get in.
                       FRANK
         Rachel.
He removes something from his pocket, a small enameled
cross.
                      FRANK
         I want you to keep this.
Rachel looks at it, both flattered and confused.
                       RACHEL
         For me?   It's beautiful.

                                                                     46.

                           FRANK
              It's fitted with a radio
              transmitter. When you close the
              clasp, it sends a signal. If
              there's ever a problem and we're
              separated, just press it and I'll
              know you need me.

     Rachel doesn't know how to respond. She's stuck for
     words. Spector pokes his head out impatiently.
                           SPECTOR
              Okay, she knows how it works,
              let's get going.
     Rachel manages a quick smile to Frank as she gets in the
     back. Frank gets in the front beside Tony. The limo
     pulls out.

54   INT. LIMO - NIGHT (LATER)                                  54
     Frank rides beside Tony in the front seat. The RADIO
     PLAYS SOFTLY in the b.g. In back, Rachel, Spector and
     Devaney are drinking champagne. Tony burps, smiles
     at Frank.
                           RADIO D.J. (V.O.)
              You're listening to K.R.O.K., the
              rock of L.A. and yes we have.
                           (MORE)
                           RADIO D.J. (V.O.)(CONT'D)
              We told you we'd crack the case
              of the mystery guest... and if
              you are one of the few who hasn't
              heard, it's Rachel at the Mayan.
     Franks turns UP the VOLUME.
                           RADIO D.J. (V.O.)
              Rachel Marron, tonight, appearing
              as Billy Thomas' very special
              guest. But if you don't have a
              ticket, you can forget going
              down there. Police are asking
              us to ask you to stay away. So
              everybody, please stay cool,
              stay tuned and we'll try to get
              you some interviews after the
              show. Remember, you heard it
              here on K.R.O.K. -- the station
              that delivers.
     Frank looks back at Spector who silently mouths --

                                                                       47.

                           SPECTOR
              It wasn't me.
     The car turns a corner and there it is, The Mayan only
     fifty yards ahead, a mob of fans spilling out of the
     club, off the sidewalk and into the street.

                              TONY
              Fuckin' a.
     Spector whoops with uncontrolled delight from the back of
     the limo. Frank stares ahead in disbelief. The NOISE
     of the CROWD can be heard as they pull up front.

55   EXT. THE MAYAN - NIGHT                                       55

     The mob reacts to the sight of the approaching limo which
     turns into the parking area and heads for the backstage.
     Faces of the fans are at the windows leering at Rachel.
     Many are grotesquely painted. Some go into a wild frenzy
     as Rachel's limo pulls up. There is a punch-up and a man
     is beaten back. Someone has a video camera. Its quartz
     light shines in through the limo windows. Everybody
     squints at the glare.

56   EXT. BACKSTAGE ENTRANCE - NIGHT                              56
     As Rachel's car pulls up, the beaten man dances weirdly
     at the curb with blood streaming from his nose.
     A pair of security guards try to hold them back.    As her
     limo stops, a chant begins.
                            CROWD
              Rachel!   Rachel! We want Rachel!
     Others join in as the mob presses forward.
     The instant she exits the car, her expression goes public
     -- a wide, show-biz smile. Sandwiched between Spector and
     Devaney, with Tony in front and Frank at the rear, Rachel
     makes her entrance.
     A young man breaks the barrier   moving toward Rachel.
     Frank grabs him by one of his   belt loops, gracefully
     guides him all the way across   and slips him under the
     opposite cordon into the arms   of a security guard.

57   INT. RACHEL'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT                          57
     Rachel steps into a room set for a star's arrival.
     Flowers are on every surface that will hold them. One
     huge arrangement is so big it has to be placed on the

                                                                     48.

     floor. Frank checks them all with a magnometer wand
     before letting Rachel sit down. He goes out, closing
     the door, watchful.

58   INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT                                     58

     Frank's eyes search the crush of people, milling around
     outside the dressing room. A few feet away, Spector talks
     to a JOURNALIST who's carrying a tape recorder.
                           JOURNALIST
              ... and this is my exclusive?
                           SPECTOR
              I swear I thought she'd talk to
              you. Maybe later. What can I
              say.
     Frank is checked out by a strange-looking women in
     Vampyra Drag.

59   INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT                                 59
     Rachel sits in front of the mirror putting on the silver
     headpiece we saw earlier. She notices a small spray of
     lilies-of-the-valley among the floral arrangements.
     An envelope marked "Rachel" is attached to it. She
     reaches forward and opens it.
     We see the note as she unfolds it.
              MARRON BITCH - YOU HAVE EVERYTHING
              I HAVE NOTHING - PREPARE YOUR SOUL
              FOR DEATH - THE TIME TO DIE IS...
     We see the shock in her face.

60   INT. STAR'S SUITE - NIGHT                                  60
     Spector, Frank, and Devaney are there. Rachel seems
     dazed, unfocussed. Devaney hands the note to Frank.
                           DEVANEY
              He sent another one.
     Rachel immediately picks up on this.
                           RACHEL
              What do you mean 'another one'?
     Frank quickly shoots a look at Spector.
                           FRANK
              They didn't tell you.

                                      49.


             RACHEL
Tell me what?
             DEVANEY
There were some letters before,
Rachel... same kind of thing,
threats, oddball stuff...
             SPECTOR
We didn't want to worry you...
             DEVANEY
... and somebody got into the
house...

             RACHEL
       (starting to panic)
Someone was in my house?
              SPECTOR
Okay.   Let's not get hysterical...
             FRANK
Let's get her out of here.
             RACHEL
Someone was in my house?
             SPECTOR
It was weeks ago. You were out of
town...
             RACHEL
While Fletcher was there?
             SPECTOR
Listen, Fletcher is okay. The
house is like Fort Knox now.
Right, Frank?
             FRANK
We should get her out of here.
Right now!
             SPECTOR
There's no way anyone could...
             RACHEL
No way anyone could what?
             SPECTOR
No, wait... look everybody calm
down. Calm down.
             DEVANEY
Sy.

                                                                      50.


                           SPECTOR
              Let's just see how she is.
                     (to Rachel)
              How do you feel, honey?
     Someone comes through the door with some flowers.   Frank
     eases them out and gently closes the door.
                           FRANK
              I can't protect her out there.
                           RACHEL
              Do you think he's out there?
     Devaney can't answer.   She turns to Frank.

                           RACHEL
              He's here, isn't he?
                             FRANK
              He might be.
                           SPECTOR
              We don't know that. Frank, we
              don't know that.
     Rachel is enraged.
                           RACHEL
              But you know he was in my house...
              oh my God.
                           DEVANEY
              Let's go home, Sy. We'll have to
              make an announcement.
                           SPECTOR
              Fine, you make it, they'll tear
              the fucking place apart.

61   INT. ONSTAGE - NIGHT                                        61
     A lone mike stands onstage. The crowd's growing im-
     patient. A RHYTHMIC CLAPPING begins. Devaney walks
     timidly onstage. He's not happy to be there. He reaches
     the mike and taps it with a finger.
                           DEVANEY
              Excuse me... hello... I've got
              an announcement to make. I'm
              sorry but... due to circumstances
              beyond...
     Voices shout. "Where's Rachel?"... a groan begins.
     A chorus of boos fills the room. He raises his hands.

                                                                    51.

     More voices.

62   INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT                                    62
     Frank guides Rachel toward the stage exit. A roar from
     the audience begins. "Rachel! Rachel! Rachel!" It
     grows louder as they near the exit. Rachel's expression
     is a combination of fear and humiliation. When they have
     almost reached the exit, she stops.
                              RACHEL
              Wait...
                           FRANK
              Rachel... don't do it.    It's not
              worth it...
                           RACHEL
                     (cutting him off)
              No fucking freak is gonna chase me
              off stage.
     She pulls away from him.    Farmer starts after her, closely
     followed by Spector.

63   INT. STAGE - NIGHT                                        63
                           DEVANEY
              I'm afraid that...
     A great gush of applause from the audience. Devaney's
     befuddled. He doesn't see Rachel walking up behind him.
                           DEVANEY
              Rachel won't be able...
     Rachel stands beside him beaming. She bows. Claps back
     to her fans. Devaney retreats. Rachel gestures in his
     direction.
                           RACHEL
              Bill Devaney, ladies and gentlemen,
              thank you, Bill. Hey, everyone.
              Hello! Isn't Billy Thomas the
              greatest. He's asked me to sing
              a song. I hope you don't mind.
     The crowd roars its approval.
     Frank nervously scans the room. Rachel smiles and moves
     along the stage. MUSIC starts in the b.g. Masking
     obvious fear, she starts to sing.
     As she takes one hand from the microphone, her fingers
     tremble. She clasps it again to hide her anxiety.

                                                                   52.


      ANGLE - RACHEL - SHOT FROM BEHIND
      shows her alone and vulnerable, bathed in light, center-
      stage.
      Rachel snatches a quick glance at Frank then looks back
      to her silent audience.
      ANGLE - FRANK
      He scans the audience intensely, face to face.

63A   EXT. MAYAN - BACKSTAGE DOOR - NIGHT                        63A

      Rachel's limo stands waiting. CAMERA PULLS BACK to
      reveal a black Toyota 4 X 4 parked among the other cars.

63B   INT. MAYAN - NIGHT                                         63B
      Rachel approaches the end of her song, her voice coming
      ever stronger. Spector comes up to Frank in the wings,
      positioning himself combatively between Frank and his
      view of Rachel.
                            SPECTOR
               Are we having a communications problem
               here?
                            FRANK
               What?
      Spector's presence is a distraction. Frank steps to one
      side for a better view of Rachel. Spector moves too.
                            SPECTOR
               Apparently, I didn't make it clear
               to you how things go around here.
                            FRANK
               You told me you were going to
               tell her. And you didn't.
                            SPECTOR
               I didn't think she could handle it.
                            FRANK
               But she handled it fine.
      Frank continues to peer past Spector's shoulder, his
      vigilance undiminished. Soothed and nurtured by the
      obvious admiration of her audience, Rachel's fear is
      beginning to vanish. The song is taking over. Spector
      changes tack, becoming confidential, "man-to-man."

                                                                     53.

                           SPECTOR
              Look. Frank, I know what you're
              saying. I know you want to do
              what's best for her. I understand
              that. You have a job to do here.
              But you have to understand that
              Rachel has a job to do too. And
              that's what she's doing - out
              there. She's working, Frank.
              That's what she does and that's
              where she does it. She's hot
              right now. This is the time for
              her. If she doesn't get out there,
              she's dead. Forget about crazy
              death threats, if she doesn't
              sing, she's dead anyway... Look,
              handled properly, this thing could
              be good for a million dollars'
              worth of free publicity.
     Frank grabs him by the collar and slams him up against a
     wall of curtain ropes.
                           FRANK
              One word.
                           SPECTOR
              It could clinch her the nomination.
                           FRANK
              One word in print about any of
              this...
     Spector nods, half-gasping. Frank tightens his grip.
     Frank's attention is drawn by a renewed roar from the
     crowd.
                           SPECTOR
              Trouble with you is you don't
              understand the sympathy vote.

64   INT. STAGE - NIGHT                                         64
     Rachel scans the crowd, spread before her like a surreal
     mural.
     Camera flashbulbs explode like crazy through the glare.
     The thundering adoration is like a stimulant. She darts
     a look to Frank and gives him a fierce "naughty girl"
     smile.
                           RACHEL
                     (turning back to
                      crowd)
              You like that? Would like to
              hear another? Billy?

                                                                     54.


     From the wings, Billy Thomas gives her the nod to go for
     it. It seems to be alright with everyone. The band
     starts playing a dance beat.
                           RACHEL
                     (on the prowl)
              I think my feet are trying to
              tell me something... wanna see a
              new video?
     The crowd explodes. They know what song is coming.
     They start to move with Rachel.
                           RACHEL
                     (dancing, talking)
              I want to dance...
     She skitters to the other side of the stage, baiting her
     fans. Her new video explodes across the video wall
     behind her. The crowd surges forward.
     Two security guards nervously tense up, watching the
     crowd. When one fan tries to climb onstage, Frank
     reaches out and unbalances him, so that the man falls
     back into the audience. Another man climbs the stage on
     the other side. One of the guards darts out like a
     ballboy at a tennis match, pushes the fan back and
     scurries to the far side to resume his vigilance. The
     crowd is getting even more excited, pressing closer,
     trying to touch Rachel.
     The security guards move in, but Rachel gestures for
     them to back off.
     ANGLE - FRANK
     Frank's task has suddenly become impossible. A forest of
     hands and faces start to engulf Rachel. Anyone could be
     the killer. Frank's eyes  dart over them all, his gaze
     intense, as if trying to hold them off by sheer willpower.
     RACHEL'S POV
     Looking offstage at Frank. His frustration is almost
     intoxicating to her. She struts over the lip of the
     stage. A man leaps up from audience to join her. Frank
     starts forward. Rachel gestures to him to hold back,
     waving him off.

65   INT. WINGS - NIGHT                                         65
     Spector stands well out of Frank's reach, staring at Rachel
     onstage. He catches Frank's attention, yelling back
     defiantly.

                                                                     55.

                           SPECTOR
              Look at her, fucking great.

66   INT. ONSTAGE - NIGHT                                       66
     Rachel dances erotically with the man -- bumping and
     grinding, sinking to her knees. The crowd roars
     approval.
     Frank quickly sizes up the scene. He speaks into a SURV
     KIT microphone in his sleeve. Across the room we see
     Henry listening, pushing an earpiece to his ear. Henry
     quickly scurries to an exit. Frank starts moving toward
     the stage. At that moment, the lucky man Rachel's
     dancing with grabs her around the waist and spins her
     gleefully, like the dance partner she has been pretending
     to be. One of security guards rushes forward to extri-
     cate her. The spinning man inadvertently bumps hard
     into the guard and the man loses his grip on Rachel.
     She flies out of his grasp and tumbles off the front of
     the stage -- into the adoring arms of a half dozen fans.
     The audience goes wild. This is the kind of thing
     Rachel was famous for when she was starting out. The
     scene resembles a rugby scrum... with Rachel the ball.

     Frank sees Rachel being passed over the heads of fans --
     deeper into the audience. Her dress is ripped and torn
     apart. The silver headpiece is dislodged and disappears
     into the crowd.
     CLOSE ON RACHEL
     Fear fills her face. She's gone over the edge, literally
     and figuratively. She's lost control. Tony and the
     security guards are fighting to get to her, slamming
     bodies out of the way. In the b.g., the video continues
     on its serene, uninterrupted way.
     FRANK'S POV
     He spots a fire extinguisher in the wings.
     BACK TO SCENE
     Frank grabs it and heads to center stage. He aims the
     extinguisher at the crowd between Rachel and the stage.
     The chemical foam does its job, scattering fans.
     Frank leaps onto the floor, kicking a wild-eyed young
     blond man in the chest as he fights his way to Rachel,
     taking her in his arms. Tony runs ahead of Frank, knocks
     a fan off the stage and waves for Frank to follow.

                                                                       56.

                            FRANK
               Tony, not there.
                            TONY
               I'll take care of this.
     He heads for the door.

                            TONY
               Just follow me.
     He turns and heads out to the sidewalk like a bull.

67   EXT. THE MAYAN - NIGHT                                       67

     Tony bursts out the front door and begins cutting a
     swath through the crowd. Rain beats down.
                            TONY
               Make way here. Outta the way!
     A burly street regular gets a shove from Tony and comes
     back hard. The  crowd immediately sides with him, yells
     encouragement.  But Tony is the better man and sends him
     sprawling. The  rest of the way to the curb opens up.
     At the parking area Tony discovers there is no limo and
     turns in bewilderment to Rachel. But she is not there.
     A couple of people laugh.

68   EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                           68
     Rachel and Frank emerge from the darkness between two
     garbage bins and get into the limo Henry has waiting there.
     The car moves out with a SCREECH of tires, narrowly missing
     Spector as he staggers out of the building.
                           SPECTOR
               Hey! What the fuck... Farmer!
               Farmer! Come back here...
     The limo skids around the corner and speeds off up the
     street, leaving Spector in helpless fury -- apoplectic and
     speechless.

69   INT. LIMO - NIGHT                                            69
     Frank turns and looks at Rachel.    She is diminutive,
     doll-like, alone in the center of   the large limousine
     seat. Her  hands rise to her face   and her body begins to
     shake with sobs as she sits there   alone in the tattered
     remains of her dress.
     Frank turns away to avoid staring at her, but he feels

                                                                     57.

     uncomfortable.   Henry senses what is going on and
     speaks softly.
                           HENRY
              Never done that before.
                           FRANK
              It's been a long night.

70   INT. THE MAYAN - NIGHT                                     70
     The crowd is thinning out. A dim worklight is burning
     somewhere backstage. The auditorium is a mess; the
     cleaning crew has begun to work on the debris from the
     riot. FOOTSTEPS APPROACH, walking, pausing, as if looking
     for something.
     Lying on the floor in big CLOSEUP we see a small  fragment
     of Rachel's dress. The FOOTSTEPS STOP by it. A    hand
     picks it up gently and lifts it OUT OF FRAME. We   hear the
     sound of a deep lingering INHALATION of breath.   The feet
     move on.

71   INT. MARRON HOUSE - NIGHT                                  71
     Fletcher is asleep in his bed. Frank waits as Rachel
     glances in. Then she moves away. Opening the door to
     her room, she steps back, allowing him to enter ahead.

72   INT. RACHEL'S ROOM - NIGHT                                 72
     Frank moves quickly into the room, checking the window
     and French door. Rachel waits silently by the door.
     All is clear. He steps back to the door. As he
     approaches her she begins to tremble.
     He gently reaches out and takes her in his arms. Slowly
     holding her he leads her to bed, moving aside some of
     Rachel's dolls, laid out on the pillows.
     Her hands go automatically to her dress but they are
     shaking so badly she cannot undo it. Frank gently does
     it for her. She willingly allows him to undress her and
     not a word is spoken between them. As she sits naked
     still trembling, he pulls down the covers and guides her
     gently into bed.
     As he adjusts the covers she reaches up and takes hold of
     his hand. He looks down, stroking her forehead like a
     child's.
                           RACHEL
              Aren't you going to ask me why I
              behave like that?

                                                                    58.


                            FRANK
              I know why.

73   INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                                      73

     Frank sits alone at a table in the huge kitchen, care-
     fully cutting and eating a peach.  The door at the other
     end of the room slams open and Tony stalks in, soaking
     wet. He has just made his way home  from the MAYAN and he
     is boiling. He sights on Frank and  moves toward him fast.
     Frank just watches until Tony is almost upon him. As
     Tony reaches out to lift him by his shirt, Frank spins
     low out of his seat. Tony's legs are knocked out from
     under him. He lands hard on his back and finds himself
     looking up at Frank, who holds him down with the chair he
     was sitting on, like a lion tamer, a leg strut pressed
     against Tony's throat. Frank looks down at him question-
     ingly, as if to ask, "Had enough?"
     Tony scowls and nods. Frank lifts the chair away. Tony
     stands up and faces him. Frank turns away and Tony
     throws a punch at his head, barely catching him as Frank
     ducks and moves in under it. He hits Tony twice and
     throws him against a cabinet. Tony gets up slowly, looks
     around and grabs a carving knife from a hook on the wall.
     He holds it in front of him threateningly.
     Frank shakes his head. He's getting irritated. He picks
     up the knife he's been using on the peach and flips it in
     his hand so he's holding it by the blade. With the same
     fluid motion we've seen earlier, he throws it at Tony.
     It sticks in the wall an inch from Tony's ear. Tony
     does a slow take and then lowers his blade. Frank picks
     up his dirty dish and takes it to the sink. He glances
     at Tony.
                           FRANK
              I don't want to talk about this
              again.

74   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - DRIVEWAY - DAWN                      74
     Frank has been talking to the uniformed guard in the gate
     house and now begins walking up the drive toward the man-
     sion.
     The grounds are quiet, beautiful, misty.
     We see him from behind some foliage, as if he's being
     covertly observed, stalked. A twig snaps and he turns
     sharply. It's Rachel. She's dressed in a soft jumpsuit
     and starts jogging out from behind the bushes towards him.

                                                            59.

The suit softens her appearance; she looks lovely. Her
manner, too, has altered; she is charming -- friendly and
very girlish.
                       RACHEL
         Hey!   Gotcha, didn't I?

                         FRANK
         Hey.
                      RACHEL
         You're probably wondering what I'm
         doing.
                (as Frank nods)
         You didn't know I jogged, did you?

Frank shakes his head.
                      RACHEL
         What's the matter? 'Fraid I'll
         get picked off in my snazzy running
         suit?
                     FRANK
         No. I'm afraid I'll have to jog
         with you.
They both smile.
                        RACHEL
         Great.    I guess I can't do it.
Rachel stops pumping, gasps for air, and for one moment,
rests a hand on Frank's arm to support herself. She
removes it quickly.
                      RACHEL
         Will you walk with me a little?
Frank nods and they cut off across the grounds.
                      RACHEL
                (hard for her)
         I know this is kinda late, but
         thank you. I'm really glad you're
         here.
                (she looks at him)
         I'm going to try to cooperate.
                      FRANK
         That would be good.
They walk in silence for few moments. When Rachel
finally speaks, she sounds genuinely unsure of herself,
nervous. It's very appealing. And if it's an act, she's
a terrific actress.

                                                                   60.

                           RACHEL
              Farmer... I have this problem.
              This minor little problem. You
              see, I'd like to go out for an
              evening. Just me and a guy. You
              know...
                     (makes a funny face)
              ... like a 'date.' But I can't go
              out on a date because you have to
              be with me every minute. I mean,
              what if he invited me up to his
              place afterwards? Are you going
              to come, too?
                     (a beat)
              So the only thing I can figure is
              for you to take me out.
                     (pause)
              So... that's what I was wondering
              ... you know. What do you think?
              But only if you want to.
     Frank is bemused.
                           RACHEL
              Only if you want to... I'm not so
              bad...
                     (looks at him)
              God, this is embarrassing. I'm
              gonna run up ahead there. You
              decide.
     She runs up the hill to the pool area, which is now above
     them. He walks up after her.

75   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - BALCONY - DAY                       75
     Nicki is yelling from a window on the second floor of
     the mansion. Fletcher peers out with her.
                             NICKI (O.S.)
              Rachel!    Sandy Harris is on the
              phone!
     Rachel and Frank look up.
                           RACHEL
              Tell her she'll have to wait,
              babe. I'm getting fixed up here.
     AT WINDOW - CLOSE ON NICKI
     She watches Frank and Rachel, her expression neutral.
     She turns away. Fletcher continues to watch his mother
     with Frank.

                                                                       61.

76   INT. DAN-DEE CAR WASH-O-RAMA (L.A.) - WASH TUNNEL -          76
     DAY
     The SOUND is DEAFENING. A wet car comes out of the
     tunnel of machinery. In the distance, glimpsed through
     the spinning brushes, Henry talks to a couple of workers
     as he waits for the limo to be cleaned.

     Hands appear with a large chamois cloth, moving easily
     and fast over the hood and windshield. A black in his
     early twenties is finishing the exterior of the car.
     A second pair of hands appear.    White hands in rubber
     gloves. They open the  driver's   door and push a vacuum
     suction hose inside.  The hands   switch ON the car RADIO,
     loud. Loud enough to  hear over   the din outside the car.
     The hose works its way over the   front seats.
                           D.J. (V.O.)
              ... And here's another biggie
              from a lady very much in the news
              these days, Miss Rachel Marron...
     We see the owner of the hands. It is the young blond
     man Frank kicked aside at the MAYAN. His name is DAN.
     His face is impassive.
                           D.J. (V.O.)
              ... the hit song from the movie...
              Queen Of The Night... I Have
              Nothing.
     The song begins and Rachel's voice fights the din. In
     the back of the car, Dan's hose probes around, nosing
     into all the crevices of the upholstery. It sucks up a
     crumpled pre-signed photograph of Rachel from the gap
     beside the rear seat. The hose is switched off and the
     gloved hands retrieve the picture.

77   INT. LOCKER ROOM - WASH-A-RAMA - DAY                         77
     Tight, shabby facilities. Dan opens the combination
     padlock to his locker and deposits the crumpled photo
     inside.
     As the hands remove the rubber gloves, the inside of the
     locker is revealed. Pasted over every inch of the locker
     are pictures of Rachel Marron. One tabloid shot of her
     dancing with the word "whore" scrawled across it. Taped
     to a single sheet of white paper in the center, like a
     holy relic, is the torn scrap of Rachel's dress from the
     MAYAN. The hands pin up the newly-acquired photo next to
     it.

                                                                    62.

84   INT. FBI LABORATORY - DAY                                 84
     Special Agent Court is seated next to a white-coated
     technician. The technician is leaning over one of the
     neatly pasted-up death threats we have seen earlier.
     With a scalpel, he lifts the word "whore" from out of the
     message. He sets it on a white sheet, then brings the
     blade back and scrapes at the residue of the dry glue on
     the letter.

     CUTTING DOWN HIS ATTACKERS

85   EXT. KOKUSAI THEATRE - NIGHT                              85

     Frank and Rachel exit with a small crowd.    Rachel wears a
     scarf and tinted glasses. The combination    goes a long
     way toward disguising her. They pause at    one of the dis-
     play windows. Inside is a poster for the    movie, Yojimbo,
     a large picture of Toshiro Mifune looking   scruffy and
     fierce.
                            RACHEL
               Well, he didn't look like he
               wanted to die to me.
                           FRANK
              There's a big difference between
              wanting to die and having no fear
              of death.
     They walk down the sidewalk.
                           RACHEL
              And because he had no fear of
              death, he was invincible?
                           FRANK
              What do you think?
                           RACHEL
              Well, he sure creamed 'em all in
              the end.
                           FRANK
              Yeah, it was a good movie.
     They walk off down the sidewalk.
                           RACHEL
              How many times have you seen it?
                           FRANK
              Sixty-two.

                                                                 63.

86   INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT                                       86
     It's a bit of a dive, but the food is good and the atmos-
     phere is great.
                           RACHEL
              Your kinda place?

     Frank nods.
                            FRANK
              Yeah.
                           RACHEL
              Your kinda music?

     As she smiles:
                            FRANK
              Absolutely.
                           RACHEL
              You figure no one can get by you
              here?
                           FRANK
              If someone is willing to swap his
              life for a kill, nothing can stop
              him.
                            RACHEL
              Great.   What do I need you for?
                           FRANK
              He might get me instead.
                           RACHEL
              And you're ready to die for me?
                           FRANK
              That's my job.
     Rachel looks at him.
                           RACHEL
              And you'd do it? Why?
                           FRANK
              I can't sing.
                           RACHEL
              Maybe there's some glory in saving
              a president or something, but just
              anyone...
                           FRANK
              You mean like you?    It's a matter

                                                         64.

          of conditioning and discipline.
                       RACHEL
          I don't trust discipline. At the
          crucial moment I'd cop out.
                       FRANK
          That happens.
                       RACHEL
          But not with you, Fierce Frank.
                         FRANK
          It happens.
A beat.

                       RACHEL
          Have you ever liked anybody?
                       FRANK
          What do you mean?
                       RACHEL
          Like me -- a girl.
Frank knows what she's driving at. But he's not at all
happy to relinquish this information.
                       FRANK
          A long time ago.
                       RACHEL
          What happened? Do you mind if I
          ask?
                       FRANK
          Do you mind if I don't answer?
                       RACHEL
          I don't want to pry...
Frank smiles at that.
                       RACHEL
                 (begins to laugh,
                  can't help herself)
          She didn't die did she? You
          weren't like... protecting her and
          she got killed?
Frank is silent, grim.    Rachel looks stricken.
                         RACHEL
          Oh, my god!    That's it, isn't it?

                                                                   65.

                           FRANK
              Nobody's perfect.
     Rachel is taken aback.
                           RACHEL
              Oh Frank, I'm sorry.

     Frank laughs.
                           FRANK
              No... Nice try though.
                     (pause)
              It was less dramatic than that.
              She didn't love me anymore. Can
              you imagine such a thing?

     Frank puts a smiling spin on this last; it's pretty
     charming. Rachel looks at him.
                           RACHEL
              No, not really.
     A SONG comes on the JUKEBOX -- 'WHAT BECOMES OF THE BROKEN
     HEARTED.' Frank smiles as Rachel begins to sing.
                           RACHEL
              So, is this a full service date,
              Frank?
     Frank's wary.
                           RACHEL
              I'm just asking you to dance.

87   INT. DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT                                 87
     Frank and Rachel navigate a tiny dance floor. Frank is a
     surprisingly good dancer and is comfortable being this
     close to her.
     Rachel hums softly, picking up the words to the song.   As
     we listen to the lyrics something clicks in her head.
                           RACHEL
              You like this?
                              FRANK
              Yeah.
     A beat, then Rachel bursts out laughing.
                            FRANK
                      (reddening)
              What?

                                                                      66.

                           RACHEL
                     (trying to compose
                      herself)
              I'm sorry... It's just that...
              It's so depressing.
     Now they're both laughing.

                           FRANK
                     (grinning)
              It is, isn't it.
     Suddenly a dish drops to the floor. Frank, still dancing,
     makes a smooth quick turn that puts his body between
     Rachel and the noise. His head turns to locate the source
     of the noise.

                           RACHEL
              Don't worry, I'll protect you.
     They drift back into the music, Rachel singing, Frank
     watching.

88   EXT. FRANK'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                  88
     Frank's car is parked in the driveway.    A light goes on
     in a basement window.

89   INT. FRANK'S HOUSE - BASEMENT                               89
     Frank hangs back, drink in hand, as Rachel explores the
     basement. Frank has fitted it out as a combination gym/
     target range/weapons workshop. The place has a kind of
     unfussy order about it, a simplicity.
                           RACHEL
                     (almost to herself)
              It's very quiet here.
     She walks to some shelves -- a random selection of
     books, football and karate trophies, framed citations
     and other memorabilia. She glances at a dusty framed
     photo of a football team.
                           RACHEL
                     (reading)
              West Virginia University Football.
              God, look at you.
     She looks at Frank, quizzically.
                           RACHEL
              What'd you play?

                                                           67.

                        FRANK
         End.
                      RACHEL
         Were you tough?
                        FRANK
         No.    Fast.
Rachel puts down her drink and moves toward a samurai
sword that is mounted in its scabbard on the wall. She
looks at it, peering closely.
                      RACHEL
         You some kind of a samurai, too?

Frank smiles.
                      RACHEL
         They said you were in the Secret
         Service. What made you get out?
Frank moves away and sits on a sofa against the wall.
                        FRANK
         Money.
Rachel looks around at Frank's modest home.
                      RACHEL
         I can see your tastes are
         extravagant.
She looks at Frank and then back at the sword.   She
reaches out to touch it.
                        RACHEL
         May I?
Frank nods. Rachel takes it off its mount carefully,
unhooks the scabbard and begins to slide it off.
                      FRANK
         Watch yourself.
Rachel slides the scabbard off. The naked blade is
breathtaking. Rachel holds the sword out before her.
She walks toward Frank, then stops and looks over the
blade at him.
                      RACHEL
         You're a hard one to figure, Frank
         Farmer.
He stares at her. She steps closer, so the blade is only
about a foot from his face.

                                                                      68.

                           RACHEL
              It seems to me a bodyguard must
              know little peace.
     Frank stands up so that the point of the sword is only
     about an inch from his chest. He reaches out over the
     blade to Rachel's neck and unties the silk scarf she is
     wearing there. One hand draws the scarf away. The other
     hand lingers for a moment on her neck, then lifts away.
                            FRANK
              Watch this.
     He has raised the scarf over his head, in   the space
     between them. With two hands he spreads    it out and then
     lets it go. Slowly, billowing, the scarf    floats down
     over the blade and is cut in two. These    two pieces float
     slowly to the floor.
     Frank takes Rachel's wrist and moves the sword away to
     the side. They are both holding it as Rachel presses her
     body against Frank's and they begin to kiss.

90   INT. FRANK'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT                        90
     Their lovemaking is INTERCUT with SLOW MOTION black and
     white images of Samurai warriors from the movie,
     Yojimbo.

91   INT. FRANK'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER                        91
     They lie nude under a sheet.
                           RACHEL
              I've never been this safe before.
     Frank smiles.
                           RACHEL
              No one could get by you.
                           FRANK
              Right now it might not be so hard.
     Rachel laughs, kisses him and buries her head down into
     his shoulder. Frank stares across the bed at the samurai
     sword lying on the floor. Some of Rachel's clothing is
     draped in a heap across it. The torn pieces of her scarf
     lie nearby. HOLD ON Frank's look.
                                                 SHOCK CUT TO:
92   INT. FRANK'S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING                         92
     The roller-blind is raised with a sharp, snapping sound.
     Frank is moving around the room, getting dressed. Rachel

                                                            69.

is still in the bed behind him, woken by the noise of his
activity.
                     RACHEL
         What? What is it? What are you
         doing?

Frank keeps moving, looking for his shoes.
                         RACHEL
         Frank?
                      FRANK
         Rachel, I don't want to get
         confused about what I'm doing
         here.

                      RACHEL
         I'm not confused.
Frank finds his shoes.
                      FRANK
         You pay me to protect you, that's
         what I do.
Rachel sits up.
                     RACHEL
         What? Have I done something
         wrong?
                         FRANK
         No, nothing.
                      RACHEL
         Then what is it?
She lifts the sheet seductively and looks over the top
of it.
                      RACHEL
         Do you want me to beg?
                      FRANK
         No, I want you to do without.
She stops.
                      RACHEL
         What's going on, Frank?
                      FRANK
         I want to keep it straight in my
         head what job I'm doing.

                                                              70.

                      RACHEL
         And what is that exactly?    Making
         me feel like shit?
                      FRANK
         No, I'm sorry. This is my fault.

                      RACHEL
         Don't apologize for godsake. Just
         tell me what I did. I'm a big
         girl.
                      FRANK
         You didn't do anything. It was me.
         I involved myself with my client.

Rachel picks up on the word.
                      RACHEL
         Your "client"?
                      FRANK
         I made a mistake.
                      RACHEL
         What mistake?... You don't find me
         attractive anymore.
                      FRANK
         Christ! I've told you why. I
         can't protect you like this.
                       RACHEL
         And what?   That's it for me?
                      FRANK
         Yeah...
                      RACHEL
         I don't believe it.
He automatically checks the gun as he slips it into the
holster.
                      FRANK
         You can live with that or you can
         fire me.
                      RACHEL
         But I can't fuck you.
Frank turns and looks at her.    This is hard for him, too.
                      RACHEL
         I don't believe this...
         I'm asking you?... Let me tell
         you...

                                                                     71.


     She stops suddenly and, with a roar of combined frus-
     tration, humiliation and rage, she lurches from the bed
     in search of her clothes. Frank shuts his eyes in morti-
     fication and pain.


93   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - POOLSIDE - EARLY MORNING              93
     A nanny sits in the early morning mist, embroidering.
     Frank is kneeling with Fletcher beside the pool. He's
     putting new batteries into Fletcher's boat. Fletcher
     watches him as he tears off the wrapping from the
     batteries, much preoccupied.
                              FLETCHER
                        (watching him)
                 She's real mad at you, isn't she?
     Frank stops what he's doing and just looks blankly at the
     batteries in his hands. There's a beat of silence.
                              FLETCHER
                 She told me she doesn't understand
                 why you're so shitty to her...
     Frank's shoulders droop and he lets out an imperceptible
     sigh. He gently resumes fitting the batteries, still
     not looking at Fletcher. In the quiet of early morning,
     it's almost like a confessional.
                              FRANK
                 I've spent a lot of time learning
                 not to react to things like other
                 people do. It's my job. But it
                 doesn't always work, Fletcher...
                 it doesn't always work.
                              FLETCHER
                 I don't think I understand.
                              FRANK
                        (looks at him)
                 I'm an old man compared to you,
                 pal, and I don't understand either.
                 And I'm starting to get the
                 feeling I never will.
     There's a crunch of footsteps behind him.       He looks
     around.
     With a big flourish, a copy of Daily Variety is put down
     in front of us, front page upwards.
                             NICKI (O.S.)
                 Ta Da!

                                                                    72.

     Frank takes in that it's Nicki then glances at Variety,
     lying on the concrete beside him. Splashed across the
     top, the headlines announce the day's news of the
     Academy Award nominations. Rachel's name is among the
     Best Actress nominees. The Hollywood Reporter follows.
     Frank picks up Variety and stares at it. Nicki stands
     beside him with the morning's mail under her arm.

                           NICKI
                     (looking at him)
              Thought you'd like to know.
              Everyone said she was a sure thing.
              Of course, you know all about that.
     She raises an eyebrow, gives him a look. Frank looks
     steadily back at her. She drops a small pile of mail
     beside the magazines... several letters and a small
     packet. She's embarrassed by Frank's gaze.
                           NICKI
              I'm sorry. That was out of line.
              It's none of my business... Here's
              today's question marks for you.
     She turns and walks briskly back to the house. Frank
     watches her go, then looks slowly down to the pile.
     From across the pool, Fletcher watches silently, then
     pushes his boat out into the deep water.

94   INT. SQUIRREL HILL PRODUCTIONS - JANITOR'S ROOM - DAY     94
     Frank is investigating the small packet, with a surgeon's
     precision, checking it with a stethoscope and a metal
     detector, sniffing at it.
     It has been addressed in the normal way, except that
     Rachel's name has been cut out of a magazine and pasted
     above the address. He begins carefully slicing away the
     wrapping. Inside is a cardboard box. The contents are
     still hidden by packing paper. He picks it away with
     tweezers. Suddenly there is a LOUD BUZZING from the box
     and movement in the paper. Frank drops the box into a
     bed of sand in a sink surrounded by sandbags.
     The movement slows and stops. Frank extracts the item --
     it is a wind-up mechanical beaver with a hand-painted
     sign hung around its neck:
                     WE LOVE YOU, RACHEL
                     YOUR FANS IN BEAVER, PA.
                     SALLY AND KATE.
     The beaver's TEETH CLICK in Frank's hand.
     We see Frank's face. This may just have taken years off
     his life. He holds his hand out straight, palm downwards,

                                                                   73.

     and looks at it.   No tremor.   Just checking.
     Spector's voice suddenly shouts from the next door office.
                            SPECTOR (O.S.)
              Farmer!   Get in here!


95   INT. SQUIRREL HILL PRODUCTIONS - RACHEL'S OFFICE - DAY   95
     The office is filled with congratulatory balloons and
     flowers heralding the morning's news. Spector's secretary
     is taking congratulatory phone messages at a desk in the
     b.g. Two assistants are struggling in through the door
     with a large basketed floral arrangement.

     Spector confronts Frank across his desk.
                           SPECTOR
              Put together a list of   your
              expenses. Your total    billing...
              Let me have it in one   hour and
              I'll see that a check   is cut.
                           FRANK
              Don't you ever say what's on your
              mind?
     Spector cannot believe he's being so addressed --
     especially in front the staff. The assistants stop in
     their tracks and look.
                           SPECTOR
                     (almost shouts)
              What's on my mind is that you're
              fired, Frank. She missed all her
              interviews yesterday because of
              your little date. Do you realize
              she stood up Barbara Walters?
              First you fuck up her career...
     Behind Spector, out of his line of sight, Rachel and
     Devaney appear in the doorway with more cards. They
     also stop and listen.
                           SPECTOR
              ... and now you're fucking with
              her head.
                           FRANK
              That's between us.
                           SPECTOR
              You think so? You forget who signs
              your check. You don't understand
              the role I play around here.

                                                              74.

                       FRANK
         No.   I understand.
Spector stiffens, then decides not to take this one on.
                      SPECTOR
         Get your shit together and be out
         of here by noon.
                        DEVANEY
         Frank stays.
Spector looks round, sees that Devaney and Rachel have
been listening. Rachel is silent. With a curt nod of
his head, Spector gestures to the assistants to leave the
room. Devaney weighs in.

                      DEVANEY
         With this high a profile, Rachel
         needs protection now more than
         ever. If he goes, you can forget
         Miami...
                      SPECTOR
         She's signed the fucking contract,
         Bill. You want me to read it to
         you?
Rachel is watching them both.
                      DEVANEY
         Fuck the contract. If he goes,
         she's not singing a note. It's
         too dangerous.
                      SPECTOR
         Oh. 'Fuck the contract.' Great.
         Why don't you let Rachel speak for
         herself? I think she has some say
         in this.
                      RACHEL
                (flatly)
         Frank stays.
Spector considers her for a beat, then looks at the others.
The secretary interrupts from the back of the office.
                      SECRETARY (O.S.)
         Mr. Schiller calling on line one...
Spector ignores her, still holding his look at Devaney,
Rachel and Frank.
                      SPECTOR
         Well, I guess this is democracy in
         action.

                                                             75.


Rachel nods. Spector, turning to take the call, flashes
her a "little boy" look.
                     SPECTOR
         I gave in. That's not easy for
         me. Don't I get a hug?

Rachel is stone-faced.   Spector covers by picking up the
phone.
                      SPECTOR
                (into phone)
         Yeah?... Sure, put him on... Ben
         how are you?... uh huh...

Frank and Rachel look at each other in silence.
                      SPECTOR
         ...The Ambassador? What the hell
         are you trying to pull, Ben?
         Rachel always gets the
         Presidential... I don't care what
         you thought...
Devaney leans to Frank as Spector's conversation continues
in the b.g.
                      DEVANEY
         Do you know the Fontainebleau
         Hotel in Miami Beach?
Frank nods.
                      DEVANEY
         How does the Ambassador Suite
         compare to the Presidential for
         us?
Frank thinks only for a moment.
                      FRANK
         It's on the twentieth    floor in the
         south wing. There's a     service
         elevator right there.     Mainly
         ocean windows. Should     be no
         problem.
                      SPECTOR
                (into phone)
         ... I'm aware of that, Ben, but
         let me just remind you people
         that you invited us...
Frank turns toward the door.

                                                                     76.

                           RACHEL
                     (to Frank)
              Hang around, Farmer. We might
              need your vaunted expertise.
     She reaches forward and hits a button on Spector's desk,
     throwing the call onto a speaker.

                           RACHEL
                     (sweetly)
              Hello, Ben honey.
                           SCHILLER (V.O.)
              Rachel, congratulations, you must
              be thrilled at the...

                           RACHEL
                     (across him)
              Ben. I hear you've got me in the
              annex next to the kitchen.

96   EXT. FONTAINEBLEAU HOTEL (MIAMI BEACH) - HELICOPTER SHOT 96
     - DAY
     We COME STREAKING IN OVER the ocean TOWARD the towering
     white Fontainebleau.
     ON the SOUNDTRACK, we hear JOHN TESH'S VOICE filling the
     viewers in on the latest Hollywood dirt.
                           JOHN TESH (V.O.)
              ...It's off to Sun City today for
              Best Actress nominee Rachel Marron.
              Rachel's giving two AIDS charity
              concerts this week at Miami's
              Fontainebleau Hotel. A thousand a
              plate no less. And rumor has it
              that the lovely lady has unseated
              the governor of Florida himself.
              Seems there was a showdown on
              who'll get to lounge in that big
              Fontainebleau penthouse tonight.
     As we CIRCLE the top floor, we see a tiny figure on the
     balcony.
                           JOHN TESH (V.O.)
              Well, sleep tight in the
              Presidential Suite, Rachel. Who
              says a nomination isn't as good as
              winning...

97   EXT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - BALCONY - DAY                    97
     Frank looks up at the disappearing helicopter then down

                                                                   77.

     over the edge and around the corner. He leans slightly
     against the wrought iron railing. It sways precariously.
     Frank catches himself.
                            FRANK
              Thuringer.

     Frank kneels and inspects the fixture that anchors it to
     the cement balcony: the cement crumbles around it, a
     weld joint is broken on the side. THURINGER, the hotel
     security chief, joins Frank on the balcony. Frank shakes
     the railing.
                             THURINGER
              God damn.    I'll get someone right
              on it.


98   INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - DAY                            98
     Frank walks quickly across the living  room of the lavish
     suite.  Two uniformed security guards  are making a sweep
     of the room with POLICE DOGS. Frank   checks the drawer of
     a side table and then seals it with a  peel-off security
     tape.  Thuringer is waiting near the  entrance hall.
     Frank nods to him.
                            FRANK
              Okay.   Let's go.

99   INT. HALLWAY - 15TH FLOOR - DAY                          99
     This is a semi-private corridor; several hotel employees
     are steam-cleaning the carpet. Frank looks at them, then
     Thuringer.
                           THURINGER
              It's okay, they've been cleared.
     He shows his clipboard to Frank. As the two men walk
     along the corridor, the guest elevator opens and a
     twelve-year-old boy in a bathing suit (MARK KATZ) steps
     out, accompanied by his nanny. In the background, hotel
     security men are checking fire-extinguishers and closets.
                           THURINGER
                     (to Frank)
              The Katzes of St. Louis. Very
              prominent. Come every year. An
              elderly couple and three
              grandchildren. A nurse and a maid.
     They pass the little boy as he reaches the door of the
     Katz suite with his nanny.

                                                                  78.

                            THURINGER
               Hi, Mark.
                            MARK
               Hi.
      Frank smiles and nods to the nanny.

                            THURINGER
                      (to Frank)
               Theirs is the only suite on the
               floor.
      The two men reach the service elevator and the emergency
      exit door at the end of the hall. Frank opens the stair-
      way door and goes inside. Thuringer follows.

                            THURINGER
               As you asked, the rooms below have
               been kept vacant.

100   INT. STAIRWAY - DAY                                       100
      The doorway closes behind the two men. Frank tries it;
      it's locked. They continue down the stairs.

105   INT. KITCHEN - DAY                                        105
      Frank and Thuringer walk into and along the edge of the
      busy kitchen.

109   INT. OFFSTAGE AREA - DAY                                  109
      Frank walks ahead of Thuringer. He looks around and
      pauses at the edge of the stage. Then he steps out on a
      stage. A piano tuner is at work in the corner.

110   INT. ON STAGE - DAY                                       110
      FRANK'S POV -
      as he looks out at the mammoth room.
      Frank stands center stage and looks around. The naked-
      ess of this spot gets to him. He shakes his head and
      looks at Thuringer. Thuringer smiles.
                            FRANK
               What a silly job this is.

                                                                     79.

111   INT. FONTAINEBLEAU HOTEL - LOWER LOBBY - DAY                 111
      Behind the glass doors that lead to the pool, bright
      quartz lights clock on. A camera crew stands waiting.
      Someone mimes a "we're rolling" sign with his hands.
      Inside Rachel waits with Spector and BEN SCHILLER, the
      tough, fat fellow who owns the place. Frank is at her
      elbow.
                            SPECTOR
               O.K. Rachel. It's showtime!
               They're rolling. Let's go.
                            FRANK
               Is this really necessary?

                               SPECTOR
               Yes.   It is.
                            RACHEL
               Quit bitching, Farmer. This is
               the part you do get paid for.
      Rachel sweeps out the door.    The camera crew hurries to
      keep up with her.

112   EXT. POOL AREA - DAY                                         112
      This place is crowded with hundreds   of guests basking on
      chaise lounges. A sea of sun-baked    faces virtually as
      far as the eye can see. The sight    of the crowd and the
      presence of the news crew seems to   push Rachel to a
      whole new adrenaline level.
      Rachel walks among them, moving swiftly, evaluating the
      bodies displayed before her in words and expressions,
      playing to the camera.
                           RACHEL
               Oh my God. Look what they're
               wearing. Mother, hide your eyes...
      Heads turn to look.
                            RACHEL
               I couldn't wear that suit... Honey,
               you're naked... Of course, if I
               had a body like that...
      There is a murmur of recognition from some of the guests.
      She pauses to shake a hand, and now all the guests
      throughout the pool area are aware that Rachel Marron is
      among them.
      People stand on chairs, scramble for pens and paper, run

                                                            80.

to get a closer look. Lounges collapse, drink GLASSES are
BROKEN, flower tubs are trampled. A lot of pushing and
shoving starts - too much for the video crew, who abandon
the filming attempt.
                     SPECTOR
         Great, babe. They got what they
         needed. Let's get back inside.
Frank increases his pace to keep by Rachel's side, gently
easing a path for her. Schiller scurries behind in
Frank's wake.
Rachel turns suddenly as a tall good-looking lifeguard
appears in the throng. She eyes him appreciatively.

                      RACHEL
                (to lifeguard)
         You look like a man of good taste
         to me. Come to my party tonight.
                (to Schiller)
         Ben, make sure this boy gets to
         my party.
Schiller nods. Rachel glances at Frank, making sure he
gets the point, and then she's off again. The throng
gets tighter. Frank's having to work harder, steering
her towards the door back into the hotel. The familiar
chant starts up: "Rachel, Rachel." It's starting to
resemble the frenzy of the opening scene. This time,
amid the thrusting hands and clamoring faces, a few
bewildered elderly guests look dazed as they are shoved
forward. A child starts crying, lost in the mess of legs
and Bermuda shorts. A distraught mother tries to reach
him. Someone is jostled into the pool as the crowd
surges again.
Amid the chaos, whistles and scattered applause.   Rachel
drinks it all in.
                      RACHEL
                (over her shoulder)
         Thank you. Thank you. Come
         tonight and give till it hurts.
With a final surge, Frank makes it to the door with his
party. The door closes shut behind them. A mass of
distorted faces pushes onto the glass. The party walks
on briskly.
                      RACHEL
                (to Spector)
         I'm beginning to wonder about your
         judgement, Sy. Why do I have to
         keep paying my dues if I've
         already arrived?

                                                                      81.

                             SPECTOR
                       (very fast)
                Kick me, beat me... whatever makes
                you feel good. But let's not
                pretend you don't like it. We're
                too close for that. Whipping
                people into a frenzy is why you
                got into it in the first place.
       Rachel's eyes lock with  Spector's -- there's a real connec-
       tion and understanding  here that she spends a lot of time
       denying. Frank sees it   as clearly as Spector, whose tone
       becomes almost soothing  --
                             SPECTOR
                And it's nothing to be ashamed of,
                either, not for a second. It's a
                gift... and only a handful are
                given it. Many call but few are
                answered.
                             SPECTOR (CONT'D)
                Don't fool with the blessing,
                Rachel. The magic is sustained
                through its use.
                             RACHEL
                Now you're going to tell me about
                magic? Give it a rest will ya...
                             SPECTOR
                I'm done. Not another word...
                       (a crooked smile)
                ... I know you like to be reminded
                sometimes.
       Rachel looks away.   It's true.   He's good at his job.

113    INT. GRAND CENTRAL ROOM - ON STAGE - NIGHT                113
       In the spotlight, all alone, Rachel Marron works her magic.
       She sings, as it was meant to be sung, "I Have Nothing."
       One person does not look at Rachel. He stands in a
       corner in front of the stage easily in the shadows. His
       eyes continually scanning. Picking up every movement.
       All alone. Watching.

113A   EXT. FONTAINEBLEAU HOTEL - NIGHT                          113A
       Fireworks explode over the water.

                                                                     82.

114   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                  114
      In the living room, the first night party is in full
      swing. Crowded. Smoky. Noisy. Fireworks burst outside
      the windows. People clap.
      A mixed bag of upscale partygoers: women in party
      dresses, men in open shirts, etc. A black pianist is
      playing. Two bars at either end of the room. Waiters
      work the room with platters of canapes.

115   INT. RACHEL'S SUITE - OUTSIDE MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT      115
      Tony sits in a chair watching TV, a drink in his hand,
      oblivious to all. The lifeguard shuts Rachel's door be-
      hind him and makes his way down to the party. He pauses
      at the head of the stairs, checking out the party, and
      grabs a glass of champagne from a passing waiter. Frank
      catches the movement; the two men briefly lock eyes. The
      lifeguard responds with a knowing smile.

116   EXT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE SUITE - NIGHT                        116
      Thuringer has set up a checkpoint through which all
      guests are passing.
      As they get off the elevator, they walk up to a desk
      manned by one of Thuringer's uniformed guards. When
      their names have been checked off a master list, they
      walk past another guard wielding a metal detector. No
      one likes it, but they all do it.
      Most of the local TV stations have sent camera crews.    The
      handheld cameras move among the guests, their bright
      lights flaring. FLASHBULBS POP. It's a local media
      event.
      Frank squints as a quartz light shines straight in his
      face.
      A tall, fit, athletic-looking man raises his arms; is
      cleared by the metal detector. He is GREG PORTMAN.

117   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                  117
      Portman makes his way through the crowd to the bar. His
      eyes scan the suite. His gaze settles on Frank checking
      out the people who filter in. Portman appears next to
      Frank.
                            PORTMAN
               Hello, Farmer.

                                                           83.

                      FRANK
         Portman.
                      PORTMAN
         Buy you a drink?
                      FRANK
         Orange juice. It's been awhile.
         You on the job?
                      PORTMAN
                (nods)
         Technically I'm off duty,   but the
         Governor may show up here   later,
         so I thought I'd give it   a light
         check.
                (smiles)
         Someone else is covering   him right
         now.
                      FRANK
         How old is she?
                      PORTMAN
         Maybe eighteen. You working?
Rachel makes her entrance, and poses self-mocking on the
landing above the crowd, accepting applause. She has
succeeded in under-dressing everyone in the room. She
is a star. Frank nods in her direction... that's his
client.
                      PORTMAN
                (impressed)
         No kidding? I'd call that a step
         up from the President. Probably
         sings better too.
                       RACHEL
         Thank you.   Thank you.   You're
         so right.
SCATTERED LAUGHS.
                      RACHEL
         I want everyone to have a good
         time and drink as much of Ben
         Schiller's liquor as you like.
Rachel descends into the crowd, laughing and blowing
kisses.
                      PORTMAN
         Handful.
Frank's look says if you only knew the half of it.

                                                           84.

                        PORTMAN
           I heard you had to take someone
           out in New York.
Frank remembers.
                        PORTMAN
           I lost track of you after the
           Reagan thing.
                          FRANK
           Yeah.
                        PORTMAN
           It wasn't your fault, Farmer.
           You weren't even there.

A pause.
                        PORTMAN
           I got a call a couple of months
           ago. That guy you were covering
           in New York. He said you'd
           recommended me.
                          FRANK
           Surprised?
                          PORTMAN
           A little.
                        FRANK
                  (smiles)
           I never doubted your skills.
                        PORTMAN
                  (laughs, good-
                   natured)
           No. Only my qualifications for
           the priesthood. You were always
           clear about that. Anyway, I
           appreciate it. I had to turn it
           down but I appreciate it.
Portman notices Rachel looking at him, as she makes her
way to them. Rachel takes Frank's orange juice and sips.
Makes a very funny face.
                        RACHEL
           That's orange juice!
Rachel gives Portman an approving once-over.
                          RACHEL
           Who are you?

                                                                   85.

                            PORTMAN
               Greg Portman.
                            RACHEL
               I take it you've met my bodyguard?
                            PORTMAN
               We used to work together.
                            RACHEL
                      (suddenly more
                       interested)
               Ah... Well, well, well.    And what
               do you do now?
                            PORTMAN
               Same thing as Farmer.
                            RACHEL
                      (looking between
                       them)
               Two samurai, eh?
      Frank and Portman eye each other.
                            RACHEL
                      (to Portman)
               Are you working now?
                            PORTMAN
               Not right now.
                            RACHEL
               Good.
                      (she takes his arm)
               'cause I'm the only one in the
               room who needs protection.
      She gives Frank a look and leads Portman into the crowd.

118   EXT. LIVING ROOM BALCONY - LATER                           118
      Rachel's taking a breather on the balcony, drinking cham-
      pagne, talking to Portman and another couple. Everybody's
      high and happy. Conversation bubbles.
      FRANK'S POV
      Rachel leans into Portman; heads together, they whisper
      intimately. Rachel laughs, then for a brief moment, turns
      her head to look directly at Frank. Her look is petulant,
      defiant. Portman does not see this.

119   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                   119

                                                                    86.

      Tony helps himself to a handful of canapes, he turns at
      the sound of a COMMOTION out on the balcony. Someone's
      horsing around, spraying champagne from a bottle over
      everyone. A woman screams. Frank   bolts for the balcony.

121   EXT. ON BALCONY - NIGHT                                           121

      Rachel and Portman are poised precariously halfway over
      the railing. Frank's hand shoots out, grabs Rachel's
      wrist and tugs at the pair of them.
      Portman regains his balance first and pulls Rachel back
      from the edge.
                            FRANK
               What happened!
                            PORTMAN
               Somebody tripped. It's okay.
                            RACHEL
                      (looking at Portman)
               Thank God I had a bodyguard here.
      She grasps the railing and looks over.
      RACHEL'S POV
      Staring down twenty stories of distance between her and the
      pool area.
      Way, way below her, her champagne GLASS hits the tile
      with a MUFFLED SHATTERING sound.
                            RACHEL
               It's a long way down, Frank.
                      (to Portman)
               You saved my life.
      Frank eyes the newly-welded anchor fixture.   It has
      held.
      Rachel takes Portman by the arm.   The front of her dress
      is stained with champagne.
                            RACHEL
               Maybe someone will keep an eye
               on me while I change.
      She leads Portman past Frank and up the stairs toward
      her bedroom. Frank and Portman lock eyes. Portman
      shrugs; he feels badly for Frank.

122   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                    122

                                                                   87.

      Frank walks to the bar taking a drink from his glass. He
      looks in the mirror behind the bar and sees Rachel and
      Portman in the hall outside her bedroom. She turns her
      head to look directly at Frank's reflected face. Assured
      that Frank is watching, she takes Portman's hand and leads
      him into her room.

      Frank sets his glass down and the bartender refills it
      with orange juice. A stunning WOMAN IN GREEN glides down
      the bar and stands very close to Frank.
                            WOMAN IN GREEN
               I've been watching you all night
               from across the room.
                            FRANK
               Why don't you go back there and
               keep watching?
      Frank looks at Rachel's doorway, sipping his juice.

123   INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                              123
      Rachel and Portman are kissing, with some heat.
      Portman's hands are starting to explore her body.

124   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                   124
      Frank still looks at Rachel's doorway, thinking. After
      a moment, he walks across the room to the sliding doors
      that lead to the balcony outside.

125   EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT                                       125
      Frank steps outside. No one there. The moonlight re-
      flects off the ocean. The SURF sounds a STEADY BEAT.
      It is peaceful and quiet. A relief.
      On the Katz's balcony, forty feet away, little Mark Katz
      is leaning against the railing, staring at Rachel's
      suite. Frank smiles at him.
                            FRANK
                      (softly)
               Go to sleep.
      Frank looks out at the ocean. After a pause, in the
      background, Mark slips inside the Katz suite.

126   INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                              126
      Rachel and Portman are still locked in the clinch.
      Realizing what she's doing, Rachel suddenly pulls back,

                                                                   88.

      catching herself.
                            RACHEL
               I'm not doing this.
                            PORTMAN
                      (still holding her)
               I think you are.
      She steps out of his embrace.
                            RACHEL
               I said I was grateful.   Thank you
               and good night.
      She looks to the door that leads back to the party. The
      SOUNDS of CELEBRATION CONTINUE outside. She starts to
      cross to the door.
                            RACHEL
                      (cool)
               Please go now.
      Portman moves toward her as she opens the door, reaching
      for her arm.
      Then he sees, through the doorway, Tony standing in the
      hall talking to a woman. Tony looks up at the sound of
      the door and sees them both. Rachel slips quickly out
      of Portman's grip.
                            RACHEL
               Mr. Portman was just leaving us,
               Tony.
      Portman hesitates, then smiles at Rachel and Tony and,
      with a quick peck on Rachel's cheek, slips past them back
      to the party.
      Rachel briefly scans the party crowd over Tony's shoulder
      but she doesn't see Frank. The door closes, leaving her
      alone in the room again. She reaches for a bottle of
      Scotch and raises it to her mouth, drinking straight
      from the bottle.

127   EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT                                       127
      Frank looks out at the ocean.
      ECHOING on the soundtrack, we hear the song 'WHAT BECOMES
      OF THE BROKEN HEARTED' that Rachel and Frank danced to.
      It sounds slow and sweet and a long way away.
      Frank stares out at the ocean. Totally divorced from
      everything in the suite behind him, in the world around
      him. There is only the moon and the ocean. For this

                                                                     89.

       one moment, his guard is down.

127A   INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                127A
       A chambermaid is Hoovering the floor. Rachel steps out
       of her bedroom. She looks terrible. Hungover, she is
       wearing sunglasses and a loose smock. It is noon of the
       following day.

130    INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - KITCHEN - DAY                    130
       Frank is sitting at the kitchen table eating a sandwich.
       Behind him, in the dining room, a Cuban maid has set a
       place with breakfast. She is pouring orange juice as
       Rachel walks in.
       Rachel sits down at the table as though the walk in had
       been a terrible effort. She looks at the breakfast with
       distaste and picks up the coffee. Frank continues to eat.
       Rachel looks at him.
                               RACHEL
                         (nasty)
                  What the hell are you looking at?
                         (pause)
                  You probably never had a heavy
                  night in your whole, goddamn
                  disciplined life.
       Frank looks at her, continues to eat.
                               RACHEL
                  You know, Farmer, you're a self-
                  righteous son-of-a-bitch.
       Frank has to smile at this, which makes Rachel even
       angrier.
                               RACHEL
                  Don't laugh at me, goddamit!   And
                  don't you dare judge me.
                               FRANK
                  Give me a break, will ya? I
                  didn't tell you to fuck everybody
                  in the hotel!

132    INT. CLEANING SUPPLY WAREHOUSE - DAY                       132
       Special  Agents Court and Minella are watching the general
       manager  of the supply house as he pries the top off a huge
       canister  marked "INDUSTRIAL DETERGENT." The general
       manager  lifts the lid to reveal white powder.

                                                                    90.

      He talks animatedly and gestures around the warehouse.
      Court listens, nodding. Minella spoons some of the
      powder into a plastic bag and seals it. OVER this we
      hear Court's voice, filtered as on a telephone line.
                              COURT (V.O.)
                 It matches the traces in the glue,
                 Frank. We're getting to him.
We're gonna nail this fucker.

133   INT. FONTAINEBLEAU - LOBBY - DAY                            133
      Frank is on the courtesy phone.
                             FRANK
                Yeah, well, don't take too long,
                Ray.
                              COURT (V.O.)
                Hey, Frank.   It's good money,
                isn't it?
      Frank hangs up.

134   INT. 20TH FLOOR HALLWAY - OUTSIDE PRESIDENTIAL SUITE -      134
      DAY
      The elevator door opens and  Frank steps out. He
      walks toward the entrance to  the suite and is
      immediately alarmed by what  he sees: there is no
      uniformed guard by the front  door. He unlocks the
      door and goes inside.

135   INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - ENTRANCE - DAY                    135
      Frank comes in and looks around quickly.
      FRANK'S POV - LIVING ROOM
      Looking over living room, hallways, balcony.    No one in
      sight. Nothing disturbed.
      Devaney comes out of Rachel's bedroom, a panicked look
      on his face.
      BACK TO SCENE
      They face each other across the gulf of the living
      room.
                             FRANK
                Where is she? Where's Tony?

                                                                     91.

                            DEVANEY
               I don't know. I thought you were
               with her.

138   INT. SUITE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                               138

      Frank is at the telephone; he punches out three
      numbers.
                            FRANK
                      (into phone)
               Thuringer, this is Farmer. Where's
               your man on the door to the suite?
                      (listens)
               Well get someone up here.

      Frank hangs up the phone, looks at Devaney.
                            FRANK
               He doesn't know.
      They look at each other, worried. Frank walks out onto
      the balcony, looks round and down, comes back in. He
      heads for the front door.
                            DEVANEY
               Where are you going?

139   INT. SUITE - ENTRANCE HALL - DAY                             139
      Frank is almost at the door. We hear LAUGHTER. A key
      turns in the lock. Rachel and Tony come through the
      door in high spirits, their arms full of shopping bags
      and packages.
      Frank stops dead and    watches. Rachel glances at him and
      goes into the living    room. Tony looks at him meaning-
      fully and follows.     Frank reflects for a moment, then
      pulls the front door    closed, oh so gently.

140   INT. SUITE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                               140
      Rachel drops packages around and goes to the bar, pours
      herself a drink. Tony takes some packages to Rachel's
      bedroom.
                            RACHEL
               Hello, Devaney.
                            DEVANEY
               Rachel, where the hell have you
               been?

                                                                      92.

                             RACHEL
                Tony and I went over to Bal
                Harbour. Did a little shopping.
       Tony comes back, a smile playing across his lips.    Frank
       watches near the entrance.

                             DEVANEY
                We were worried.
                       (looks at Frank,
                        talks to Rachel)
                You know you're not supposed to do
                that.
       Frank and Rachel look at each other.

                             RACHEL
                Farmer, you work here! Do you
                understand that? You work for me.
                             DEVANEY
                Rachel.
       Frank turns and heads for the door.    Devaney looks at
       him anxiously.
                             DEVANEY
                Farmer, where are you going?
                             FRANK
                I'm gonna check the route.    As
                usual.
       He opens the front door. A uniformed guard is standing
       outside. Frank goes out and closes the door.
                             RACHEL
                Did Fletcher call?
       Devaney, staring after Frank, shakes his head "no."

141    INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - DAY                                  141
       Frank's face shows the tension and the anger.    The ele-
       vator descends.

141A   INT. KITCHEN - DAY                                           141A
       Frank walks along the edge of the kitchen, looks over
       the workers. A kitchen worker is in Frank's path. He
       looks up, sees Frank's face and scurries out of his way.

142    INT. BASEMENT - SERVICE CORRIDOR - DAY                       142

                                                                 93.

Frank walks along checking the corridor.        At each door-
way, he stops, looks inside.
One room is dark. He flicks on the light. Near the door
is a pile of wooden crates, placed unnaturally out from
the wall.  Frank walks over and looks inside. They are
discarded vegetable crates. Frank goes back to the door
and yells toward the kitchen.
                          FRANK
            Gomez!   Louis Gomez!
He waits impatiently. No one comes. Two quick steps and
he is back at the CRATES, throwing them violently into
the corner where they CLATTER loudly to the floor. Frank
walks on along the corridor.

He stops, noticing something around the side.
He investigates.
An ENORMOUS CUBAN is sitting on some boxes in the
shadows. He doesn't bat an eye when he sees Frank.
                         FRANK
            What are you doing?
                         ENORMOUS CUBAN
            Is none of you fuckin' business.
                           FRANK
            Move it.
The Enormous Cuban gets slowly up from the boxes.        He
towers over Frank.
                         ENORMOUS CUBAN
            Shove it up you ass, motherfucker.
Frank has had   enough for one      afternoon. He hits the
Cuban low and   hard. The man       crumples forward, hurt,
but manages to   enfold Frank      in an awesome bear hug. His
weight carries   them backward      in Frank's direction.
The Cuban continues      moving in that direction, but Frank
is no longer in his      grasp. Instead, incredibly, Frank
seems to have passed      through the man's body and flicked
him into the corner      of the stairwell.
The Cuban hits the wall hard. Jarred but not lost, he
comes up and out wielding a long mop as if it were a
baseball bat.
Frank steps in and      under the man's long arms and hits him
four times around      the chest and jaw. Each of Frank's
hands lands twice,      their movement is barely visible.
The solid THUDDING      tells the story. Frank strikes both

                                                                    94.

       the Cuban's ears simultaneously with cupped hands.
       The Cuban goes down, stunned. Frank, his expression
       fierce, is upon him immediately. Frank's arms entwine
       the Cuban's and he begins to lift him roughly. At the
       end of the corridor, a woman screams.

                       CLEANING WOMAN (O.S.)
                Stop! Please. Don't hurt him.
                Please stop!
       Frank looks up. A hotel CLEANING WOMAN, carrying her
       purse, is running towards them, tears already on her
       face.
                             CLEANING WOMAN
                Don't hurt my husband, mister.       He
                not up to nothing.
       Frank lets the Cuban down gently and stands up. Dis-
       gusted with himself. Breathing hard, he leans back
       against the wall. The Cleaning Woman falls to her knees
       and hugs her husband protectively.
                              FRANK
                I'm sorry.
       Frank steps away, rubs a hand through his hair, tries to
       collect himself.
       He's standing amidst dumpsters and discarded food boxes.
       He looks up and sees a marquee.
       RACHEL MARRON.   TONITE.   BENEFIT CONCERT.    8 P.M.

145A   INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                              145A
       Rachel is seated at her dressing table applying her
       makeup for the evening's performance. The telephone
       RINGS as she begins to work on her hair.
                              RACHEL
                Fletcher?
       No response.
                             RACHEL
                Baby, is that you? It's mommy,
                honey.
                             DAN (V.O.)
                       (eerily distorted)
                Guess again, whore! Fuck you and
                fuck Miami. I'm coming for you.
                I know where you are and I'm
                coming for you...

                                                                   95.


      Rachel is paralyzed by fear, unable to hang up the phone.

146   INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT              146
      Frank comes in the front door. He's had it. Devaney,
      who has been sitting alone in the living room, stubs out
      a cigarette and stands to meet him. Frank doesn't pause.
                            FRANK
               I'm through. I'll get you back to
               L.A. and that's it. The guy with
               Fletcher can cover you till you get
               a replacement.

                            DEVANEY
               She got another call, while you
               were downstairs and she answered it
               herself. It was him, Frank. Same
               guy.
                            FRANK
                      (moving toward
                       balcony)
               I don't care.
                            DEVANEY
               Farmer, it really shook her up.
               She thought it was going to be
               Fletcher calling her from L.A. I
               think she'll be reasonable now.
                            FRANK
                      (across him)
               Save it, Devaney. The people who
               hire me don't have to be convinced
               to save their own lives.
      Frank reaches the sliding door that leads to the balcony.
                            FRANK
               Call me when she's ready to go
               down.
                             DEVANEY
               Farmer --
      Frank goes out on the balcony and slides the door closed
      behind him.

147   EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT                                       147
      Frank looks out at the ocean. The breeze washes over his
      face. A huge brightly-lit yacht is sailing by, close to
      shore. Frank looks at it reflectively.

                                                              96.


He senses another presence and looks to his right.
Rachel sits huddled in a balcony chair. The bright  moon-
light illuminates her as she looks out to sea. She  is
wearing one of her spectacular show gowns, her hair has
been brushed, and her stage makeup has been applied.   But
tonight it hasn't come together. It doesn't work.   She
holds a cigarette and the breeze keeps it glowing.  This
is the only time we've seen her smoke.
                      RACHEL
         Farmer... Nothing that's happened
         between us matters... I understand
         now... You're going to have to
         believe me, because I'm not going
         to beg.

She takes a long drag on her cigarette.
                      RACHEL
         It wasn't what he said... it was
         the way he said it... he was so...
Her voice cracks.   She stops and tries to compose herself.
                      RACHEL
         I need you... I'm afraid... and I
         hate it. I hate my fear...
                (a beat)
         Please protect me... Protect
         Fletcher... If anything happened
         to him...
Frank looks at her. Tears are destroying her elaborate
stage makeup. She wipes them away with her hand.
                      FRANK
         I can't protect you like this.
         It's impossible. The odds are on
         his side.
                      RACHEL
         I'll do whatever you say.
This is the first time Frank has ever heard Rachel say
that. He studies her, then looks out at the ocean.
                      FRANK
         I want to take you away for
         a while.
Rachel nods.
                      FRANK
         Somewhere people don't know about.
She nods again, agreeing.

                                                                   97.


                            FRANK
               No Spector or Devaney or Tony.
      He looks at her, reading her face for any hesitation.
      There is none.

                            FRANK
               If you cross me up this time, I'll
               kill you myself.
      Rachel smiles, weakly but with obvious relief.

148   EXT. HERB FARMER'S HOUSE (BEND, OREGON) - LAKE SIDE -      148
      DAY

      A large, old, two-story house sits at the top of a slight
      rise, surrounded on three sides by thick, rolling woods.
      Sloping gently down from the house to the lake fifty yards
      away is a broad expanse of lawn.  Snow lies on the ground
      and in the trees. At the edge of  the lake, a dock and
      boathouse. An entrance road cuts  out of the trees.
      A little TERRIER skitters to the edge of the drive
      BARKING.
      A van emerges from the trees, tires CRUNCHING through the
      snow.
      Frank's father, HERB, steps onto the front porch. He's
      in his mid-60's, lean, tan and fit. He's wearing a plaid
      shirt, jeans and cowboy boots.
      The van stops in front of the house. Frank steps out
      from the driver's seat and eyes his dad.
                            FRANK
               Lake's a little low.
                            HERB
               Fill up soon enough when she thaws.
                      (glancing at the van)
               They all in trouble?
                               FRANK
               Just one.

149   INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY                                     149
      Herb squats on the floor with Fletcher. Together, they
      are happily playing around with the fluffy terrier.
      Fletcher squeals with delight as the dog licks his face.
      Henry brings the remaining luggage through. Rachel and
      Nicki stand with Frank near the archway. All eyes are on

                                                                      98.

      Fletcher, Herb and the dog.       Rachel eyes the dog
      skeptically.
                            RACHEL
               That's going to protect us?
                            FRANK
               He's a trained noisemaker.
                               RACHEL
               Terrific.
                            FRANK
               I don't like big dogs. They don't
               know who they're eating.


150   INT. KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON                                 150
      Herb stands beside a butcher block, cutting vegetables
      for the evening meal with a practiced hand. Rachel
      watches, drink in hand, looking around the kitchen. It
      has been neatly organized.
                            HERB
               Katherine had this place organized
               just the way she wanted it.
                      (seeing her
                       questioning look)
               Frank's momma.
      There's the COUGH and SPUTTER of an outboard MOTOR from
      outside. Rachel looks from the kitchen window and sees
      Fletcher and Frank in the small skiff by the dock.
      Fletcher tugs again on the starter cord.       At the third
      tug he tumbles backwards onto the seat.
                            RACHEL
               Fletcher doesn't swim well.
                            HERB
               I guess he'd better stay in the
               boat then.
                      (his smile puts
                      her at ease)
               Frank tells me you're a singer.
                            RACHEL
               That's right.
                            HERB
               I'm afraid we're a little out of
               touch here. I'm sorry.
      Rachel waves this off.

                                                                   99.

                            HERB
               You must be very successful to
               need Frank.
      Rachel smiles and looks out of the window.
                            RACHEL
               It's so quiet here.
                            HERB
               Frank came back and stayed six
               months after the Reagan thing.
      Rachel's questioning look encourages Herb.
                            HERB
               Frank wasn't there the day he was
               shot. He never got over that.
                      (a long pause)
               We buried Katherine that day.
      Rachel looks out again at Frank and Fletcher in the boat.

151   EXT. ON LAKE - SUNSET                                      151
      Fletcher, Rachel and Frank are chugging across the golden
      water in the skiff. Fletcher sits at the back, operating
      the outboard, controlling the movements of the boat. He
      wears a life vest. Rachel watches him proudly. Fletcher
      locks the throttle into place and takes his hands off it
      for a laughing moment with a "Look, Mom, no hands"
      gesture.
      Rachel looks to Frank and smiles, the wind blowing her
      hair.
      WIDE ON LAKE - DUSK
      CAMERA is DOWN at water level by the lake's edge. In the
      distance, the small boat skims across the surface. A
      light mist is coming up.

152   EXT. BOATHOUSE - DUSK                                      152
      Henry helps Fletcher tie up the boat for the night.   It
      is much foggier now and almost dark.
                            FRANK
               I don't want anyone going out in
               it until you've checked it over
               first. Okay? Every time.
      Henry nods.

                                                                   100.

                             HENRY
               Every time.
                             FRANK
               Every time.
      In the distance, Rachel and Fletcher have just reached
      the house where Nicki scoops up Fletcher and spins him
      round and round in a circle. She hugs him close and
      kisses his hair.  After a few moments, Fletcher squirms
      free and runs to catch up with Rachel.

153   INT. HALLWAY - LATER                                       153
      Rachel, munching on a raw carrot, browses a row of family
      photographs. The sounds of dinner being prepared come
      from the kitchen.
      We see the history of the family in the pictures; Frank
      as a ten-year-old baseball player with a younger Herb;
      Herb as Police Chief of Bend, Oregon, being given a civic
      award; Frank as a college football wide receiver; Herb
      and Katherine Farmer, all dressed up and being introduced
      to Jimmy Carter by Frank; the picture-perfect family home
      in Oregon with Katherine tending flowers.
      Rachel notices a photo of a smiling Henry Kissinger,
      talking to some female reporters. There standing
      shoulder-to-shoulder with him, are Frank and Portman.
      Portman's also smiling at the women, flirting. Frank is
      in a familiar pose, alert, unsmiling, vigilant. Rachel
      looks at the two of them for a second.
      Frank steps from the kitchen with an orange juice and a
      drink for Rachel in his hand. He watches her for a
      moment as she studies the photo.
      She turns and sees him. They lock eyes for several
      seconds. She smiles as he hands her the drink.
                            FRANK
                      (inclining his head
                       toward the photo)
               Portman sometimes had trouble
               remembering what his job was.
               Supper's ready.
      We can see from Rachel's face that she feels embarrassed
      about her behavior in Miami.

154   INT. DINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT                        154
      The meal has been enthusiastically consumed. Fletcher's
      manhandling a chicken leg, his face covered with crumbs
      and drippings. Rachel shakes her head, laughing.

                                                                 101.


                            HERB
               ... And I never hit him. Ever.
               To this day.
                      (to Frank)
               That's true, isn't it?
                      (to Rachel)
               That's very unusual for my people.
               So what happens? When he's ten
               years old, he complains about it?
               Can you believe that?
                            FRANK
               Oh, for Chrissake! I'm going to
               tell her about the time you
               stripped in court.

      Frank gets up smiling and takes some dishes into the kitchen.
                            HERB
                      (to Frank)
               I don't care. I'm proud of that.
                      (to Rachel)
               Anyway, he's ten years old and
               he's just started playing tackle
               football. He comes to me and
               tells me he's afraid of getting
               hit, right? And he thinks it's
               because I never hit him. 'Why don't
               you ever hit me?' he says to me!

155   INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                                    155
      Frank puts down the dishes in the darkened kitchen.
                            FRANK
                      (back over his
                       shoulder)
               If you're lucky, maybe he'll
               tell you about my first jockstrap.
      As he speaks, he peers out through the window at the
      lake. We hear Herb's voice continue from the other room.
                            HERB (O.S.)
               He got over it: Turned into a
               helluva wide receiver. He
               couldn't stand being afraid. When
               he found something that scared
               him, he'd just do it 'til the fear
               went away.

156   INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT                                156

                                                                   102.

                            HERB
               His mother was the same way.
      Rachel smiles at him, thinking, then looks through at
      Frank in the kitchen, still peering out of the windows.
      Nicki watches Rachel.


157   INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER                                   157
      Herb delicately lifts  a chessboard from the top of a
      cabinet and walks it  over to the table: A half-finished
      game. He leans over   and blows on the pieces -- sending
      a small cloud of dust  into the air.
                            HERB
               Come on, son, you can run but you
               can't hide.
      Herb pulls up a chair and smiles as Frank appears from
      the kitchen, a bowl of popcorn in his hand. Frank takes
      a place across from his dad by the fire. The others
      gather round.
                              HERB
               Your move.
      Frank studies the board.   Rachel lowers her head into a
      cupped hand, fascinated.
                            RACHEL
               How long has this game been going
               on?
      Frank picks up a knight, thinks, sets it back down.
                              FRANK
               Three years.
      Nicki takes the bowl of popcorn and squats down with it
      beside Fletcher. Fletcher peers intently at the board
      as he chews on a handful.
                            HERB
               He had me on the run there that
               first year.
      Frank picks up his rook, scratches his forehead with it.
      He turns to Fletcher.
                            FRANK
               What do you think?
      Fletcher finishes a mouthful of popcorn, wipes his mouth.
                            FLETCHER
               Knight to king-four.

                                                                   103.


      Frank, Herbert and Rachel turn in synch and stare at the
      boy.
                            FRANK
               City kid.

      Herb pats his leg, gesturing to Fletcher to take a place
      on his lap.
                            HERB
               Come over here, Fletcher, sit by
               me.
      Fletcher goes over and joins him.

                            RACHEL
               Well, that's it for me, I'm
               going to bed.
      She rises. Frank follows her up the stairs.   Nicki
      watches them go.

158   INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT                                 158
      Frank stops at the end of the hallway, checking the lock
      on the window, the little terrier is at his heels.
      Rachel pauses outside the door. Frank gestures for the
      dog to stay. The dog sits in the middle of the hallway
      looking from one to the other. For a few seconds neither
      speaks.
      Frank smiles.
                            FRANK
               Good night, Rachel.
      Rachel accepts this. She smiles in return and touches
      him on the arm, very tenderly.
                            RACHEL
               Good night, Frank.
      Rachel turns, goes to her room and closes the door.

159   EXT. FARMER HOUSE - NIGHT                                  159
      Details are barely distinguishable in the fog. We hear
      the gentle LAPPING of the LAKEWATER against the dock.

160   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                   160
      Fletcher is asleep, snuggled on Herb's lap by the fire.
      Herb is also asleep. Frank fetches a blanket and gently

                                                                104.

      covers them both.    He puts out the light.

161   INT. ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT                              161
      Frank steps quietly into the hall. Nicki is standing
      in the shadows. She watches as Frank goes through the
      ritual of locking the front door, several ways.
                            NICKI
                      (softly)
               You're very thorough.
      VARIOUS SHOTS - AROUND INTERIOR
      Frank makes a circuit through the rooms of the first
      floor, checking windows and doors. Nicki tags along.
                            NICKI
               What's happening between you
               and Rachel?
      Frank glances at her.
                            NICKI
               Come on. One minute she's got
               magnetic hands, the next she hates
               you. I can't figure out what it
               is now.
                            FRANK
               You follow all her moves this
               closely?
                            NICKI
                      (smiling)
               It's a living.
                            FRANK
               No, it isn't.
      He moves away into the next room.    She hesitates a
      moment, then follows.
                            NICKI
               You think my life is pretty
               sickly, don't you?
                              FRANK
               No.
                              NICKI
               You must.    I do.
      Frank steps into a tight, dark, little window alcove,
      checks the windows.

                                                             105.

                      FRANK
         Why don't you change it?
                      NICKI
         Is it that easy?
Frank turns from the window to find Nicki blocking his exit.
She moves close to him and kisses him, her hands on his
shoulders. The kiss ends and they look at each other.
                      FRANK
         You're a lovely woman.
                      NICKI
         But you don't want me.

Frank's look affirms it.    Nicki is embarrassed, angry.
                      NICKI
         I'm surprised. Thorough fellow
         like you. Why stop at one sister
         when you can fuck them both?
                      FRANK
         I make my mistakes.
                      NICKI
         But you didn't say no to the boss.
She starts to turn away from him, but his hands are on her
now, holding her close, refusing to let her turn away.
Their faces are very close.    It is tight and near here.
                      FRANK
                (with force)
         No, don't go away, Nicki. Don't
         leave me with that. Tell me about
         it. Tell me how long you've been
         second. Tell me how she has a
         child and you don't. Tell me
         something. But don't turn away
         and try to stick it on me.
Nicki twists in his grip.    He holds her tight.
                      NICKI
         I don't need this from you.
                      FRANK
         Maybe I need it.     I'm fed up with
         people telling me    they have no
         control over their    lives. If you
         hate your life so    much, turn it
         around.

                                                                     106.

                             NICKI
                It's not so simple.
                             FRANK
                Yes it is. You can walk out that
                fucking door anytime you want.
                I'll unlock it for you.

       Nicki looks up into his face.    Tears start in her eyes.
                               NICKI
                Let me go.
       He releases her, looks at her.
                                FRANK
                Okay.     It's not my business.
       He moves away, OUT OF FRAME.    We HOLD ON Nicki, a long
       time.

162    EXT. LAKE - DAY                                             162
       Bright sun. Frank and his father walk along the lake
       shoreline, stooping here and there to finger animal
       prints in the snow and mud.
                             FRANK
                Raccoon... deer...?
       Herb nods.
       Their attention is drawn to soft singing up by the house.

162A   EXT. PORCH - DAY                                            162A
       Nicki absently sings an old gospel tune as she tosses
       breakfast scraps to a group of hungry ducks gathered by
       the porch.

162B   EXT. LAKE - DAY                                             162B
                             HERB
                I've never heard church music in
                the middle of the week before.

162C   EXT. PORCH - DAY                                            162C
       Nicki's soft voice is joined by Rachel's strong harmony,
       and the two men watch as Rachel comes out to join her
       sister on the porch, startling Nicki. Both sing for a
       moment, together. Then Nicki stops, embarrassed. Rachel
       gives her a hug.

                                                                    107.


162D   EXT. LAKE - DAY                                            162D
       Herb and Frank are about to return to the house. They
       stop short. There, at their feet, is a line of human
       foot prints, from heavy snow boots, leading away into
       the trees. Frank looks at Herb, suddenly alert.

                              FRANK
                 Where's Fletcher?
       Henry appears at the porch of the house, carrying a
       fishing rod as he comes out. At that instant, the sound
       of the OUTBOARD MOTOR CRACKLES through the air. Frank's
       head snaps toward the boathouse. Henry, in the distance,
       looks quickly at the boathouse, then to Frank.

                             HENRY
                       (shouting)
                 Frank! I haven't...
       But Frank is already moving, leaping from the porch
       and starting to run flat out toward the boathouse
       and dock.
       Rachel turns to look.
       The skiff appears out of the boathouse, Fletcher at the
       motor, the boat's lone occupant. The boat moves slowly
       away from the boathouse, parallel to the dock.
       Frank is running toward the water with everything he's
       got, his face contorted. The sound of the OUTBOARD
       drowns out his voice as he yells.
                               FRANK
                 Fletcher!   Fletcher!
       IN BOAT
       Fletcher, intent on his piloting, neither hears nor sees
       Frank running down the lawn behind him. The boat is
       approaching the end of the dock.
       DOCK
       Frank finally makes it to the dock and continues to
       sprint after the boat. His weight rattles the boards
       as he runs.
       IN BOAT
       Fletcher passes the end of the dock and gives the
       throttle a little twist.
       DOCK

                                                             108.

Frank reaches the end of the dock at a full run and dives
directly at the rear of the moving boat. Frank's body
flies out over the boat. He knocks Fletcher out of his
seat and into the water on the other side of the skiff.
                         RACHEL
                   (screams)
           No!   He can't swim!
IN WATER
Frank holds the terrified, shaking Fletcher in his arms.
Fletcher begins to cry. Frank paddles with him toward
the dock. The empty boat swerves, then continues out
toward the center of the lake.

DOCK
Henry and Rachel are already    at the end of the dock. Nicki
and Herb are running toward    it. Rachel is livid, hysterical.
Henry peers out at the boat,    which continues to bounce
innocently across the water,    defining a broad curve.
                        RACHEL
           Fletcher, baby. Are you all
           right? Baby.
Fletcher, spluttering, is handed up to Rachel by Frank.
Rachel hugs Fletcher to her. Herb bends down to check
he's breathing properly, wrapping the boy in his jacket.
                        HERB
           He's all right.
Henry helps Frank up out of the water.    Frank sits on
the end of the dock, breathing hard.
                        RACHEL
           What are you doing? You out of
           your mind? You're crazy!
                  (to Fletcher)
           You're all right, baby.
                  (back to Frank)
           You could have drowned him!
Frank and Henry look out toward the boat which has come
to a stop out in the middle of the lake.
                         FRANK
           I'm sorry.   I got careless.
Henry looks at Frank.    He feels terrible about not
checking the boat.
                        HENRY
           Frank, I'm sorry. I should have...

                                                                     109.

                             HERB
                It's okay, Henry.
       Herb puts his hand on Fletcher's head.
                             HERB
                You all right now, son?

       Fletcher nods, his crying ends raggedly.   Frank begins
       to stand up.
                             HENRY
                How do we get the boat back?
       Out in the center of the lake, the BOAT BLOWS UP.    Every-
       one on the dock jumps.

       Nicki screams.
       Frank sits down again. He shakes his head. On an
       impulse, he stretches out his hand, palm downward.   It's
       trembling slightly.

162E   INT. BEDROOM - DAY                                          162E
       Rachel and Nicki hurriedly pack their bags.   Fletcher
       hovers nearby.

162F   EXT. SHED/GARAGE - DAY
       162F
       Frank slides out from under the van. The hood is up.
       Henry stands nearby. Frank goes to the driver's seat.
                             FRANK
                       (to Henry)
                Back off.
       Henry moves away from the van.   Frank inserts the key in
       the ignition.

162G   EXT. PORCH - DAY                                            162G
       Herb comes out of the house, fast. His eyes scan the
       woods as he heads towards the shed.
                                HERB
                Frank!
       Henry turns and motions to Herb to stay away.

162H   INT. VAN - DAY                                              162H

                                                                        110.

        Frank takes a moment, then turns the key.    Nothing.   The
        van is dead.

162-I   EXT. LAWN - DAY                                               162-I
        Henry and Herb watch.    Frank gets out of the van.   He
        walks to Herb.
                              HERB
                 Someone's cut the phone lines. It
                 could be anywhere between here and
                 town.
                              FRANK
                 Both the cars are dead. And I
                 can't see how it was done.
        Frank and Herb exchange a look.
                              FRANK
                 Who could know we're here? This
                 place has nothing to do with her.
                              HERB
                 Maybe it has to do with you.
        Frank looks at him.
                              HERB
                 We can't walk out of here at
                 night with them.
        Frank shakes his head.
                              FRANK
                 We'll button down tonight and
                 walk out at first light.

162J    EXT. FARMER HOUSE - NIGHT                                     162J
        There is a light ground-mist. The moon shines down
        down brightly but the house is totally dark.

162K    INT. HOUSE - MONTAGE - NIGHT                                  162K
        The terrier dog listens in the upstairs hallway. Herb
        watches from an upstairs window. Rachel lies in bed,
        clutching Fletcher tightly.

164     INT. LIVING ROOM - MIDDLE OF NIGHT                            164
        Frank has been sitting in a chair in the center of the
        living room for two hours. Listening. Now we listen

                                                                   111.

      with him. At first it seems silent, but slowly we become
      aware of a subtle symphony of sounds. An old house sur-
      rounded by WOODS. There are lots of NOISES. But they
      are regular, innocent.
      Frank is aware of a new noise, a gentle sobbing coming
      from nearby. He picks up his gun from the table beside
      him and goes into the kitchen.

166   INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                                       166
      Nicki is sitting with her head in her hands at the kitchen
      table, sobbing. There's a nearly empty bottle beside
      her. Frank is instantly on the alert but makes no sign.

                            NICKI
                      (crying)
               I was an idiot last night.
      There is a long pause.
                            NICKI
               What do you think about today?
                            FRANK
                      (gently)
               I think this is no maniac.   He
               knows what he's doing.
      There is a long, long silence.   Nicki continues crying.
      Finally --
                            NICKI
               You're right. He does.
                            FRANK
               Tell me about it.
      She doesn't reply.
                            FRANK
               Who is it, Nicki?
                            NICKI
               He almost got Fletcher today...
                            FRANK
               How do we stop him?
                            NICKI
               ...my darling Fletcher...
                               FRANK
               Who is it?
                               NICKI

                                                           112.

         I don't know.   I don't know.
Frank goes to her, treats her gently, like a doctor.
                      FRANK
         You can call him off.

                      NICKI
                (shaking her head)
         He doesn't even know who hired him.
         He doesn't know who I am and I
         don't know who he is.
                      FRANK
         How'd you do it?

She seems on the edge of hysteria. Frank takes her face
in his hands, strokes her hair, brings her back from the
brink.
                      FRANK
         How?
                      NICKI
         ...I went to a bar in East L.A. I
         asked around... I talked to a
         man...
                      FRANK
         Name?
                      NICKI
                (vague)
         ...Armando... He arranged it.
         That's all I know...
                      FRANK
         Is it all paid for?
                      NICKI
                (nods)
         ... and then some... Till it's done.
                      FRANK
         He keeps going until he kills her?
Nicki nods again, lowering her face into her hands.
                      FRANK
         What's the name of the bar?
                      NICKI
         I'm not sure... I was very stoned.
                      FRANK
         How 'bout the letters?

                                                                  113.


                            NICKI
                      (desperately)
               No, no. You don't understand.
               The letters came first. I don't
               know who's sending them... but
               they're reading my mind... Those
               were my thoughts. I hate her. It
               made me think I could do it... But
               I could never hurt Fletcher.
               Never.
                      (begging him)
               You've got to stop it!
                            FRANK
               We will. You and me. Tomorrow
               we're going back to L.A. We're
               going to find the bar, we're going
               to find Armando.
      He starts to rise.    She stops him.
                            NICKI
               Don't you even want to know why?
                               FRANK
               You told me.     She has everything.
      Frank stands up and begins to move across the room. Nicki
      puts her face in her hands and is silent for one moment.
      Suddenly, Frank freezes, listening.
                            NICKI
               What if we can't --
      Frank motions her into silence. We strain to hear what
      Frank hears. Silently, Frank goes to the door, crouch
      ing. He listens. There again is a DISTANT GROWL from
      the DOG upstairs.
      Frank lifts his gun from the table, turns to Nicki.
                              FRANK
               Stay here.    Don't move.
      Nicki's face shows true terror.
      Frank is out the door.

168   INT. STAIRS - NIGHT                                      168
      Frank runs up them fast.    Two at a time.

169   INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL - NIGHT                           169

                                                                      114.

       Frank travels close to the wall, very quickly. He stops,
       listens. The TERRIER looks at Frank but still GROWLS.
       Frank throws open Rachel's door. Rachel gasps in
       surprise and clutches at Fletcher. Frank hears a noise
       behind him, whirls round him and drops to a knee, weapon
       ready to fire!

       It's Herb, stepping out of his room, carrying a police-
       issue pistol.
                             HERB
                It's me!
       Rachel's voice comes from her room.
                             RACHEL (O.S.)
                What's happening?
       The terrier suddenly starts barking loudly.

171    INT. FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - POV - MOVING SHOT - NIGHT         171
       We're in someone's POV moving along the hallway. Nicki
       steps out of the kitchen a few feet ahead and looks in
       terror toward the CAMERA.
                             NICKI (O.S.)
                No, no... stop... I'm the one
                who...

172    INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT                            172
       Frank and Herb spin around.    Rachel calls from her room.
                             RACHEL
                Frank?

172A   INT. FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT                             172A
       A GUNSHOT BLASTS Nicki against the wall, her hand still
       delicately raised in a classic gesture of restraint.

172B   INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT                            172B
       Frank's head spins to Rachel's doorway, then immediately
       back to Herb. He starts to move towards the stairs,
       fast.
                             FRANK
                       (to Herb)
                Stay with Rachel!
       Henry's head appears round the doorway of Herb's room.

                                                                    115.



173    INT. STAIRS - NIGHT                                        173
       Frank is rapidly down the stairs, gun in hand.


173A   INT. FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT                           173A
       Frank finds Nicki's body slumped against the wall.   He
       checks her. She's dead. The door beyond is open.     The
       wind blows in. Outside it's foggy.
                             FRANK
                       (yelling)
                Dad?

                              HERB (O.S.)
                We're okay!
                             FRANK
                Stay with Rachel!
       The DOG continues to BARK upstairs. Frank sees a slight
       movement outside and window to his right. A split-second
       moment of decision. He heads off rapidly down the hall,
       away from the open door.

175    EXT. FARMER HOUSE - NIGHT                                  175
       The fog is thick. Frank swiftly emerges from the back
       door and stops, dead still, listening. There is only the
       RUSTLING of TREES.

175A   INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                              175A
       Herb is by Rachel's bed.
                             RACHEL
                What's happening? Where's Nicki?
                              HERB
                Be quiet!

175B   EXT. FARMER HOUSE - NIGHT                                  175B
       Frank listens. Suddenly he hears RUNNING FOOTSTEPS, a
       body breaking through the bushes. Frank heads off
       towards the sound at a run.

176    EXT. WOODS - NIGHT                                         176
       INTERCUT - FRANK AND FIGURE

                                                                    116.


       The move fitfully through the eerie, beautiful scene.
       In and out of the fog. Stop, listen,  wait, go. Two
       wary, interchangeable animals. Frank  disappears into
       the fog. When the figure reappears,  Frank is moving
       faster, closing the gap.

       The figure, seen in CLOSEUP for the first time, is wear-
       ing a dark-colored ski mask.  His breath billows out of
       the mouth hole, whitening in the cool March air. He
       hears Frank APPROACHING and points his gun in the
       direction of the FOOTSTEPS.  He does not fire. SILENCE.
       Frank stops and rests on his haunches. Listening, he
       hears the intruder move. The sounds have stopped up
       ahead. Close.

       The figure peers into the fog, gun up.   He's ready,
       confident. He waits. Nothing.
       Frank, from his crouch, does something brand-new. He
       raises his gun into the fog in a two-handed grip, ready
       to fire. He holds it easily. And then he does something
       really strange: Frank closes his eyes. After a beat, we
       hear MOVEMENT. Frank, eyes still closed, swings his gun
       15 degrees and FIRES TWO BLASTS.
       The man jumps away from a small tree that has splintered
       six inches from his shoulder. His eyes are wild behind
       his ski mask. Frightened, he suddenly crashes away in
       the opposite direction. We FOLLOW. There is ANOTHER
       SHOT from Frank very close to the man.

176A   INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                              176A
       Herb is at the window. There is anguish on his face as
       he hears the SHOTS. He wants to go to his son's aid but
       knows he cannot leave Rachel.
       Rachel and Fletcher are huddled in the bed, terrified.
       Fletcher clutches at the DOG, which is still BARKING.
       Henry stands by the bed, gun in hand.

176B   EXT. WOODS - NIGHT                                         176B
       Frank moves quickly through the woods, passes the
       splintered tree. We STAY WITH him and hear the ENGINE
       of a CAR ROAR to life and TIRES PEEL OUT of the dirt.
       Frank breaks out of the woods in time to see the red
       lights at the back of the car as it fishtails around a
       bend. He EMPTIES his GUN at it. We hear GLASS
       SHATTERING, but the car keeps going.

176C   INT. PHONE BOOTH - COUNTRY ROAD - EARLY MORNING            176C

                                                                  117.


       Snow is falling. In the b.g. we see the flashing
       lights of a police car. Frank is on the phone to
       Minella.
                             MINELLA (V.O.)
                But, Frank, this doesn't make
                sense...
                             FRANK
                What do you mean?
                             MINELLA (V.O.)
                We already got him.
                              FRANK
                What?   Where?

179    INT. F.B.I. HEADQUARTERS (LOS ANGELES) - EARLY MORNING   179
       Minella is talking with Frank on the phone. He's looking
       into an observation room through a one-way window.
                             MINELLA
                Here, last night. You should see
                his locker, Frank. The guy's
                obsessed with Rachel Marron...
                             FRANK
                You're sure it's him?
                             MINELLA
                Forensics say it's 100 percent
                positive I.D... And he's got a
                black Toyota 4 x 4. Ray's with
                him now.
       MINELLA'S POV
       Sitting in the observation room at a table talking to
       Ray Court is Dan. He looks frightened and confused.

179A   INT. PHONE BOOTH - COUNTRY ROAD - EARLY MORNING          179A
                             FRANK
                Well, whoever you got down there
                wasn't here last night. This was
                a professional...
                             MINELLA (V.O.)
                This is crazy... What do you want
                to do, Frank?
                             FRANK
                How long can you keep him?

                                                                   118.


                            MINELLA (V.O.)
               Well technically all he's done is
               write some letters. 48 hours
               maximum. You know the deal.


181   EXT. MARRON MANSION - DRIVEWAY - DAY                       181
      Rachel's black limousine moves slowly up the winding
      drive, followed by a black Mercedes limousine. Behind
      the cars, the gates close on a large press contingent
      gathered outside, held back by a large number of police
      and security guards. A light drizzle is falling.
      The two cars pull up to the entrance, Henry at the wheel
      of Rachel's. Frank gets out of the front and opens the
      back door. Devaney and Spector help Rachel and Fletcher
      out of the car. They are all dressed in black. A few
      other mourners, including Emma, get out of the Mercedes.
      Rachel, red-eyed and weary, takes Fletcher under her arm
      and goes inside. She does not look at Frank.

182   INT. FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT                                   182
      A hand takes a pitcher of orange juice from the refriger-
      ator and pours some into a large glass. They uncap a
      bottle of vodka and pour a huge portion into the orange
      juice.

183   INT. FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT                                   183
      It has grown very dark in the family room. Frank is
      sitting all alone, perfectly still, in one of the over-
      stuffed chairs, the vodka bottle on a table next to him.
      He stares off into space. A small voice comes out of
      the darkness.
                            FLETCHER
               You okay, Frank?
      Frank acknowledges Fletcher's small presence standing
      to the side of the big chair. He doesn't look at him
      directly.
                            FRANK
               Yeah, Fletcher, I'm okay.     How
               'bout you?
                            FLETCHER
               I couldn't sleep... It was so
               scary, just thinking about it...
      He looks at Frank.

                                                                    119.


                            FLETCHER
               Do you feel scared, Frank?
                            FRANK
               Yeah, Fletcher, I do.

      Frank puts his hand gently on Fletcher's head, but he
      does not look at him.
                            FRANK
               Everybody's afraid of something,
               Flethcer. That's how we know we
               care about something, when we're
               afraid we'll lose it.

                            FLETCHER
               What are you afraid of?
                            FRANK
               I think you should try to go back
               to sleep now, pal.
                            FLETCHER
               Tell me, Frank, please. Is it the
               man who killed Nicki? Are you
               afraid of him?
      Finally, Frank turns and looks at Fletcher.    Frank is
      pretty far gone. He shakes his head "no."     He realizes
      that that kind of fear had never occurred to   him, and
      recognizing that fact sets him back into his   thoughts.
                              FLETCHER
               Then what?    What are you afraid
               of?
      Frank doesn't have the will to resist anymore.    He lets
      his hand drop away from Fletcher.
                            FRANK
               I'm afraid... of not being there...
      Fletcher stares at him, uncomprehending.
                            FRANK
               It's late. Do you want me to take
               you back to your room?
      Fletcher shakes his head "no," just barely.    Then he
      disappears.

185   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                        185
      Frank, silhouetted, moves toward the stairway to the main
      level. There is light up there.

                                                                  120.



186   INT. STAIRWAY - NIGHT                                    186
      Frank begins climbing the stairs. When he has gone a
      quarter of the way up, Rachel appears at the top and
      begins walking down.

      At first she doesn't see Frank; when she does she
      hesitates a moment, then continues down. They meet and
      try to sidestep each other, but twice they go in the
      same direction, unable to get around. Rachel, already
      emotionally ravaged, cracks. She begins slapping Frank
      hard about the face and torso. One of the first blows
      knocks the GLASS from his hand; it SMASHES loudly against
      the wall. He raises his arms in a half-hearted attempt
      to protect himself from the onslaught. She cries as she
      hits him.
                            RACHEL
                      (hysterical)
               You, you, you... You brought this
               pain into my house... Now you're
               here! Where were you then? Why
               didn't you save her? It was your
               job to protect me and she died
               doing it... It was me they were
               after. And you let them kill her!
                      (she gasps for air)
               She never did anything to anyone.
      As she loses the strength and the will to hit him, her
      blows become sloppy, weak. She sinks to the steps,
      sitting on them, sobbing.
                            RACHEL
               She never hurt anyone. She was
               good.
                      (she looks at him;
                       entreats him)
               You saw her. She never wished
               anyone any harm. Did she? Did
               she?
      Frank looks at her, shakes his head "no." Rachel puts
      her head in her hands and is silent for a few moments;
      her crying slows.
                            RACHEL
                      (finally, quietly)
               She never hurt a soul.
                      (long pause)
               ... I didn't love her well enough.
               I didn't take care of her...
                      (a beat)
               ... She gave me only love.

                                                                     121.

       She sits quietly on the steps in the gloom. Frank watches
       for a long moment, then softly continues on his way.

186A   EXT. POOL AREA - MARRON ESTATE - DAY                      186A
       It's bright sunshine. Fletcher is splashing noisily in
       the pool with a few other kids. His nanny waits
       patiently at the side, towels at the ready.
       At one side of the pool, Rachel sits, lost in thought,
       mourning her sister.
       At the other side sits Frank, also thoughtful. He, too,
       is trying to adjust to the tragedy for which he bears
       some of the responsibility.

       The SHOUTS and LAUGHTER of the kids continue.

187    EXT. MARRON ESTATE - GROUNDS - LATER THAT NIGHT           187
       The guardhouse at the main gate is brilliantly illumi-
       nated in the distance. The guard patrols at his station.
       Inside, the T.V. screens flicker and glow.
       Perched on the top of a slight   hill, Frank sits alone and
       motionless under a big tree.    He gazes down at the gate-
       house, his face lit softly by   the glow from its lamps.
       All around him the rest of the   estate is quiet and
       tranquil in the moonlight.
       After a moment, another silhouetted figure slowly ap-
       proaches and stands beside him. It's Rachel.
                             RACHEL
                I guess you've heard what's
                happening.
       Frank nods.
                             RACHEL
                Mind if I sit down?
       Frank shakes his head. They sit side by side for awhile,
       both lost in thought. Rachel seems very calm.
                             RACHEL
                It isn't over yet, is it?
       Frank shakes his head.
                             FRANK
                He knows he still hasn't got you.
                             RACHEL
                So he'll come again?

                                                          122.


                      FRANK
         It's possible.
                       RACHEL
         The Oscars?

                       FRANK
         Maybe.
Rachel takes this philosophically.     She tugs at the
grass, thinking.
                      RACHEL
         When I was back in Squirrel Hill,
         I started betting my friends
         fifty bucks each that someday I'd
         win an Oscar. You can understand
         how important it is that they see
         me up there if I win.
She looks at him and smiles.
                      RACHEL
         If everyone of those pikers comes
         through, it could add up to a lot
         of money.
                      FRANK
         I think it's very dangerous.
                      RACHEL
         I know. But I can't stay up here
         on my hill forever.
They are silent for awhile.     Rachel lies back on the
grass, stares at the sky.
                      RACHEL
         I didn't get to this place in my
         life by doing the smart thing
         every time.
                (as Frank nods)
         How 'bout you, Frank Farmer? Out
         there on the edge... did you ever
         do something that didn't make too
         much sense, except maybe inside
         you? In your stomach somewhere?
         Something that wasn't smart?
                (looks at him)
         I'll bet you have plenty. I'll
         bet you do. Nobody gets really
         good without it. And you're good.
         I know that.
She sits up beside him.

                                                                       123.


                            RACHEL
               I don't know why all this has
               happened to me...
                      (a beat)
               ... but I do know that none of
               it's your fault. I hope you can
               hear me, because this is how I say
               I'm sorry.
      Frank accepts.
                            RACHEL
                      (relieved)
               So... I'm going to go see if I win
               an Oscar. And I won't worry about
               it at all. Because I've got you
               to protect me.
      Frank almost smiles.
                            FRANK
               That's right.
      He looks at her a long time, then takes her in his arms.
      He kisses her and lays her down. His body moves over
      hers. Like a bodyguard, protecting her from the night.

188   EXT. THE PANTAGES THEATRE - NIGHT                           188
      The chaos and razamatazz of Oscar night.   Crowds, limos,
      cameras, searchlights...

189   INT. RACHEL'S LIMO - FRONT OF THE PANTAGES - NIGHT          189
      The limo is waiting in a line of limos to reach the red-
      carpeted entrance to The Pantages Theatre.
      Frank and Tony sit in front with Henry. In the back a
      spectacularly-gowned Rachel sits flanked by Devaney and
      Spector, both of whom, like Frank, are wearing tuxedos.     Up
      ahead, they can all see the hubbub at the entrance: TV
      cameras, lights, photographers, arriving guests, two
      bleachers full of fans. The glare from the arc lights
      is almost blinding.
                            DEVANEY
               We'll go straight back to the
               Green Room. Right, Frank?
      Frank nods.
                            DEVANEY
               Got that, Tony?

                                                                  124.


                            FRANK
               Tony knows what he's doing.
      Tony looks at Frank, surprised and not a little pleased
      with the unexpected support.

                            RACHEL
               I wish you boys would relax a
               little. Nothing bad's gonna
               happen out there, alright?
                      (the old Rachel)
               Unless I lose the fucking award.
      She looks around at the men, all are tense.

                            RACHEL
               Jesus, what a crew.
      Rachel leans forward and flips down the mirror on the
      panel in front of her and checks her appearance. The
      limo moves up.
                            RACHEL
               Screw it. I'm through worrying.
               When your number's up, it's up.
               Right, Farmer?
      The limo is almost at the red carpet.   Frank slips out
      the front door of the moving limo.

190   EXT. LIMO - NIGHT                                         190
      More quartz lights click on.
      The TV cameras all focus on the door of the limo as Frank
      steps out of the way.
      FRANK'S POV
      as he surveys the busy scene. A microphoned M.C. peers
      into Rachel's limo and walks toward it.
                            M.C.
               ... Miss Rachel Marron!
      ON TV CAMERA MONITOR we see Rachel wave to the crowd.
                            M.C.
               Everyone wishes you the best
               tonight, Rachel.
      Frank leads the small procession down the red carpet.
      Fans reach out asking for his autograph.
      FRANK'S POV

                                                                 125.


      as his glance darts around: high into the bleachers,
      ahead in the distance, to the door, to the side at
      photographers nodding to the massed security men with
      their walkie-talkies.
      Rachel's smile is convincing, lovely, professional.
      Spector, Devaney and Tony look strained.
      As they enter, a WIDE SHOT from across the street shows
      their limo pulling ahead as the next car pulls up. The
      CAMERA TRACKS SIDEWAYS to reveal the rear fender of a
      Toyota 4X4 parked in the foreground.

191   INT. GREEN ROOM - NIGHT                                      191

      It is large and has been fitted with a bar and buffet.
      Formally-dressed presenters and hosts mill about, laugh-
      ing and talking. Many greet Rachel.
      A TV monitor hangs from the ceiling in one corner. On
      it, the Academy Awards continue. An elaborate dance
      number is just concluding. The audience applauds.
      Beside the monitor, a large clock with a ticking second
      hand.
      A harried associate producer SKIP THOMAS, comes up to
      Rachel, settled in an armchair. Tony stands nearby,
      Frank leans against a far wall.
                            SKIP
               Hello, Rachel. I need to get you
               straight on your responsibilities.
                             RACHEL
               Sure, Skip.
      Skip takes a typewritten sheet from a sheaf in his hand
      and gives it to Rachel. He consults a clipboard as he
      speaks. There, laid out minute by minute, is the order
      of the evening's events. Each one has a precise time
      printed beside it, including those that involve Rachel.
                            SKIP
               Now, it's Best Sound, then another
               song, then you. At precisely
               (looks at his clipboard) -- 8:07,
               you'll be presenting with Clive
               Healy. Those are your lines. The
               prompter's straight ahead and --
               we pray -- working perfectly.
      Rachel nods.
                             RACHEL

                                                                  126.

                  Fine, you'll be a big shot
                  someday, Skip.
      Skip smiles and walks off, glancing up at the clock.
      7:43. CLIVE HEALY, a slim British actor appears, bows
      and kisses Rachel's hand.

                               CLIVE
                  I understand it's my great honor
                  to escort you onstage.
                               RACHEL
                  That's right, Clive. And I don't
                  like it one bit that you look
                  skinnier than me.

      TV MONITOR - The show is progressing, flashing out across
      the world.

      The celebrities in the Green Room drink, eat and talk.
      Rachel is deep in a giggling, girlish conversation with
      another actress. Skip Thomas approaches Rachel again.

                  Rachel.    One more song, then you.
      Rachel nods, goes back to her conversation.       Frank steps
      up to Tony.
                               FRANK
                  I'm going to have a look around.
                  I'll come back for her. Stay
                  alert.
      Tony nods, watches Frank go.

193   INT. BACKSTAGE AREA - NIGHT                                     193
      Frank moves down the hall from the Green Room toward the
      stage. Stagehands, technicians, performers speak in
      hushed tones. TV monitors are mounted throughout the
      area. On screen a distinguished-looking actor named
      REARDON is serving as temporary master of ceremonies.
      Frank walks along, checking the route, looking up into
      the flies. He rounds a corner and is face to face with
      Portman.
                                FRANK
                  Portman.   What are you doing here?
                               PORTMAN
                  I'm on the job.
                                FRANK
                  Who?
                                PORTMAN
                  Him.
      Portman points at a nearby TV monitor.      On screen,
      Reardon is introducing the next song.
                               REARDON (V.O.)
                         (on TV screen)
                  My mother has always thought I was
                  the star of every movie I've been
                  in. You remember 'Night Of The
                  Stranger'?
      Applause.
                               REARDON (V.O.)
                  You probably don't remember me in
                  that. My mother can tell you
                  about it. To this day, she thinks
                  it's about a desk clerk at the
                  hotel where what's-his-name is
                  hiding out from the cops.

                                                                     128.

      Laughter.
                               REARDON (V.O.)
                  Now it's time to hear the final
                  nominated song, from the film
                  'Queen Of The Night' -- 'I Have
                  Nothing.' And here to sing it for
                  us, the multi-talented Miss Sandra
                  Castle!
                               PORTMAN (O.S.)
                         (during the above)
                  Short-term gig... but quite
                  profitable... Listen, Frank, I'm
                  sorry about Miami. You know,
                  nothing really happened... I felt
                  bad for you... I wanted to say
                  something, but you disappeared...
      (NOTE: "I Have Nothing" fanfare. Dancers onto stage.
      First section of song, commencing with shortened chorus
      then first verse (Total 1 Minute)
      Reardon walks off the stage ten feet from where Frank and
      Portman are standing, glances at them and moves off down
      the hall.
                               PORTMAN
                  Back to work. I'll probably see
                  you at the Governor's Ball.
      Portman walks off after Reardon.    Frank watches him,
      thoughtful.
      ON TV MONITOR - Sandra Castle sings "I Have Nothing" with
      great feeling. The lyrics recall the text of the death
      threat.

                 Yeah, Frank.
                              FRANK
                 Tony, I've got a feeling this is
                 the night. I think he's gonna go
                 for her in front of all the
                 cameras. The kind of thing only a
                 lunatic would do. That's how he
                 wants it to look. Except he isn't
                 a lunatic. He's very clever. I
                 need you to help me.
                              TONY
                        (O.S.)
                 I'm with you, Frank.
       There's no more competition between them.
       Three sound technicians appear at Frank's side, very
       agitated.

      Frank walks past Tony. Tony holds up the earpiece in
      frustration. Frank nods. He walks over to Rachel. He
      seems tense and she senses it. And like a tangible
      thing, his anxiety is passed over to her. She is
      frightened.
                            RACHEL
                      (spooked)

               Rachel... Clive. Let's go, okay?
      Clive Healy comes over. Rachel must tear her eyes away
      from Frank. Tony floats up behind them. Skip regards
      him with irritation and turns to Frank.
                            SKIP
                      (indicating Tony)

               Tony stays.
      Skip looks at Rachel for a response.
                              RACHEL
               Yes!    I want him.
      Skip shrugs.    Clive takes Rachel's arm.

               Come, Rachel, let us brighten the
               firmament.
      Rachel forces a smile, but her eyes follow Frank as he
      starts to lead the way out of the Green Room. On an
      impulse, she reaches for something from the makeup table
      and presses it into her hand. It's the Russian Orthodox
      cross. She clutches it like a talisman and follows
      Frank. Tony brings up the rear.

Clive and Rachel climb the stairs. Rachel turns once
more to look anxiously at Frank. She clutches the cross
but he doesn't see.
Frank watches them ascend. He signals Tony to stay
there until Rachel goes on. Frank moves off toward the
stage left wings.
ON TV MONITOR - we see Reardon, acting as Master of
Ceremonies, doing the introductions.
                        REARDON (V.O.)
                  (on screen)
           I used to have an outfit just like
           that... And to present the Best
           Song award we have our debonair
           friend from England and the lady
           who has everything -- Clive
           Healy and Rachel Marron!
A red camera light clicks on.
MUSIC UP, APPLAUSE, as we see Clive and Rachel make their
entrances on the TV monitor.

                                                                    132.


198   INT. STAGE LEFT - NIGHT                                           198
      Frank swiftly adjusts his position so he can still see
      the stage. As he does, he glances under the scaffolding
      that supports the set.


199   INT. ON STAGE - NIGHT                                       199
      Rachel and Clive reach the podium. Clive is all smiles.
      Rachel is trying, but is obviously distracted.
      FROM BEHIND THEM
      As the applause dies away, we see  what they see: TV
      cameras, an orchestra in the pit,  the huge audience, and
      the bright glare of the lights.   At the front of the
      podium is the transparent plastic  of the teleprompter;
      their lines can be clearly seen,  printed out and moving
      vertically.
                            CLIVE
                      (reading from the
                       prompter)
               Well, Rachel, I know that you only
               came tonight to present this award
               and you'll want to leave as soon
               as we're done.
      Rachel's lines appear on the prompter, but she does not
      start reading them immediately. They stop moving on the
      screen. Rachel's face, her eyes darting about. There
      is an awful silence.

      RACHEL'S POV - BRIGHT RED LIGHT
      on the nearest TV camera. The teleprompter, now showing
      Clive's lines. The light. A man in the first row of
      the audience.
      CLOSE ON HER HANDS as they squeeze the cross.
                            CLIVE (O.S.)
               Over the course of the evening
               we've heard five smashing songs
               and the names of the artists who
               created them.

200   INT. STAGE LEFT - NIGHT                                           200
      Frank, watching Rachel, hears the barely audible CLICKING
      start from the tiny receiver on his belt. He's puzzled.
      His eyes dart to Rachel's hand and he sees the cross.
      He knows what she's going through. Her hand is shaking

                                                                    133.

      badly.

201   INT. ON STAGE - NIGHT                                       201
      She sways. Clive supports her as discreetly as he can,
      smiling out at the audience.

      FROM BEHIND Clive and Rachel, we watch as Clive picks up
      Rachel's lines from the prompter, AD LIBBING to make them
      fit.
                              CLIVE
                 And I know that no matter what
                 anyone thinks, you have no
                 personal favorites.

      Thin laughter. The audience is starting to sense that
      something is wrong with Rachel.
                              CLIVE
                 The Best Song nominees are:
                 "Clock On The Wall" from 'The
                 Dining Room Table' -- By Dana S.
                 Lee and Sara Spring. 'Give
                 Me Your Trust' from 'Out Of the
                 Gloom' -- By David Siegel and
                 Barbara G. Gordon. "I Have
                 Nothing" from 'Queen Of The Night'
                 -- By Nancy Garbor. "Maybe Soon"
                 from 'Maybe Soon' -- Anne Trop and

                 Heart" from 'Hot And Cold' -- By
                 Leslie Moraes.
                                                  QUICK CUT TO:
      RACHEL'S POV
      An usher near the wall shifts his weight. The orchestra
      conductor turns to look at her. A musician turns his
      sheet music. The dark at the back of the balcony. The
      teleprompter.
      CLOSE ON FRANK
      as he alone hears the CLICKING -- monitors her distress
      and fear.
      ON STAGE
                              RACHEL
                        (blurting her
                         prompter lines)
                 All right, Clive, let's find
                 out --

                                                                       134.

      The teleprompter operator has been thrown off and now
      takes a moment to get it moving again.
                               RACHEL
                         (reading)
                  -- let's find out who the winner
                  is.

                               CLIVE
                  The envelope. Rachel, shall I do
                  the honors?
      INTERCUT --
      RACHEL'S POV - CLIVE'S HANDS

      work at the envelope, tearing, freeing the flap.       His
      fingers work to pull out the contents.
      RACHEL'S FACE
      watching. The CLICKING is almost deafening -- like a
      heartbeat.
      THE CLOCK
      The second hand ticks in enormous CLOSEUP.       It's 8:07.

202   INSERT - (BLEACHED OUT) ENORMOUS CLOSEUP - MAN'S FINGER        202
      on a trigger.

203   INSERT - (BLEACHED OUT) ENORMOUS CLOSEUP - A BULLET            203
      drifts lazily towards us out of the muzzle of a gun in
      ultra SLOW MOTION.

204   INSERT - (BLEACHED OUT) - HANDS                                204
      bring out one of the pasted-up death threats with the
      familiar opening lines -- 'MARRON BITCH -- YOU HAVE
      EVERYTHING. I HAVE NOTHING.'
      CLOSE
      as Clive pulls the card out of the envelope.       It reads:
                           "I HAVE NOTHING"
                              Music by
      Rachel gasps, stifles a scream.
                               CLIVE
                  And the winner is "I Have Nothing"

                                                                         135.

                  from 'Queen Of The Night' music
                  and lyrics by Nancy Garbor.
      Rachel loses control, backs away from the podium and runs
      off stage right. The audience applauds the winner.
                               NANCY GARBOR
                  This is so exciting. I can't
                  begin to describe what it feels
                  like to stand here -- with this!
      APPLAUSE.
                               NANCY GARBOR
                  First, I want to thank Rachel
                  Marron. Without her support,
                  encouragement and determination
                  to help get an unknown songwriter
                  heard, I wouldn't be standing here.
                  A lot of people talk about how
                  they're going to help others once
                  they make it themselves, but Rachel
                  really follows through. I'd also
                  like to thank Helen Pollak, a
                  wonderful producer, who never got
                  fed up with me.

205   INT. OFF STAGE LEFT - NIGHT                                    205
      Frank sees Rachel run off the opposite side of the stage
      and heads over there, around the back of the scenery.

206   INT. ON STAGE - NIGHT                                          206
      Clive, the professional, stands holding the envelope.         He
      glances off after Rachel, mystified.

207   INT. STAGE RIGHT WINGS - NIGHT                                 207
      A cluster of people   surround Rachel, comforting her.
      Frank comes up. He    does not try to force his way through
      to Rachel. People    begin to move away, the cluster thins.
      Two stars move off   toward the back of the stage.
                               STAR #1
                  I always said she was nuts.    I've
                  always said that.
      Clive Healy comes up.
                               CLIVE
                  Is she all right?
      He is assured that she is.       Clive goes out to his seat

                                                               136.

in the audience. As the people move off, Rachel becomes
clearly visible to Frank. Tony is standing next to her,
but another man has his arm around Rachel, comforting her.
Rachel's face is tear-stained and she dabs at it with a
handkerchief. She is recovering fast. Past her fear,
she is now very embarrassed. Her voice is strong.

                      RACHEL
         Christ, what an idiot I am.
         Jesus. What the hell's the matter
         with me?
Frank moves up closer, and exchanges looks with Tony,
who is confused by Rachel's behavior. Rachel turns
toward Frank and, in so doing, brings the man comforting
her around to face Frank. It is Reardon.
                      RACHEL
         Farmer, you've made me a raving
         lunatic.
Frank barely hears Rachel, so struck is he   by Reardon's
presence. Frank looks around them quickly    for Portman.
Rachel looks at Frank with irritation and   turns back
toward the Green Room. A production aide    signals Reardon.
                      REARDON
                (to Rachel)
         I have to go back out.   Are you
         okay?
                      RACHEL
         Thank you for your help, John.
         I'm fine.
Rachel walks off toward the Green Room with Tony.
Reardon starts to walk out toward the stage. Frank stops
him. Reardon is irritated.
                      FRANK
         Where's Portman?
                      REARDON
         Who?
                      FRANK
         Portman.
                      REARDON
                (breaking away)
         Never heard of him.
Reardon walks out on stage. Frank is left standing alone.
All the weariness comes back, all his senses start to hum.
Frank looks around, then moves off toward the Green Room.

                                                                   137.


208   INT. GREEN ROOM - NIGHT                                        208
      Rachel sits at a makeup table.   Skip Thomas approaches,
      clipboard in hand.
                            SKIP
               Rachel, I'm sorry, but if you're
               going to be in your seat for the
               Best Actress award, you've got
               to do it now.
                            RACHEL
               Skip, I'm moving as fast as I can.
               For chrissake, go twitch somewhere
               else.

      Skip backs off.   Spector and Frank join the group.
                            SPECTOR
               Honey, everything's fine. No one
               noticed anything. Everybody in
               this building is ready to jump out
               of their skin from nerves.
                            RACHEL
               Bullshit, you saw me. Farmer's
               made me a raving lunatic --
                            FRANK
               Something's going on you should
               know about --
                            SPECTOR
               You're making her crazy.   You're
               making us all crazy.
                            FRANK
               Rachel, I know who it is. He's
               here tonight. I think he's...
                             RACHEL
               Shut up...
      This is the last straw. She throws down the powder and
      stands up fast, makeup and purse flying. The powder com-
      pact bursts over the cross lying on the table. Everyone
      in the Green Room looks at her.
                            RACHEL
                      (hissing at him)
               Shut up, you maniac! You never
               stop. Now you've made an ass of
               me in front of a billion people.
               And you won't quit.
      They stare at each other and everyone else stares at them.

                                                                 138.

      Rachel walks swiftly out the door of the Green Room.
      Frank sits for a moment, then stands up. The bodyguard
      follows his charge to the door. He whispers hurriedly
      at Tony as they leave.
                              FRANK
                 Tony, it's Portman.   Remember?   The
                 guy from Miami...
      Spector grabs Tony's sleeve, pulling him back.
                              SPECTOR
                 After tonight, you're back in
                 charge.
                             TONY
                 What?
                              SPECTOR
                 He knows nothing about show
                 business.
      Tony squares off with Spector.
                              TONY
                 You are an asshole.

209   INT. ONSTAGE - NIGHT                                     209
      Reardon is just introducing TOM WINSTON, the actor who
      will announce the Best Actress award.
      BEST ACTRESS INTRO (TOTAL 1 MINUTE)
      (Reardon back on stage to applause, Reardon linking
      material (maybe gags.) Reardon intros Winston. Play on
      Winston to applause.)

210   INT. MAIN AUDITORIUM - AISLE                             210
                              REARDON
                 Presenting the Best Actress award,
                 we have the man who last year
                 received the top honor an actor
                 can achieve for his performance in
                 "South Of Waco". Ladies and
                 gentlemen, Tom Winston!
      APPLAUSE
      Frank watches, his eyes scanning, searching the vast
      theatre, squinting as he tries to see beyond the glare
      of the klieg lights and the cameras.
                              WINSTON
                 Thank you, John, thank you, Academy.

                                                             139.

            It brings back some great memories
            to be standing here again. Last
            year I figured something out.
            While it is a great honor to be
            nominated, actually winning caps
            the evening very pleasantly.

LAUGHTER
WINSTON
on stage, speaking and then listing the nominees.
FRANK'S POV - RACHEL, DEVANEY AND SPECTOR
in their seats, up the aisle toward the back of the
theatre, high into the gloom of the balcony.
ANGLE ON STAGE
                         WINSTON
            Tonight we give this award not to
            the best actress, but to the best
            performance by one of five
            exquisitely talented artists...
FRANK'S FACE - searching.
TV CAMERA - focused on the audience.    Its red light goes
on.
ON SCREEN
Rachel's face, expectant, nervous on the screen.
FRANK'S POV - THE PATH
Rachel would have to take to the stage, the steps to the
stage, the faces of the ushers near the stage, the
conductor, ready to play theme music.
                         WINSTON (O.S.)
            ...And the nominees for best
            performance by an actress in a
            leading role are -- Constance
            Simpson for Hot and Cold...
BACK TO SCENE
APPLAUSE. Frank slips through the curtained doorway that
leads to the backstage.
                         WINSTON (O.S.)
            ...Ellen Pearson for Maybe Soon...
More APPLAUSE.

                                                                  140.


211   INT. BACKSTAGE - STAGE RIGHT WINGS - NIGHT                211
      Frank comes up swiftly. He stops behind a curtain, six
      feet from the path the winner will take. Tony is there.
      Frank speaks to him and, as he does, he puts a hand on
      Tony's arm. They both look across the stage, past
      Winston into the wings on the other side.
      FRANK'S POV
      In the wings of the opposite side of the stage, half
      hidden by a curtain, a TV cameraman is hoisting his
      lightweight portable camera onto his shoulder. His back
      is to us.

                               WINSTON (O.S.)
                  ... Rachel Marron for Queen Of The Night...
      APPLAUSE.
      ANGLE ON FRANK
                               FRANK
                  Tony, I want you on the other
                  side... and check out that guy.
                  He's not supposed to be there...
      Tony trots off quickly.
      FRANK'S POV
      The cameraman half-turns toward us, peering past the
      curtain into the audience. For a split second, we
      glimpse his face. It's Portman. Then someone crosses
      quickly in front of him and he's gone.
                               WINSTON (O.S.)
                  L.C. Dean for I Dream Of Peace
                  ...and Evelyn Gardner for
                  The Harper Plan...
      APPLAUSE.
      BACKSTAGE
      Frank draws his gun. He glances quickly to Tony, but
      Tony's already on his way, trotting round the labyrinth
      behind the set.
      Frank automatically raises his sleeve to call to Tony,
      then realizes his communications are useless. He tries
      to see where Portman has disappeared to, but he daren't
      lose sight of Rachel.
      ONSTAGE - WINSTON

                                                                     141.

      with envelope.
                             WINSTON
                And the winner is... Rachel Marron
                for Queen Of The Night.
                                                   FLASH CUT TO:

      FRANK'S FACE
      grim.   He looks past the curtain to Rachel.
      FRANK'S POV - AUDITORIUM
      Deafening applause in the main auditorium. A stunned
      Rachel stands. Devaney and Spector kiss her. People
      nearby reach out to touch her. Rachel walks along her
      row. The orchestra plays "I Have Nothing."

212   INT. BACKSTAGE - OPPOSITE WINGS - NIGHT                      212
      A mass of drapes and flats. Behind them, the cameraman
      is fixing something to the side of his camera. His back
      is to us. Tony comes up briskly behind him, unable to
      see his face.
                             TONY
                Hey! You! What the fuck you
                think you're doin' back here...
      With amazing speed, the cameraman - Portman - wheels
      around, simultaneously jabbing two outstretched fingers
      from his free hand straight into Tony's eyes. Tony
      cries out, his hands flying to his face.
      Portman's hand moves swiftly again, jabbing to a nerve
      behind Tony's ear, Tony drops like a sack.
      Glancing rapidly around, Portman sees all other eyes on
      the auditorium. He pulls the curtain around Tony's
      body - obscuring it.
      He then removes his own "SECURITY" ID and fixes a
      laminated "PRESS" ID to his lapel.

213   INT. BACKSTAGE - STAGE RIGHT WINGS - NIGHT                   213
      Frank gestures animatedly to the head of security and
      several guards. The music and the applause drown out
      his words and we do not hear them. The guards rush off
      backstage and into the auditorium.

214   INT. MAIN AUDITORIUM - NIGHT                                 214

                                                            142.

Rachel walks along her row. Hands reach out to her.
Some people stand in their seats around her. A crane-
mounted TV camera swoops down between Frank and his view
of Rachel, obscuring her for a brief instant.
CLOSE ON FRANK'S FACE

Desperately scanning, seeking.   Suddenly his face
freezes.
FRANK'S POV
As Rachel reaches the center aisle and starts to walk
toward the steps, there in the far aisle, his face almost
hidden, is Portman -- the camera, hand-held on his
shoulder, moving level with Rachel, 20 feet behind her.

Frank raises his gun.

AISLE
Rachel walks down the aisle toward the side steps. Tears
in her eyes. Thunderous applause. Security guards in
the side aisles look around in all directions. They
can't see anything.
FRANK'S POV
TIGHT ON Portman, now almost completely obscured behind
the members of the audience, as more and more of them
stand to applaud Rachel.
PORTMAN'S POV
ALONG THE SIDE OF THE CAMERA. Rachel keeps appearing and
disappearing behind the heads of the audience.
FRANK IN THE WINGS
Desperate to get a clear shot at Portman but unable to
fire without hitting a bystander.
FROM STAGE RIGHT WINGS - FRANK'S POV OF RACHEL
as she  approaches the podium, steadily, controlling
herself  as she mounts the steps. The outline of her body
becomes  difficult to see against the glare of the foot-
lights  and the lights at the side of the auditorium.
FRANK'S FACE
His eyes squint against the dazzle.
ON STAGE - PODIUM
Rachel approaches Winston.   The applause and music is

                                                                     143.

      deafening.
      FRANK'S FACE
      He can't see Portman past the glare. He can't fire into
      the audience. He knows Rachel is now at her most vulner-
      able. There is only one thing he can do to protect his
      charge.
      BACKSTAGE WINGS
      Frank runs on stage at terrific speed and leaps through
      the air at Rachel, twisting his body as he does.

      ON STAGE - PODIUM

      Rachel turns her head, sees Frank leaping at her and
      gasps out with a mixture of fury and terror.
                              RACHEL
                 No!
      CLOSE ON PORTMAN
      The silenced PISTOL taped to the side of the camera FIRES.
      ONCE. TWICE.
      ON STAGE
      Frank and Rachel tumble over on the floor. The podium
      topples. There are screams from the audience.
      AUDITORIUM
      Pandemonium breaks out. Men run on stage from all
      directions. Guns are drawn. Everyone is shouting. TV
      cameras whip-pan in all directions, security men shout
      into walkie-talkies.
                                                   QUICK CUT TO:
215   INT. MOBILE TV CONTROL VAN - NIGHT                           215
      Chaos on all screens.
                              TV DIRECTOR
                 What the fuck?
                              OTHER VOICE (O.S.)
                 Go to commercial...

216   INT. MAIN AUDITORIUM - NIGHT                                 216
      CLOSE ON PORTMAN

                                                                   144.

      Totally calm and, as he gambled, invisible in the commo-
      tion. Camera still on his shoulder, he slowly backs
      away from the scene. Ushers and uniformed security men
      rush past him towards the stage. People leap from their
      seats. A woman screams piercingly behind him. Portman
      doesn't blink.


217   INT. STAGE - NIGHT                                         217
      Dozens more helpers pour onto the stage around Frank and
      Rachel. Rachel starts to rise on all fours and sees, as
      hands reach out to help her, the blood on Frank's shirt.
      He has taken the hits for her. But he's still on the
      job, gaze alert. Without taking his eyes from the audi-
      torium, his left arm stretches out, with some pain, to
      push Rachel back down. The right arm, gun in hand,
      sweeps the auditorium. Where is Portman? Frank can't
      see past the mob.
      Ushers fall on Frank in a heap, trying to disarm him.
      Security men try to pull them off. Rachel shouts,
      trying to make herself heard above the noise.
                             RACHEL
                He's my bodyguard. Get off him!
                He's O.K...
      FRANK'S POV - SERIES OF SHOTS
      A SERIES of SWIFT LOW ANGLE SHOTS through legs and faces.
      One brief glimpse that could be Portman. A cameraman
      turns. It's not. Frank is desperate, pushing away a
      helping arm. The chaos mounts. SIRENS WAIL outside.

218   INT. MAIN AUDITORIUM - NIGHT                               218
      CLOSE ON PORTMAN
      He turns away from the stage as four cops pound past him.
      He walks away. Suddenly, for one brief second, his face
      loses its composure as he looks to the side door.
      PORTMAN'S POV
      Hysterical audience members jostle for the exit, screaming
      and shouting. It's like a football scrum. Cops and secur-
      ity men pushing and pulling. His escape route is blocked.
      CLOSE ON FRANK'S FACE - HIS EYES
      Briefly glimpsed through blurred, frenzied, f.g.   Still
      seeking his target, biting his lip in pain.
      PORTMAN

                                                                  145.


      Cool again, he turns back to the stage, seeking an
      alternative escape route, camera still providing cover.

219   INT. ON STAGE - WINGS - NIGHT                             219

      A lumbering figure, blood streaming from one eye, his
      .38 drawn and outstretched. It's Tony staggering to the
      edge of the stage, straight towards his attacker.
                             TONY
                       (bellowing)
                 Frank! Frank! Over here!
      ON STAGE

      Frank and Rachel's heads swivel in unison at the sound,
      looking towards the far aisle.
      PORTMAN
      Against the side wall at the front, Portman's eyes
      desperately scan for the source of the voice. He sees
      Tony, his pistol takes aim.
      FRANK'S POV
      For a split second, two running figures f.g. pass and
      cross leaving a momentary clear line to Portman.
      ON STAGE
      Frank FIRES.   ONCE.   TWICE.
      PORTMAN
      Frank's bullets hit home. The first slams Portman in the
      chest, knocking him against the wall. The second hits
      the CAMERA on his shoulder, EXPLODING it around his face.
      FEMALE ACADEMY MEMBER
      Blood spatters her white Armani dress and the shirt-
      front of her escort. Portman's body slumps forward in
      her lap, pinning her back in her seat. He's dead. His
      pistol drops onto a pair of shiny, black leather pumps.
      ON STAGE
      Frank holds his aim steady, reluctant to look away. He
      half turns to Rachel, wincing with the effort. She's
      unhurt. He has fulfilled his promise to her.
      Rachel throws her arms around Frank and hugs him, tears
      streaming down her cheeks.

                                                                    146.

      Frank Farmer's face. Sad and weary. His guard is
      finally down. Nothing more can happen. He slowly lowers
      the gun, closes his eyes and lets his head fall onto his
      chest.

      ANGLE ON SPECTOR

      In the midst of the commotion of medics, security men,
      police and ushers, Spector bends down and gently retrieves
      the gold envelope and the card bearing Rachel's name.
      There are splatters of blood on it. He tries to wipe
      them off with the silk handkerchief from his breast pocket.

220   EXT. THE PANTAGES THEATRE - NIGHT                          220

      A chaos of press and public, ambulance and police lights
      flashing, SIRENS WAILING.
      ANGLE ON PART OF CROWD
      Police and paramedics surrounding a man on a stretcher --
      it is Frank -- Rachel walks at his side, clutching his
      hand as he is rushed to an ambulance. Tony, a dressing
      over his eyes, is also helped out by paramedics. Among
      the gathered crowd, we focus in on one face. It is Dan,
      pushed back to the sidelines and unable to see what is
      happening. He slowly turns and walks away. CAMERA
      CRANES to a HIGH WIDE SHOT of the scene.

221   EXT. AIRPLANE TARMAC - DAY                                 221
      A buffed-out charter turboprop stands on the tarmac as
      the last pieces of equipment of Rachel's band are loaded
      aboard from a truck. A limousine pulls up and Rachel
      gets out with Tony and Court, who is clearly acting as
      her bodyguard.
      She greets some members of the band and others who will
      be part of her entourage. A roadie has her luggage
      removed from the limo and loaded aboard the plane.
      Devaney is trying to hurry her on board. Spector is
      conspicuous by his absence.
      As Rachel and the others prepare to get onto the plane,
      Tony, wearing a dark leather eyepatch, reacts to
      something O.S.
      Frank approaches from the nearby parking area. He is
      pale. Under his clothes it can be seen that his torso is
      still taped. He smiles as Tony. Their handshake becomes
      a quick abrazo.
                             FRANK
                       (indicating eyepatch)
                How's it going?

                                                           147.



                      TONY
         Under control. But it won't be
         the same... ya mutt.
Tony fakes a glancing blow to Frank's chin. Over by the
plane, Fletcher spots Frank and tugs at Rachel's dress,
till she turns to look. Fletcher runs up to Frank and
hugs him around the knees. Rachel approaches and Tony
moves back toward the plane.
Devaney waves in Frank's direction, tapping his watch to
indicate they are late. Frank waves and smiles.
Rachel's surprised to see Frank, but clearly happy.
Fletcher is ecstatic.
                      RACHEL
         You shouldn't be here.
Frank laughs.    There is a pause.
                      RACHEL
         So, you're quitting show business?
                        FRANK
         Yeah.
                      RACHEL
         Too bad. You had talent.      What
         are you going to do?
                      FRANK
         I thought I might hole up with my
         dad.
                (pats bandaged torso)
         Finish that chess game.
Rachel nods approvingly.
                      RACHEL
         Get him when Fletcher's not
         around.
                      FRANK
                (ruffling Fletcher's
                 hair)
         That's the idea.
Fletcher grins.   Rachel starts to cry.
                      FRANK
         So, how's the new guy?
                      RACHEL
         He's got white hair, Frank.

                                                                    148.



                            FRANK
               He's very good.
                            RACHEL
               Why'd you have to get me an old
               man?
                            FRANK
               I don't trust you.
                            RACHEL
               Yeah... well, give me a kiss and
               let's get this over with.

      Frank gives her an awkward hug.   They kiss.
                              FRANK
               'Bye Rachel.
      Rachel turns quickly. She almost runs up the boarding
      ladder. Frank remains watching her. Fletcher looks back
      over his shoulder as they disappear into the plane.

222   INT. PLANE - DAY                                            222
      Rachel takes a seat beside Fletcher.   Devaney leans over
      the aisle.
                            DEVANEY
               That wasn't so bad.
                      (he sees her tears)
               You okay?
      Rachel is in her own world. Devaney passes the word to
      get moving. The ENGINES WARM UP. Rachel turns and sees
      Frank still standing there looking at her.
223   INT. COCKPIT - DAY                                          223
      The pilot's hand pushes forward on the throttle.
224   EXT. PLANE - DAY                                            224
      The nosewheel starts to taxi.    The plane moves forward.
225   INT. PLANE - DAY                                            225
      Rachel's face at the window.
                              RACHEL
               Wait...

226   EXT. TARMAC - DAY                                           226

                                                            149.


The steps start to fold down out of the plane, but not
fast enough for Rachel.
She jumps the last six feet, staggering slightly as the
plane's jet wash hits her, whipping her clothes and hair.
Without pausing, she runs to Frank who takes her in his
arms. They embrace and kiss. They kiss again and again.
Finally, slowly, Rachel draws back, her eyes are filled
with tears.
                        RACHEL
           Remember when you said you'd risk
           your life for me?
Frank tries to break in, but she won't let him interrupt.

                        RACHEL
           I didn't really believe it then.
           Nobody means what they say. But
           you did, Frank. You did it. You
           laid it all on the line for me.
Frank tries to speak, she puts her hands to his lips.
                        RACHEL
           Don't wreck this for me. I don't
           want to hear any bullshit about
           you just doing your job. You did
           more than save my life, Frank.
           You showed me a way to be. And I
           love you for it.
                  (a beat)
           There, I said it.
                  (looks at him)
           I'll never forget what it felt
           like to be under your eye. Never.
                        FRANK
                  (smiles)
           I won't be forgetting you either.
She presses something into Frank's hand.
                        RACHEL
           Here... I want you to keep this.
           If you ever need me, you just put
           this on and no matter where you
           are I will find you.  I promise.
She gives him a quick kiss and walks back toward the
plane, her eyes holding Frank's. Frank opens his palm
to reveal the little enamel cross.
ON FRANK
as the engines roar and the plane turns to taxi out.

                                                                   150.

      The ROAR of the plane becomes APPLAUSE.

227   EXT. CONCERT - NIGHT                                       227
      Rachel's face in FULL FRAME, bathed in light and the
      applause of a huge audience.

                            RACHEL
               Thank you... Thank you... Now I
               want to sing you an old song, but
               it's a new favorite.
      As the music begins, Rachel stands alone in front of the
      band, mike in hand.

                            RACHEL
               You know, this song used to make
               me feel sad... But it doesn't
               anymore.
      Rachel pauses.   The audience is still.
                            RACHEL
               Now it just reminds me of someone
               very special... This is for him.
      Rachel begins to sing the song 'WHAT BECOMES OF THE
      BROKEN HEARTED' - slow and sweet.
      It's the song she and Frank danced to.    As a VERSE
      TRAILS OFF --

228   INT. CLERMONT HOTEL (IOWA CITY) - NIGHT                    228
      It is a Rotary Dinner.
      The CAMERA TRACKS ALONG the front of the head table which
      runs from one side of the room to the other.
                            ROTARY PRESIDENT (O.S.)
               Our speaker this evening, the
               honorable congressman from the
               fifth district, Galen Windsor, has
               been a lone, courageous, voice...
               he alone has challenged those who
               have linked organized crime with
               legitimate business throughout our
               state.
      STILL TRACKING, we see the Rotary  President as he nods to
      a distinguished-looking gentleman  one seat to his right.
      On the wall a sign identifying the  hotel and a club
      banner which reads -- "THE ROTARY  CLUB OF IOWA CITY."
      The CAMERA CONTINUES to TRACK and  the Rotary President
      goes OUT OF FRAME.

                                                                  151.


                            ROTARY PRESIDENT (O.S.)
               But first our benediction will be
               delivered by Reverend Phillip
               Hardy of the First Presbyterian Church.
      STILL TRACKING we see the Reverend get up as the men
      around him bow their heads.
                            REVEREND HARDY
               Heavenly Father, please bless us
               today as we meet in friendship and duty.
      STILL TRACKING as we REACH the end of the table.
                            REVEREND HARDY (O.S.)
               And Lord, whatever dangerous
               endeavors those among us may take,
               let them never be without your
               sanctuary.
      The CAMERA STOPS. Standing against the wall behind the
      table is Frank. As the Reverend's prayer goes on, all
      heads are bowed to receive the benediction. All heads
      but Frank's. The CAMERA MOVES IN TIGHT ON his face.
                            REVEREND HARDY
               ... For all we know in our hearts
               that even though we may walk
               through the valley of the shadow
               of death, you are with us...
               guiding and protecting us. Amen.
      The Reverend's final words segue into Rachel's song.
      Frank's searching gaze around the room is arrested for
      a moment as though reacting to Rachel's voice.

229   INT. CONCERT - NIGHT                                     229
      Rachel ends a phrase. She dabs at the corner of her eye
      as she continues the song that still binds them together.

230   INT. ROTARY CLUB DINNER - NIGHT                          230
      VERY CLOSE ON FRANK
      His expression, so intense in the opening scene of the
      film, is softer now. Rachel's voice continues as Frank
      carefully scans the room.
                                                FADE OUT:
                              THE END
"BONNIE & CLYDE"

                David Newman & Robert Benton




FADE IN.

INT. BEDROOM.  CLOSE-UP OF BONNIE PARKER.  DAY

Blonde, somewhat fragile, intelligent in expression.  She is
putting on make-up with intense concentration and
appreciation, applying lipstick and eye make-up.  As the
camera slowly pulls back from the closeup we see that we
have been looking into a mirror.  She is standing before the
full-length mirror in her bedroom doing her make-up.  She
overdoes it in the style of the time: rosebud mouth and so
forth.  As the film progresses her make-up will be refined
until, at the end, there is none.

The camera pulls back and continues to move very slowly
throughout the first part of this scene.  As the camera
continues to move away, we see, by degrees, that BONNIE is
naked.  Her nudity is never blatantly revealed to the
audience, but implied.  That is, she should be "covered" in
various ways from the camera's P.O.V., but the audience must
be aware of her exposure to CLYDE later in the scene.  This
is the only time in the film that she will ever be this
exposed, in all senses of the word, to the audience.  Her
attitude and appraisal of herself here are touched with
narcissism.

The bedroom itself is a second-story bedroom in a lower-
class frame house in West Dallas, Texas.  The neighborhood
is low income.  Though the room reveals its shabby
surroundings, it also reveals an attempt by BONNIE to fix it
up.  Small and corny objets d'art are all over the tops of
the bureaus, vanity tables, etc. (Little glass figurines and
porcelain statuettes and the like.)

BONNIE finishes admiring herself.  She walks from the mirror
and moves slowly across the room, the camera moving with
her, until she reaches the screened window on the opposite
wall.  The shade is up.  There are no curtains.  She looks
out the window, looking down, and the camera looks down with
her.

EXT. BEDROOM.  BONNIE'S P.O.V.  DAY.

Over her shoulder, we see the driveway leading to the garage
connected to the house.  There is an old car parked in the
driveway, its windows open.  We see a man walking up the
driveway, somewhat furtively.  He is a rather dapper fellow,
dressed in a dark suit with a vest, a white collar, and a
straw boater.  It is CLYDE BARROW.  Obviously, he is about
to steal the car.  He looks it over, checking around him to
make sure no passers-by are coming.  He peers inside the
front window to see if the keys are in the ignition.  He
studies the dashboard.  BONNIE continues watching, silently.
Finally she calls out.

                                                            2.


                         BONNIE
            Hey, boy!  What you doin' with my
            mama's car?

EXT. DRIVEWAY.  DAY.

CLYDE, startled, jumps and looks to see who has caught him.
Obviously frightened, he looks up and his face freezes at
what he sees.

EXT. WINDOW.  CLYDE'S P.O.V.  DAY.

We now see what he is looking at: at the open window,
revealed from the waist up, is the naked BONNIE.  She looks
down, an impudent half-smile on her face.  She doesn't move
or make any attempt to cover herself.

EXT. CLOSE-UP OF CLYDE - DAY -

-- whose face changes from astonishment to an answering
smile of impudence.  (Seeing what he has, he realizes that
this girl is clearly not going to scream for the police.
Already they are in a little game instigated by BONNIE,
sizing each other up, competing in a kind of playful
arrogance.  Before they speak, they have become
coconspirators.)

Close-up of BONNIE, still smiling.  Finally she speaks.

                         BONNIE
            Wait there!

INT. BEDROOM.  DAY.

Running from the window, she flings open a closet and grabs
a dress, and shoes.  She slips on the shoes, and flings the
dress on, running out the door as she does.  The camera
tracks with her, moving as fast.  As she runs down the
stairs she buttons up the dress.

EXT. DRIVEWAY.  DAY.

She flies out the door, slamming it behind her, runs off the
porch (all this has been one continuous movement since she
left the window, in great haste) and continues quickly into
the driveway.  Four feet away from CLYDE, she stops on a
dime.  They stand there, looking at each other, smiling the
same challenge.  For a few seconds, no one speaks, then:

                         BONNIE
                   (putting her on)
            Ain't you ashamed?  Tryin' to steal
            an old lady's automobile.

                                                            3.


                         CLYDE
                   (with the same put-on)
            I been thinkin' about buyin' me one.

                         BONNIE
            Bull.  You ain't got money for
            dinner, let alone buy no car.

                         CLYDE
                   (still the battle of
                   wits going on)
            Now I got enough money for cokes,
            and since it don't look like you're
            gonna invite me inside--

                         BONNIE
            You'd steal the dining room table
            if I did.

                         CLYDE
                   (he moves from his spot)
            Come to town with me, then.  How'd
            that be?

                         BONNIE
                   (starting to walk
                   onto the sidewalk)
            Goin' to work anyway.

EXT. STREET.  MOVING SHOT.  DAY.

The camera tracks.  It is a hot Texas afternoon, all white
light and glare.  As they walk the block to town in this
scene, their manner of mutual impudence is still pervading.

                         CLYDE
            Goin' to work, huh?  What do you do?

                         BONNIE
            None of your business.

                         CLYDE
                   (pretending to give
                   it serious thought)
            I bet you're a...movie star!
                   (thinks)
            No...A lady mechanic?...No...A
            maid?--

                         BONNIE
                   (really offended by that)
            What do you think I am?

                                                            4.


                         CLYDE
                   (right on the nose)
            A waitress.

                         BONNIE
                   (slightly startled by
                   his accuracy, anxious
                   to get back now that
                   he is temporarily
                   one-up)
            What line of work are you in?  When
            you're not stealin' cars?

                         CLYDE
                   (mysteriously)
            I tell you, I'm lookin' for suitable
            employment right at the moment.

                         BONNIE
            What did you do before?

                         CLYDE
                   (coolly, knowing its effect)
            I was in State Prison.

                         BONNIE
            State Prison?
                   (she shows her surprise)


                         CLYDE
            Yeah.

                         BONNIE
                   (herself again)
            Guess some little old lady wasn't
            so nice.

                         CLYDE
                   (tough)
            It was armed robbery.

                         BONNIE
                   (sarcastically)
            My, my, the things that turn up in
            the driveway these days.

They reach the corner and turn.  They are on:

EXT. MAIN STREET.  DAY.

--a small-town street of barber shops, cafes, groceries, etc.
At the moment, it is deserted.  They continue walking down
the empty street.  CLYDE looks the place over.  Tracking.

                                                            5.


                         CLYDE
            What do y'all do for a good time
            around here, listen to the grass
            grow?

                         BONNIE
            Guess you had a lot more fun up at
            State Prison, huh?

CLYDE laughs, enjoying her repartee.  They continue walking.
At a hydrant, CLYDE stops.

                         CLYDE
                   (showing off, but seriously)
            See this foot?
                   (pointing at his
                   right foot)
            I chopped two toes off of it.  With
            an axe.

                         BONNIE
                   (shocked)
            What?  Why?

                         CLYDE
            To get off the damn work detail,
            that's why.
                   (stopping)
            Want to see?

                         BONNIE
                   (a lady of some sensitivity)
            No!...
                   (turning a cute)
            I surely don't intend to stand here
            and look at your dirty feet in the
            middle of Main Street.

They continue walking in silence past a few stores, each
planning what next to say.

                         BONNIE
            Boy, did you really do that?

                         CLYDE
            Yeah.

                         BONNIE
            You must be crazy.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

                                                            6.


EXT. GAS STATION.  DAY.

Gas station up the block.  BONNIE and CLYDE are seen leaning
against the soft drink chest, their profiles silhouetted by
the bright sun.  They are drinking cokes.  As they begin to
talk, the camera moves in closer to them.  CLYDE takes off
his hat and rubs the cold coke bottle across his forehead.
BONNIE watches him.

                         BONNIE
            What's it like?

                         CLYDE
            Prison?

                         BONNIE
                   (very interested)
            No, armed robbery.

                         CLYDE
                   (he thinks it a silly question)
            It's...I don't know...it isn't like
            anything.

                         BONNIE
                   (thinking she's heard
                   proof that he's a liar)
            Hah!  I knew you never robbed bo
            place, you faker.

                         CLYDE
                   (challenged)
            Oh, yeah?
                   (studies her, then
                   makes up his mind to
                   show her)


Close-up.  Gun.  Day.  He reaches in his jacket and pulls
out a gun.  The camera moves to a closeup of the gun,
glinting in the sunlight.

EXT. STREET.  DAY.

The camera pulls back to show BONNIE looking at it with
fascination.  The weapon has an immediate effect on her.
She touches it in a manner almost sexual, full of repressed
excitement.

                         BONNIE
                   (goading him on)
            Yeah, well you got one all right, I
            guess...but you wouldn't have the
            gumption to use it.

                                                            7.


                         CLYDE
                   (picking up the
                   challenge, proving himself)
            You just keep your eyes open.

EXT. LITTLE GROCERY STORE ACROSS THE STREET.  DAY.

The camera remains just behind BONNIE's shoulder so that
throughout the following scene we have BONNIE in the picture,
looking at what we look at.

CLYDE goes into the little store.  We remain outside with
BONNIE watching.  For a minute nothing happens.  We can
barely see what is going on in the store.  Then CLYDE comes
out, walking slowly.  In one hand he holds the gun, in the
other a fistful of money.  He gets halfway, to BONNIE and
smiles broadly at her, a smile of charm and personality.
She smiles back.  The moment is intense, as if a spark has
jumped from one to the other.  Their relationship, which
began the minute BONNIE spotted him in the driveway, has now
really begun.  CLYDE has shown his stuff and BONNIE is
"turned on."

Suddenly the old man who runs the grocery store comes
running out into the street, completely dumbfounded.  He
stands there and says nothing, yet his mouth moves in silent
protest.  CLYDE points the gun above him and fires.  It is
the first loud noise in the film thus far and it should be a
shock.  The old man, terrified, runs back into the store as
fast as he can, CLYDE quickly grabs BONNIE's hand.  The
camera swings with them as they turn and begin to run down
the street.  A few yards and the stores disappear entirely.
The landscape turns into that arid, flat and unrelieved
western plain that begins where the town ends.

EXT. STORE.  AT THE EDGE OF TOWN.  DAY.

A car is parked at the back of the store.  As soon as they
reach it, CLYDE motions and BONNIE gets in.  CLYDE runs to
the front, lifts up the hood and crosses the wires to make
it start.  As he stands back, BONNIE calls to him:

                         BONNIE
            Hey, what's your name, anyway?

                         CLYDE
                   (he slams the hood)
            Clyde Barrow.

He runs over to the door, opens it, shoves her over, and
starts up the engine.  The entire sequence is played at an
incredible rapid pace.

                                                            8.


                         BONNIE
                   (loud, to make
                   herself heard over
                   the gunning motor)
            Hi, I'm Bonnie Parker.  Please to
            meet you.

EXT. ROAD.  DAY.

VROOM!  The car zooms off down the road, doing 90.  The fast
country breakdown music starts up on the sound track, going
just as fast as the car.

EXT. CAR.  DAY.

The car, still speeding, further down the road.  We zoom
down and look in the rear window.  CLYDE is driving, we see
from behind.  BONNIE is all over him, biting his ear,
ruffling his hair, running her hands all over him--in short,
making passionate love to him while he drives.  The thrill
of the robbery and the escape has turned her on sexually.

EXT. CAR.  ANOTHER ANGLE.  DAY.

The camera pulls back and above the car.  The car starts to
go crazy in a comical fashion, manifesting to the audience
just what is happening to the driver controlling it.  The
car swerves all over the road.  The car comes to a sudden
halt.  The car starts again.  It swerves this time almost
right off the road before it straightens out.  It jumps and
jerks.  Another car comes down the road the other way and
CLYDE's car swerves so much as to make the other guy drive
right off the road into the dirt.  It is almost Mack Sennett
stuff, but not quite that much.

INT. CAR.  BONNIE AND CLYDE.  DAY.

BONNIE grabs the wheel and turns it sharply.

EXT. CAR.  DAY.

It hairpins off the road onto a shoulder beneath some trees.

INT. CAR.  BONNIE AND CLYDE.  DAY.

--still settling to a stop.  BONNIE and CLYDE appear to be
necking heavily now, punctuated by BONNIE's squeals of
passion as she squirms and hops about like a flea, trying to
get to CLYDE.  The floor gear-shift is keeping their bodies
apart, however.  In exasperation, BONNIE takes the gear
shift and shoves it forward out of their way.  She plunges
onto CLYDE, burying him from view.

                                                            9.


                         BONNIE
                   (kissing, biting)
            ...You ready?...

                         CLYDE
                   (muffled, laughing)
            ...Hey, wait...

                         BONNIE
                   (giggling herself)
            Aren't you ready?  Well, get ready!

BONNIE has obviously touched him.  With savage coquetry she
tears into her clothes and his.

                         BONNIE
                   (muffled)
            C'mon, honey, c'mon, boy...let's
            go...let's...

                         CLYDE
                   (muffled)
            Hey...hey, wait a minute...quit
            that now, cut it out.
                   (sharply)
            I said, cut it out!

He shoves her rudely away, slamming her into the far car
door.  Suddenly it looks as if they've been fighting.  Both
unbuttoned and unglued, they stare silently at one another,
breathing heavily.  CLYDE gets out of the car, clearly
shaken.  Despite the fact that he may have encountered this
situation many times before, it's one that no twenty-one-
year-old boy in 1932 is sophisticated enough to dismiss
easily with bravado.

BONNIE remains seated in the car.  She seems terribly
vulnerable.  She fumbles about for a cigarette, too confused
to figure out what didn't happen.  CLYDE turns back and
reaches through the car window from the driver's side,
lighting it for her.  BONNIE casts CLYDE a fishy stare, then
accepts the light.

                         CLYDE
                   (trying to be casual,
                   even insouciant)
            Look, I don't do that.  It's not
            that I can't--
                   (his voice cracks,
                   the match burns his
                   fingers, and he bangs
                   his head onto roof of
                   car, and he goes
                   right on)
            --it's just that I don't see no
            percentage in it.
                         (MORE)

                                                           10.


                         CLYDE (CONT'D)
            I mean there's nothin' wrong with
            me, I don't like boys.

BONNIE doesn't know what she thinks, and CLYDE is trying to
gauge her reaction--whether she feels rejected or repelled.
In fact, it's both--along with a little latent fascination.

                         BONNIE
                   (finally, spitting
                   out smoke)
            Boy...boy...boy...

                         CLYDE
                   (a little annoyed)
            Boy, what?

                         BONNIE
            Your advertising is dandy.  Folks'd
            just never guess you don't have a
            thing to sell.
                   (a little afraid)
            You better take me home, now.

                         CLYDE
                   (getting back into car)
            Wait!

                         BONNIE
            Don't touch me!

She gets out of car, leaving CLYDE draped across the front
seat, reaching after her.

                         CLYDE
                   (almost shouting)
            If all you want's stud service,
            then get on back to West Dallas and
            stay there the rest of your life!

This stops her.  Now CLYDE pours it on, with an almost
maniacal exuberance that becomes more controlled as he gets
control of BONNIE.

                         CLYDE
            But you're worth more'n that, a lot
            more, and you know it, and that's
            why you come along with me.  You
            could find a lover boy on every
            corner in town and it doesn't make
            a damn to them whether you're
            waiting on tables or picking
            cotton, so long as you cooperate.
            But it does make a damn to me!

                                                           11.


                         BONNIE
                   (turning, intrigued)
            Why?

                         CLYDE
            Why?  Because you're different!
            You're like me and you want
            different things.

BONNIE is hooked now.

                         CLYDE
                   (continuing)
            You and me travelin' together, we
            could cut clean acrost this state,
            and Kansas, too, and maybe dip into
            Oklahoma, and Missouri or whatnot,
            and catch ourselves highpockets and
            a highheeled ol' time.  We can be
            somethin' we could never be alone.
            I'll show you...when we walk into
            the Adolphus Hotel in San Antone',
            you wearin' a silk dress, they'll
            be waitin' on you and believe me,
            sugar, they're gonna know your last
            name.

He stops, having begun to woo her to something more intense
than a casual, physical coupling.

                         BONNIE
            When'd you figure that all out?

                         CLYDE
            First time I saw you.

                         BONNIE
            How come?

                         CLYDE
                   (intensely, with real honesty)
            'Cause you may be the best damn
            girl in Texas.

Close-up.  BONNIE.

                         BONNIE
            Who are you, anyway?

                                            CUT TO:

                                                           12.


INT. ROADSIDE CAFE.  BONNIE AND CLYDE.  DAY.

BONNIE and CLYDE seated in booth, now C.U. CLYDE.  The sound
track bridges the scene: the question that BONNIE has just
asked is now suddenly rebutted by CLYDE, as he points a
finger at her.

                         CLYDE
                   (not answering her,
                   preferring to lead
                   the conversation)
            I'll tell you about you.

He loves doing this and he does it well.  The more he
envisions BONNIE's life, the more instinctively accurate he
becomes.  She grows more and more fascinated, like a child
watching a mind reader.

                         CLYDE
            Lessee...You were born somewheres
            around East Texas...got a big old
            family, right?...You went to
            school, of course, but you didn't
            take to it much 'cause you was a
            lot smarter than everybody else
            anyway.  So you just quit.  Now...
                   (thinking, playing it
                   for all it's worth)
            ...When you were sixteen...no,
            seventeen, there was a guy who
            worked in...uh...

Pull back taking in BONNIE, favoring CLYDE.

                         BONNIE
                   (fascinated)
            Cement plant--

                         CLYDE
            Right.  Cement plant.  And you
            liked him 'cause he thought you was
            just as nice as you could be.  You
            almost married that guy, but
            then...you thought, no, you didn't
            think you would.  So you got your
            job in the cafe...
                   (getting closer to
                   home now, hitting
                   them right in there)
            And every morning you wake up and
            you hate it.  You just hate it.
            And you get down there and you put
            on your white uniform--

                                                           13.


                         BONNIE
                   (enthralled)
            Pink.

                         CLYDE
            And the truck drivers come in to
            eat greasy burgers and they kid you
            and you kid them back, but they're
            stupid and dumb, boys with big
            tattoos all over 'em, and you don't
            like it...And they ask you for
            dates and sometimes you go...but
            you mostly don't, and all they ever
            try is to get into your pants
            whether you want to or not...and
            you go home and sit in your room
            and think, when and how will I ever
            get away from this?...And now you
            know.

BONNIE is half-mesmerized by his talk.  A waitress comes
with their food.  A cheap, gaudy dame, she has spit curls on
each temple in the style of the times.  CLYDE looks at her
and at BONNIE, who also wears spit curls.  As soon as the
waitress leaves:

                         CLYDE
                   (pointing at her hair)
            Change that.  I don't like it.

Without a word of protest, BONNIE immediately reaches in her
bag and takes out a mirror.  She holds it up and with the
other hand, brushes back her spit curls into her hair.  She
never again wears them.  When she has pushed them back she
looks at CLYDE for his approval.  He nods his okay.  She
smiles, puts back her mirror and begins to eat her food.
She's ravenously hungry and eats with total concentration on
her plate.  CLYDE doesn't touch his food, just watches
BONNIE eat for a minute.

                         CLYDE
            God, you're a knockout.

EXT. ROADSIDE CAFE.  DAY FOR DUSK.

CLYDE and BONNIE emerge from the cafe into the early evening.
They move toward the car they have stolen.  Just beyond sits
a newer model car.  BONNIE is surprised to see CLYDE head
toward the newer car.

                         BONNIE
            Hey, that ain't ours.

                                                           14.


                         CLYDE
            Sure it is.

                         BONNIE
            But we came in this one.

                         CLYDE
            Don't mean we have to go home in it.

She walks amazed around the new car and gets in beside him.
He turns the key and they pull away from the cafe.

INT. ABANDONED FARM HOUSE.  A WIDE SHOT OF THE PARLOR LIVING
ROOM.  DAY.

The room is bare.  In the middle BONNIE is waking, having
slept on a couple of car seats covered with an old piece of
tattered blanket.  There are windows behind her.  She looks
about bewildered.

                         BONNIE
            Clyde...

She starts to panic and runs to the window.

                         BONNIE
                   (continuing)
            Clyde...

At another window CLYDE appears.

                         CLYDE
            Hey, lady.

                         BONNIE
                   (chagrined at her fear)
            Where you been keeping yourself?

                         CLYDE
            Slept out by the car.

                         BONNIE
            Oh...These accommodations ain't
            particularly deluxe.

                         CLYDE
            No...If they're after us, I want
            the first shot.  Come on, you got
            some work to do.

BONNIE moves to the door and out of the house.

                                                           15.


EXT. FARM HOUSE.  FRONT YARD.  DAY.

On the door is a sign which reads:

INSERT:

PROPERTY OF MIDLOTHIAN CITIZENS BANK -- TRESPASSERS WILL BE
PROSECUTED.

Wide angle.  Across fence.  Day.  On the dilapidated picket
fence six old bottles have been placed.  As BONNIE joins
CLYDE he turns and fires six quick shots.  The bottles
disappear.

                         BONNIE
            You're good.

                         CLYDE
            The best.

                         BONNIE
            And modest...

                         CLYDE
            Come on.  Got you all set up over
            here.

Wider angle.  They move around to the side of the building
where CLYDE points to a tire hanging by a rope from a tree.
He means that to be BONNIE's target.  He hands her a gun.

                         CLYDE
            Set her spinnin'.

BONNIE fires.  She misses.

                         CLYDE
            Again.  Come down slow with it...

BONNIE fires again and hits the tire.  She smiles and blows
the smoke from the barrel in pride and self-mockery.

                         CLYDE
            Ain't you something?  I tell you
            I'm going to get you a Smith and
            Wesson, it'll be easier in your
            hand.  Now try it again once...

BONNIE sights.  As she is about to fire, a man appears
around the corner of the building.  A FARMER.  She fires and
hits the tire.

                         FARMER
            Heighdo.

                                                           16.


CLYDE whirls at the sound.  He grabs gun from BONNIE because
his is empty.  He aims at FARMER.

                         FARMER
                   (frightened)
            No sir...no sir.  You all go right
            ahead.

CLYDE watches him warily.

                         FARMER
                   (continuing)
            Used to be my place.  Not any more.
            Bank took it.

CLYDE and BONNIE start to move toward the farmer.  All three
move around to the front of the building.  At a distance we
see an Okie car loaded with belongings.  A WOMAN with a BABY
in arms sits in front.  A smaller BOY stands outside the car.

                         FARMER
            Yessir, moved us off.  Now it
            belongs to them.
                   (He points at the
                   foreclosure sign.)


                         BONNIE
            Well, that's a pitiful shame.

CLYDE shakes his head sympathetically.  He loads the empty
gun.

                         FARMER
                   (bitterly)
            You're damned right, ma'm.

He looks up to see an OLD NEGRO who has come from a distance
shack and now stands near CLYDE's car.

                         FARMER
                   (nodding toward Negro)
            Me and him put in the years here.
            Yessir.  So you all go right ahead.
            We just come by for a last look.

He stands a moment looking at the house and then turns
around toward his family in the car.  CLYDE and BONNIE look
after him.  CLYDE spins and fires three fast shots into the
fore-closure sign.  The FARMER stops and turns, looking at
CLYDE.  CLYDE offers the gun to the farmer.  He looks at it,
then accepts it.  He slowly takes aim at the sign and fires.
It pleases him.  He looks at CLYDE and BONNIE who smile.

                                                           17.


                         FARMER
            You all mind?

BONNIE and CLYDE are puzzled.

                         FARMER
            Hey, Davis!  Come on over here.

The NEGRO moves toward them.  Now BONNIE understands.  She
takes the second gun from CLYDE and hands it to DAVIS.
DAVIS looks from BONNIE to the FARMER and toward the house.
The FARMER fires again.  This time at a window.  He nods to
DAVIS.  DAVIS slowly raises the gun and fires at another
window.  It shatters and they can't keep from laughing.  The
FARMER returns the gun as does DAVIS.

                         FARMER
                   (continuing)
            Much obliged.

He extends his hand.  CLYDE shakes it.

                         FARMER
            Otis Harrison.  And this here's
            Davis.  We worked this place.

                         CLYDE
                   (formally)
            Miss Bonnie Parker.  And I'm Clyde
            Barrow.

Across farmer's car.  Wide shot.  Day.  The FARMER turns and
moves toward his people.  DAVIS moves toward his shack.
CLYDE and BONNIE in the b.g.

Close angle.  BONNIE and CLYDE.

                         CLYDE
                   (continuing)
            We rob banks.

BONNIE turns quickly to look at CLYDE.  He smiles and nods.

                                            FADE OUT.

FADE IN.

EXT. A LONG, COUNTRY ROAD.  DAY.

A car is driving down it.  It is the next day.  BONNIE is
driving, CLYDE beside her.

                                                           18.


INT. CAR.  DAY.

                         CLYDE
            You just stay in the car and watch
            and be ready.
                   (he is playing it
                   cool, knowing she is
                   scared.  He thinks
                   he's James Cagney)
            Okay now?
                   (he hands her a gun
                   from the glove compartment)
            You just be ready if I need you.

BONNIE's hands are tense on the wheel.  Her face shows how
nervous she is now that the time has come.

                         CLYDE
            Scared?

                         BONNIE
            No.

They drive in silence.

                         CLYDE
            What are you thinkin' about?

                         BONNIE
            Nothin'.

EXT. BUSINESS STREET OF A LITTLE TOWN.  DAY.

We are still in the car.  BONNIE pulls over and stops by the
bank.  CLYDE is frozen in his seat.  We can see that, for
all his talk, he is scared, too.

                         BONNIE
            What are you waitin' for?

That gets him.  CLYDE throws the door open and jumps,
practically dives out the door.  The camera follows his
motion right inside the bank, tracking very fast.

INT. BANK #1.  DAY.

Something is very screwy here.  The bank is dark, the TELLER
is half asleep over his books.  CLYDE approaches, thrusts
the gun at him.

                                                           19.


                         CLYDE
                   (with a swagger)
            This is a stickup.  Just take it
            easy and nothin' will happen to you.
            Gimme the money.

                         TELLER
                   (looking up with no
                   fear, his voice calm
                   and conversational)
            Heighdy.

                         CLYDE
                   (nonplussed at this)
            Gimme the money!

                         TELLER
            What money?  There ain't no money
            here, mister.

                         CLYDE
                   (totally befuddled at
                   the turn of events)
            What do you mean there ain't no
            money?  This here is a bank, ain't
            it?

The camera pans around the bank.  We see that it is empty,
dusty and shuttered.

                         TELLER
            This was a bank.  We failed three
            weeks ago.

                         CLYDE
                   (furious)
            What?  What??

In a rage, he goes behind the partition, grabs the teller
and pushes him ahead with the gun.  CLYDE is fuming.  He
forces the teller out the front door.

EXT. BANK #1.  DAY.

--showing BONNIE in the car.  She is terrified as she sees
CLYDE and the TELLER coming at her.  She doesn't understand
what is happening.

                         CLYDE
                   (shoving the teller forward)
            Tell her!  Tell her!

                                                           20.


                         TELLER
                   (acting like a man
                   who has had his sleep
                   interrupted by lunatics)
            As I was tellin' this gentleman,
            our bank failed last month and
            ain't no money in it.  I sure am
            sorry.

BONNIE's reaction is one of hysterical relief and
appreciation of what's funny in the situation.  She laughs
uproariously, she can't stop laughing.  This makes CLYDE
madder than ever.  He shoves the teller to the ground.

INT. CAR.  DAY.

Completely humiliated, CLYDE gets in the car, shoving BONNIE
over.  She is still laughing.  BONNIE starts the car.  CLYDE
points his gun out the window.

Close shot.  Bank window--whereon is lettered: ASSETS-$70,000.

INT. CAR.  CLYDE AND BONNIE.  DAY.

Angle to include bank window.  CLYDE aims and puts a bullet
through each of the zeros.  We see each zero shot through.
Then the entire window hangs there for a second and suddenly
crashes.  On the soundtrack, BONNIE's laughter.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. CAR.  DAY.

--still driving.  BONNIE has still not fully recovered from
her mirth, but is quieting down because she sees that CLYDE
is really mad and can't be pushed too far.

                         CLYDE
                   (steaming)
            We got $1.98 and you're laughin'.

She tries to stop.

EXT. STREET.  DAY.

The car pulls down another street of shops in another little
hick town.  A grocery store ahead.

INT. CAR.

                         CLYDE
            Keep it running.

                                                           21.


INT. GROCERY STORE.  DAY.

There is an old CLERK behind the counter, and standing in
the b.g., almost out of our vision, is a BUTCHER--an enormous
giant of a man.  CLYDE steps up to the counter.

                         CLYDE
            Give me a loaf of bread, a dozen
            eggs and a quart of milk.

The CLERK gets the order and puts it in a bag.  He rings
open the cash register preparatory to asking CLYDE for the
money.  CLYDE pulls his gun.

                         CLYDE
            This is a stickup.  I'll take all
            the money in that drawer now.

He reaches over the counter into the cash drawer and grabs
the bills.  He smiles.  Suddenly looming beside CLYDE is the
BUTCHER, brandishing a meat cleaver.  Camera looks up at
this formidable sight as the cleaver comes crashing down,
missing CLYDE and sticking in the wooden counter.  He grabs
CLYDE around the chest in a bear hug and actually lifts him
off the ground.  The struggle is in silence.  CLYDE is
terrified, fighting wildly to get free.  The gun in CLYDE's
hand is pinned, because the man has CLYDE's arm pinned to
his thigh.  CLYDE tries to raise the barrel at an upward
angle to shoot, finally he is able to do so.  He fires.  The
bullet enters the BUTCHER's stomach.  The BUTCHER screams,
but reacts like a wounded animal, more furious than ever.
He still holds CLYDE in a fierce hug, staggering around the
store, knocking into shelves and spilling cans.  CLYDE is
hysterical with fear.  He shoots the BUTCHER again.  The
BUTCHER falls to his knees, but still he doesn't release
CLYDE.  In a panic, CLYDE drags the man to the door, trying
to get out.

EXT. GROCERY STORE.  DAY.

BONNIE sees CLYDE and the BUTCHER holding his legs.  She is
terrified.  CLYDE drags him out on the street.  The BUTCHER
won't let go.  CLYDE, in real panic, aims the gun at his
head and fires.  Click.  Out of bullets.  In blind fury, he
pistol-whips the BUTCHER's head with two terrific swipes.
Finally the BUTCHER lets go.  Hysterical, CLYDE jumps away
and leaps into the car on the other side.  BONNIE still at
the wheel.

                         CLYDE
            Get the hell out of here!

They drive-off at top speed.

                                                           22.


INT. CAR.  DAY.

CLYDE is shaken.  He speaks haltingly, panting; trying to
get control of himself.

                         CLYDE
            Damn him, that big son of a bitch...
            He tried to kill me... I ain't got
            eyes in back of my head... I didn't
            want to hurt him.  It wasn't a real
            robbery... Some food and a little
            bit of dough.  I'm not against him.
            Damn!

EXT. SPEEDING CAR.  DAY.

The car is speeding down an open road.  Suddenly it begins
to buck and cough.  There is something wrong with the motor.

CLOSE SHOT.  C.W. MOSS.  EXT. FILLING STATION.

His cherubic cheeks are puffed up as he blows into the fuel
lines of CLYDE's car.  There is a distinctly flat sound.

Reaction: CLYDE and BONNIE.  CLYDE stands by the hood.
BONNIE remains seated in the car.  CLYDE is covered with
sweat and grease--clearly he has gotten in his licks on the
engine without success.  Neither he nor BONNIE seems
impressed by the noise C.W. is making.

Another angle.  C.W.--as he screws back the fuel line and
moves between BONNIE and CLYDE to the ignition, turning the
engine over.  It purrs beautifully.  CLYDE is astonished.

                         CLYDE
            What was wrong, anyway?

                         C.W.
                   (moving back to screw
                   on gas cap)
            Air bubble--clogged the fuel line.

C.W. now stands between BONNIE and CLYDE.

                         C.W.
                   (continuing)
            I just blowed her away.

CLYDE still can't get over it.

                         CLYDE
            You just blowed it away.

C.W. belches.  He is embarrassed before BONNIE.

                                                           23.


                         C.W.
            'Scuse me, ma'm... Anythin' else I
            can do for you?

CLYDE nods vigorously, looking across C.W.'s back to BONNIE.
BONNIE gets the message.

                         BONNIE
            Well...I'm not sure...
                   (she looks around)
            Say, them little red things there
            stickin' up?  Are they gas pumps?

                         C.W.
                   (he's not too bright)
            Sure.

                         BONNIE
            Isn't that interesting?  How does
            that there gasoline get in my
            little old car?

                         C.W.
                   (trying to be helpful)
            Well, y'see, there's this tank
            underground, and the gas comes up
            this tube into the pump and into
            your car, M'am.

                         BONNIE
            My, you're a smart fellow.  You
            sure know a lot about automobiles,
            don't you?

                         C.W.
                   (he has no idea he's
                   being toyed with)
            Yeah, I do.

                         BONNIE
            Well, would you know what kind of a
            car this is?

                         C.W.
                   (touching it)
            Yeah, it's a Chevrolet 8-cylinder
            coupe.

                         BONNIE
            No, no.

                         C.W.
            Sure it is.

                                                           24.


                         BONNIE
            No, this is a stolen Chevrolet 8-
            cylinder coupe.

C.W. jerks his hand off it as if he touched a hot stove.

                         CLYDE
                   (getting in the conversation)
            You ain't scared, are you?
                   (to Bonnie)
            I believe he is.  What a pity.  We
            sure coulda used a smart boy who
            knows such a great deal about
            automobiles.
                   (suddenly business-
                   like, to C.W.)
            You a good driver, boy?

                         C.W.
                   (getting quite confused)
            I guess so.

                         CLYDE
                   (pretending to cool
                   on him)
            No, I don't think so.  He's better
            off here...

                         BONNIE
            What's your name, boy?

                         C.W.
            C.W. Moss.

                         BONNIE
            What's the C.W. for?

                         C.W.
                   (reluctantly)
            Clarence Wallace.

                         BONNIE
            I'm Miss Bonnie Parker and this is
            Mr. Clyde Barrow.   We... rob...
            banks.
                   (C.W. reacts with
                   wide eyes)


                         CLYDE
                   (swiftly, testing his mettle)
            Ain't nothing wrong with that, is
            there, boy?

                                                           25.


                         C.W.
                   (nervously)
            Uh, nope--

                         BONNIE
                   (with a put-on sigh)
            No, he ain't the one.

                         CLYDE
            Unless, Boy, you think you got
            enough guts for our line of work?

                         C.W.
                   (affronted in his
                   dumb way)
            What do you mean?  I served a year
            in the reform school.

                         BONNIE
            Oh, a man with a record!

                         CLYDE
                   (laughs)
            Now look here, I know you got the
            nerve to short-change old ladies
            who come in for gas, but what I'm
            askin' you is have you got what it
            takes to pull bank jobs with us?

                         BONNIE
            Mr. C.W. Moss?

                         C.W.
                   (anxious to prove himself)
            Sure, I could.  Sure I could.  I
            ain't scared, if that's what you
            think.

                         CLYDE
            Prove it.

C.W. walks away from the car.  Camera remains where it was.
We see him walk inside the gas station office, open the cash
drawer, close it and come out.  He emerges with a fistful of
money.  He walks over to BONNIE's window, sticks his hand
inside and drops the money on her lap.  We see the bills
flutter down.  Not a word is spoken.  BONNIE moves over into
the middle.  C.W. opens the door and gets in behind the
wheel.  For a moment we see them all sitting there, each
smiling their little smile.  CLYDE starts to hum a hillbilly
tune quietly.  The sound track picks it up (banjo and
violin, etc.) and as the music swells, they drive off down
the road.

                                                           26.


INT. HOSPITAL ROOM.  DAY.

A small room with a bed.  On it, covered by a sheet which
humps like a mountain over his enormous stomach, is the
BUTCHER.  His head is propped up on a pillow and he sips a
liquid through a bent glass straw.  Camera is on the left
side of the head of the bed, seeing the BUTCHER in a three-
quarter profile.  On the opposite side of the bed stands a
uniformed patrolman who is in the act of flashing mug-shot
photos for the BUTCHER to identify his assailant.  The
lawman holds a stack of them in front of them, swiftly
changing the cards like a grade-school teacher with her
flash cards.  At each picture, the BUTCHER grunts negatively
and goes on sipping from his glass straw.  One picture, two,
three go by.  The fourth picture is a mug shot of CLYDE.
Again the BUTCHER grunts 'no,' without hesitation.  As the
next picture comes into view, we

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. MOTEL.  NIGHT.

--on a painted wooden sign, lit by one attached light, which
reads: "MOTOR COURT".

INT. ROOM IN MOTOR COURT.  NIGHT.

--in darkness.  Camera is close on BONNIE.  She is awake and
restless.  O.S. comes the measured snoring that we will
think comes from CLYDE.  BONNIE raises up and kneels over
Clyde.  She needs him.  Clyde seems to snore on.  Camera
drops between them and we see that the snoring actually
comes from C.W.  BONNIE drops back on her pillow.  We cut
close on CLYDE.  He is awake.

INT. CAFE.  DAY.

BONNIE, CLYDE and C.W. seated in a booth in a cafe.  The
Waitress brings the food and serves everybody.  We see C.W.
With great concentration, as he does everything by relating
to the immediate action he happens to be involved with, he
takes the sugar shaker and begins methodically sprinkling
sugar over all his food.  He sugars the meat, the beans, and
the beets.  BONNIE and CLYDE watch this performance with
first, amazement and second, disgust.  They can't believe
what they see.

                         BONNIE
                   (incredulously)
            C.W., what are you doing?  Why do
            you do that?

                                                           27.


                         C.W.
                   (beginning to eat it)
            Why not?

                         BONNIE
            It's just disgusting, that's why.

                         C.W.
                   (chewing)
            Not to me it ain't.

                         BONNIE
            But...but it makes everything sweet!

                         C.W.
            Yeah, I know.

With a resigned expression, BONNIE turns away and begins to
eat.  Suddenly a look of consternation crosses C.W.'s face.

                         C.W.
            Damn!  No mayonnaise!

He gets up and goes down to the counter on the other end of
the restaurant, out of our vision, apparently planning to
put mayonnaise over the sugar.  The minute he is out of
earshot, BONNIE gets CLYDE's attention.

                         BONNIE
            Clyde, why does he have to stay in
            the same room as us?

CLYDE seems not to have heard the question.  He takes up the
sugar shaker and spreads a thin field of sugar on the dark
table surface.  He will sketch his plan in the sugar.

                         CLYDE
            Lemme show you about tomorrow.

                         BONNIE
            Why?

                         CLYDE
            Now C.W.'ll be waitin' right
            outside in the car.  Here is the
            teller's cage.  Four of them and
            over here the desks and what have
            you...

                         BONNIE
            Why, Clyde...

                         CLYDE
            Hmmm??

                                                           28.


                         BONNIE
            In the same room with us?

                         CLYDE
            Hell, where else?  Ain't gonna
            spread out all over the state...

The harshness of his tone concerns him and he recovers with
a smile.

                         CLYDE
                   (continuing)
            Not yet, anyway.  Now, the door to
            the bank is here now.  You cover me
            from there.

                         BONNIE
                   (takes his hand to
                   her face)
            Just that I love you so much.

                         CLYDE
            You're the best damn girl in Texas.

C.W. comes back with the mayonnaise; looks at the table.

                         C.W.
            Hey, you spilled the sugar.

Three shot.

                         CLYDE
                   (eating)
            The layout for tomorrow up in
            Mineola.

                         C.W.
            Mineola?  Gosh, that's four, five
            hundred miles from here!

                         CLYDE
            So what?  We take U.S. 85 to Willis
            Point, don't you know, and cut over
            on State Highway 28 at Kaufman,
            keep on goin' till we hit the farm-
            to-market road that connects to 105
            and that's right up by Mineola.  On
            a Saturday afternoon...

EXT. SMALL KANSAS TOWN.

The car driving into a small Kansas town.  It is Saturday
afternoon, sunny.  The streets are filled with people, cars,
wagons.  C.W.

                                                           29.


is driving, BONNIE is in front with him, CLYDE is in the
back.  C.W. looks scared to death at the idea of robbing a
bank.  The car pulls up in front of the bank, double-parked.
BONNIE and CLYDE get out.

EXT. CAR.  DAY.

                         CLYDE
            Keep it running.

BONNIE and CLYDE enter bank.

INT. BANK #2.  DAY.

Cut to the interior of the bank.  BONNIE and CLYDE come in,
assume the class positions--she at the door where she can
cover the bank, CLYDE at the first teller's cage.

                         CLYDE
                   (in a very quiet voice)
            This is a stickup.

                         TELLER
            What?

                         CLYDE
            This is a stickup.

This time everyone in the bank hears it.  The people gasp
and pull back.  CLYDE slowly edges toward the door and prods
BONNIE forward.  She carries a paper sack.  CLYDE motions
her to go from cage to cage and get all of the money.
BONNIE begins doing so, while CLYDE keeps his gun trained on
everybody.  We see BONNIE get the money from the first
teller, the second teller, then...

EXT. SMALL TOWN STREET.  DAY.

A car parked in a tight spot has just pulled out.

Close-up C.W.  Day--who suddenly looks delighted to see a
parking space.

EXT. CAR - STREET.  DAY.

Immediately he methodically begins to back in.  It's a tight
spot and he has to cut the wheel, pull forward, cut some
more, pull back and so on.  The scene, for the audience,
should be nervous and funny.

                                            CUT TO:

                                                           30.


INT. BANK #2.  DAY.

Inside the bank, BONNIE and CLYDE have filled the sack.
They run out the door, the camera tracks with them.

EXT. SMALL TOWN STREET.  DAY.

They run for where the car was, but it isn't there.  Then
they see C.W. has parked it.

INT. CAR.  DAY.

                         CLYDE
            Let's go!  Let's go!

C.W. suddenly realizes what a stupid thing he's done.

EXT. CAR.  STREET.  DAY.

C.W. tries to shoot out of the parking spot, but he can't.
He has to go through the business of backing up, cutting the
wheel and all of it.  The scene is one of pure pandemonium
and chaos.

INT. CAR.

                         CLYDE
            Come on!  Get it out!

EXT. CAR.  DAY.

A policeman arrives and begins firing at car.  C.W. gets the
car halfway out of the spot, scraping fenders in the process,
and the car is almost out when suddenly a face looms up at
the window--a dignified, white-haired, celluloid-collared
man, obviously a bank official who has leaped onto the
running board.  His screaming can barely by distinguished
from all the noise.

                         MAN
            Stop!

CLYDE fires through the window.

Close-up (special effects).  The face of the man explodes in
blood.  Then he drops out of sight.

EXT. CAR.  DAY.

The car shoots off down the road, doing ninety.  Police are
firing at the escaping car; BONNIE and CLYDE are shooting
out the back window; C.W. is almost having a nervous
breakdown at the wheel.

                                                           31.


EXT. STREET.  A MOVIE HOUSE.  DAY.

A police car that had been chasing CLYDE and BONNIE's car
comes down the street.  It is obvious that the cops have
lost them.  They are searching the street for a sign of
CLYDE's car.  They pass a movie house whose marquee reads:
"GOLDDIGGERS OF 1933."  They slow for a moment, decide that
is not a probable place to look.  They drive off.

INT. MOVIE HOUSE.  WIDE ACROSS AUDIENCE AT SCREEN.

The opening musical sequence of "Golddiggers" is on the
screen.  Ginger Rogers sings "We're In The Money."  Among
the audience we cannot make out our three people.  It is a
small audience and thinly dispersed.

Tight shot at audience.  Camera pans the audience while on
the track we hear the music of the song.  First of our group
who becomes visible is C.W.  He is staring at the screen and
eating bites from a candy bar in each hand.  Camera pans
further and we see that CLYDE is in the row behind C.W. and
a few seats to one side.  CLYDE is nervous and keeps watching
the entrance doors.  He is in a rage.  He shifts in his seat.

                         CLYDE
            Boy, you gotta be poor in the head.
            You...!  Count of you I killed a
            man.  Murder...you too.

Shot from behind CLYDE.  Shooting toward screen.

                         CLYDE
                   (continuing)
            Dumb ass stupid.

C.W. turns to CLYDE and nods agreement.  This infuriates
CLYDE even more.  He slaps the back of C.W.'s head.

                         CLYDE
            Ever do a dumb thing like that
            again, I'll kill you boy!

Angle at BONNIE.  She has been watching the movie; is now
disturbed by the noise.  She turns back to CLYDE from her
seat on the aisle.

                         BONNIE
            Ssshh!  If you boys want to talk
            why don't you go outside?

She smiles at her joke and turns back to the screen to the
movie which she is obviously enjoying enormously.

                                                           32.


INT. CHEAP MOTEL BATHROOM.  CLOSE-UP BONNIE.  DAY.

On the right of the screen, f.g., BONNIE stands at the sink
fixing her make-up in the mirror.  The make-up has become
more conservative.  On the left, further back, is a bathtub
and in it sits C.W.  His head and knees peek over the gray,
soapy water.  He is engaged with his usual single-minded
concentration, in washing himself, carefully scrubbing his
arms, not a thought in his head.  BONNIE finishes her make-
up and regards herself quizzically, tilting her head to look
at herself at different angles.  She is smoking a cigarette,
and really, studying herself.

                         BONNIE
            What do you think of me, C.W.?

                         C.W.
            Uh...well, you're just fine, I
            guess.  Uh, well, course you're a
            real good shot...and...uh...well,
            sometimes you look pretty as a
            painting.

Camera stays with BONNIE during all this, watching her look
at herself as she listens to C.W.'s evaluation.  She has a
narcissistic concern at the moment and as she hears him
enumerate her values, she thinks about each in turn and
decides yes, that's true.

                         C.W.
            Hey, uh, Bonnie...could you get me
            that washrag there?

Responding automatically, BONNIE turns and walks to a towel
rack, pulls the washcloth off and starts toward C.W. when
suddenly she stops with a smile on her face and a sudden
motion.  Teasingly, she holds the washcloth out at arm's
length.

                         BONNIE
                   (coyly)
            Why'nt you come get it?

                         C.W.
                   (not even realizing
                   what's on her mind)
            Huh?

                         BONNIE
                   (wiggling the
                   washcloth like a
                   bull-fighter's cape)
            Whyn't you come get it, C.W.?

                                                           33.


Suddenly C.W. looks mortally embarrassed as he realizes what
that would entail.

                         C.W.
            Aw, Bonnie, come on, gimme it.

BONNIE tries another tack.  She begins sauntering over
slowly, teasingly, still holding out the treasured washcloth.

                         BONNIE
                   (pertly)
            All right, I'll bring it myself.

As she moves closer to the tub, C.W. realizes that she will
be able to peer down into the tub and see him and he
frantically reaches up with one hand and yanks the washcloth
into the tub, causing a great splash.  BONNIE, somewhat the
victim of the splash, jumps back and away.  Recovering her
composure, she looks at C.W. who is slunk down in the tub
like a gross September Morn.  She has tried him and he has
failed; she realizes now that he was no choice for her; no
real man, even if he might perform sexually.  He is a lump.
This irritates her; his very presence is demeaning to
herself and CLYDE.

                         BONNIE
                   (irritated with
                   herself for even
                   thinking of such a thing)
            You simpleton, what would you do if
            we just pulled out some night while
            you was asleep?

                         C.W.
                   (trying to give the
                   right answer, but
                   obviously faking it)
            Oh, I wouldn't know what to do.
            But you wouldn't do that.  You
            couldn't now.

BONNIE realizes, with some weariness, the inevitable truth
of what he's said; thus resigned, she says patronizingly:

                         BONNIE
            That's right, C.W.  We'll always be
            around to take care of you.

Pointedly, she throws her cigarette in his bath-water,
"Sssssssssss."  She turns and leaves the bathroom, slamming
the door behind her.

                                                           34.


INT. BEDROOM.

Camera goes with her into the connecting bedroom.  CLYDE is
sitting on the edge of the bed cleaning the guns and oiling
them.  He is quiet and preoccupied and takes no note of
BONNIE's present condition.  The moment she enters, he looks
up.

                         CLYDE
                   (quietly)
            Bonnie, I want to talk to you.  Sit
            down.

BONNIE sits, a little taken off balance by his serious
manner.  But she listens quietly.

                         CLYDE
                   (continuing)
            This afternoon we killed a man and
            we were seen.  Now nobody knows who
            you are yet, but they're going to
            be after me and anybody who's
            runnin' with me.  Now that's murder
            now and it's gonna get rough.
                   (BONNIE nods.  CLYDE
                   continues speaking
                   carefully and gently.)
            Look, I can't get out, but right
            now you still can.  You say the
            word and I'll put you on the bus to
            go back to your Mother.  'Cause you
            mean a lot to me, honey, and I
            ain't going to make you run with me.
            So if you want, you say the word.

BONNIE, moved by his offer, has tears in her eyes.

                         CLYDE
                   (as he pauses)
            Why?  We ain't gonna have a minute's
            peace.

BONNIE doesn't like him in this mood.  She tries to josh him
out of it.

                         BONNIE
            Oh, pshaw.

                         CLYDE
                   (trying to make her
                   see the seriousness
                   of it)
            Bonnie, we could get killed.

                                                           35.


                         BONNIE
                   (death has no reality
                   for her)
            Who'd wanna kill a sweet young
            thing like me?

                         CLYDE
                   (amused in spite of himself)
            I ain't no sweet young thing.

                         BONNIE
            Oh, Clyde, I can't picture you with
            a halo, and if you went to the
            other place you'd rob the Devil
            blind, so he'd kick you right back
            to me.

Close-up.  CLYDE--touched deeply, realizes that this was a
lovely thing to say to him.

INT. MOTEL BEDROOM.

They kiss.  They are near the bed on which are some guns
that CLYDE has been cleaning.  The kiss moves toward real
love making.  They are on the bed and push the guns aside.
Some fall to the floor.  CLYDE breaks the embrace after it
has reached a high pitch.  He moves away from the bed toward
the window.  BONNIE follows him and embraces him from the
rear.  They are miserable.  BONNIE frees him and returns to
the bed.  She falls on it face down.  A gun presses into her
face.  CLYDE sits in the window, the light silhouettes him.
He turns his face toward the glass and rests his head on the
window pane.  BONNIE turns to him from bed.  She smiles a
comforting smile at him.  She rolls over onto her back.  The
gun is now under her head and moves it.  She sits up and
gestures to CLYDE.  He remains at the window.  She stares at
him.  She looks toward the bathroom.  She looks back at
CLYDE.  She is moved and pained for him.  She touches her
cheek with the gun and waits for him to be able to look at
her.  Finally he does.  Her look eases him and he almost
smiles.

INT. BUCK'S CAR.  DAY.

Shot of little fuzzy doll tied by a white shoestring to the
rear-view mirror of a car.  The car is moving; the doll is
bouncing up and down.  In the front seat are BUCK and
BLANCHE BARROW.  BUCK is a jovial, simple, big-hearted man.
A little chubby, given to raucous jokes, knee-slapping and
broad reactions.  He is, in many ways, the emotional opposite
of his brother.  It doesn't take much to make him happy.
BLANCHE, his wife, is the direct opposite of BONNIE.

                                                           36.


She is a housefrau, no more and no less, not terribly
bright, not very ambitious, cuddly, simpering, madly in love
with BUCK and desirous of keeping their lives on the straight
and narrow.  As the scene begins we hear and then see BUCK,
driving, singing "The Great Speckled Bird."  BLANCHE is
sitting next to him looking at a movie magazine, appearing
fairly miserable.

                         BUCK
                   (singing)
            "What a beautiful thought I am
            thinking
            Concernin' that great speckled
            bird,
            Remember his name is recorded
            on the pages of God's Holy word..."

                         BLANCHE
            All right, now you did foolish
            things as a young man, honey-love,
            but you went and paid your debt to
            society and that was right.  But
            now you just gettin' back in with
            the criminal element.

                         BUCK
            Criminal element!  This is my
            brother, darlin'.  Shoot, he ain't
            no more criminal than you are,
            Blanche.

                         BLANCHE
            Well, that ain't what I heard.

                         BUCK
            Now word of mouth just don't go,
            darlin', you gotta have the facts.
            Shoot.  Why he and me growed up
            together, slept and worked side by
            side.
                   (laughing)
            God, what a boy he was!

                         BLANCHE
            He's a crook.

                         BUCK
                   (chidingly)
            Now you stop bad-mouthin' him,
            Blanche.  We're just gonna have us
            a little family visit for a few
            weeks and then we'll go back to
            Dallas and I'll get me a job
            somewheres.

                         BUCK (CONT'D)
            I just ain't gonna work in your
            Daddy's church--That's final.
                   (laughing it off, singing)
            "What a beautiful thought I am

                                            CUT TO:

EXT. CABIN.  THE FRONT OF THE MOTEL.  DAY.

BUCK's car drives up to the cabin, honking the horn wildly.
The door of the cabin opens and CLYDE comes running out.  He
is overjoyed to see his brother.  BUCK jumps out of the car,
equally delighted.  They hug each other.

                         CLYDE
                   (hugging him)
            Buck!

                         BUCK
            Clyde!  You son of a bitch!

They laugh happily and begin sparring with each other,
faking punches and blocking punches--an old childhood ritual.
There is a great feeling of warmth between the two brothers.
CLYDE is more outgoing than we have ever seen him before.

                         CLYDE
            How's ma?  How's sister?

                         BUCK
            Just fine, just fine.  Send their
            best to you.

                         CLYDE
                   (patting Buck's stomach)
            Hey, you're fillin' out there.
            Must be that prison food.

                         BUCK
            Hell no!
                   (laughing)
            It's married life.  You know what
            they say, it's the face powder that
            gets a man interested, but it's the
            baking powder that keeps him at
            home.

                                                           38.


                         BUCK (CONT'D)
                   (he explodes with
                   laughter and so does
                   Clyde, who loves
                   Buck's jokes)
            Hey! you gotta meet my wife.  Hey,
            honey, c'mon out here now and meet
            my baby brother.

Camera swings to car.  We see BLANCHE still sitting there,
her face obscured by the glint of sun on the windshield.
Slowly, she gets out of the car, still carrying the movie
magazine.

                         BLANCHE
                   (suspiciously, quite
                   the grand lady)
            Howdy-do.

                         CLYDE
                   (shaking her hand)
            Howdy-do.  It's real nice to know
            you.

BUCK beams with pleasure, thinking they must like each other.
BONNIE comes out of the cabin, standing on the steps.  The
screen door slams behind her.

Close-up.  BONNIE.  Day--expressionless, looking it all over.

EXT. CABIN.

BUCK and CLYDE notice nothing of this.  BUCK bounds over to
BONNIE, all jollity.

                         BUCK
                   (grabbing her)
            Well!  You must be Bonnie!  Now I
            hear you been takin' good care of
            the baby in the family.  Well sis,
            I'm real glad to meet you!
                   (he hugs her; BONNIE
                   just lets herself be hugged)
            Say...
                   (breaking the hug)
            I'd like you to meet my wife,
            Blanche.

                         BONNIE
                   (stiffly)
            Hello.

                                                           39.


                         BLANCHE
                   (stiffly)
            Hello.

There is an awkward pause.  Suddenly the screen door opens
and C.W. comes out, dressed in his long underwear.  BLANCHE
can hardly stand it.

                         CLYDE
            Everybody, this is C.W. Moss.
            C.W., my brother Buck and his wife,
            Blanche.

                         C.W.
                   (friendly)
            Heighdy, y'all.

He pumps BUCK's hand vigorously and then goes to BLANCHE.
With his characteristic one-track intensity, he decides to
act just as friendly as he can with BLANCHE, ignoring the
fact that he's standing there in his underwear.  BLANCHE,
however, is not ignoring it.

                         C.W.
            Well how do, Mrs. Barrow.  Or can I
            call you Blanch?  I sure am pleased
            to meet you.
                   (shaking her hand;
                   Blanche is slowly
                   going crazy with mortification)
            Did you have a hard time findin' us
            here in this neck of the woods?
            Well, you sure picked a good day
            for it.  Say, you got a Screenland
            there!  Any new photos of Myrna Loy?
            She's my favorite picture star.

BLANCHE is starting to edge over to BUCK in sheer panic at
this strange, young man in his BVD's but C.W. takes no
notice of it.

BLANCHE finally grabs BUCK's arm.  BONNIE watches it all,
smirking.

                         BUCK
            Hey, lemme get the Kodak!

BUCK goes to his car and gets a folding Brownie camera.

                         CLYDE
                   (lighting up a cigar)
            Hey, C.W., go put your pants on.
            We're gonna take some pictures.

                                                           40.


                         BUCK
            Y'all hear about the guy who
            thought Western Union was a cowboy's
            underwear?

BUCK and CLYDE and C.W. laugh heartily.  C.W. goes into the
cabin.  BUCK pushes BLANCHE and CLYDE together, posing them
for a picture.

                         BONNIE
            Lemme get one of my bride and my
            brother.

                         BLANCHE
                   (getting kittenish,
                   and overdoing it)
            Buck!  Don't take my picture now.
            I'm just a mess from driving all day.

                         BUCK
            Oh honey, now you look real fine.

BONNIE watches BLANCHE's behavior with hardly-veiled disgust.
BUCK snaps the picture as BLANCHE is just about to move out
of it.

                         BLANCHE
                   (with unbecoming
                   girlish outrage)
            Did you take my picture?  Oh Buck!
            I declare--

BUCK laughs and goes to BONNIE, takes her by the arm and
moves her next to CLYDE and BLANCHE.  He lines them up,
steps back and takes their picture.  CLYDE is the only one
smiling.

                         CLYDE
                   (pulling out his gun
                   and posing like a
                   movie tough)
            Hey, Buck, get one of this.

BUCK does.

                         BUCK
                   (giving Clyde the camera)
            Clyde, you do one of me and my
            missus.

He puts his arm around BLANCHE.  CLYDE takes the picture.

                                                           41.


                         CLYDE
                   (throwing her a challenge)
            Let me take on of Bonnie.

BONNIE grins at him and responds with amused arrogance.

                         BONNIE
                   (she yanks the cigar
                   from Clyde's mouth,
                   smokes it and poses)
            Okay.

CLYDE snaps the picture.  Everyone but BLANCHE laughs.  C.W.
comes out dressed.

                         BUCK
                   (drawing Clyde aside)
            Hey, brother, let's you and me do a
            little talkin'.

                         CLYDE
                   (handing C.W. the camera)
            Here, C.W., take the girls' picture.

INT. CABIN.  DAY.

They walk into the cabin.  Camera goes with them.  Bedroom
is dark, shades pulled down.  There is an aura of boys'
clubhouse secret camaraderie in the following scene:

                         BUCK
                   (as soon as the door
                   is shut; conspiratorially)
            It was you or him, wasn't it?

                         CLYDE
            Huh?

                         BUCK
            That guy you killed.  You had to,
            didn't ya?

                         CLYDE
                   (they are protecting
                   each other)
            Yeah, he put me in a spot, so I had
            to.  He didn't have a Chinaman's
            chance.

                         BUCK
            But you had to--

                         CLYDE
            Yeah.  I had to.

                                                           42.


                         BUCK
                   (like two kids
                   keeping a secret from Mom)
            Don't say nothin' to Blanche about
            it.

                         CLYDE
            Hey, that time you broke out of
            jail, she talk you into goin' back?

                         BUCK
                   (it is obvious he had
                   hoped Clyde hadn't
                   known about it)
            Yeah, you hear about that?

                         CLYDE
            I won't say nothin' to Bonnie about
            it.

                         BUCK
            I appreciate it.

                         CLYDE
            Yeah...say, what d'ya think of
            Bonnie?

                         BUCK
            She's a real peach.

There is now a long pause--a lull in the conversation, as if
they asked each other all the questions and are now out of
things to say.  It is too much for BUCK, the natural enemy
of silence, who suddenly claps his hands together and bursts
out animatedly:

                         BUCK
            Boy, are we gonna have us a good
            time!

                         CLYDE
                   (matching his merriment)
            We surely are!

                         BUCK
            Yessir!
                   (a pause, then:)
            What are we gonna do?

                         CLYDE
            Well, how's this--I thought we'd
            all go to Missouri.  They ain't
            lookin' for me there.  We'll hole
            up someplace and have us a regular
            vacation.  All right?

                                                           43.


                         BUCK
            No trouble, now?

                         CLYDE
            No trouble.  I ain't lookin' to go
            back to prison.

                         BUCK
            Hey, what's this I hear about you
            cuttin' up your toes, boy?

                         CLYDE
                   (ironically)
            That ain't but half of it.  I did
            it so I could get off work detail--
            breakin' those damned rocks with a
            hammer day and night.  Sure enough,
            next week I got paroled.  I walked
            out of that god-forsaken jail on
            crutches.

                         BUCK
            Shoot--

                         CLYDE
            Ain't life grand?

EXT. ROAD.  DAY.

We see the two cars, one behind the other, driving down a
main road.

INT. FIRST CAR.  DAY.

CLYDE is driving.  BUCK sits next to him.  No one else is in
the car.

                         BUCK
            And the doc, he takes him aside,
            says, "Son, your old mama just
            gettin' weak and sickly layin'
            there.  I want you to persuade her
            to take a little Brandy, y'know, to
            pick her spirits up." "Why, doc,"
            he says, "you know my mamma is a
            teetotaler.  She wouldn't touch a
            drop." "Well, I tell you what," the
            doc says, "why don't you bring her
            a fresh quart of milk every day
            from your farm, 'cept you fix it up
            so half of it's Brandy and don't
            let on!" So he does that, doctors
            it up with Brandy, and his mamma
            drinks some of it.
                         (MORE)

                                                           44.


                         BUCK (CONT'D)
            And the next day he brings it again
            and she drinks some more--and she
            keeps it up every day.  Finally,
            one week later, he brings her the
            milk and don't you know she just
            shallows it all down, and looks at
            her bag and says, "Son, whatever
            you do, don't sell that cow!"

CLYDE and BUCK explode in laughter.

INT. SECOND CAR.  DAY.

At the top of the laugh, cut to the int. of the second car,
riding right in back of them.  The atmosphere is completely
unlike the cozy and jolly scene preceding.  We have dead
silence.  BONNIE is driving, smoking a cigarette, grim.
BLANCHE--seated as far away as she can get from BONNIE
without falling out of the car--makes a face at the cigarette
smoke, rolls down the window for air.  C.W.'s in the back
seat, just staring.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT. GARAGE APARTMENT.  DAY.

A residential street in Joplin, Missouri, showing a garage
apartment above a double garage.  Camera sees BUCK talking
to a dapper gent with keys in his hand.  BUCK pays him.  The
man tips his hat and walks off.  BUCK gestures and Clyde
drives a car into the driveway.  C.W. follows, driving
BUCK's car with BLANCHE.  CLYDE stops beside BUCK.  BUCK
leans into CLYDE's car and says:

                         BUCK
            I give him a month's rent in
            advance.  We're all set.  Let's get
            inside.

CLYDE calls back to C.W. in the following car.

                         CLYDE
            Pull up and unload the stuff.

                         BUCK
                   (on the running board
                   of moving car)
            Honey-love, I'm taking you into our
            first home.

BLANCHE giggles.  The two cars pull up before the garage and
the people start to descend.

                                                           45.


INT. GARAGE APARTMENT.  DAY.

A winded BUCK enters and puts down BLANCHE.  As others
behind him carry in their things and disperse throughout
apartment.

                         BLANCHE
            Oh look, it's so clean, Buck.  And
            a Frigidaire...not an icebox!

                         BUCK
            He give me the grocery number.

He goes to the phone.

                         BUCK
                   (continuing)
            Lemme see, eh 4337...Operator...
            please ma'm, may I have 4337...if
            you please?

                         BLANCHE
            Oh...they got linoleum on the
            counter.  Ain't that clever!

                         BUCK
            Hello, Smitty's grocery...I'd like
            to order a mess of groceries.  Oh
            yeah...eh 143 Hillsdale Street.
            Lessee, about 8 pounds of porkchops,
            4 pounds of red beans...a can of
            Chase and Sandborn...uh.

                         BLANCHE
            Oh, isn't this something, Daddy!

                         BUCK
            Sshh.  Uh...quart of milk...uh 8
            bottles of Dr. Pepper and that's
            it, I guess.  No...no.  Uh...a box
            of Rice Krispies...Bye now.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. LIVING ROOM.  DAY.

Open on BONNIE and CLYDE.  He is cleaning guns.  She is
watching something off screen.  We hear a clicking sound.

                         BLANCHE (O.S.)
            My, you need a haircut, Daddy.  You
            look like a hillbilly boy.

                                                           46.


A look of disgust crosses BONNIE's face.  CLYDE, who has
been watching her, smiles.  The clicking sound increases
suddenly.

                         BUCK (O.S.)
            Gotcha!

BLANCHE whoops.  Camera cuts to see that BUCK and C.W. are
playing checkers and BUCK has just beaten him.

                         C.W.
            Again.

                         BUCK
            Boy, you ain't never gonna beat me
            but you keep tryin' now.

He starts to set up the game again.

                         BLANCHE
            Jest like an ol' man.  Plays
            checkers all the time and doesn't
            pay any attention to his poor
            lonely wife.

She ruffles his hair again.

                         BUCK
            Cut it out now, honey.  I'm gonna
            teach this boy a lesson he'll never
            forget.

Camera cuts to BONNIE, watching with disgust.  Then slowly,
a wicked little smile edges across her face.  She watches
for a moment more, then she rises and with the most ingenuous
look she can muster up, beckons to CLYDE to follow her into
the bedroom.  A little puzzled, CLYDE follows.

INT. BEDROOM.

BONNIE closes the door and immediately begins fussing with
CLYDE's hair, doing a scathing imitation of BLANCHE.  Though
her miming expresses her irritation at being closeted with
the Barrow menage, it is also a peach doing an imitation of
a lemon--and it is disarmingly sensual... Indeed the mimicry
allows BONNIE to be physically freer with CLYDE, and allows
CLYDE to respond without anxiety, without self-consciousness.
We should have the distinct--if momentary--feeling that
CLYDE could suddenly make it with BONNIE.

                                                           47.


                         BONNIE
                   (doing an unmerciful imitation)
            Oh, Daddy, you shore need a haircut.
            You look just like a little old
            hillbilly boy, I do declare.
                   (she has her other
                   hand toying with the
                   buttons on his shirt,
                   her hand slipping
                   under, fluttering
                   across his bare chest)
            Oh mercy me, oh my stars!

CLYDE laughs, and BONNIE tugs at the shirt--she kneels on
the bed over CLYDE, who quite easily drapes across it.

                         BONNIE
                   (a little louder)
            Oh, Daddy!  Yore such a slowpoke!

She's letting her hair fall loose, its golden ends brushing
up and down CLYDE's body.

                         CLYDE
                   (amused, but cautionary)
            Hush up a little.  They're in the
            next room.

                         BONNIE
                   (a mock-pout, but
                   with an edge to it)
            Shoot, there's always somebody in
            this room, the next room and ever'
            other kind of room.

CLYDE has his arm around BONNIE, and she's almost draped
across him--but in the direction of the length of the bed,
so their bodies almost form a crooked cross.  She digs an
elbow into his stomach.

                         CLYDE
            Oof!...now that ain't no nice way
            to talk about my brother.

                         BONNIE
                   (imitating Blanche
                   again with baby talk)
            I ain't talking about your brother.

Suddenly BONNIE straightens up to a kneeling position again,
and cocks her head.  When she speaks now it is with a simple
plaintiveness.

                                                           48.


                         BONNIE
            Honey, do you ever just want to be
            alone with Me?
                   (sensing Clyde's
                   sensitivity to the
                   sexual implication)
            I don't just mean like that...I
            mean do you ever have the notion of
            us bein' out together and alone,
            like at some fancy ball, or, I
            don't know, where we walk in all
            dressed and they announce us and
            it's fancy and in public, but we're
            alone somehow.  We're separate from
            everybody else, and they know it.

CLYDE looks up to BONNIE, affectionately.  He runs his hand
carelessly down her body.

                         CLYDE
            I always feel like we're separate
            from everybody else.

                         BONNIE
                   (it's terribly
                   important to her)
            Do you, baby?

Suddenly there is a ring at the door.  BONNIE and CLYDE
freeze.

INT. LIVING ROOM.

BONNIE and CLYDE run out into the living room, camera going
with them.

                         BONNIE
                   (to all)
            Quiet!  I'll get it.

BONNIE goes down the stairs and reaches the front door.

                         BONNIE
            Who is it?

                         VOICE
            Groceries, M'am.

EXT. GARAGE APARTMENT.

She opens the door.  A young man is there with the two big
sacks of groceries.

                                                           49.


                         BONNIE
            How much?

                         YOUNG MAN
            Six dollars and forty-three cents.

BONNIE pays him and goes to take the bags from him.

                         YOUNG MAN
            Here, M'am, them bags is heavy.
            Let me carry 'em up for you.

                         BONNIE
                   (curtly)
            No thanks, I'll take 'em.

She takes the heavy bags and hefts them up and turns and
walks up the stairs.  They are obviously very heavy for her.
Closeup the delivery boy's face, looking puzzled at this
behavior.  BONNIE reaches the top steps, and voices are heard.

                         BUCK'S VOICE
            What was it?

                         CLYDE'S VOICE
            Quiet.  Open the door.

                         BONNIE
            C'mon, c'mon...

Close-up.  The DELIVERY BOY.  A look of suspicion comes
across his face.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

INT. GARAGE APARTMENT.

Close-up of BONNIE--seated in the living room.

                         BONNIE
                   (reading from a pad;
                   in a recital voice)
            It's called "The Ballad of Suicide
            Sal."
                   (she pauses for
                   effect; then begins:)
            "We each of us have a good alibi
            For being down here in the 'joint';
            But few of them really are justified
            If you get right down to the point.
            You've heard of a woman's glory
            Being spent on a downright cur'."

                                                           50.


                         BUCK'S VOICE (O.S.)
            You write that all by yourself?

                         BONNIE
            You want to hear this or not?

As she reads, the camera pans around the room picking out
everyone's reaction.  CLYDE is looking and listening
seriously.  BUCK is grinning.  C.W. is blank.  BLANCHE is in
the kitchen cooking.

                         BONNIE
            "Still you can't always judge the
            story
            As true, being told by her.
            Now 'Sal' was a gal of rare beauty,
            Though her features were coarse and
            tough--"

                         BUCK
            Yeah, I knew her.  She was cockeyed
            and had a hare-lip and no teeth!

BONNIE flashes him a look that could kill.  He shuts up fast.
She continues:

                         BONNIE
            "Now 'Sal' was a gal of rare
            beauty,
            Though her features were coarse and
            tough;
            She never once faltered from duty
            To play on the 'up and up'."

Still listening, CLYDE gets up from his chair and walks
slowly past the living room windows.  The camera angled
slightly above him, sees down the street.  We see two police
cars quietly pulling up.  One of them parks sideways in the
driveway to block escape from the garage, the other stays on
the street.  CLYDE turns and looks out the window.

                         BONNIE
                   (o.s. as we see out
                   the window)
            "Sal told me this tale on the
            evening
            Before she was turned out free,
            And I'll do my best to relate it
            Just as she told it to me--"

                         CLYDE
                   (seeing it)
            It's the law.

                                                           51.


As soon as CLYDE calls out, BLANCHE drops the frying pan on
the floor and begins screaming.  Camera cuts back to the
living room.  Everyone else leaps into action.  Guns begin
blazing from everywhere; we rarely see who is shooting at
whom.

EXT. GARAGE APARTMENT.  DAY.

The police, down the stairs into the garage--we follow them
with a hand-held camera tracking rapidly.

EXT. STREET.  DAY.

BLANCHE, however, in utter panic, just runs right out the
front door, and begins running down the quiet residential
street, going nowhere, anywhere.

EXT. GARAGE APARTMENT.  DAY.

BUCK, crouching, shooting with one hand, gets the garage
door open.  A policeman fires.  BUCK fires back and the cop
falls dead in the street.  BUCK, firing, dashes to the
police car blocking their escape and releases the hand brake.
CLYDE, BONNIE and C.W. leap into their car, gun the motor,
still shooting madly.  Two more police fall dead or wounded.
One policeman is hurled through a fence by the blast of a
sawed-off shotgun.  BUCK jumps into the car with the others.
They now begin to bump the police car with their car.  The
police car picks up speed as they push it and it tears into
the street right at the group of firing police.  The gang's
car turns into the street toward the running BLANCHE.
BONNIE and CLYDE are in front; BUCK and C.W. in the back
seat firing back at police.  The car pulls alongside the
wildly running BLANCHE; the back door is flung open and in
almost the style of a cartoon, two hands reach out and lift
her off her feet and pull her into the car.  They speed away.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. CAR.  DAY.

The inside of the car, still speeding.  BLANCHE is hysterical.
C.W. is still firing out the window.  The pursuing police
car's driver is shot and the car crashes into a tree.  The
gang is not being pursued now, but CLYDE is driving at 90.
BLANCHE is moaning and crying.  BONNIE, in front, turns
around furiously.

                         BONNIE
            Dammit, you almost got us killed!

                                                           52.


                         BLANCHE
                   (crying)
            What did I do wrong?  I s'pose
            you'd be happier if I got shot.

                         BONNIE
                   (at her bitchiest)
            Yeah, it would of saved us all a
            lot of trouble.

                         BLANCHE
            Buck, don't let that woman talk to
            me like that!

                         BUCK
                   (caught in the middle
                   of a bad situation,
                   knowing Blanche is
                   wrong, but trying to
                   soothe her)
            You shouldn't have done it, Blanche.
                   (quietly, cont.)
            It was a dumb thing to do.

                         BLANCHE
                   (switching tactics)
            Please, Buck, I didn't marry you to
            see you shot up!  Please, let's go!
            Let's get out of here and leave.
            Make him stop the car and let us out!

                         BUCK
                   (still quietly)
            Can't.  I killed a man.  We're in
            this now.

                         BLANCHE
                   (loud and shrill)
            Please!  Please!

                         BONNIE
                   (exploding)
            Shut up!  Just shut up your big
            mouth!  At least do that, will ya,
            just shut up.

                         CLYDE
            Cut it out, Bonnie.

BONNIE is affronted.  BLANCHE continues sobbing.

                         BONNIE
                   (curtly)
            Stop the car.  I want to talk to you.

                                                           53.


Without a word, CLYDE stops the car.

EXT. ROADSIDE.  DAY.

BONNIE and CLYDE get out and walk fifteen feet away from the
car.  Both are irritated and touchy.  Camera follows them.

                         CLYDE
                   (coldly)
            What is it?

                         BONNIE
            Get rid of her.

                         CLYDE
            Can't do that.  She's Buck's wife.

                         BONNIE
                   (snapping her words)
            Get rid of both of them then.

                         CLYDE
            Why?  What's the matter with you
            anyway?

                         BONNIE
            She's what's the matter with me, a
            damn stupid back country hick
            without a brain in her head.
                   (contemptuously)
            She ain't nothin' but prunes and
            proverbs.

                         CLYDE
                   (really pissed-off at Bonnie)
            What makes you any better?  What
            makes you so damn special?  You're
            just a West Dallas waitress who
            spent half your time pickin' up
            truck drivers!

This hits home with BONNIE.  He has said the unforgivable.

                         BONNIE
                   (raising her voice)
            You talk to me like that!  Big
            Clyde Barrow, just the same as your
            brother, an ignorant uneducated
            hillbilly.
                   (with deadly archness)
            Only special thing about you is
            your peculiar ideas about
            lovemakin'--which is no love makin'
            at all.

                                                           54.


CLYDE stiffens.  The two of them stand silent and tense,
almost quivering with anger.  They have stripped each other
raw.  CLYDE turns and looks back at the car.  Everyone is
waiting, watching them.  He breathes a deep sigh, like a man
counting to 10 to hold his temper.

                         CLYDE
            Look, Bonnie--

He can't finish.

Close.  BONNIE.  She drops her head into her hand for a
moment, comes up a little more relaxed.  She looks at CLYDE
and her eyes reflect the realization of the pain she has
inflicted on him.  She softens.

                         BONNIE
            Clyde...honey...I didn't mean all
            that, honey.  Blame it on all that
            shootin', I just felt so bad...sure
            enough...Clyde?

                         CLYDE
            Okay...Okay, hon...let's get
            movin'...

He turns and begins walking back to the car.  BONNIE walks
alongside him.  On the few steps back, she regains all her
dignity and acts aloof from the others waiting for her.  She
reaches the car.  CLYDE opens her door for her and she gets
in like a great lady.  He walks around to his side, gets in,
and they drive off.

WIDE SHOT.  EXT. CAR.  DAY.

A very wide shot.  We see CLYDE's car driving along a wooded
road.  For a moment that is all we see, then we should
become aware that far in the distance another car is
following CLYDE's.

Close. Rural mail box.  On the opposite side of the road,
CLYDE's car swings across the road and CLYDE, who is driving,
snatches a newspaper which protrudes from the box and hands
it into the car.  They drive out of the shot.  Camera holds
and soon the following car enters the shot.  The man driving
is a Texas ranger.  He drives slowly.  He drives out of the
shot.

INT. CLYDE'S CAR.

BUCK is reading from the paper.

                                                           55.


                         BUCK
                   (jubilantly)
            Hey, y'all, listen to this here:
            Law enforcement officers throughout
            the Southwest are frankly amazed at
            the way in which will-of-the-wisp
            bandit Clyde Barrow and his yellow-
            haired companion, Bonnie Parker,
            continue to elude their would-be
            captors.  Since engaging the police
            in a gun battle on the streets of
            Joplin Missouri and slaying three
            of their number...

                         BLANCHE
            Oh, Lord...

We notice CLYDE is wincing.

                         BUCK
            ...the Barrow gang has been reported
            as far West as White City, New
            Mexico, and as far north as Chicago.
            They have been credited with
            robbing the Mesquite Bank in the
            aforementioned White City, the J.J.
            Landry Oil Refinery in Arp, Texas,
            the Sanger City National Bank in
            Denton, Texas on three different
            occasions.  In addition to these
            robberies, the fast travelling
            Barrows have been rumored to have
            had a hand in the robbing of two
            Piggly Wiggly stores in Texas, and
            one A&P store in Missouri, though
            Chief Percy Hammond, who first
            identified Clyde Barrow's brother,
            Buck, as a member of the gang,
            expressed some doubt that these
            last robberies were committed by
            the Barrow Gang alone.

                         BONNIE
            Go on.

                         C.W.
                   (finally)
            Clyde, we ain't goin' to see a
            restroom for another thirty miles.
            Why don't you just stop here?

CLYDE looks relieved.

                                                           56.


EXT. WOODED AREA.  DAY.

He pulls the car to a stop, gets out and goes off into the
woods.  We watch him vanish behind the trees.

INT. CAR.

BUCK still scanning the newspaper.

                         BUCK
                   (with a laugh)
            Hey now, here's something!  Listen
            here: Lone Cop Arrests Two Officers
            In Hunt For Barrow.  Police Officer
            Howard Anderson's heart turned
            faster than his motorcycle when he
            forced to the side of the road a
            roaring black V-8 sedan in which
            were three men and a blondheaded
            woman yesterday afternoon.

Everybody laughs.  As BUCK continues to read, his voice
remaining on the soundtrack.

EXT. CAR.

The camera goes outside the car and pulls back, way back, to
reveal a police car quietly driving up behind the car.  The
car stops a good distance away and one man gets out, the
only occupant of the car.  He is tall, dressed in the
uniform of the Texas Ranger.  He draws his gun and slowly
approaches the car from the rear.  On the soundtrack BUCK's
voice continues; as we see all this taking place.

                         BUCK
            When he saw several machine guns in
            the car he was certain he'd caught
            Clyde Barrow, Bonnie Parker, and
            maybe Buck Barrow and the third
            unidentified member of the gang.
            It took a lot of telephoning and
            explaining to convince the
            motorcycle cop that his captives
            were two highway patrolmen and a
            blonde-haired stenographer from the
            Highway Patrol--.  Haw!  Haw!
                   (everybody busts up
                   with laughter)


In the meantime, on screen, the lawman is slowly approaching
the back of the car.  Suddenly, cut to shot of CLYDE coming
out of the woods, behind the lawman.  His gun is tucked in
his pants.  In a second, he sees what is happening.

                                                           57.


BUCK's voice is continuing:

                         BUCK
            Anderson was held up as an example
            for every other Texas peace officer
            today. "That was a mighty brave
            thing," explained Highway Patrol
            Chief L.C. Winston.

CLYDE whips out his gun.  The following scene is played
exactly like a classic fast-draw in an heroic Western.

                         CLYDE
            Sheriff!

BRYCE spins around.  Both men fire instanteously, but CLYDE
has the draw on him, and the aim.  The gun goes flying from
the SHERIFF's hand.  A really razzle-dazzle display of
grandstand marksmanship from Clyde.

Immediately the gang leaps from the car and surrounds the
man, guns drawn.

                         C.W.
            Boy!  What a shot, Clyde!

                         BUCK
            Sweet Jesus, I never seen shootin'
            like that!

The gang grabs the man and takes his handcuffs from his belt.
CLYDE makes him lean on the car's hood, arms extended, legs
spread, while he frisks him.  In general, everyone is
excited over the capture.  BONNIE takes the sheriff's gun
and delicately places it on the radiator grill like an
object d'art.

                         CLYDE
                   (examining the man's
                   wallet, really surprised)
            Well, now, getta load of this.  I
            want y'all to know we are in the
            custody of Cap'n Frank Bryce, and
            Frank here is a Texas Ranger.

Rev. angle across hood--so BRYCE's face, not visible to
CLYDE or anyone else behind him, is in foreground.  His
gnarled, powerful hands tremble slightly on the hood, as tho
they might crinkle the metal like so much tissue paper.  His
eyes stare toward camera relentlessly, unblinking, but
without passion.  They are shark's eyes.  They have witnessed
much carnage, devoured it, and are still wide open for more.

                                                           58.


                         C.W.
            Sure 'nough, Clyde?

                         BUCK
            Say there, peacemaker.  I believe
            you got your spurs all tangled up.
            You're in Missouri, you know that?

CLYDE has been going thru the man's  credentials.  Not so
pleasantly:

                         CLYDE
            You didn't know you was in Missouri?

                         C.W.
            He's lost, this here Texas Ranger.

CLYDE claps BRYCE's hands behind his back, handcuffs him,
spins him around.

                         CLYDE
                   (a little pissed)
            --he ain't lost...them banks are
            offerin' extra reward money fer us,
            and Frank figured on easy pickin's,
            didn't you?
                   (he suddenly knocks
                   Bryce's hat off)
            Didn't you?

BRYCE flinches involuntarily.  BUCK suddenly grows wary at
CLYDE's mood.  CLYDE leans into BRYCE, looking up.

                         CLYDE
            --Now you ain't hardly doin' your
            job, Texas Ranger.  You oughta be
            home lookin' after the rights of
            poor folks, not out chasin' after us.

He suddenly hefts BRYCE's huge bulk onto the fender.

                         BUCK
                   (trying to be casual)
            Easy there, Clyde.  Why take is so
            personal.

                         CLYDE
                   (to Bryce)
            Reg'lar laws is one thing.  But
            this here bounty hunting, we got to
            discourage that.

BLANCHE looks very uncomfortable.  She starts to say
something, but BUCK intervenes.

                                                           59.


                         BUCK
            Like how, Clyde?--

A tense moment.  CLYDE can't think of anything right away.

                         C.W.
                   (trying to be helpful)
            Shoot him.

BONNIE shoots C.W. an angry glance--it's just what the gang
doesn't want.

                         C.W.
                   (trying again)
            ...hang him?...

Reaction--BONNIE carefully gauging the moment to intervene.

                         BONNIE
                   (suddenly)
            --uh-uh.  Take his picture.

CLYDE's not sure he's heard right.  Neither is C.W.

                         C.W.
            Take his picture?

                         BONNIE
                   (pointedly ignoring
                   C.W., brightly)
            Then we'll let the newspapers have
            it--so's everyone can see Captain
            Frank Bryce of the Texas Rangers
            with the Barrow gang--
                   (moving demurely to Bryce)
            --and all bein' just as friendly as
            pie.

                         BUCK
                   (grasping
                   possibilities immediately)
            ...yeah, yeah...

                         BONNIE
                   (continuing right on,
                   coyly picking up
                   Bryce's gun from grill)
            --why we 'bout the friendliest
            folks in the world.  Texas Ranger
            waves his big ol' gun at us, and we
            just welcome him like he's one of
            our own.

                                                           60.


                         CLYDE
                   (grinning widely)
            Buck, get the Kodak!

                         BUCK
                   (relieved and excited)
            Hot dog!

                         CLYDE
                   (to Bryce)
            We're mighty proud to have a Texas
            Ranger in the family.

BRYCE is obviously not pleased with this turn of events.
Following dialogue is overlapped, ad-libbed, etc.  A sense
of mounting glee at the kind of vengeance they are going to
exact.

New angle.  BUCK is fiddling with the camera, setting up the
shot with CLYDE.  BUCK's following speech should be heard,
b.g., to CLYDE's speech below it.

                         BUCK
            ...keep him set on the hood,
            there...more to the sun, like
            that...yeah...when all his ranger
            friends see this...I bet he's gonna
            wish he was dead!

                         CLYDE
                   (to Bryce)
            ...see what come o' your
            mischief?...not doin' your job?
            Down in Duncanville last year poor
            farmers kepts the laws away from us
            with shot guns...you're s'posed to
            be protectin' them from us, and
            they're protectin' us from you.
                   (giggling)
            --don't make sense, do it?

                         BUCK
            C'mon, now, Clyde, you and Bonnie
            first.  Move into him, right close,
            right friendly.

                         CLYDE
            All righty
                   (to Bryce, whose
                   hands are tied,
                   hemmed in by them both)
            Don't move, now, hear?

                                                           61.


CLYDE grandly puts an arm on BRYCE's shoulder, BONNIE,
looking up admiringly from the other side.  BUCK takes the
picture.  BONNIE immediately hops onto the hood, next to
BRYCE.

                         BONNIE
            How's this? "Captain Bryce and new
            found friend."

She coyly loosens his tie, tousles his hair, and plants a
big kiss on him while still ogling camera.

                         CLYDE
            ...yeah, yeah...quick, Buck, get
            it...

                         BUCK
            ...I'm gettin' it, I'm gettin' it.

Quite suddenly BRYCE, whose simmering intensity we should be
more sensitive to than the gang is, spits on Bonnie.  BONNIE
half-screams in disgust, but CLYDE is on top of BRYCE in a
flash, half-strangling on his own fury.  He pulls BRYCE off
the fender by the handcuffs, spinning him around crazily
like a lasso.  BRYCE is literally ricocheted off the car by
the force, and, with CLYDE hanging on by the cuffs, plummets
down the embankment to the sandy beach below, both men
falling, spinning.  BRYCE rises shakily.  He tries to walk
away.  CLYDE grabs him again by the handcuffs and hurls him
out into the water.  BRYCE smacks into a tree stump poking
out of the shallows and goes down.  CLYDE is on top of him.

Meanwhile, BUCK has rushed down into the water, tries to
pull CLYDE off BRYCE.

                         BUCK
                   (frantic)
            I got the picture.  I got the
            picture...

                         CLYDE
                   (oblivious)
            Lemme be, lemme be...

BRYCE reaches the surface and CLYDE tries to throw him into
deeper water.  He hitches BRYCE over a moldy skiff, knocking
aside one of the oars.  BUCK upends BRYCE into the skiff and
kicks it spinning.  CLYDE picks up an oar and hurls it like
a boomerang, ass over end at the skiff.  It kicks up a spray.

                         BUCK
                   (holding tightly to
                   Clyde, yelling)
            I got the PICTURE!

                                                           62.


Reaction.  CLYDE waist deep, breathing heavily.

                         CLYDE
            ...All right, all right...
                   (to Bryce, yelling)
            WE GOT YOU...HEAR?... REMEMBER...
            YOU... YOUR FACE...WE GOT IT...WE
            GOT YOU...WE GOT YOU...WE GOT YOU...

BRYCE, battered and handcuffed, stares back with mindless
malice from the lazily spinning skiff to the hysterical
spectre of CLYDE, screaming his madness across the water.

                                            DISSOLVE:

INT. BANK.

Inside the bank.  In contrast to the previous inept bank
robbery scene, this one goes admirably well, the gang
performing slickly and without a hitch.  As they enter,
dripping wet, CLYDE makes a general announcement to everyone
to the bank.

                         CLYDE
            This is the Barrow gang.
                   (the people turn and freeze)
            Everybody just take it easy and
            nobody will get hurt.

CLYDE covers the door.  BONNIE and BUCK go to the tellers'
cages and get money.  BUCK goes inside, emptying out the
cash drawers.  Cut to BONNIE filling the sack.

Cut to a close-up of a burglar alarm button.  Slowly a hand
crawls up the wall and a finger slowly moves to push the
button.  When the finger is about one inch away, suddenly a
gun appears in the frame and gently taps the hand away.  The
camera pulls back to reveal BUCK smiling at a lady teller.

                         BUCK
            Don't do nothin' silly now.

Cut to CLYDE standing near the door, training his guns on
the entire bank.  A farmer stands a few feet away, some
bills clutched in his hand.

                         CLYDE
            That your money or the bank's?

                         FARMER
            Mine.

                         CLYDE
            Keep it, then.

                                                           63.


Across the floor, the bank guard in the corner takes
advantage of CLYDE's distraction to go for his gun.  CLYDE
spots it and fires a shot that just knocks the bank guard's
hat off without harming him.

                         CLYDE
                   (to the guard, who
                   has practically
                   frozen in fear)
            Next time I'll aim a little lower.

They finish robbing the bank.  They start to exit.  Near the
door stands a guard with his hands raised.  He wears sun
glasses of the period.  As they leave BUCK snatches the sun
glasses from the guard's head.

                         BUCK
            Get a good look at us!  We're the
            Barrow boys.

EXT. BANK.  DAY.

The gang runs wildly into the street where the car waits,
motor running.  As they leap into car, BUCK throws the sun
glasses into BLANCHE's lap.

                         BUCK
            Happy birthday.

They zoom off.  Shots are heard.  BONNIE, BUCK and CLYDE
begin firing at the bank guards who are pursuing them.  The
guards fire back.

Close-up.  BLANCHE sitting in the back seat with her fingers
stuck tightly in her ears, eyes shut, trying to overcome her
panic.  A funny image, but one that also awakens pity.  The
next sequence is carried out in cross-cutting.

                                            CUT TO:

The street in front of the bank.  Police car pulls up and
the excited crowd gestures in the direction of the departed
gang.  The siren starts.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. GANG CAR.  DAY.

The siren heard now in the far distance.

                         BUCK
                   (to C.W. at the wheel)
            Kick it in the pants, C.W.

                                                           64.


                         CLYDE
            We got to make that state line!

                         C.W.
                   (driving like a wild
                   man, but adlibing loudly)
            Can't get more'n this out of a
            Plymouth!

                                            CUT TO:

INT. BANK.

The gang has left a legacy of celebrity behind.  We see the
bank guard whose hat was shot off being interviewed by a
reporter.  He is seated in a chair, his shirt open at the
collar and a woman teller is fanning him.

                         BANK GUARD
                   (enjoying the limelight)
            Then he saw me goin' for my gun.
            Clyde Barrow himself, I mean.  And
            suddenly I was starin' into the
            face of death!

                         WOMAN TELLER
            Tsk, tsk.

A photographer steps in.

                         PHOTOGRAPHER
            Just look this way, Mr. Hawkins.

The bank guard hurriedly buttons up his collar and smiles as
the flashbulb goes off.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT. GANG CAR.

Still speeding along, the siren more distant.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. BANK.

The bank president and a policeman are posing for that
classic picture where both stand flanking a bullet hole in
the wall and point proudly at it.  The flashbulb goes off.

                                            CUT TO:

                                                           65.


INT. POLICE CAR.

Two men in police uniforms following BONNIE and CLYDE.

                         FIRST POLICEMAN
            Step on it, Randolph.  We gotta
            catch 'em 'fore they reach the
            state line!

                                            CUT TO:

INT. BANK.

FARMER is describing BONNIE and CLYDE to passersby who dote
on him as though he'd just had contact with a portion of the
true cross.  FARMER is aware of his position.

                         FARMER
            Clyde?...he looked like, well he
            looked real...clean...and Bonnie,
            she's too much a lady ever to be
            caught with a cigar in her mouth...I
            don't care what you heard before.
            I saw 'em right here, not twenty
            minutes ago...
                   (gravely)
            --and all's I can say is, they did
            right by me, and I'm bringin' me a
            mess of flowers to their funeral.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. GANG'S CAR.

Car slows up perceptibly as CLYDE says:

                         CLYDE
            Okay, relax.  We're in Oklahoma now.
            Slow down.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. POLICE CAR.

                         FIRST POLICEMAN
            Turn around.  Don't waste no more
            gas.

                         SECOND POLICEMAN
                   (a young eager beaver type)
            Ain't we gone to catch 'em?

                                                           66.


                         FIRST POLICEMAN
            Hell, they're over the State line.
            That's out of our jurisdiction.

                         SECOND POLICEMAN
            Why don't we get 'em anyway?

                         FIRST POLICEMAN
            I ain't gone to risk my life in
            Oklahoma.  That's their problem.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT. CAR.

Now the gang's car is seen traveling down a long, narrow
country road surrounded by cornfields.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT. ROADSIDE BY WOODS.  DAY.

They get out, taking the various bags of money with them,
and dump the lot on the hood.  There is not an impressive
amount of money.

                         CLYDE
                   (disappointed)
            Hell.  That ain't much, is it?

                         BUCK
                   (commiseratingly)
            Times is hard,

                         CLYDE
            Well, let's get to it.

He begins dealing and splitting the money out on the hood of
the car, as they gather around.

                         CLYDE
            This is Clyde Barrow.
                   (lays down a bill)
            Buck Barrow...
                   (lays down a bill)
            Bonnie Parker...C.W.
                   (goes back to the
                   first again and lays
                   out another round)
            Clyde, Buck...Bonnie...C.W. Clyde,
            Clyde again...Buck...Bonnie...C.W.

BUCK and BLANCHE stand watching.  BLANCHE looks fretful.
She nudges BUCK and whispers to him.

                                                           67.


BUCK whispers something back to her.  Meanwhile, CLYDE's
counting still goes on.

                         CLYDE
            Bonnie...C.S....Clyde...

                         BUCK
                   (very ill at east in
                   this position he has
                   been forced into)
            Um...eh...Clyde?

                         CLYDE
            Hah?

BUCK is clearly embarrassed.

                         BUCK
            Uh, Clyde...well...what about
            Blanche?

Everyone reacts with stunned amazement at BLANCHE's nerve in
wanting to get her cut.

                         BONNIE
                   (incredulous)
            WHAT?

BLANCHE sees she has to rise to her own defense, and she
rises to the occasion with spirit and verve.

                         BLANCHE
            Well, why not?  Say I earned my
            share!  Same as everybody.  I
            coulda got killed same as everybody,
            and I'm wanted by the law same as
            everybody.  Besides I coulda got
            snake bit sleepin' in them woods
            every night!
                   (building it up)
            I'm just a nervous wreck and that's
            the truth.  And I have to listen to
            sass from Miss Bonnie Parker all
            the time.  I deserve mine!

Close.  BUCK.  Day--looking at CLYDE, his face full of weak
smiles and embarrassment at his wife.

                         CLYDE
                   (with a sigh)
            Okay...okay...hold your horses,
            Blanche.  You'll get your share.

                                                           68.


BONNIE is livid but says nothing.  CLYDE, the leader has
decided.  C.W. looks indignant, like a hog who's just been
given a bath.  CLYDE begins counting all over again in near
silence.

                         BUCK
            Married a preacher's daughter and
            she still thinks she's takin' the
            collection.

Everyone now laughs, but BLANCHE.  CLYDE continues counting.

                         BUCK
                   (to Blanche)
            Well, don't spend it all in one
            place now, hear?

                         BONNIE
            She'll be doin' right well to spend
            it at all.

BONNIE turns and ambles away from the car.  After a moment
CLYDE stops counting and moves after her.  He's prepared for
a fight, stands behind BONNIE's arched back trying to gauge
the degree of hostility there.

                         CLYDE
            Bonnie?

No answer.

                         CLYDE
                   (a little defensive)
            Look, Bonnie, I've said it and I
            guess I'll keep sayin' it before
            we're thru--Blanche is Buck's wife
            and Buck is family.

He waits expectantly.

                         BONNIE
                   (finally, utterly
                   without malice)
            --she's such a silly-Billy...

BONNIE looks plaintively to CLYDE.

                         BONNIE
            My family could use some of that
            money.

                                                           69.


                         CLYDE
            Them laws have been hangin' round
            your mamas house 'til all hours,
            Bonnie.  It's just too risky to go
            there.

                         BONNIE
                   (exploding)
            Well, where can we go?  We rob the
            damn banks, what else do we do?

CLYDE cannot really answer.  Suddenly C.W. starts yelling:

                         C.W.
            CLYDE!  CLYDE!  CLYDE!

CLYDE flinches at the sound.  C.W. comes bounding over, as
rude an assault on their sensibilities as he can be.

                         CLYDE
                   (wincing as they are
                   nose to nose)
            I hear you, C.W.

                         C.W.
            This ol' heap's gushin' oil!  We
            got to swipe us another set of
            wheels right away, or we won't get
            anywhere.  Look here.

He reaches down under the pan of the car and scoops a gooey
handful of slick black oil which he holds before their faces.

                         C.W.
            See?

CLYDE nods slowly.  He looks back to BONNIE.  He sees.

                                            DISSOLVE:

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET.

A residential neighborhood on a suburban street.  A rather
well-to-do neighborhood.  The camera is up on a porch of a
white frame house, looking toward the street.  On the porch,
sitting in the swing in the left f.g. are a MAN and a WOMAN.
She is about twenty-nine, he is about thirty-six.  He is
sitting with his back to us, embracing the WOMAN.  They are
spooning, making low, loving murmurs.

                         WOMAN
            Oh, now...now, dear...

                                                           70.


                         MAN
            Mmmm...sweet thing...

We see in the distance two cars parked in front of the house.
His and hers.  Suddenly we see another car drive up (BONNIE
and CLYDE) and somebody gets out.  Then the whole gang gets
out, ditches the one car and gets in one of the parked cars.
All the while the couple on the porch is busy spooning.  The
car begins to roll slowly into the street.  The WOMAN notices.

                         WOMAN
            Say, isn't that your car, Eugene?

                         MAN
                   (still nuzzling her)
            Mmmmmm...huh?
                   (he looks, leaps from
                   the swing)
            That's my car!  Hey!

The MAN and WOMAN run down the front steps and front walk to
the second car.  They jump in and take off, giving chase.

INT. CAR.  DAY.

The WOMAN is driving (it's her car).  The MAN is furious.

                         EUGENE
            I'll tear 'em apart!  Those punks!
            Steal a man's car right out from
            under him!  Wait till I get my
            hands on those kids, Velma, I'll
            show 'em!

They continue driving, furious, the man cursing and muttering.
We see through their windshield the other car way in the
distance.

                         VELMA
            What if they have guns, Eugene?

                         EUGENE
                   (realizing the
                   possibility, he
                   suddenly stops being
                   mad and turns chicken)
            We'd better get the police and let
            them handle this.

                         VELMA
            Right.

                                                           71.


                         EUGENE
            Turn around and let's get back to
            town.  We'll go get the sheriff.

They are by now on a narrow dirt road and the WOMAN has to
execute a U-turn.  It takes her about seven cuts to turn the
car around in the narrow space.  They start back to town.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. BONNIE AND CLYDE'S CAR.

BUCK looks out the rear window.

                         BUCK
            They stopped chasin' us.  They
            turned around.

Close-up.  CLYDE grinning mischievously.

                         CLYDE
            Let's take 'em.

BUCK and C.W. laugh appreciatively at the reversal.  CLYDE
turns the car around.  He performs the U-turn in the same
narrow space in one, swift, smooth, beautiful turn.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. THE OTHER CAR.

VELMA looks in the rear view mirror and sees that now she is
being chased.

                         VELMA
            Oh, my Lord, they're comin' after us.

                         EUGENE
                   (in a panic)
            Step on it, Velma, step on it!

Close-up.  Accelerator.  VELMA jams it down to the floor.
The car speeds.

EXT. ROAD.  THE CHASE.  DAY.

BONNIE and CLYDE's car gaining on them, gaining on them,
gaining on them and finally overtaking them, coming up and
ahead, forcing them to the side of the road.

Med. shot.  The MAN and WOMAN's car.  Terrified, they roll
up their windows, lock their doors and huddle together.

                                                           72.


EXT. ROAD.

The Barrow gang piles out of their car and walks over,
having a merry time.  They surround the car and press their
faces against the window, flattening their features, making
menacing gestures at the shaking pair inside.  We see this
from the point of view of the MAN and WOMAN inside the car.
CLYDE pulls out a gun, makes as if to shoot, but he is
kidding.  They all laugh uproariously, especially BUCK who
is delighted with CLYDE's prank.  All of this we see in
pantomime from inside the trapped car.

EXT. CAR.

                         CLYDE
            C'mon, get out!  Get out of there,
            I said.

They come out, hands held high, shaking with fear.  They
have practically turned to jelly.

                         CLYDE
                   (ordering them into
                   the other car)
            Get in here.

INT. OTHER CAR.  DAY.

They get in and the gang gets in.  Seven people are now
jammed inside.  CLYDE drives, BONNIE next to him, C.W. next
to her.  In back, BLANCHE, then EUGENE with VELMA (of
necessity) sitting on his lap, and then BUCK.  As will be
seen, the reason the Barrows have kidnapped the couple is
simply that they wanted company.  Living as they do, seeing
only each other day after day, they long for diversion and
new faces.  So the atmosphere in the car will shortly change
to one of friendliness and jollity, and it will get
progressively more so in the series of cuts which advance
the time.  As the car starts up at the beginning, however,
the MAN and WOMAN are terrified.

                         BUCK
            What's your name?

                         EUGENE
                   (hesitantly)
            I'm Eugene Grizzard.

                         VELMA
            I'm Velma Davis.

                                                           73.


                         BUCK
                   (just as friendly as
                   he can be)
            Well, howdy!  We're the Barrow gang.
            That there is Clyde drivin' and I'm
            Buck.

The MAN and WOMAN almost faint from fear; clutch at each
other.  The gang all laugh at this.  VELMA and EUGENE begin
to realize that they are not going to get hurt and that the
Barrows are friendly to them.

                         BONNIE
            Look, don't be scared, folks.  It
            ain't like you was the law.  You're
            just folks like us.

                         EUGENE
                   (agreeing over-enthusiastically)
            Yeah, yeah, that's the truth.

                         CLYDE
            I expect you been readin' about us.

The MAN and the WOMAN answer simultaneously with what they
think is the right thing to say under the circumstances.

                         EUGENE
            Yes.

                         VELMA
            No.

They glare at each other.

                         EUGENE
                   (meaningfully)
            Yes, Velma, we have too.

                         BONNIE
                   (laughing at the contretemps)
            Well, you two must be in love, I bet.

EUGENE and VELMA blush, get shy for a second.  BONNIE smiles.

                         BUCK
                   (gleefully, clapping
                   his hands)
            Well, when you gonna marry the
            girl, boy?

Everyone chuckles heartily.

                                            CUT TO:

                                                           74.


INT. CAR.  LATER.

--still driving, same positions, but some time has elapsed.
The atmosphere is now completely convivial and the captives
are enjoying their new friends.  As the scene starts, BUCK
is finishing his joke.

                         BONNIE
            So then she drinks her milk down
            again, every drop.  And she looks
            over at her son and says, "Son,
            whatever you do, don't sell that
            cow!"

The couple laughs with great amusement, but everyone else in
the car doesn't laugh--this is the tenth time they've heard
the joke.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. OF CAR.

--getting on toward evening.  All are thoroughly relaxes and
chatting.

                         BONNIE
                   (to Velma)
            How old are you, honey?

                         VELMA
            Thirty-three.

A sudden look of surprise registers on EUGENE's face.

INT. OF CAR.  NIGHT.

It is now night.  Everyone inside the car is eating.
Apparently they stopped somewhere along the way for food.
In the crowded interior, it is like a party--food is being
passed back and forth, laughter and gaiety, increasing
warmth between the couple and the Barrows.  The car has
become a little society on wheels, dashing through the black
night down the highway.  Inside there is a small world of
happiness and fun.

BUCK is unpacking the food and passing sandwiches and drinks
around the car.

                         VELMA
            Now I ordered some French fries,
            didn't I?

                                                           75.


                         BUCK
                   (passing her some)
            Yeah, here you go.

                         CLYDE
            Take it easy on those French fries,
            Velma.  Ain't that right, Eugene?

                         EUGENE
                   (studying his hamburger)
            This isn't mine.  I ordered mine
            well done.  Who's got the other
            hamburger?

Close-up.  C.W. who has already taken a bite of the other one.

                         C.W.
            Oh, is this supposed to be yours?

He extends the bitten burger out to EUGENE.

Full shot.

                         EUGENE
            That's okay, forget it.

CLYDE laughs at this.

                         BUCK
                   (chewing)
            Haw!  I sure am havin' a good time!
            How 'bout you folks?  Ain't you
            glad we picked you up?

                         CLYDE
                   (laughing)
            Hey, maybe y'all ought to join up
            with us.

That idea strikes everyone as being very amusing.

                         EUGENE
                   (laughing)
            Ha!  Wouldn't they be surprised
            back home to hear that?

                         VELMA
            Yeah.  What would Martha and Bill
            say if they heard that?
                   (she roars with laughter)
                         (MORE)

                                                           76.


                         VELMA (CONT'D)


                         EUGENE
            Lordy!  They'd throw a fit!
                   (roars with laughter)


                         BONNIE
                   (laughing)
            What do you do, anyway?

                         EUGENE
                   (as his laugh begins
                   to fade)
            I'm an undertaker.

Suddenly everyone freezes.  A shudder, as if the cold hand
of death had suddenly touched the occupants of the car.  The
atmosphere changes to cold, deadly, fearful silence in
exactly one second.  It is a premonition of death for the
Barrows, and they react accordingly, BONNIE especially.

Close-up.  BONNIE.

                         BONNIE
                   (tautly, in a flat voice)
            Get them out of here.

EXT. ROAD.  NIGHT.

The car brakes to a sudden stop.  The rear down is opened,
the MAN and WOMAN flung out into the darkness.  The car
drives off into the lonely night.

From this point on, the audience should realize that death
is inevitable for the Barrow gang, that it follows them
always, that it waits anywhere.  It is no longer a question
of whether death will come, but when it will.

EXT. WOODS.  MORNING.

Moving with CLYDE he tears through the brush, snagging his
clothes, calling BONNIE's name.  CLYDE's search is so
desperate here that for a moment we might think he is
fleeing from something rather than looking for something.

In a moment he emerges onto the road.  The car, with C.W.
driving, and BUCK and BLANCHE beside him, is patrolling
slowly up ahead of him.

CLYDE spots it and runs toward it.  Hold on this angle until
he catches up with it and leaps onto the running board.

                                                           77.


Moving shot.  Car.  Morning.  CLYDE, now on the running
board, his head poked into the car, his face apple red and
sweating.

                         CLYDE
                   (breathing heavily)
            ...see anythin', Buck?

BUCK is shocked at his brother's desperation, but makes no
overt comment on it.

                         BUCK
            --not yet, boy.

                         CLYDE
                   (with an edge of
                   paranoia, as if the
                   three of them might
                   be withholding
                   something from him)
            --and nobody saw her leave, or
            heard anythin'
                   (almost a threat)
            ...C.W....?

EXT. CAR.  MOVING SHOT.  DAY.

CLYDE gets the point.  For the very first time we see CLYDe,
the leader, helpless as he hangs onto the running board.

                         CLYDE
                   (lamely)
            ...Well, where do you think she
            could've gone?...Buck?...Buck?

                         BUCK
                   (amazed and a little frightened)
            Jesus, I don't know...

CLYDE looks helplessly at his brother, then drops off the
running board and continues on foot, running along, scanning
the fields--the car keeping up beside him as he runs and we
truck before both car and CLYDE.

Angle on car through windshield.  Reaction shot.  Day.  BUCK
turning to BLANCHE, shrugging his shoulders, speechless.

Reverse angle through the windshield.  Day--at CLYDE, who
has suddenly seen something begins gesticulating wildly,
almost--from car's POV, a little comically.

                         CLYDE
            There!  There!  There!

                                                           78.


He starts running off into a cornfield.

Another angle--picking up CLYDE as he kicks his way into the
cornfield, knees pumping high, knocking down the stalks.  He
stops and picks up the stocking he had spotted, takes it and
moves on.

Still another angle as CLYDE has picked up a freshly beaten
trail through the cornfield.  He picks up one of BONNIE's
scarves, now.  As he runs on, he clears a knoll and BONNIE,
her yellow hair unmistakable even at this distance, comes
into view.  She's far off in the cornfield, stalking off,
looking neither to right nor left, carrying a brown paper
sack that has split, from which she has occasionally lost
clothing.  CLYDE screams, "BONNIE." She apparently doesn't
hear.

Angle on cornfield.  Day.  As CLYDE gets closer.  BONNIE
herself suddenly breaks into flight, the paper bag splitting
completely, the remaining clothes spilling out.  There is a
real chase where they each try to get the advantage.  CLYDE
is so exhausted from his run that he has real trouble
cornering her as they maneuver up and down the rows of corn.
Finally CLYDE catches up.

Extreme close-up.  BONNIE & CLYDE.  Day.  As they tumble
into the stalks of corn, mowing them down.

                         BONNIE
            Leave me alone!  Leave me alone!

                         CLYDE
                   (holding her, kissing
                   her frantically)
            Hey...hey, hey, baby, hey, Bonnie,
            hey baby...
                   (calming her down)
            ...Hey, hey now...just where did
            you think you were goin'?...

BONNIE doesn't answer.

Up angle.  POV CLYDE.  As he's momentarily distracted by
BUCK's laughter as he's in the cornfield picking up BONNIE's
clothing.  CLYDE waves an impatient it's all-right-wave.  He
turns back to BONNIE who he still holds tightly.

                         CLYDE
                   (still frantic)
            --Huh.  Bonnie?  Where?  Where?

                                                           79.


                         BONNIE
            I don't know!  You're hurting me, I
            was just scared is all...and my
            mama's been on my mind, and she's
            gettin' so old...

BONNIE hesitates, beginning to feel a little foolish now.

                         CLYDE
            Boy, don't ever leave without
            sayin' somethin'.  You really
            scared me, Bonnie.

                         BONNIE
            But I mean it, though.  I want to
            see my mama.  Please, Clyde.

Two shot.  BONNIE and CLYDE.  Day.

                         CLYDE
                   (enormously relieved,
                   kissing her)
            Okay, sweetheart.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. SIDE OF A ROAD.  VERY LONG SHOT.  DAY.

--of three or four cars parked on the side of a road in
Texas.  A light rain is falling.  There are a lot of people
gathered around, but the sound is an indistinct mixture of
talk, laughter, etc.

There follows a quick montage of cuts which isolate specific
moments in the family reunion, thereby implying the entire
tone of the proceedings.  The sense of family pervades.

Montage.  BONNIE and MOTHER.  BONNIE's mother, an old woman,
grabs her and hugs her and cries.

Montage.  BONNIE, CLYDE, MAN.  A man, an uncle perhaps,
stands with BONNIE and CLYDE, arms around them both, hugging
them to his sides tightly.

Montage.  BONNIE and sister.  BONNIE's sister hands them a
scrapbook of clippings.

                         SISTER
            Here you are, we been cuttin' and
            pastin' everything we could find
            about you in the papers.

                                                           80.


CLYDE, BONNIE, BUCK and BLANCHE all look at the scrapbook.
We see a page of it, showing newspaper articles with the
photographs the gang took back at the motel.

                         BUCK
            Hey look, here's that one I took of
            you, Clyde.  That came out just fine!

Montage.  BONNIE, CLYDE, MAN.  BONNIE and CLYDE are posing
for a comic snapshot.  A silly looking male relative is
posing, pointing a gun at them.  They have their hands in
the air and are grinning broadly.  (The effect should be
funny and simultaneously frightening.)

Montage BUCK, SMALL BOY.  BUCK is sitting with a little
four-year-old on his knee, bouncing him up and down and
singing.  Both are having a fine time.

                         BUCK
                   (singing)
            Oh, Horsey! keep your tail up, keep
            yer tail up, keep yer tail up, Oh,
            Horsey! keep yer tail up, Why don't
            you make it rise.

Montage--C.W.  A hand off camera thrusts a sandwich at C.W.
He opens the bread to see what's inside it, then eats it.

Montage--BONNIE & SISTER.  BONNIE sits stock-still while her
sister gives her a permanent in the back seat of a car.  He
sister pauses, setting down the curling iron.  She strokes
BONNIE's yellow head with her hand, as though she were a
wild animal that had paused long enough to be petted.
BONNIE turns to see her sister's expression.  They embrace.

Montage--Family picnic--Favoring CLYDE, MOTHER & BONNIE.
CLYDE, in his best theatrical manner has been playing host
in the sand pile, perhaps using some sort of towel across
the arm or around the middle.  The party is beginning to
break up now as used paper plates and crumpled napkins are
blowing across the sand and the group is finishing up on
Eskimo pie.

                         BONNIE'S UNCLE
                   (rising)
            Where y'all headed from here?

                         CLYDE
                   (right back)
            I don't know, what y'all got in
            mind?  At this point we ain't
            headin' to anywhere, we're just
            runnin' from.

                                                           81.


CLYDE laughs, in fine spirits.

Reaction--BONNIE.  She doesn't.

                         BONNIE'S SISTER'S VOICE
            C'mon, down, Litte Tom!  We're
            goin' home.  Little Tom?  Mathew,
            fetch Little Tom.

                         BONNIE
            Don't go yet, Mama.

                         UNCLE'S VOICE
                   (cutting in)
            C'mere, c'mere you little corn
            roller.

Wide angle.  As Uncle sweeps up the laughing little Tom.

Reaction--BONNIE.  BONNIE turns with increased urgency to
her MOTHER, who, having been hefted to her feet by BONNIE's
sister, has turned to CLYDE, who gives her a big, boyish hug.

                         MOTHER
            ...you know, Clyde, I read about
            y'all in the papers and I'm jes'
            scared.

                         BONNIE
                   (to Clyde)
            Sugar, make mama stay a while yet.

                         CLYDE
                   (ignoring Bonnie, as
                   does Mother,
                   ebulliently, even joshing)
            Now Mrs. Parker, don't y'all
            believe what you read in the papers!
            That's the law talking there.  They
            want us to look big so's they'll
            look big when they catch us.

He knows he's stumbled onto the wrong thing, but he bounces
right along--it's his style.

                         CLYDE
            --and they can't do that.  Why, I'm
            even better at runnin' than robbin'
            banks--aw shoot, if we done half
            the stuff they said we did, we'd be
            millionaires, wouldn't we, old
            sugar.
                         (MORE)

                                                           82.


                         CLYDE (CONT'D)
                   (he turns to Bonnie
                   who continues to
                   stare at her Mother)
            And I wouldn't risk Bonnie here
            just to make money, uncertain as
            times are.  Why one time I knowed
            of a job where we could of make
            $2000 easy, but I saw the law
            outside and I said to myself, why
            Bonnie could get hurt here.  So I
            just drove right on and let that
            money lay.

He waits for a response, as does BONNIE.  BONNIE's MOTHER
smiles, a little abstractedly.

                         MOTHER
            ...Maybe you know the way with her,
            then.  I'm just an old woman and I
            don't know nothin...

She trails off, looking nowhere in particular.  CLYDE takes
her reaction to mean that he's overwhelming her with his
confidence, and continues to pour it on.

                         CLYDE
            We'll be quittin' this just as soon
            as the hard times is over, Mother
            Parker, I can tell you that.  Why
            me and Bonnie were just talkin' the
            other day and we talked about when
            we'd settle down and get us a home,
            and Bonnie said, "I couldn't bear
            to live morn'n three miles from my
            precious mother." Now how'd you
            like that, Mother Parker?

BONNIE's MOTHER has undergone a funny sort of transformation
during CLYDE's speech--as if something had suddenly come
into focus before the old woman's eyes.

                         MOTHER
            Don't believe I would.  I surely
            don't.
                   (to Bonnie)
            You try to live three miles from me
            and you won't live long, honey.
                   (to Clyde)
            You'd best keep runnin' and you
            know it, Clyde Barrow.
                   (matter of fact)
            Bye, baby.

                                                           83.


She hugs BONNIE who can barely respond.  We move in for a
closeup of BONNIE as her various relatives, young and old
come by to squeeze, kiss and hug her with a chirpy little
chorus of Bye, Bonnie!  Bye, Bonnie, bye, bye, bye.

                                            DISSOLVE:

EXT. PLATTE CITY MOTEL.  PLATTE CITY, IOWA.  DAY.

Hold on the outside long enough to see the unusual
structures: two little motel cabins connected by two
identical garages, an entirely symmetrical structure.

INT. PLATTE CITY MOTEL BEDROOM.  WITH BONNIE.  DAY.

--as she tries, against heavy odds, to file and trim her
nails in a corner of the room.  The odds are; CLYDE on a
uke, b.g., BUCK, and BLANCHE--gathered around C.W. who sits
in the only stuffed chair in the room.  Their o.s.
raucousness is clearly shattering to BONNIE who, at a key
moment in the scene, ends up spearing her cuticle with a
file, spurting a little board and a lot of temper.

Other angle.  CLYDE--BUCK--BLANCHE--C.W.  Day.  A naked
lightbulb (the lampshade has been removed) glares down on
C.W.'s chest--where a pair of bluebirds have been tattooed
with a rocco flourish.  BUCK and BLANCHE are vastly amused--
rather BLANCHE takes delight in BUCK's delight.

                         BUCK
            How long have ya had it?

                         C.W.
                   (like some docile
                   animal submitting to inspection)
            --just got it.

                         BUCK
                   (to Blanche, who
                   stares fascinated as
                   one of C.W.'s pectoral
                   muscles contracts and
                   the wings flutter)
            Touch it, honey!  Go on!

BLANCHE squeals with amusement.  BUCK takes BLANCHE's hand
and places it on the bluebirds.

                         BLANCHE
                   (titillated with delight)
            Oh, no, Daddy!  No!

Reaction BONNIE.  Day--as the file digs into her cuticle on
BLANCHE's squeal.  With barely controlled rage:

                                                           84.


                         BONNIE
            What are you all doin'?

INT. MOTEL BEDROOM.  GROUP SHOT.  FAV. BONNIE.  DAY.

                         C.W.
                   (insensitive to
                   Bonnie's stare)
            Playin' with my tattoo, Bonnie.

                         BONNIE
            Well, why don't you all go play
            with it somewhere else?

New angle.  Motel bedroom.  Day.

                         BLANCHE
            What's bothering her?

                         CLYDE
                   (sees something coming)
            Not now, Blanche.

                         BUCK
                   (who doesn't want to
                   be victimized by
                   Bonnie's temperament)
            What's bothering her, Clyde?

                         BONNIE
                   (exploding)
            I said go somewhere else!

She picks up the first three objects she can find on the
dresser and hurls them--an ashtray, a Gideon Bible, and a
flower pot--at the little group.  The pot goes shattering
into the wall.  Everyone ducks.

                         CLYDE
                   (straightening up,
                   matter-of-fact)
            Bonnie's hungry, C.W. I saw a
            chicken place a few miles back.
            Who all wants to go get some food?

INT. MOTEL BEDROOM.  GROUP SHOT.  DAY.

                         BLANCHE
                   (rising from her
                   chair, a little
                   shaken at Bonnie's outburst)
            I sure do.  I'm plenty tired of
            sittin' around here anyway.

                                                           85.


                         BUCK
                   (not making a move to
                   get up)
            You can't drive, honeylove.

                         C.W.
                   (reluctantly)
            I'll go.

CLYDE makes a face to BONNIE pretending there's something
going on between C.W. and BLANCHE.  BONNIE tries to keep
from being amused.  C.W. moves out with BLANCHE.  BUCK rises
to go next door.

                         C.W.
            What's everybody want?

                         CLYDE
            Just five chicken dinners, and get
            somethin' for dessert.

                         BUCK
            See if they got peach ice cream.
                   (he grins and pats
                   his stomach)


All finally exit, leaving BONNIE and CLYDE alone.

EXT. CAR AND STREET.  DUSK.

C.W. and BLANCHE go out.  We go with them.  They get in the
car and drive off.  BUCK enters his cabin.

INT. MOTEL BEDROOM.  BONNIE AND CLYDE.  DUSK.

CLYDE reaches her, and for a moment both stare with fanatic
intensity at each other, BONNIE trying desperately to keep a
straight face.  They are nose to nose, unblinking.  CLYDE
gives her a big raspberry, waggling his fingers in his ears
like a kid.  She laughs.

                         BONNIE
            I hate you all.

                         CLYDE
            I hate y'all, too.

                         BONNIE
            no, I really hate you.

She turns away from him, wilts onto the bed.

                                                           86.


                         BONNIE
                   (eyes brimming)
            Oh, baby, I've got the blues so
            bad...

CLYDE moves behind her, begins to massage her back.  There
is something very delicate about the way he touches her; it
suggests CLYDE's sensitivity to her mood rather than any
degree of physical intimacy.

                         CLYDE
            Bonnie?...is it your mama, what
            your mama said?

                         BONNIE
            What mama?...she's just an old
            woman now...I have no mama...

BONNIE rolls over on her back, stares up at CLYDE, tears
splaying across her face from the move.

                         BONNIE
                   (quietly)
            ...so funny...I thought when we
            first went out, we were really
            goin' somewhere...but this is it--
            we're just goin', huh?

She has addressed this last directly to CLYDE, but there is
nothing rhetorical about it--it is a real question.  CLYDE
doesn't answer for a moment.  Then:

                         CLYDE
            Do you care about where we're goin'?

BONNIE clearly finds this hard to say:

                         BONNIE
            Not as long as you care about me.

                         CLYDE
                   (quite simply)
            Why I love you, sugar.

It's the first time he's said it to her, and BONNIE is
overwhelmed.  She wraps her arms around CLYDE's middle, and
snuggles into him, like a child.  Neither we nor CLYDE can
see BONNIE's face now, and her voice is muffled by his chest.

                         BONNIE'S VOICE
            --enough to die with me, baby?...
            'cause I think that's where we're
            goin'...I surely do.

                                                           87.


CLYDE is both touched and amused by the plea.  He strokes
her head lightly.  Really meaning it.

                         CLYDE
            --wherever.

                                            DISSOLVE:

INT. CAR.

BLANCHE, her tense and agitated self growing increasingly
more so lately, lights a fresh cigarette off the butt of the
one she has been smoking.

                         C.W.
                   (conversationally)
            You sure smokin' all the time lately.

                         BLANCHE
                   (quick to take
                   offense, snaps)
            So what?

                         C.W.
            Nothin'.

BLANCHE, sick of it all, drops her head in her hand with a
sigh.

                         BLANCHE
            Oh, God...

C.W. looks at her, finally decides to say something that
occurs to him.

                         C.W.
            Whyn't you go back home to your papa?

                         BLANCHE
                   (it's been her dream)
            Oh, if I could!  If I could just do
            that one thing!  Oh, there's no
            tellin' why this all happened.  I
            was a preacher's daughter.

                         C.W.
            When church is your pa affiliated
            with?

                                                           88.


                         BLANCHE
                   (much more interested
                   in talking about herself)
            Baptist...oh, and he thought the
            world of Buck, my daddy did, even
            knowing that Buck was serving time
            in jail.  He forgave him for that
            'cause he paid his debt to society.

                         C.W.
            We were Disciples of Christ.

INT. FRIED CHICKEN CAFE.

The camera remains stationary in this scene, in this position.
A lunch counter sweeps down the center of the screen.  We
are at one end of the counter.  In the f.g., a DEPUTY sits
drinking coffee, absorbed in his cup.  In the b.g., at the
other end of the counter, by the Exit door, BLANCHE and C.W.
are being handed their order by the counterman.

                         BLANCHE
            Hey, C.W., I ain't got my money.
            Give me some, will you?

The DEPUTY turns his head and looks over there.  C.W. opens
his jacket to reach in his pocket for money.  As he opens
his coat, his gun is clearly seen tucked in his pants.
Camera zooms in to tight close-up of gun.

Close shot.  DEPUTY--his face tense.  Sound of door closing
shut, as C.W. and BLANCHE leave.

                         DEPUTY
                   (to counterman)
            Get Sheriff Smoot on the phone.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

INT. PLATTE CITY MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT.

On C.W.'s moonlit chest and face, tattooed bluebirds heaving
and occasionally snoring in the night.  Behind him the room
is dimly lit by flickering candles that are placed out of
sight on the floor.  The shapes in the room--the bed is
gutted and only the box mattress remains--dresser, lamp
shades, etc., are grotesque in the flickering light.  O.s.
sounds of BONNIE and CLYDE, BONNIE giggling and CLYDE
whispering something we can't quite hear.

Move across the room toward the gutted bed.  Move giggling
from the floor beneath the box mattress--for a moment it
should appear as if something perversely sexual may be going
on between BONNIE and CLYDE.

                                                           89.


                         BONNIE'S VOICE
            Ready?

                         CLYDE'S VOICE
                   (a little embarrassed)
            Aw Bonnie--

                         BONNIE'S VOICE
                   (coaxing)
            C'mon!

CLYDE's arm wielding a Tommy gun, clears the bed.  With the
muzzle, CLYDE knocks the swivel mirror on the dresser
overhead, bringing BONNIE and CLYDE into view.

Closer angle mirror--BONNIE and CLYDE.  Night.  BONNIE lies
stiff as a statue on the white mattress, impeccably dressed
for her funeral.  Candelabras made of empty beer bottles lie
at her head and feet.  BONNIE's hands and face are powdered
and painted a waxen white.  She wears a garish silk bow in
her hair which it, for this occasion, curled like a little
girl's.

CLYDE sits up, beer bottle in one hand, Tommy gun in the
other, derby hat cocked--and just a little unsure of the
whole thing.  He takes a swig--BONNIE stops him, trying
terribly hard not to change her position.

                         BONNIE
            Lie down now, honey.

                         CLYDE
            I've done enough!

Angle on mirror--BONNIE and CLYDE.  Night.

                         BONNIE
                   (with patience, to a child)
            You have to lie down...it's the
            only way we can tell what we'll
            look kike together.

She giggles again, more than a little gassed herself.  CLYDE
clamps a big cigar between his teeth and abruptly lies down
beside her.  CLYDE is both amused and annoyed.

                         CLYDE
                   (staring up at
                   himself talking with
                   cigar clenched
                   between his teeth)
            Whatta you think?

                                                           90.


                         BONNIE
                   (it suddenly strikes her)
            That's not the right tie!

                         CLYDE
            What?

                         BONNIE
                   (rising, weaving a little)
            You can't wear polka-dots on an
            occasion like this.

                         CLYDE
            Well what--

                         BONNIE
            Stripes.  Don't go away now.

She weaves her way over to the dresser, takes a swig from a
bottle there herself, checks her makeup, and returns with
the tie.  Holding against his chest to try it out she almost
falls into him.  CLYDE steadies her.

                         BONNIE
            Perfect.

She tries to tie it for him, and clearly has trouble with
the knot.

                         CLYDE
            OK, o.k.  If we're gonna do this,
            at least I can tie it myself.  Lie
            down before you fall down.

INT. MOTEL BEDROOM--BONNIE AND CLYDE.  NIGHT.

She does, with some play-acting, exaggerated obeisance to
CLYDE's command--reaching up at the last moment like a
zombie and snatching an artificial flower from BLANCHE's hat
which still lies on the dresser.  CLYDE lies down now.  They
look into the mirror again.

                         CLYDE
                   (grudgingly)
            Better?

                         BONNIE
            Much.

This tickles CLYDE despite himself and he laughs--BONNIE
begins to sing to him--performing for both CLYDe and her own
image in the mirror--like some hoydenish vaudevillian.

                                                           91.


During the course of the song she will rise and take CLYDE
with her who finally joins in when they tip-toe over and
begin to serenade C.W.

                         BONNIE & CLYDE
                   (to the lugubrious
                   strains of the Death March)
            "Did you ever think when a hearse
            went by,
            That somebody you or I may die?
            They'll wrap you up in a big white
            sheet
            and bury you down just about six
            feet,
            The worms crawl in, the worms crawl
            out,
            The worms play penuckle on your
            snout.
            Your eyes fall in, your teeth fall
            out,
            Your face turns green and the pus
            runs out.

During this last they have been hovering over C.W.'s
twitching face, like a couple of tipsy ghouls, whisper-
singing into his ears.  C.W. finally blinks, doesn't even
bother to look at them.

                         C.W.
            I'm gonna die if I don't get some
            sleep.  Quit singing that.

Reaction--BONNIE and CLYDE.  Night.  They smile, go back and
lie down.  Looking at their images:

                         BONNIE
            All right, shut your eyes now.

                         CLYDE
                   (playing along with her)
            No, you first.

                         BONNIE
            One for the money.

                         CLYDE
            Two for the show.

                         BONNIE
            Three to get ready--

                         CLYDE & BONNIE
            Four to Go.

                                                           92.


As they approach four we should feel that somehow when they
shut their eyes, they really will die.  They shut them on
GO, and screen goes black.

EXT. PLATTE CITY MOTEL.  NIGHT.

Ranged across the lawn are six police cars, loaded with
peace officers.  Four men come out and, guns drawn, walk
cautiously over to the room on the right--BUCK and BLANCHE's.

INT. PLATTE CITY MOTEL.  BUCK'S CABIN.  NIGHT.

There is a knock on the door.  They sit bolt upright in bed.
Before BUCK can say anything, BLANCHE puts her hand over his
mouth to shut him up.

                         BLANCHE
                   (calling out)
            The men are on the other side.

EXT. PLATTE CITY MOTEL.  NIGHT.

The four lawmen, among them the DEPUTY from the cafe, edge
their way across the lawn, past the first garage, past the
second.  Before they reach the door of BONNIE and CLYDE's
cabin, the window smashes and there are blasts of gunfire.
One cop is hit and falls, the others run back to the cars
for cover.  BONNIE and C.W. are at the window, firing
steadily.

CLYDE--running into the garage to get the car.  They must
escape.  All they can do is escape, and all they have is
that one car in the closed garage.

Outside.  Two of the lawmen fall to the ground, shot.  As
the remaining two run back for cover, we see a blinding
light rolling up in a space between the six cars.  It is an
armored truck, with mounted guns and and spotlight, advancing
toward the cabin.

Inside the armored truck.  Two men in the seat.  Sounds of
gunshots coming from everywhere, piercing light.  From
inside the truck, we suddenly see the windshield shattered
from bullets fired by BONNIE and C.W.  The driver is hit,
and he slumps over the wheel.  His body hits the horn, which
starts blasting and continues throughout the battle.  The
other man, quickly, ducks under the dashboard for protection.

Inside the garage.  CLYDE standing by the car.  He holds the
Browning Automatic.  The garage door is shaking from the
impact of bullets, shattering.  His gun already firing
(automatic clip) before he gets there.  CLYDE in a crouch
runs to the garage door, flings it up, and runs back inside
the car.  Now the door is open and he can get the car out.

                                                           93.


One hand on the wheel, one hand shooting, he rolls the car
out onto the driveway.  The battle is raging from all sides.

EXT. STREET.

The car stops.  CLYDE keeps shooting.  The door of the cabin
flies open and BONNIE and C.W. come charging out, guns
blazing away.  C.W.  fires the Thompson sub-machine gun,
BONNIE fires two pistols with automatic clips.  They run in
a crouch, tryingto get inside the car in front of their door.
They make it.

Camera pans across the motel to the other door.  It opens,
BUCK and BLANCHE come out, holding a double bed mattress in
front of them for protection.  This makes their running
awkward--the mattress is heavy.  BLANCHE carries the front
end, BUCK the back with one hand, the other firing his gun.
They get halfway to the car and then BUCK is hit, shot in
the head.  He falls to the ground; BLANCHE and the mattress
fall too since she has lost balance.  Both are under the
mattress.

CLYDE dashes out of the car and drags BUCK into the back
seat.  BLANCHE follows, hysterical.  All guns on all sides
are still firing.  They fling themselves into the car and
from a standing start, the car starts out at 60 mph down the
driveway.  One of the lawmen stands blocking the way with a
double-barrele rifle, but the car keeps coming, about to run
him down.  He jumps out of the way and fires at the side.
The glass cracks and we see BLANCHE fling a hand to her
face, which is bloody.  A piece of glass has lodged in her
eye.  We hear her scream.  The horn is still blasting.

INT. THE CAR SWERVING MADLY.

CLYDE manages to keep it on the road.  They drive away.

EXT. STREET.

The police run back to their cars to give chase, calling out
to each other, unable to believe that the gang could possibly
have gotten away.

INT. CAR.  NIGHT.

as it is speeding down the highway.  Crazy, mad hillbilly
music on the soundtrack.  Packed inside this car right now
is more sheer human misery and horror than could be believed.
It is hell in there, hell and suffering and pain.  The car
is a complete mess.  C.W. is sobbing.  Everyone is hysterical.
BLANCHE is shrieking with pain and concern for BUCK.  BUCK
is alternating between groaning and passing out completely.
BONNIE is yelling at everybody to shut up.

                                                           94.


Only CLYDE, driving with both hands clenched on the wheel,
is silent.  The car is doing 90.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET.  NIGHT.

The car from the outside, a half hour later.  They have
eluded the police.  They are barreling down the road at top
speed on a nice suburban street with proper homes.  It is
the middle of the night, utter silence.  CLYDE stops the
car, points to ca car in a driveway--it is a beautiful,
shiny new and expensive automobile.  C.W. runs out, runs up
the driveway, peers inside, gets in, quietly backs it down
the driveway and pulls behind the gang's bullet-riddled
getaway car.  Suddenly they both zoom off down the road
together.

INT. OF THE NEW CAR.  NIGHT.

C.W. driving alone.  He is crying, mumbling, wiping his eyes
and nose with one hand while he controls the wheel with the
other.

EXT. RING OF FIRS.  NIGHT.

A wide field in the country.  This is Dexter, Iowa.  It is
quiet.  We see, in a long shot that takes in everything,
that this is a meadow surrounded by a ring of trees, a dense
forest that circles them.  The meadow, however, is large.

The two cars drive into the middle of the field, headlights
on.  They stop and the Barrow gang gets out.  They are in
horrible shape--we can finally have a look at them.  Half-
dressed in their pajamas, bloody, dirty, in tatters.  Those
that can stagger out do so, others are carried.  A far shot
of all this.

Closer shot.  Moving closer to them, we see CLYDE and C.W.
lay BUCK down on the ground.  CLYDE begins to administer to
his wounds as best he can, mostly just wiping him off.  BUCK
is semi-conscious.  All are in a semi-daze.  BLANCHE falls
to her knees, still clutching her eyes.  She is totally
hysterical.

                         BLANCHE
            Oh, God, please help us!  Dear
            Father in Heaven, get us out of
            this and Buck will never do another
            bad thing in his life!
                   (she continues
                   moaning, praying, sobbing)


BONNIE walks over to the group, looking at BUCK, C.W. goes
over to her.  Two shot--BONNIE and C.W.

                                                           95.


                         C.W.
            He ain't got a chance.  Half his
            head blown off.

Camera pulls back to take in BLANCHE.

                         BLANCHE
            My eyes!
                   (she SCREAMS)
            God, I think I'm blind.
                   (in the headlights)
            ...light hurts so bad...

BONNIE walks over to the car and comes back with the
sunglasses BUCK had given BLANCHE.  Moving her out of the
glare, she helps BLANCHE put them on.  BONNIE now has an arm
around BLANCHE, and BLANCHE shivers into BONNIE gracefully.
BONNIE is a little repelled by BLANCHE, but comforts her out
of genuine feeling for her.

                         BLANCHE
                   (clinging)
            Please, please get us to a doctor!
            Tell Clyde to get us to a doctor.
            We'll die here.

                         BONNIE
                   (helping with glasses)
            --here, hon'.

BONNIE looks silently up to CLYDE.  CLYDE is looking dumbly
down at his mangled brother.

                         BLANCHE
                   (going on)
            Clyde, Clyde, please get us to a
            doctor.

Though BLANCHE cannot see it, CLYDE has knelt down to the
side of BUCK, taking BUCK's hand and with his other hand has
begun smoothing BUCK's hair back, away from the wound.

                         BLANCHE
            He's your brother!

                         BONNIE
                   (gently, knowing
                   CLYDE will not and
                   cannot answer BLANCHE)
            Buck can't be moved, now, hon'.

BLANCHE's answer to this is hysterical sobbing, burying
herself into BONNIE, mumbling half-coherent, muffled prayers
between the sobs.

                                                           96.


With BUCK and CLYDE.

                         BUCK
                   (weakly)
            Clyde?...Clyde?...

                         CLYDE
            Right here, boy.

                         BUCK
            I believe I lost my shoes...maybe
            the dog hid 'em...
                   (he lapses into
                   unconsciousness again)


CLYDE has begun to cry a little, continues to smooth back
BUCK's hair with ritualistic regularity.

Wide angle.  Night.  Camera pulls away, way back to wide
shot of the entire field, showing the group in the center of
the darkness, lit by the headlights.

Match dissolve into early dawn, camera still on the wide
shot.  The field is lighter, though the trees still loom
blackly around it.  The two cars, one almost a shattered
wreck, the other bright and shiny and new, are parked in the
center.  The sky is light, but the trees cast a dark shadow
on the field.  The gang is just sitting around.  BLANCHE
weeping next to BUCK, C.W. sitting on the running board of a
car, staring.  BONNIE standing and smoking.  CLYDE still
with BUCK.

All is quiet.

EXT. WOODS.  DAY.

From the edge of the woods, a man in a white shirt emerges
from behind a tree.  The camera swings abruptly to get him.
He calls out to the gang.

                         MAN
            Surrender!

It is a total surprise.  BONNIE, CLYDE and C.W. all grab
their guns and fire several shots; they are not firing the
big guns now, but the pistols.  The man lingers there for a
moment--he looks strange, white, luminous, like an
apparition--and then he vanishes into the woods.  Silence,
long enough to make you think it was perhaps an illusion.

Then there is a volley of gunfire--a noise so large as to be
almost an impossible sound--coming from the woods, all
around, everywhere.

                                                           97.


A ring of little white puffs of smoke emerge from the woods;
from every tree a puff of smoke.  The camera pans in a
circle.  Behind every tree is a man with a gun.  There are
at least 150 people out there--peace officers, farmers with
hunting rifles, kids with squirrel guns, everyone who wanted
to come along and catch BONNIE and CLYDE.  Their number is
so large because this time they want no possibility of the
gang making what seemed by them supernatural escapes.

From this point on, the sound of guns is unnaturally muffled
on the sound track.  We hardly hear them at all..it is like
a dream.

Without a word, all of the gang including the half-dead BUCK
making his final effort, scramble for the nearest car.  They
run, throughout this battle, crouched, like animals--their
only thought, to get away, to escape.  To fight it out would
be ludicrous.

From the moment the Barrows start in motion, there is
shooting again from the edge of the woods.  We see them
scrambling towards the car, in an extreme long shot,
surrounded by the ring of smoke.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. OF THE CAR.

All of them inside.  CLYDE is at the wheel.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT. CAR.

Med. Long shot of the car moving.  The sound track goes to
complete silence.  We see the car looking for an avenue of
escape.  It veers towards a tree, a man steps out from
behind the tree and fires, the car jerks and veers toward
another tree, again a man steps out and fires and so on.
The car performs its eccentric dance, all in utter silence
(no sound of the motor, nothing).  The film should have the
feeling of slow motion, as the car swerves and loops along
the edge of the woods.  Not once do any of the Barrows fire
back.  Another man steps out and aims.

INT. CAR.

Close-up.  CLYDE.  At the wheel-shot in the arm.  He grabs
his arm in pain, loses control of the wheel.

                                            CUT TO:

                                                           98.


EXT. CAR.

--out of control (still silent).  It smashes into a tree
stump.  The picture stops, freezes for three beats.  We hold
the image of the moment of crash, with pieces of metal
crumpling and flying into the air, suspended there by the
stop-film.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. CAR.

Sound partly up again, but never at its realistic volume.
From inside the smashed car, we peer out the window across
the field and see the other car.  The thought strikes the
audience at the same time it strikes the gang--they must get
to that car.

Med. shot of the second car, sitting in the field, shining
in the sun.  The lawmen also realize what must be done--cut
off this escape.  Though BONNIE, CLYDE and the others are
heading toward it, they suddenly train all their fire on the
car rather than the gang.

The car fills the frame of the screen.  Bullets begin to hit
it.  It starts to quiver under the impact.  For the next
minute, we see the car die in front of our eyes.  We see the
beautiful machine fall to pieces--windows smash, tires torn
apart, body riddled.  The death of the car is as painful to
watch as the willful death of a human being.  The execution
is paced deliberately to show the ritualistic tempo of the
destruction.

EXT. WOODS.

The camera pulls back, way back and slightly above everything
to reveal the entire field.  On the left of the screen,
BONNIE, CLYDE and C.W. are scrambling toward the edge of the
woods.  In the center BUCK and BLANCHE have taken cover
behind a fallen log.  In the foreground, police begin to
emerge from the woods.  The camera zooms rapidly in with
them toward BUCK.  BLANCHE is screaming.

                         BLANCHE
            Don't kill him!  Don't kill him!
            He's dying!

BUCK is making a last feeble attempt.  The zoom continues
past BUCK until it comes tight on his hand, a lawman's foot
steps on his hand.  BUCK falls over.  He dies.  BLANCHE
screams.

                         BLANCHE
            Don't die, Daddy.  Don't die!

                                                           99.


She goes berserk.  Five men, one hardly a teen-ager, grab
her and hold her as she writhes and cries.  She is still
wearing the sunglasses.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT. WOODS AND STREAM.  BONNIE, CLYDE, AND C.W.  DAY.

They have reached the edge of the woods.  Camera tracks with
them as they run.  From all around come the sounds of the
posse.  The three get in through the pines and come finally
to a deep stream.  They jump in and start across, running
awkwardly in chest-deep water.  They are half way across
when the police appear on the bank behind them, shooting.

Close-up.  BONNIE.  Day--as she is struggling through the
water.  A bullet hits her in the shoulder.  We must see this
bullet clearly, we must see it go in her flesh so that we
can feel it.

Tight close-up of BONNIE's face as she screams.  It is the
first time she has been hurt, and the scream is pure animal
pain.  She cries out.

EXT. STREAM AND CORNFIELD.  DAY.

CLYDE, who has almost reached the other side, comes back and
gets her.  He drags her out of the water and into a cornfield
that starts growing on the opposite bank, C.W. helping.  He
half-carries half-runs with her into the cornfield, as the
field gets deeper and thicker.

They stop for a second.

                         CLYDE
                   (panting, to Bonnie)
            Saw...saw a farm...up ahead...gotta
            get...a car...

He starts to give over the wounded BONNIE to C.W.

                         BONNIE
            Baby, no...

But CLYDE has not heard this last.  Working on pure
adrenaline now, he struggles onward.  Camera tilts up
slightly so we can see CLYDE as he essays his way toward a
farmhouse with a car in the distance.  After a few moments
he disappears and we can hear only the cracking of the
stalks as that sound too diminishes,

Full shot.  Cornfield.  Day.  Silence.

                                                          100.


Close.  C.W. and BONNIE.  Obviously some time later.  They
both lie prostrate in the field, listening.  C.W. licks his
lips.

                         C.W.
            Maybe--

                         BONNIE
            Shhh!

They wait for another long moment, picking up only the
tiniest sounds.

                         BONNIE
                   (finally)
            Oh, no.

                         C.W.
                   (nervously)
            What?  What?

                         BONNIE
                   (as though it were
                   the most logical
                   thing in the world)
            I can't die without Clyde.  I just
            can't.

C.W. looks at her as if she's gone crazy.  After another
moment the corn begins to tremble, and we hear the o.s.
sound of an approaching car.

With C.W. Day--tentatively lifting his head up to clear the
corn stalks.  With him we see the car looming larger,
bearing down on us, splitting the corn stalks.  The car
finally comes to a stop a few feet in front of C.W.  BONNIE
is on her feet, and CLYDE tumbles out of the car, practically
before it's stopped, sweeping BONNIE into him.  For a moment
both are in their knees a few feet from the running board of
the car, simply holding onto each other and not moving.

                         C.W.
                   (tugging at both of
                   them frantically)
            C'mon!  C'mon!  C'mon!

                                            ABRUPT CUT:

INT. CAR.  ABOUT A HALF HOUR LATER.  DAY.

They have gotten away, but are still escaping.  C.W. is
driving.  He is bare-chested.  CLYDE is beside him in front,
his arm bleeding.  He falls in and out of consciousness.
BONNIE is stretched out in back.

                                                          101.


Her shoulder has been bandaged with C.W.'s shirt.  She is
unconscious.

INT. CAR.  LATE DAY.

CLYDE comes half-awake and looks over at C.W.

                         CLYDE
            Head out, C.W.

                         C.W.
                   (determinedly)
            I'm goin' home to my daddy's farm.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. ROAD WITH CAMPSITE.  THE SAME EVENING.

C.W. is driving down the road, hell for leather.  Nearing a
campsite, where there are about six Okie cars and pick-up
trucks all loaded down, with a number of poor families
seated around a campfire, cooking.  C.W. jams on the brakes.
He gets out, looking totally exhausted.

Reaction shot.  The faces of the Okies, looking at this
sudden presence in their midst.

Back to C.W.

                         C.W.
                   (about to drop)
            Can y'all spare me a little water?

EXT. CAMPSITE.  FULL SHOT.

One man, the leader of the group, dips a cup of water and
approaches C.W. suspiciously.  He comes close enough to make
C.W. reach out for the water, but withholds it from him.

                         MAN
            Who are you, boy?

                         C.W.
            Name's Moss.

This seems to be enough for the man, who gives him the water.
As C.W. gulps it down, the man begins to circle the car,
peering into it suspiciously.  Suddenly he starts and his
eyes open wide.

                         MAN
                   (in really hushed and
                   reverent tones)
            It's Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow.

                                                          102.


He stands there struck dumb, staring.  Those of the others
who have heard him begin to come over.  Without a word they
move quietly to the car and stare in.

INT. CAR.

BONNIE is out in the back seat; CLYDE is semi-conscious in
the front seat.  He looks up through half-closed eyes.

EXT. CAR.

We see a woman pour a bowl of soup at the campfire and bring
it to C.W.  He accepts it.

A man rolls a cigarette and lights it.  Then, very gingerly,
as if afraid to really touch him, he reaches through the
window and places it in CLYDE's lips.  It hangs there, CLYDE
unable to drag on it or remove it.

Children peer through the back window.

C.W. finishes his cup of soup.  He hands it and the cup of
water back to a woman in the crowd.

Quietly, moving together, the Okies step back.  C.W. walks
to the driver's seat, gets in and shuts the door.  He starts
up the car.

The people push a bit closer for a last look.  CLYDE, unable
to do more, nods his head in a barely perceptive gesture by
way of saying "thank you" t ot the people.  The cigarette is
still dangling from his lips.

The car moves off.  A YOUNG BOY pulls on his FATHER's shirt.

                         BOY
            Who was they, Pa?

                         MAN
            That was Bonnie and Clyde, the bank
            robbers.

A woman, nearby, smiles sweetly.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. MOSS FARM.  MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

The car pulls up outside the slightly ramshackle farm of
MALCOLM MOSS, C.W.'s father, in Arcadia, Louisiana.  It
sits, for a moment, in the dark.  Then C.W. honks the horn.
A few seconds pass, and the porch light comes on.  OLD MAN
MOSS comes out in his pajamas and peers into the darkness.
He is a fat man with gray hair.

                                                          103.


                         MALCOLM
            Who's there?

                         C.W.
                   (calling back)
            Daddy?

                         MALCOLM
            Who's there?  Who is it?

                         C.W.
            It's C.W.  It's Clarence.

                         MALCOLM
            Clarence!

He runs down the steps, down the path to his son.  They
greet each other, hugging for a second, looking each other
over.

                         MALCOLM
            God, it's good to see you, boy!

He holds C.W. at arm's length to study him, and suddenly he
scowls at something he sees by the light of the porch.

                         MALCOLM
            What's that on your chest?

                         C.W.
                   (puzzled)
            Huh?
                   (realizing what he means)
            It's a tattoo...I'm in trouble.
            I'll tell you about it later.  My
            friends are hurt.  Help me get 'em
            in.

MALCOLM goes to car and looks inside for a moment.  He walks
back to C.W.

                         MALCOLM
            Jesus, what happened to them?  You
            in trouble, son?

                         C.W.
            Yeah.  That's Clyde Barrow and
            Bonnie Parker.
                   (reaction from Malcolm)
            We been shot.  Help me get 'em
            inside.  We gotta help 'em.

They go to the car and drag the unconscious BONNIE out and
begin carrying her up to the house.

                                                          104.


                         MALCOLM
            Why'd you get yourself marked up?
            A tattoo!  What in hell made you do
            a damn fool thing like that?

They reach the house.

                         C.W.
            C'mon, Pa, open the door.

INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE IN DEXTER.  DAY.

Although the scene begins with a full-screen close-up of a
newspaper clipping with a photo, it is just a blurry-gray,
crowded scene of BLANCHE's capture.  Really impossible to
make anybody out in the crowd.  Camera stays on photo as we
hear voice over of two men talking: a sheriff and his deputy.

                         BILLY
            I was in the bunch that took 'er.
            See here?  Can you make me out?
            Here I am, see here, right behind
            Joe Boyd here.

                         PETE
            Sure enough, Billy, is that your
            head there?

Camera pulls away, BILLY, a young deputy--cold, intense,
humorless and square, carefully folds up the clipping and
puts it in his wallet.

                         BILLY
            Still can't figure how we let them
            other two get away.

                         PETE
                   (an older, more
                   genial type)
            Yeah, seems as how nobody can get
            'em somehow.

                         BILLY
                   (sullen)
            Yeah...well, maybe this boy'll be
            the one to do it, this Hamer guy.
            Boy if he can't do it, Sheriff,
            ain't nobody but the whole U.S.
            Army can do it.

                                                          105.


                         PETE
                   (with a new note of
                   enthusiasm, gets up
                   and walks to the
                   window--turning to Billy)
            You hear he quit the Rangers on
            account of Texas got that woman
            governor.  Said he wouldn't work
            under no woman.

                         BILLY
                   (respectfully)
            Yeah, that's somethin' all right.
            Say, how many they say he shot
            anyway in his day?

                         PETE
            Sixty-five they say.

                         BILLY
            Son of a sea-cook!

The door opens.  We see, full shot and then fast close-up
FRANK HAMER.  It should be a complete shock to the audience--
this is the man kidnapped by the gang earlier and partially
destroyed by BONNIE.

HAMER is dressed in his Ranger outfit and hat, and again he
has that quality of sinister frenzy beneath his calm manner.
His attitude toward these lawmen is sheer condescension,
friendly only out of convention, really superior and
contemptuous of lesser workers in his field.

                         HAMER
                   (with politeness
                   arising from condescension)
            Excuse me, am I in the right place?
            Is this Sheriff Smoot?

PETE and BILLY jump up from the chairs and walk over to
HAMER, hands extended.  They are quite impressed by meeting
in the flesh.

                         PETE
                   (mispronouncing his name)
            Frank Hammer.  I sure am pleased to
            meet you!
                   (shakes his hand)


                         HAMER
            Hamer.

                                                          106.


EXT. MOSS FARM.  CLOSE SHOT NEWSPAPER.  DAY.

A coil of rope snaps into and through the paper, splitting
it and revealing C.W.'s startled face.  CLYDE strides the
porch angrily, snapping the rope.

BONNIE and MALCOLM are seated along with C.W.  Through
BONNIE has her arm supported by a sling and CLYDE has his
shoulder bandagedm it is evident by CLYDE's heady indignation
and BONNIE's attentiveness that both are well on the way to
recovery.

                         CLYDE
                   (still snapping rope)
            FLED?  What do they mean, fled?
            How in the nama God could I leave
            my brother to die when he was
            already dead when I left him?
                   (livid)
            He was shot in too many pieces to
            pick off the ground!  Fled...what
            do they know, the papers or the
            police?...

Suddenly he moves upon MALCOLM with enormous intent, as if
by pounding the point home to the one relative stranger
among them, he will justify it all.  MALCOLM momentarily
flinches, then listens with intense deference.

                         CLYDE
            Why, while we were all lyin' around
            here, near dead, they had us
            holdin' up the Grand Prairie
            National Bank!  They hung that one
            on us just for luck, I guess.

CLYDE shakes his head, still thinking this over.  Abruptly,
to BONNIE, with deadly seriousness:

                         CLYDE
            Tell you what.  Soon's we get well,
            we're gonna take that bank!

He breaks into a wicked grin, but then reels, catching
himself on the porch railing.  He's obviously dizzy from
exertion and anger.  BONNIE starts--then sees CLYDE is in
control.

                         CLYDE
                   (remarking on his own dizziness)
            Whooooooo, boy...
                   (kneeling, to Bonnie)
            They don't know nothin'--do they,
            sugar?

                                                          107.


                         BONNIE
                   (assuring him)
            You did all you could, hon'.
            Nobody coulda done more.

C.W. has been studying hard on the torn paper, b.g.  Suddenly:

                         C.W.
            Hey.  How come I'm always called
            the "Un-identified sus-spect?"

Group shot.  Porch.  C.W. has trouble with this last phrase.
BONNIE laughs.  This picks up CLYDE's spirits once more.

                         CLYDE
                   (to C.W.)
            You can just thank your lucky stars
            that's all you are.  So long's they
            don't have your last name, you're
            home safe.

                         MALCOLM
                   (toadying to Clyde,
                   talking to Clarence)
            Mr. Barrow's lookin' out for your
            interests, boy.

                         C.W.
                   (impressed)
            Oh...Hey, Pa, how you like havin' a
            coupla big deals stayin' with you?

                         MALCOLM
                   (friendly as can be)
            Ain't that somethin' for me?

                         CLYDE
                   (back in good mood, expansive)
            Well now, you been real nice to us,
            and I tell you what, let us pay you
            forty dollars for your hospitality,
            what do you say?

                         MALCOLM
                   (protesting vehemently)
            No, no, no.  I don't want your
            money.  I'm just pleased to have
            your company.  Any friend of my
            boy's...

                         C.W.
                   (abruptly)
            Hey, Pa, let's have supper.  I'm
            hungry.

                                                          108.


                         MALCOLM
                   (smiling)
            Yeah...okay, Clarence...
                   (to Clyde)
            You're welcome here, now you know
            that.

INT. MOSS HOUSE.

They go into the house.  Camera goes with them.  As soon as
they are out of earshot from BONNIE and CLYDE, MALCOLM turns
on C.W. displaying an entirely different demeanor from the
one he presented outside.

                         MALCOLM
                   (indicating tatto
                   which flutters
                   through C.W.'s open shirt)
            You look like trash, boy, marked up
            like that.  Cheap trash.

                         C.W.
                   (protesting)
            Bonnie says it looks good.

                         MALCOLM
            Bonnie, what does she know.  She's
            just cheap trash herself.  Look
            what they do to you, and you don't
            even get your name in the paper--
            just pictures put on your skin, by
            "Bonnie and Clyde"--
                   (more to himself)
            --why they're a coupla kids.

                         C.W.
            But, Daddy--

                         MALCOLM
            I'm just glad your ma ain't alive
            to see that thing.

C.W. peeks at it, peering down at his chest, trying to bring
the bluebirds into focus, puzzled.

                         C.W.
            I don't see what's so bad about it...

INT. HOSPITAL.  MED. SHOT OF THE ROOM.

Seated in a soft chair, looking directly at us, is BLANCHE
BARROW.  Her eyes are completely covered with a white
bandage.  She wears a hospital gown.  The room is white and
bright.

                                                          109.


Med. shot.  HAMER in the doorway.  The nurse leaves.  He
reaches in his pocket and pulls out a white handkerchief.
He puts it over his mouth to disguise his voice, afraid she
will remember it from the kidnap.  Quietly, almost on
tiptoes, HAMER walks over to BLANCHE.  He gets inches away
from her face.  She still doesn't know he is there.

                         HAMER
                   (quietly, but
                   suddenly, his voice
                   muffled by the handkerchief)
            Blanche Barrow.

She starts to her feet, then adjusts to his presence.  She
is a bit panicked.  BLANCHE is now a defeated human being.
Her voice and manner bespeak great weariness, sorrow and
still a touch of her old high-strung hysteria.  But most of
that is gone now, like everything else that was really vital
in her life.

                         BLANCHE
            What?  What?  Who is it?

                         HAMER
                   (in a monotone, a
                   relentless questioner)
            You know your husband's dead.

                         BLANCHE
                   (her voice flat and expressionless)
            I know.

                         HAMER
            You're going to prison.

                         BLANCHE
            I know it.

                         HAMER
            Where's the rest of 'em?

                         BLANCHE
            I don't know.

                         HAMER
            Where's the rest of 'em?

                         BLANCHE
            I just don't know.  I don't know.

                         HAMER
            How'd you get in with them?

                                                          110.


                         BLANCHE
                   (starting slow, but
                   warming up to the
                   subject, she begins
                   to talk and talk for
                   the sake of airing
                   her troubles)
            I didn't mean to.  I didn't.  Buck
            said we was just goin' to visit, we
            wouldn't be doin' no robbin' and
            stealin', and then we went to
            Joplin and all of a sudden they
            started shootin'.
                   (hysteria begins to
                   creep into her voice
                   as she relives it all)
            And we run off, God, I was scared.
            And then it was run all the time,
            and I wanted to go, I begged to go,
            but Clyde and Bonnie and C.W.--

                         HAMER
                   (seizing on it)
            C.W.  C.W. who?

                         BLANCHE
            C.W. Moss.

                                            FADE OUT:

FADE IN:

EXT. CAR ON THE MOSS FARM.  A DIRT PATH NEAR THE BARN.  DAY.

It is pouring rain, middle of the afternoon, BONNIE and
CLYDE are inside the car, sitting.  They have lived so much
in cars that they tend to still spend much of their time in
it rather than in a room.  There they are themselves.

INT. CAR.

BONNIE is in the back seat, her legs wrapped in a plaid
blanket, writing poetry.  She looks like Elizabeth Barrett
Browning.  With one essential difference--her arm is in a
sling and she is wearing bandages on the shoulder.  CLYDE is
in the front seat, reading a newspaper.  He is also partially
bandaged.  On the dashboard is a box of ginger-snaps which
he eats while he reads.  They look domestic.

                         CLYDE
            Want a ginger-snap, Bonnie?

                                                          111.


                         BONNIE
                   (busy, absorbed)
            No, hum-umm.
                   (then she realizes
                   his nice gesture and
                   smiles warmly at him)
            But thanks anyway, Clyde.
                   (she takes it all in,
                   her situation, and
                   looks content and cozy)
            It's real nice here, just the two
            of us like this.

                         CLYDE
                   (more interested in
                   his paper)
            Uh-huh.
                   (something in the
                   paper catches his interest)
            Look here, honey, remember this?

He holds up the paper; there is one of the photos from the
motel, the one showing BONNIE smoking.  She looks up at it
with mild interest.

                         BONNIE
            Yeah, at the motel.

                         CLYDE
                   (studying the picture)
            You sure don't resemble that no more.

Close-up BONNIE.  She doesn't.  She has become totally
fragile, the essence of herself.  She is writing on a pad.

CLYDE and BONNIE.

                         CLYDE
            What you writin' this time?

                         BONNIE
                   (intensely)
            I'm writing a poem about us.  I'm
            writing our story.

                         CLYDE
                   (this appeals to his ego)
            Oh, are you?  Let's hear it.  If
            it's good, I'll mail it in to the
            Law and it'll be printed in all the
            papers again.

                         BONNIE
            Just let me finish this line.

                                                          112.


She does so.  CLYDE munches a cookie.

                         BONNIE
                   (continuing)
            Okay, here it is.

Close-up.  BONNIE--as she reads intensely.  At the beginning
of this montage, the camera remains on her face.  Behind her
we see the rain on the window.

                         BONNIE
                   (reading)
            "The Story of Bonnie and Clyde"

            You've heard the story of Jesse
            James--
            Of how he lived and died:
            If you're still in need
            Of something to read
            Here's the story of Bonnie and
            Clyde.

            Now Bonnie and Clyde are the Barrow
            Gang
            I'm sure you all have read
            How they rob and steal
            And those who squeal
            Are usually found dying or dead.

            They call them cold-hearted killers;
            They say they are heartless and
            mean;
            But I say this with pride,
            That I once knew Clyde
            When he was honest and upright and
            clean.

            But the laws fooled around,
            Kept taking him down
            And locking him in a cell,
            Till he said to me,
            "I'll never be free
            So I'll meet a few of them in
            hell."

            The road was so dimly lighted;
            There were no highway signs to
            guide;
            But they made up their minds
            If all roads were blind,
            They wouldn't give up till they died.

                                            CUT TO:

                                                          113.


INT. POLICE STATION.  DAY.

The manuscript is lying on the police blotter.  HAMER picks
it up and continues reading it.  He reads it in a halting
way:

                         HAMER
            The road gets dimmer and dimmer;
            Sometimes you can hardly see;
            But it's fight man to man,
            And do all you can,
            For they know they can never be
            free.

            From heartbreak some people have
            suffered;
            From weariness some people have
            died;
            But take it all in all,
            Our troubles are small,
            Till we get like Bonnie and Clyde.

Close-up of a newspaper page.  The poem is printed all the
way down the length of one column.  On the sound track,
BONNIE's voice picks up the recitation:

                         BONNIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
            If a policeman is killed in Dallas,
            And they have no clue or guide;
            If they can't find a fiend,
            They just wipe their slate clean
            And hang it on Bonnie and Clyde.

INT. CAR.  CLOSE-UP OF BONNIE.  DAY.

The day is sunny and we see it through the car window.  She
continues reading, but now she reads it directly from the
newspaper:

                         BONNIE
            If they try to act like citizens
            And rent them a nice little flat
            About the third night
            They're invited to fight
            By a sub-gun's rat-tat-tat.

            Some day they'll go down together;
            They'll bury them side by side;
            To few it'll be grief--
            To the law a relief--
            But it's death for Bonnie and Clyde.

                                                          114.


BONNIE finishes the poem, as camera pulls back slightly to
show that it is a different day, different clothes and the
bandages are gone.  As she stops, she has an expectant and
somewhat self-satisfied look.

Close-up of CLYDE.  His eyes are wide, his mouth open, his
face shows surprise and delight and he is on the verge of a
giant laugh.

                         CLYDE
                   (in gleeful wonder)
            Damn!  That's me!

A great laugh comes bursting from him.  Camera widens to
take in BONNIE.  She is both startled and delighted by his
response.

                         CLYDE
                   (continuing)
            In that poem!

BONNIE giggles.

                         CLYDE
                   (continuing; it is
                   all starting to come
                   out now--his
                   realization that he
                   has made it, that he
                   is the stuff of
                   legend, that he is an
                   important figure)
            A sub-gun's rat-tat-tat!
                   (he begins to laugh loudly)
            Right in the paper!

Close-up BONNIE.  Now laughing too, with a great feeling of
joy.

Two shot.  BONNIE and CLYDE.

                         CLYDE
            Jesse James!  You hear 'bout old
            Jesse, now you goin' to hear 'bout
            Clyde!

He puffs up with air and explodes like a steam valve.

                         CLYDE
                   (continuing)
            Pshhhhhh!

He grabs BONNIE and chuckles delightedly.

                                                          115.


                         CLYDE
                   (continuing)
            Damn, Bonnie!  You musta been one
            hell of a waitress!

Close-up.  BONNIE--laughing, her eyes filled with tears.
CLYDE's hand wipes them away.

Two shot.

                         CLYDE
                   (shaking his head
                   back and forth like a
                   puppy, just so much
                   glee in him that he
                   can't hold it)
            Oooooh, that Clyde!  That's my boy,
            that Clyde!

He looks at her with love and delight, hugs her tightly.

                         CLYDE
            Bonnie...
                   (she hugs him back)
            The Poem of Bonnie and Clyde!

                         BONNIE
                   (laughing at the
                   mistake, happy)
            The Story.

                         CLYDE
            The Story of Bonnie and Clyde!  Oh,
            child, you really did tell that
            story!

He pulls her to him, his face inches away from hers, about
to kiss her.  She is waiting, expecting... Suddenly, he lets
out one wild laugh almost into her mouth.

He kisses her.  She kisses back.  They are chuckling,
giggling.  They grow more ardent; they pull back and laugh
again.  They begin to make love.

EXT. ARCADIA STREET.  ICE CREAM PARLOR.  DAY.

Bright afternoon.  Camera across the street from an ice
cream parlor.  Sign about it: "EVA'S HAND-PACKED ICE CREAM."
A large plate glass window fronts the store, and through it
we can see the people inside seated at tables and booths.
Prominent in our vision is MALCOLM MOSS, seated, facing
camera.  He is seated across from another man, but we see
him from the back.

                                                          116.


MALCOLM is obviously doing a lot of talking and then some
hard listening; gesticulating and looking disturbed.  After
a bit of this, he rises from the table and begins walking
toward the door.  The other man rises and turns.  We now see
that it is FRANK HAMER.

MALCOLM and HAMER come out onto the sidewalk, squinting in
the sunlight.  MALCOLM mimes some social pleasantries by way
of saying "goodbye," but HAMER's face shows no emotion of
recognition of the gesture.  He turns and walks away,
walking out of the frame.

MALCOLM stands where he is, in front of the ice cream parlor.
By the expression on his face, we can see that he is rather
disturbed by what he has heard and that he is still grappling
with the problem.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

BONNIE and CLYDE.  They lie where they were with one
difference--they are now wrapped in the blanket.  CLYDE's
pants are wadded up and tangled with his shoes at the base
of the blanket.

                         CLYDE
                   (chuckling, apparently
                   quite pleased)
            Damn!...damn...damn!

He casts a sidelong glance to BONNIE, wanting some sort of
overt reaction from her.  She's just smiling slightly.
CLYDE's underlying anxiety begins to surface.

                         CLYDE
                   (not looking at her)
            Hey, listen, Bonnie, how do you feel?

                         BONNIE
                   (watching him
                   steadily, her slight
                   smile growing)
            Fine.

                         CLYDE
            I mean you feel like you're s'posed
            to feel after you've uh...

                         BONNIE
            Just.

                                                          117.


                         CLYDE
                   (doesn't know what
                   the fuck to say,
                   desperately wants her approval)
            Well, that's good, ain't it.
            Reason I ask is, I uh... Well, I
            figger it's a good idea to ask.  I
            mean how else do I tell if I did it
            the way...

                         BONNIE
                   (stopping him, with
                   great warmth)
            Hey.  You done just perfect.

CLYDE looks at her for the first time, tremendously relieved.
He can see she means it.  Now his buoyancy, utterly,
unchained breaks through:

                         CLYDE
            I did, didn't I?  I mean I did, I
            really did.  I did it, I did, I
            mean this was my first time and it
            was just like rollin' off a log
            when it comes right down to it, it
            was easy, I mean I didn't even have
            to try...

Lovingly, laughing, altogether overwhelmed with himself,
CLYDE pulls BONNIE into him.  He kisses her, wants to make
love again, but then pulls back and keeps chattering at
sixty miles a minute.  He's waited twenty-three years to
talk about this, and he's got the perfect audience.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

INT. KITCHEN.  MOSS FARM.  TWILIGHT.

After dinner.  There are four empty plates, but only C.W.
and MALCOLM in the kitchen.  C.W. is scraping the bottom of
a wilted "EVA'S HAND-PACKED ICE CREAM" carton.  MALCOLM
studies his son's quiet intensity in this direction for a
moment, then moves very close, whispers when he speaks.

                         MALCOLM
                   (whispering)
            Boy, they expect you to go downtown
            with 'em tomorrow?

                         C.W.
                   (out loud, licking
                   his ice cream)
            Who?

                                                          118.


                         MALCOLM
                   (raising his own
                   voice, infuriated by
                   his son's obtuseness)
            Bonnie and Clyde!...
                   (he slaps the carton
                   out of C.W.'s hands;
                   whispering again)
            Bonnie and Clyde.

                         C.W.
            Sure, I always go with them.

MALCOLM thinks hard about this.

                         MALCOLM
            ...better go then, you better go,
            better go...
                   (forcing C.W. to sit
                   at table)
            --but when they get back in the car
            to come on home, don't get in with
            them.

                         C.W.
                   (genuinely puzzled)
            Why, Daddy?

                         MALCOLM
            You just listen to your Pa fer once!
            Cain't you do that?  I'm yore
            Daddy, I'm your kin, not Clyde.

                         C.W.
                   (still confused)
            Well, what should I tell 'em? "I
            can't get back in the car with you?"

MALCOLM is ready to kill--his son's obtuseness and his fear
of CLYDE is whipping him into a quiet frenzy.

                         MALCOLM
                   (squeezing C.W.'s arm)
            No, you tell them nothin', hear?
                   (hesitates, then)
            I made a deal and got you off with
            a coupla years!

                         C.W.
                   (a piercing treble)
            Made a deal with who, Daddy?

                                                          119.


MALCOLM hauls off and whacks C.W. across the top of his head
with the flat of his hand, then momentarily holds his hand
over C.W's mouth.

                         MALCOLM
                   (we can see his own fear)
            ...the law.  Just don't get back in
            that car.
                   (eyeball to eyeball)
            And whatever you do, don't let onto
            them, hear?

C.W. suddenly smiles, as if he knew something.

                         C.W.
                   (expletive)
            Whew!... You think them laws are
            gonna catch Bonnie and Clyde in town?

C.W. returns to the ice cream carton--MALCOLM lets him,
figuring he better find out what he can.

                         MALCOLM
            What do you think, Clarence?

                         C.W.
                   (matter of fact)
            They ain't gonna catch 'em.  Don't
            matter whether I let on or not.

                         MALCOLM
                   (playing along)
            Mebbe.  Just you be off'n the
            streets of that town when they go
            to get in their car.

                         C.W.
                   (looking directly at Malcolm)
            Nobody catches Clyde.  Clyde's got
            a sense, don't you know that, Daddy?
            Nobody catches Clyde.

MALCOLM knows better, but for just a moment he stares at his
son, fearing that maybe C.W., for all his limitations, has a
sense about CLYDE's sense.  C.W. has finished with the
carton and crumples it, licking the last remnants of cream
off his fingers.

INT. BEDROOM.  MOSS FARM.  NIGHT.

BONNIE and CLYDE's bedroom, the middle of that night.  Both
are wide awake, lying on opposite sides of the double bed.
Both are staring into the night, disquiet.

                                                          120.


                         CLYDE
                   (suddenly)
            Bonnie?  Bonnie, will you marry me?

There is a silent gasp from BONNIE, a barely perceptible
stiffening.  Then she talks in a voice falsely formal, still
staring up at the ceiling.

                         BONNIE
            How could I do that, Clyde?  You
            know it's impossible.  We'd have to
            go to a Justice of the Peace and
            the Justice of the Peace is a
            lawman.  We couldn't even take out
            a license.

                         CLYDE
                   (with a chuckle)
            Hey now, you sound like you been
            givin' it some thought on your own.

                         BONNIE
                   (with a grim irony,
                   her voice getting
                   more and more emotional)
            Oh no, I never gave it thought.  I
            haven't thought about it at least
            ten times a day, I haven't thought
            about it every minute of my life
            since I met you.
                   (suddenly her voice
                   cracks into tears)


She flings herself violently across the bed and buries
herself into CLYDE's chest, her knees drawn up, her head
tucked down into him, her body shaking with sobs.

                         CLYDE
                   (a bit startled by
                   this, attempting to
                   hold her, awkwardly,
                   and placate her.  He
                   puts his arm around her)
            Bonnie...are you crying, honey?

BONNIE nods yes and slowly gets control over her tears.

                         BONNIE
                   (her face still
                   buried in CLYDE's
                   chest, she whispers)
            Clyde, why do you want to marry me?

                                                          121.


CLYDE thinks a minute and then grins.

                         CLYDE
                   (in an attempt to be humorous)
            To make an honest woman out of you.

BONNIE is silent.

                         BONNIE
                   (finally, in a voice
                   charged with
                   anticipation and dream)
            Clyde...what would you do, what
            would you do it some miracle
            happened and we could walk out
            tomorrow morning and start all over
            again, clean, with no record, with
            nobody after us?

CLYDE thinks about it a minute.

                         CLYDE
            Well...I guess I'd do it all
            different.  First off, I wouldn't
            live in the same state where we
            pull our jobs.  We'd live in one
            state and stay clean there, and
            when we wanted to take a bank, we'd
            go to another state...and...

Suddenly he realizes that he has said the worst thing he
could have, that it was not the answer BONNIE wanted to hear.
He looks down at her, his voice anxious.

                         CLYDE
                   (continuing)
            Bonnie?

She is silent.

                         CLYDE
            Hey, Bonnie?

But she does not answer.

EXT. ROADSIDE.  EARLY MORNING.

We see MALCOLM jacking up the back wheel of his pickup truck
which is parked on the side of the road in a wooded area.

                                            CUT TO:

                                                          122.


EXT. ARCADIA STREET.  MID-MORNING.

A street in Arcadia.  The car is parked.  BONNIE and CLYDE
walks toward the car carrying big bags of groceries and
supplies and put them inside.

                         CLYDE
                   (looking around)
            What happened to C.W.?

                         BONNIE
            He stopped off in that hardware
            store to get light bulbs for his
            daddy.

CLYDE opens the door of the driver's seat and sits down.

INT. CAR.  ARCADIA STREET.  DAY.

                         CLYDE
            Boy, my feet are sweatin'.

He takes off his shoes.

                         BONNIE
                   (kidding around)
            You plannin' to drive with your
            shoes off?

                         CLYDE
            Sure, why not?

He reaches in his shirt pocket and takes out his sunglasses.
As he goes to put them on, one of the lenses falls out.

                         CLYDE
            Damn!

He puts them on.

                         BONNIE
                   (laughing)
            You gonna wear 'em?

                         CLYDE
            Sure, drive with one eye shut.

BONNIE gets in the car, rummages around in one of the bags
and pulls out something wrapped in tissue paper.  She
unwraps it and puts it up on the dashboard, displaying it.
It is a little porcelain shepherdess holding a crook in her
hand, worth about thirty cents.

                                                          123.


                         BONNIE
                   (admiring it)
            Isn't that the prettiest thing, hon?
            Just look here, you can see every
            little fingernail on her hands.

She shows him.

                         CLYDE
            It is a pretty thing, honey.

CLYDE turns on the radio and gets some hillbilly music.
They are singing "Little Church in the Valley."  He beats
time on the steering wheel, getting a little impatient.
BONNIE puts her shepherdess away and begins looking in the
grocery sack.

                         BONNIE
            We got any peaches?  I sure could
            go for a peach right now.

She burrows in the bag and comes out with a peach.  She
takes a big bite.  The juice drips down the side of her
mouth.  She looks beautiful.

                         CLYDE
                   (he stops drumming
                   his fingers, suddenly
                   has an idea)
            Whyn't we do it tomorrow?

                         BONNIE
            Do what?

                         CLYDE
            Tomorrow's Sunday, ain't it?  We
            could drive all night and be on
            that golf course tomorrow morning!

                         BONNIE
            You sure you feel up to it?

                         CLYDE
                   (enthused)
            Yeah, why not?
                   (now feeling anxious
                   and excited, he is
                   impatient to move)
            Where is that boy?  He's gone too
            long.

                                                          124.


                         BONNIE
                   (humming to the radio)
            He'll be here.
                   (holding the peach to him)
            You take a bite, hon.

                         CLYDE
                   (getting worried)
            No, it's takin' too long.  What if
            something happened?

                         BONNIE
            Nothin' happened.

                         CLYDE
                   (more urgently)
            Go take a look, see what's keepin'
            him.

Not too delighted with the chore, BONNIE goes off.  We
remain with CLYDE, getting anxious.  The music plays on.
BONNIE comes back, hurriedly, now anxious herself.

                         BONNIE
            He ain't there.

CLYDE jumps into action, slams his door.

                         CLYDE
            C'mon, let's go.

BONNIE gets in.  They drive off.

INT. STORE.  CLOSE-UP C.W.  DAY.

--hiding inside a store, peering out through a curtained
window at them driving away.  His expression is disturbed;
his face half in shadow.

EXT. ROAD.  DAY.

BONNIE and CLYDE's car coming down the road.  Camera sees
from CLYDE's P.O.V.  MALCOLM standing in the road, waving
him down.  The pickup truck, its back jacked up, is parked
beside him on a shoulder of the road.

INT. CAR.  DAY.

                         BONNIE
            What's wrong?

                         CLYDE
            I don't know.

                                                          125.


EXT. ROAD.

CLYDE reaches the spot, pulls off the road and stops the car.
He gets out.  Camera pulls back.  CLYDE talks to the old
man, BONNIE stays in the car.  Cut to a shut down the trench
of the law, tense.

Suddenly, a truck loaded with chickens comes riding down the
road from the opposite direction.  HAMER sees it from a long
way away and realizes that he cannot afford to let anything
pass between him and his quarry.  He decides the time is now.
He leaps up from the trench and yells at CLYDE.

                         HAMER
            Barrow!

The OLD MAN dives under his truck to hide.  The shooting
starts.

We see the chicken truck.  Two men in the front seat.  They
see ahead of them an incredible shooting match and, in
terror, they jam on the brakes and leap out of the truck.
They run as fast as they can into the meadow, away from the
trouble.

The gun fight takes just seconds during which law fires
eight-seven shots at BONNIE and CLYDE, giving them absolutely
no chance.  The sound is rapid, deafening.

At no point in the gun fight do we see BONNIE and CLYDE in
motion.  We see, instead, two still photographs cut into the
sequence: one of Clyde, half out of the car, taking careful
dead aim with his gun, just as he did in the teaching scene:
one of BONNIE, in terror, a pack of cigarettes in her hand
clutched tight, looking as fragile and beautiful as she can
be.

The noise stops at once.  Utter silence.  It has been a
massacre.  BONNIE and CLYDE never had a chance to return the
gunfire.  We see the car, a complete shambles.  We never see
BONNIE and CLYDE dead, though for a moment we discern their
bodies slumped in the car.

The camera pulls above the car until it is on a level with
the opposite side of the road.  Then, slowly, the six lawmen
stand up in the trench.  On the faces of the five deputies,
horror and shock at what they have just done.  HAMER,
however, registers no emotion.  His face is a blank.  He
lights a cigarette.  Slowly, slowly, the five men begin to
edge closer to the car to see the result.  Music, the wild
country breakdown music, begins on the sound track.

                                                          126.


Before they reach the car, the camera swings away from them,
past them, and zooms out and above into the meadow where the
two truck drivers are standing--tiny, distant figures.

The truck drivers begin to walk toward the camera, coming
back to the road to see what happened.  They get closer and
closer to the camera until they have reached a middle
distance and, as they continue to walk at us, it is--

                           THE END

                                            CUT TO BLACK.

                                                          First Draft


          EXT JERSEY CITY- DAY
          
          Dec 21st. Clear sky, snow on the ground. Cold as fuck. With
          the sounds of laughter and music, we MOVE IN ON:
          
          
          INT NEWSPAPER OFFICE- DAY
          
          An office Xmas party in progress, not a pretty sight: tipsy
          receptionists laugh and spill drinks on the rug, red-faced
          reporters loosen their belts and burp cocktail weiners...
          
          MOVING QUICKLY THROUGH THE PARTY TO AN OPEN OFFICE DOOR.
          Arriving just in time for the door to SLAM in our face.
          
          
          INT OFFICE- DAY
          
          A woman stomps back over to her desk and picks up her pen.
          MEET CASSIDY DALEY (dirty blond, striking, manic energy). Ink-
          stained fingers, notepads in every pocket: Cass doesn't have
          time for office parties, she's working.
          
          Her door cracks open and STEWART (almost as good looking as
          he thinks he is) appears, holding a Kahlua bottle.
          
                              CASS
                    I'm working, Stewart.
          
                              STEWART
                    Come on, take a break. (enticing)
                    I've got Kahlua...
          
          Cass picks up a stapler and LAUNCHES it at Stewart's head.
          Stewart DUCKS OUT just in time. The phone rings. Answering:
          
                              CASS
                    Cassidy Daley. Talk to me.
          
                              JIMMY (O.S.)
                    It's Jimmy. Tell me you love me.
          
                              CASS
                    Depends on what you got.
          
                              JIMMY (O.S.)
                    I've got a confirmed place and
                    time.
          
          Cass is on her feet, excited.

                    You think I'm gonna say this shit
                    over the phone? I could get killed.
                    Just meet me at the usual place.
                    Oh, and Cass? This one's gonna cost
                    an extra hundred.
          
          CLICK. He hangs up. Cass drops the phone, grabs her stuff.

                    Where ya going?

                    Please. Nobody goes there for the

          Stewart considers this, then hands her 5 20's.
          
                              STEWART
                    Now are you gonna let me in on it?

                    Sorry. No can do. I have to protect

                    You know what? We need to talk
                    about our relationship.
          
                              CASS
                    We don't have a relationship. We
                    made out 3 years ago in the copy
                    room. I was drunk. I was broken-
                    hearted. I would have made out with
                    the xerox machine.
          
                              STEWART
                    Yes, but you made out with me.
          
                              CASS
                    I have to go.

          car, rolling a cigarette while he waits for Cass.
          
          Jimmy puts the cigarette in his mouth and pulls out a
          lighter. Just as he flips the lighter open, HIS FRONT
          WINDSHIELD EXPLODES. A MAN HOLDING A TIRE IRON (MAHLER,
          heavyset, crew-cut, rarely speaks, all business) reaches
          through the broken window, AND DRAGS JIMMY OUT OF THE CAR...

          She realizes he is not in the car. THEN SHE SEES THE BROKEN

          GAS. Her car leaps into the intersection. SIRENS.

          Cass looks into her rearview mirror: A PATROL CAR IS RIGHT
          BEHIND HER, signalling for her to pull over. Up ahead, the
          Chevy is getting away.
          
          Cass debates: pull over? Or follow the story? No contest. SHE

          hair, looks like he slept on the floor. The bartender
          (CRYSTAL, 50's, Eastern European) scowls at him:
          
                              CRYSTAL
                    What did I say about the fires?

                    You said "please set fires in my
                    bar". Wait, no, that's not right.
                    "Please don't set fires in my bar".

          boys choir singing "Joy to the World", the kids dressed like
          orphans that escaped a Broadway musical.
          
          A beautiful scene, if you like that sort of thing.
          
          RACK TO- the Cadillac, half a block away, cruising sideways
          into a spot just beneath a "TEMPORARY TOW-AWAY" sign. MILO
          climbs out of the car. Shoves his way through the crowd to
          the curb, cracking open a can of Pabst.
          
          Milo does not like this sort of thing. He scans the crowd
          impatiently.
          
          Meanwhile, THE CAR THAT WAS FOLLOWING HIM parks half a block
          away. DWIGHT emerges and heads for:
          
          MILO, who has just found what he's looking for. The reindeer
          are passing him and he makes eye contact with RUDOLPH, who
          does a double-take.
          
                              MILO
                    Yeah, you. Rudolph. Come here, you
                    fucking ding-dong.
          
          Milo takes a step towards Rudolph and DWIGHT APPEARS IN
          MILO'S PATH, BLOCKING HIM.
          
                              DWIGHT

                    Hey, I owe everybody money.
          
          Suddenly, DWIGHT PUNCHES MILO IN THE GUT. Milo doubles-up,
          gasping, then BRINGS HIS HEAD UP QUICK, CATCHING DWIGHT ON
          THE CHIN. Dwight goes flying sideways and MEETS A POLICE
          BARRIER FACE-FIRST. Ouch.
          
          The barrier tips over, knocking over the one next to it. THE
          REST GO LIKE DOMINOS. Milo turns to see that RUDOLPH HAS
          DISAPPEARED. Then he catches sight of the ANTLERS, working
          their way through the crowd. Milo lunges after him and
          Rudolph drags other reindeer with him as he tries to avoid
          Milo. THE SLEIGH FLIPS. Santa tumbles from the sled. PACKAGES
          RAIN DOWN ON REINDEER LIKE SHRAPNEL.
          
          All of a sudden, IT'S THE XMAS FROM HELL: BLOODY REINDEER
          STUMBLING AROUND, SANTA UNCONSCIOUS IN THE GUTTER, KIDS
          SCREAMING, PARENTS PANICKING. Meanwhile, MILO IS GAINING ON
          RUDOLPH, who picks up one of the packages and throws it. IT
          CRACKS MILO IN THE HEAD. Just what Milo has been waiting for:
          
                              MILO
                        (BEAMING)
                    I am so happy you did that.
          
          Milo TACKLES RUDOLPH TO THE GROUND. Around them, people
          scream and scatter. One boy bursts into tears:
          
                              BOY
                    That man is killing Rudolph!
          
          SIRENS. Uh-oh. Cops SWARM the scene, surrounding Milo and
          Rudolph, GUNS DRAWN. The LEAD COP (GELMAN, short, over-
          zealous) steps forward:
          
                              GELMAN
                    Release the reindeer!
          
          Release the reindeer? Milo looks around. He's got 8 or so
          guns pointed his way and Rudolph gasping at his feet. MILO
          STARTS TO LAUGH. Gelman bristles:
          
                              GELMAN

                    doing my job.
          
          Milo flashes his ID. Gelman inspects it, rolls his eyes.

                    So I can be like you patrol boys
                    and sit around all day with my

                    What did you just say?
          
          Suddenly, a sergeant (BOBBY, late 30's, obnoxious but
          likeable, Milo's ex-partner) marches onto the scene, takes
          one look at Milo and laughs.

                              BOBBY
                    Yeah. I know this asshole. Guy used
                    to be one of us.

          EXT STREET- MOMENTS LATER
          
          Milo drags Rudolph through the crowd towards his car. Bobby
          follows, shaking his head, bemused expression on his face.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Look, Milo, I know this is a tough
                    time of year for you...
          
                              MILO
                    This isn't a tough time of year for
                    me. It's Christmas. Who doesn't
                    love Christmas?
          
                              BOBBY
                    ...and I try to be sensitive to
                    your situation...
          
                                                                    9.
          
          
                              MILO
                    What situation? Being a man who
                    works his own hours and has his
                    freedom and lives the high life?
          
                              BOBBY
                    ...because I realize you're
                    unhappy.
          
                              MILO
                    Unhappy? Are you kidding me, Bob?
                    Look at me: I'm the happiest man
                    alive.
          
          Just then, they come to where Milo left his car. IT'S GONE.
          Bobby squints at the huge "TOW-AWAY" sign:
          
                              BOBBY
                    That sign is pretty hard to see.
          
          And with that, Milo loses it:
          
                              MILO
                    AAAHHH!
          
          He rips the sign off the pole. Stomps on it. Kicks it. Tries
          to shred it with his teeth. Hmm. He doesn't really seem like
          the happiest man alive. Rudolph, to Bobby:
          
                              RUDOLPH
                    Take me to jail. Please?
          
          
          INT BOBBY'S CAR- EARLY EVENING
          
          Bobby's car is decorated with photos of his many children,
          all of whom look exactly like him, even the girls, poor kids.
          
          Milo's in front by Bobby, Rudolph's handcuffed in the back.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Ok, I got one for ya: why doesn't
                    Santa have any children? Cause he
                    only comes once a year and when he
                    does, it's down a chimney.
          
          Rudolph snickers. Milo does not. Bobby glances at Milo.
          
                              BOBBY
                    So. Have you talked to her lately?
          
                              MILO
                    Talked to who?
          
                                                                  10.

                    Katie Couric, motherfucker, who do
                    you think?
          
                              MILO
                    I haven't talked to her in three
                    years, why would I talk to her now?
          
                              BOBBY
                    Well, for one thing, so you can
                    stop taking out your rage on
                    innocent bystanders.
          
                              RUDOLPH
                        (piping up from the back)
                    Talk to her, man. For real.
          
          Milo reaches back, gags Rudolph with his own scarf.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Do what you want. But this kind of
                    shit will eat a hole in your
                    intestines, you don't deal with it.
          
          
          EXT POLICE STATION/JERSEY CITY- EARLY EVENING
          
          They pull up. Milo exits the car, pulls Rudolph from the
          back. Bobby leans out.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Hey, why don't you come by the
                    precinct tomorrow for our Xmas
                    bash?
          
                              MILO
                    I'm not invited. I'm not a cop
                    anymore, remember?
          
                              BOBBY
                    Fuck that, I'm inviting you.
          
                              MILO
                    I don't know, Bob. I'm sorta busy.
          
                              BOBBY
                    That's what I'm worried about.
                    (sighing) Just...take it easy, Ok?
          
          Bobby really seems worried, but Milo waves him off. Bobby
          drives over, parks by other cop cars. Gets out, mingles with
          some cops. Laughter, inside jokes. Milo watches from afar.
          
                                                                   11.

                              MILO
                    Do I look like I need advice from a
                    grown man in antlers?
          
          Milo gags Rudolph and drags him into the station.

          INT SID'S BAIL BONDS/JERSEY CITY- MORNING
          
          Hazy pieces: a tilting clock on the wall. A battered metal
          desk. Filing cabinets, spitting up papers. A man, SID (wound
          sorta tight, Milo's best friend) peers down at us:
          
                              SID
                    You're drooling on my sofa.
          
          Milo unsticks his face from the leather couch, wobbles
          upright. Are the walls throbbing, or is it just him?
          
                              SID
                    You do have an apartment, don't
                    you? With a bed of some kind?
          
          Milo grunts. Sid hands him a coffee.
          
                              SID
                    Heard you shut down 5th Street
                    yesterday. Gave every kid in the
                    county the gift of nightmares.
          
                              MILO
                    Hey, I'm a giving kind of guy.
                    Anyway, what do you care? I brought
                    your guy in, right?
          
          Milo holds out his hand, palm up. Sid COUNTS MONEY INTO HIS
          PALM.
          
          
          EXT SID'S BAIL BONDS/JERSEY CITY- MORNING
          
          Swearing under his breath, Sid is trying to stuff a Xmas tree
          into the back of a station wagon. At least half of the tree
          is hanging out of the back. Milo drinks a beer and watches.
          
                                                                 12.
          
          
                              SID
                    You gonna give me a hand, or just
                    stand there killing your liver?
          
                              MILO
                    Is that a trick question?
          
          Sid glares at him. Milo sighs, puts down his beer, and grabs
          part of the tree.
          
                              SID
                    So I told her, fine, I'd handle
                    Xmas this year. I mean, what's to
                    handle? You buy a tree, some gifts,
                    cook a ham, hang some lights. An
                    idiot could do it.
          
                              MILO
                    Well, we'll soon find out.
          
          Sid checks him out.
          
                              SID
                    You have plans for the holiday?
          
                                 MILO
                    The usual.
          
                              SID
                    Gonna drink some cheap whiskey and
                    put your fist through a wall?
          
                                 MILO
                    Jealous?
          
          The tree is definitely not going to fit. They let it go, and
          Sid pulls out a small hand saw.
          
                              SID
                    Then forget it.
          
                              MILO
                    Forget what?
          
                              SID
                    I've got an open bond, but your
                    thing sounds like more fun. I'll
                    give it to Doug instead.
          
          Sid starts hacking away at the tree.
          
                                                                 13.
          
          
                              MILO
                    Whoa. Hold up, Heidi. What the
                    fuck. I want the job, I'm in the
                    hole.
          
                              SID
                    You're always in the hole.
          
                              MILO
                    What's your point?
          
                              SID
                        (SIGHING)
                    The truth is, I'm not sure you're
                    the right person for this job. It
                    could be a total disaster. On the
                    other hand, when one friend sees
                    another friend stagnating in his
                    own filth, he has to do something,
                    right?
          
                              MILO
                    Hey. I just woke up. I was gonna
                    shower.
          
          Sid drops the saw. With one final shove, the tree is in.
          Phew. Sid slams the back shut.
          
                              SID
                    Ok. But remember: you asked for it.
          
          He reaches into his pocket and extracts A FOLDED PIECE OF
          PAPER. Hands it to Milo. Milo unfolds it, gives it a quick
          look. A second look. A third.
          
          TIME STOPS. THE WHOLE STREET GOES SILENT.
          
                              MILO

                              SID
                    Yes.
          
                              MILO
                    No.
          
                              SID
                    Yes.
          
                              MILO
                    No.
          
                              SID
                    Are we done yet?
          
                                                          14.
          
          
                              MILO
                    Is this a joke? Because if it is,
                    I'm gonna have to kill you.
          
                              SID
                    It's not a joke.
          
                              MILO
                    She got arrested? And then she
                    jumped bail?
          
                              SID
                    Apparently the whole thing started
                    with some reckless driving, and
                    ended with her assaulting a police
                    officer.
          
          Milo gives him a questioning look.

                        (EXPLAINING)
                    She bit him.
          
          Milo snorts.
          
                              MILO
                    Yeah. That sounds like her.
                    But here's my question: why the
                    hell did you post her bail?
          
                              SID

                    No, not "whatever". I dumped her.

                    The point is, I'm aware you guys
                    have issues, but I'm running a
                    business here. A person needs bail,
                    I don't have time to check with you
                    first.
          
                              MILO
                    Well, had you checked with me
                    first, you wouldn't be out of a
                    bond right now.

          Milo takes a deep, calming breath. Then he EXPLODES into
          whoops and hollers. He throws himself into a snow bank and
          thrashes around. He does a Fred Astaire around a lamp post.

                    I take it you're interested.
          
          Milo grabs Sid and pulls him into a crushing bear hug.
          
                              MILO
                    I love you! You're the best friend

          TERESA (mid 40's, overly made-up, popping gum) pokes her head
          out the front door:
          
                              TERESA
                    Sid, you got a DUI on line one.
                    (off their looks) What's going on?
          
          Milo drops Sid, grabs Teresa, and gives HER A LONG, INTENSE
          KISS. He releases her. She stumbles back a bit.
          
                              TERESA
                    Ok. (beat) Can I have my gum back?
          
                              MILO
                    Right. Sorry.
          
          He reaches into his mouth, extracts her gum and hands it to
          her. She retreats back inside. Milo beams at Sid.
          
                              MILO
                    You know what this is, don't you?

                    We didn't break up over a stupid
                    article. We broke up because she is
                    a cheating, manipulative liar.

                    Let's face it: you're not exactly
                    rational around her. I mean, if I
                    was a cop working a case and some
                    reporter came snooping around, I'd
                    say "no comment". Not "no comment,
                    but care for a cocktail"? And then
                    a month later, running off to some
                    love shack called "Caveman's Cabin"
                    and tying the knot? Who does that?
          
                              MILO
                    That's not even close to what
                    happened. For one thing, it was
                    called "Cupid's Cabin". And for
                    another, that was before I knew how
                    conniving she was. Now I know. So
                    all I have to do is track her down,
                    cuff her up, and bring her in.
                    (checking his watch) And I've got,
                    what, two days? Shit, man. Easy as

          at the top of his lungs:

          He puts an empty duffle on the bed and starts filling it:

          Milo tosses the duffle in the backseat. He pulls out the job
          sheet and inspects it. CASS' CELL PHONE NUMBER IS LISTED.
          Pulls out his cell phone, then hesitates. He glances around
          and sees a PAY PHONE ACROSS THE WAY.
          
          Pockets his cell phone and crosses to the pay phone.

          to be incognito. Hurrying towards her car when she sees SOME
          COPS EXIT A DINER up ahead. She slips into a doorway, waiting
          for them to pass, when her phone rings.
          
          She checks it ("PAY PHONE") and answers:
          
                                CASS

          Nope, NOT JIMMY. Milo doesn't speak. Cass listens for a
          moment. She can hear breathing. What the fuck? An evil grin
          crosses Milo's face. Cass goes pale.
          
          Milo takes a step forward. Cass takes a step back. Milo
          LUNGES and CASS DROPS HER PHONE AND BOLTS OUT OF FRAME.

          Milo slips inside, pulling the door shut behind him. It's
          dark and quiet. He glides through the room, scoping it out.
          The place is huge, white rug and couch, flat screen TV.
          
          And lining the bookshelves are FRAMED ARTICLES, AWARDS,
          PHOTOS OF CASS WITH VARIOUS PUBLIC FIGURES: the home of a
          successful and dedicated journalist.

          Milo is halfway across the room when he realizes he has left
          a set of MUDDY PRINTS across the formerly pristine white rug.

          NOW THERE ARE FOOTPRINTS CRISS-CROSSING THE FLOOR, RUNNING UP
          OVER THE COUCH, ETC. Looks like Milo had a little field day
          here. He is taking a closer look at the shelves: no photos of
          a boyfriend, family, pets: IT'S ALL WORK.
          
          He picks up one of the framed articles with the headline
          "LOCAL REPORTER WINS AWARD FOR BREAKING UP 13TH STREET DRUG

          IMPORTANT-LOOKING OFFICIAL.

          crowded parking lot.
          
          CHIRON: "1:00PM. ATLANTIC CITY. 44 HOURS TO GO."
          
          Milo exits his car and heads inside. STEWART, feeling super
          sly, pulls up to a space near Milo's car, but another car
          slips into the spot.
          
                              STEWART

          Milo knocks on the door. A woman in heavy makeup (LOIS, Cass'
          mother) opens the door, takes one look at Milo, SLAMS the
          door shut. Milo waits. After a moment, Lois opens it again.
          
                              MILO
                    Happy to see you, too.

                    to my baby...
          
          Lois bursts into tears and collapses into Milo's arms.
          
                              MILO
                    Ok. What say we do this inside?

          Men running around in gowns and feather boas. A completely
          recovered Lois sits by a make-up mirror, adjusting a wig.
          Stuck to her mirror is a PHOTO OF MILO AND CASS, ARMS AROUND
          EACH OTHER, SMILING. Milo gives the photo a dirty look.
          
                                                                 29.

                              LOIS
                    I got sick of it. Now I'm a female
                    impersonator.
          
                              MILO
                    But...you are female.
          
                              LOIS
                    That's why I'm so good at it. Help
                    me with this.
          
          She stands and wiggles into an evening gown. Milo struggles
          with the zipper.
          
                              MILO
                    Where is she, Lois? I need to talk
                    to her.
          
                              LOIS
                    Oh, Milo, where did it all go
                    wrong? Do you have any idea what it
                    means to waste a woman's child-
                    bearing years? It's criminal. Every
                    month her eggs are jumping out of
                    her ovaries like sailors abandoning
                    a sinking ship. I mean, I know you
                    were mad about that article...
          
                              MILO
                    I wasn't mad about that article. In
                    fact: what article?
          
                              LOIS
                    Listen to me, Milo: Cassidy may be
                    a strong independent woman on the
                    outside, but on the inside she's
                    just a girl who wants to be
                    protected and loved by her man.
                    What happened between the two of
                    you devastated her.

                              LOIS (cont'd)
                    I must admit, it makes me proud to
                    think that my little girl, whose
                    only friend growing up was an
                    imaginary orphan with a tin leg
                    named Leslie, now gets invited to
                    tour the White House...
          
          Milo's jaw hits the floor.
          
                              MILO
                    She got to tour the White House?
          
          Now he really wants to take Cass to jail.
          
                              MILO
                    Tell me where she is, Lois.
          
                              LOIS
                    Oh, who knows. She was running
                    around like a chicken with its head
                    cut off, said she was on the
                    biggest story of her career. Said
                    she was going somewhere to think.
          
          Milo thinks this over, then a grin breaks out on his face.

          Someone taps her shoulder. She glances up and sees: MILO,
          SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO HER, GRINNING. She slowly closes her
          phone, not bothering to say goodbye.

                    "Building a sand castle, drinking
                    from a coconut". Man, once a liar,
                    always a liar.
          
          Cass immediately stands.
          
                              CASS
                    You know what? I don't have time
                    for this, I'm working.
          
          She grabs her stuff. Milo blocks her with his leg.
          
                              MILO
                    Working? Hey, me too.
          
                              CASS
                    Congratulations. Move your leg.
          
          Milo doesn't budge. Spelling it out for her:
          
                              MILO
                    What I do is, I track down
                    criminals. People who jumped bail.
                    Idiots who decided to go on the run
                    after biting police officers. I
                    find them, and I take them to jail.
          
                                                                  33.
          
          
          Cass stares at him, eyes wide:

                    Now, hold on just a second, Milo...

                    Tell you what: I'll give you more
                    than a second. I'll give you 10.
                    For old times sake.
          
          Milo moves his leg, kicks back, starts to count.
          
                              MILO
                    10...9...8...
          
          Cass stares at him, her jaw working, trying to decide what to
          do. Then, all of a sudden, she BOLTS. Milo smiles. THE

          EXT STADIUM- AFTERNOON
          
          Cass races out, flagging a taxi. Milo pulls up:
          
                              MILO
                    Strike three. Get in.
          
                              CASS
                    I'm not going to jail, Milo.
          
                                                                     34.
          
          
                              MILO
                    I beg to differ.
          
          She heads for the cabs. Milo exits his car, GUN IN HAND.
          
                              CASS
                    Oh please. Like you're gonna shoot
                    me.
          
                              MILO
                    Nope. (loudly) I'm gonna shoot a
                    cab driver.
          
          Head whip around in his direction. THEN EVERY CAB IN THE
          PLACE GOES OFF-DUTY. Cass stomps her foot, furious.
          
                              CASS
                    Chicken shits.
          
          Cass marches back over to Milo.
          
                              CASS
                    Ok, look: let's talk about this.
          
                               MILO
                    Ok.
          
          With that, Milo sweeps her up into his arms. AND THEY FIND
          THEMSELVES FACE TO FACE. BREATHING ON EACH OTHER. THEIR LIPS
          INCHES APART.
          
          Cass stares at Milo. Is he gonna kiss her? Again, she feels
          weird. Confused.
          
                              CASS
                        (UNCOMFORTABLE)
                    Listen, Milo, I'm not sure we
                    should...
          
          Suddenly, MILO DUMPS HER IN THE TRUNK OF HIS CAR.
          
                              CASS
                    Hey, wait a minute!
          
          He smiles at her, waves, then SLAMS down the lid.
          
          CUT TO BLACK. Well, now she knows exactly how she feels:
          FURIOUS:
          
                               CASS (O.S.)
                    Bastard.
          
          CHIRON: "2:00 PM. ROUTE 9 NORTH. 43 HOURS TO GO".
          
                                                                 35.
          
          
          And immediately: A PHONE RINGS.
          
                              CASS (O.S.)
                    Great. Perfect timing.
          
          A match is struck, illuminating the trunk as Cass scrambles
          for her phone. Trying to sound professional:
          
                              CASS
                    Cassidy Daley.
          
          
          SPLIT-SCREEN:
          
          CLOSE ON- JIMMY, head tilted back, tense smile on his face.
          PULL BACK a little to reveal the GUN MAHLER IS HOLDING UNDER
          HIS CHIN.
          
                              JIMMY
                    It's me. Jimmy.
          
                              CASS
                        (exhaling with relief)
                    Shit, Jimmy, I thought you were
                    dead.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Don't be silly. (hurrying on)
                    Listen: you didn't happen to go to
                    my place and find that envelope I
                    left, did you?
          
                              CASS
                    I did, but I don't really get it,
                    what's "Sparrow"?
          
                              JIMMY
                    It doesn't matter. Did you tell
                    anyone else about this story?
          
                              CASS
                    Are you kidding? You think I want
                    to share a story like this?
          
                              JIMMY
                    Ok. Good. Cause the truth is, there
                    is no story. I made the whole thing
                    up. So you should just drop it...
          
                              CASS
                    Uh-uh, no way are you backing out
                    on me now, Jimmy. This story is way
                    too good...
          
                                                                 36.
          
          
          Mahler nudges Jimmy.
          
                              JIMMY
                        (QUICKLY)
                    Where are you?
          
                              CASS
                    I'm at the Atlantic City Boardwalk.
                    Actually, I'm in the trunk of my ex-
                    husband's car. Long story. More
                    importantly, where are you?
          
                                 JIMMY
                    I'm...
          
          CLICK. MAHLER DISCONNECTS THE PHONE.
          
          ON CASS- she stares at her phone. Uh-oh:
          
                              CASS
                    Jimmy? Hello?
          
          Suddenly, MUSIC KICKS IN and we hear MILO SINGING AT THE TOP
          OF HIS LUNGS:
          
                              MILO (O.S.)
                    Deck the halls with boughs of
                    holly, fa la la la laaaa...
          
          
          INT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON
          
          Now Milo really is the happiest man alive. He pulls out his
          cell phone, dials:
          
          SPLIT-SCREEN:
          
          Teresa removes her gum, sticks it on her mouse-pad, answers:
          
                              TERESA
                    Sid's Bail Bonds.
          
                              MILO
                    Guess who's in my trunk?
          
                              TERESA
                    Is that some sort of perverted
                    innuendo? Who is this?
          
                              MILO
                    Aw, come on, Teresa, you know it's
                    me. Put Sid on.
          
                                                                 37.
          
          
                              TERESA
                    Sid's busy shopping. (snorts) He
                    thinks he can handle Xmas.
          
                              MILO
                    Ok, just tell him I got her and
                    I'll be back in 2 hours. I want a
                    bonus for bringing her in so quick.
          
                              TERESA
                    Yeah? I want a bonus for getting
                    through the holidays without
                    stabbing anyone with a fork.
          
                              MILO
                    Don't be such a pessimist. You
                    still have time.
          
          His phone beeps. IT'S CASS CALLING FROM THE TRUNK.
          
                              MILO
                    Gotta go. I got another call.
          
          He clicks over.
          
                              MILO
                    Tina's Thai massage! Where every
                    ending is a happy one!
          
          SPLIT-SCREEN:
          
          Cass rolls her eyes.
          
                               CASS
                    You're disgusting. Let me out of
                    the trunk.
          
                              MILO
                    Hmm. Nope. By the way, your
                    boyfriend Stewart's been following
                    me. Unfortunately, I had to ditch
                    him at the track.
          
                              CASS
                    Why is Stewart..? (realizing) And
                    wait: who said he's my boyfriend?
          
                              MILO
                    Aw, don't be embarrassed. These
                    things happen. You were drunk when
                    you guys hooked up, right?
          
          Cass turns bright red. She was drunk when they hooked up.
          Changing tactics, she tries to flatter him:
          
                                                                  38.
          
          
                              CASS
                    You know what, Milo? I shouldn't
                    have run from you like that. I
                    was...I don't know. You caught me
                    off-guard. The truth is, I'm kind
                    of in some trouble and I could
                    really use your help.
          
                              MILO
                    Bad news for you, then. I wouldn't
                    help you if you were the very last
                    baby sea turtle in the world,
                    dragging its tiny weak body across
                    the burning hot sand while sea
                    gulls circled overhead. I'd just
                    pull up a chair, sip a pina colada,
                    and let nature take its course.
          
          Long beat. Suddenly, CASS STARTS TO SOB. LOUD, HYSTERICAL
          SOBS. Milo listens for a moment, out of a purely clinical
          interest, then:
          
                              MILO
                    Hey, I used to be a sucker, but no
                    more. You can cry til the cows come
                    home, for all I care.
          
          Cass instantly stops crying and slams her phone shut.
          
          CUT TO BLACK. Then, the sound of a trunk opening, and WE ARE
          INSIDE A CAR TRUNK, LOOKING UP AT: MAHLER.
          
          
          EXT TRUMP CASINO PARKING LOT- AFTERNOON
          
          Mahler reaches into his trunk and REMOVES HIS HANDGUN. Checks
          the cartridge, pockets the gun. Slams the trunk shut.
          
          He climbs into his front seat, and as he pulls out of the
          lot, we see CASS' NEWSPAPER PHOTO THAT HAS BEEN RIPPED FROM
          THE PAPER, on the passenger seat.
          
          
          INT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON
          
          Milo drives along happily humming when, suddenly, A SMALL
          TRAIL OF SMOKE drifts over his shoulder. What the hell...? He
          glances into the rearview mirror and:
          
          SMOKE IS POURING OUT OF THE TRUNK!
          
                              MILO
                    Holy shit! (calling out) Hey, um,
                    Cass? (no response) Cassidy?
          
                                                                  39.
          
          
          Still nothing. Milo jerks the car to the right, and SLAMS on
          the brakes.
          
          
          EXT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON
          
          The car screeches to a halt on the embankment. Milo leaps out
          of the driver's door and races to back, fumbling with his
          keys. SMOKE CONTINUES TO POUR OUT OF THE TRUNK.
          
                              MILO
                    It's Ok, hang on, I'm coming...
          
          Gets the key in, pops the lid and sees: CASS, HANDKERCHIEF
          OVER HER NOSE, PACK OF FLAMING MATCHES IN HAND. Cass tosses
          the matches and handkerchief, AND PUNCHES MILO IN THE BALLS.
          
          Milo groans and crumbles to the ground. Cass jumps out of the
          trunk and stands over him:
          
                              CASS
                    You know something, Milo? You're
                    one of the most gullible...
          
          BAM, Milo grabs her ankle and JERKS and Cass hits the ground.
          Next thing you know, IT'S WWF TIME, THE TWO OF THEM ROLLING
          IN THE DIRT.
          
          Milo gets her pinned, but Cass grabs his ear and TWISTS:
          
                                 MILO
                    AAAAHHH...
          
          He pulls her arm behind her back...
          
                              CASS
                    Ow ow ow...
          
          ...and she jerks her head back, SMACKING him in the nose.

                    Son of a...

          ...and she BITES him.
          
                                 MILO
                    OW...

          Finally, he has her on her back, TRAPPED. He gets his face
          right over hers and STARTS TO LET A GLOB OF SALIVA FALL FROM
          HIS MOUTH TOWARDS HER FACE.
          
                              CASS
                    NOOOO! Uncle, uncle, uncle!
          
          Milo collapses onto the ground next to her, laughing. She
          looks at him and she starts laughing too.
          
                              CASS
                    Dirty fighter.
          
                              MILO
                    Me? I'm the dirty fighter?
          
          They both laugh harder. Then Milo stands and offers her a
          hand. She takes it, and he helps her up. Awkward pause as
          they look at each other.
          
                               CASS
                    Should we...I don't know...hug, or
                    something?
          
                              MILO
                    Sure. What the hell.
          
          He opens his arms. She moves closer. They hug. Milo feels her
          hands moving towards the gun in his belt. He smirks. CLICK.
          HE SNAPS SOME HANDCUFFS ONTO HER WRISTS.
          
                              CASS
                    Hey. I had to try, right?
          
                              MILO
                    Get in the car.
          
          
          INT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON
          
          They are driving along, both a little dishevelled, ONE OF
          CASS' HANDS CUFFED TO THE PASSENGER DOOR. They pass casinos
          as they head out of Atlantic City.
          
                              CASS
                    Your windshield's cracked.
          
                              MILO
                    Thanks, Captain Obvious.
          
          Cass turns to inspect him more closely.
          
                                                                  41.
          
          
                               CASS
                    And you look like shit, Milo. What
                    have you been doing, sleeping on
                    the floor?
          
          Milo has been sleeping on the floor.
          
                              MILO
                    I enjoy sleeping on the floor.
                    Matter of fact, I love sleeping on
                    the floor. I love everything about
                    my life. Great job, good friends,
                    hot girlfriend...
          
                              CASS
                    You have a girlfriend?
          
                              MILO
                        (he does not)
                    Yes I do.
          
          Cass is skeptical:
          
                              CASS
                    Really? What's her name?
          
                              MILO
                        (the first name that pops
                         into his head:)
                    Teresa. Rocking hot body. Likes to
                    cook pasta for me and perform strip-
                    teases.
          
                              CASS
                    Wow. Is she missing a chromosome?
          
                              MILO
                    Oh, she has all her chromosomes,
                    believe you me.
          
          Cass thinks this over, then counters:
          
                              CASS
                    Well, my life is great, too.
          
                              MILO
                    I can tell. You and Stewart make a
                    great couple, by the way. You and
                    me made a terrible couple. But you
                    two? Like peas in a pod.
          
          About to deny that she and Stewart are a couple, it occurs to
          Cass: Milo seems a little JEALOUS. She jumps on this:
          
                                                                  42.
          
          
                              CASS
                    You know what I like about Stewart?
          
                              MILO
                    I can't imagine.
          
                              CASS
                    He's not you.
          
                              MILO
                    Not even on his best day.
          
                              CASS
                    Or his worst.
          
                              MILO
                    I'll bet he has a lot of those.
          
                              CASS
                    Still betting, huh?
          
                              MILO
                    You can't win if you don't play.
          
                              CASS
                    Or, in your case, even if you do.
          
          He shoots her a sharp look. She stares back, waiting.
          
                              MILO
                    I win all the time.
          
                              CASS
                    Really? I hadn't noticed.
          
          Ok. That is definitely a challenge.
          
                              MILO
                    You know what? Seeing as how I'm
                    about to come into five grand...
          
          Milo makes a SUDDEN TURN OFF THE HIGHWAY and pulls into the
          parking lot of BALLY'S CASINO.
          
                               MILO
                    I think I'll do a little betting
                    right now.
          
                              CASS
                    Don't you have to take me back?
          
                              MILO
                    Please. I have two days. A monkey
                    could get you back in two days.
          
                                                                 43.
          
          
          Again: famous last words. Milo exits the car. Cass smiles to
          herself. This is obviously what she hoped would happen. She
          glances around, spots THE DUFFLE in the back seat. PEEKING
          OUT OF THE TOP OF THE DUFFLE IS THE TASER GUN. Hmm...
          
          
          EXT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON
          
          Milo opens her door.
          
                              CASS
                    Aren't you afraid I'll get away?
          
                                 MILO
                    Nope.
          
          He uncuffs her from the door, CUFFS HER TO HIS OWN WRIST.
          
          
          EXT HIGHWAY- AFTERNOON
          
          Stewart is heading back to the city, cursing his bad luck,
          when he happens to glance over and see MILO AND CASS HEADING
          INTO BALLY'S CASINO.
          
                              STEWART
                    Damn, I'm good!
          
          He makes a quick turn off the highway and into the Bally's
          parking lot.
          
          
          INT BALLY'S CASINO- AFTERNOON
          
          The clerk at the chips cage recognizes Milo as he and Cass
          APPROACH:
          
                              CLERK
                    Merry Xmas, Mr Boyd!
          
          Behind the clerk, a FEMALE CLERK perks up at this name...
          
                              CLERK
                    What a nice surprise! Let's hope
                    your luck is better today.
          
          Milo glances at Cass.
          
                              MILO
                        (QUICKLY)
                    Sure, if there's such a thing as
                    better than great, which is how my
                    luck has been lately. Great.
          
                                                                  44.
          
          
                              CLERK
                        (AWKWARD)
                    Oh. Yes sir. Of course. My mistake.
          
          While the clerk is counting out chips, WE NOTICE BEHIND HIM
          THE FEMALE CLERK PICKING UP THE PHONE...
          
          
          INT WAREHOUSE- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Lorraine on the phone, listening intently. Then she hangs up,
          grinning.
          
                              LORRAINE
                    The idiot just showed up at
                    Bally's.
          
                               DWIGHT

                              LORRAINE
                    Uh-uh. Not you. (calling out) RAY.
          
          RAY appears next to her.
          
                              LORRAINE
                    Go get this asshole.
          
          Ray cracks his knuckles, smirks at Dwight, and exits.
          
          
          INT BALLY'S BLACKJACK TABLE- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Milo sits at a blackjack table, pulling Cass into a seat next
          to him.
          
                              MILO
                    Prepare to observe the master.
          
          He bets while Cass sits next to him, scheming:
          
                              CASS
                    Ok, how about this:
          
          She uses her free hand to pull out her wallet:
          
                              CASS
                    If I give you all the cash in my
                    wallet, will you let me go?
          
                              MILO
                    Hmm. Lemme see...
          
                                                                 45.
          
          
          He takes the cash from her and thinks for a moment.
          
                              MILO
                    Nope. Guess not.
          
          Milo adds her cash to his bet on the table.
          
                              MILO
                        (to the dealer)
                    Hit me.
          
                              CASS
                    I'd really like to.
          
          The dealer deals the cards.
          
                              DEALER
                    Dealer wins.
          
                              CASS
                    Nice going, master.
          
          Milo quickly lays out some more money. A WAITRESS (smells
          like an ashtray) appears:
          
                              WAITRESS
                    And for the couple over here?
          
                              MILO
                        (QUICKLY)
                    We're not a couple.
          
                              CASS
                        (just as quick)
                    Why would you think we were a
                    couple?
          
                              MILO
                    We used to be together. Back when I
                    was young and foolish.
          
                              CASS
                    And I was confused.
          
                              MILO
                    And I was slumming.
          
                              CASS
                    And I was drunk.
          
          The waitress looks back and forth between them.
          
                                                                 46.
          
          
                              WAITRESS
                        (BORED)
                    Great story. I have to get back to
                    work now.
          
                              MILO
                    Wait. Champagne! I'm celebrating.
          
          The waitress rolls her eyes and leaves. Milo turns to see he
          has lost more money.
          
                              MILO
                        (under his breath)
                    Son of a bitch.
          
          Ok. Cass has had enough of this. She leans closer:
          
                              CASS
                    Look, Milo, the truth is...my Mom
                    is in the hospital.
          
          Milo perks up.
          
                              MILO
                    Oh? Old Lois not feeling up to par?
          
                              CASS
                    She might be really sick. That's
                    why I had to jump bail.
          
                              MILO
                        (overly sincere)
                    Taking care of her, huh? Putting
                    aside your career for a loved one?
                    Golly, that's so you.
          
          "Golly"? Cass stares at him, realizing:
          
                              CASS
                    You've already been to see her.
          
                              MILO
                    Impressive. No wonder you got all
                    those awards. So lemme guess: the
                    real reason you jumped bail is
                    cause you're on a story.
          
          Cass narrows her eyes:
          
                              CASS
                    Stewart. Stewart told you.
          
                                                                 47.
          
          
                              MILO
                        (CAUGHT)
                    I would have figured it out on my
                    own, trust me.
          
                              CASS
                    I wouldn't trust you if you were
                    the last man alive.
          
                              MILO
                    You think about that much? Me being
                    the last man alive? Am I naked in
                    this fantasy?
          
          Cass takes a deep breath. This is getting her nowhere. But
          she is clearly hesitant to give him the real story.
          
                              CASS
                    Ok, you're right. I'm on a story.
                    A very important story. It just so
                    happens that I'm possibly about to
                    uncover a whole ring of dirty cops.
          
          Milo snorts.
          
                                CASS
                    What?
          
                              MILO
                    Please. Isn't the whole "dirty cop"
                    thing kind of old? Maybe you should
                    do a story about something people
                    are interested in. Like internet
                    porn. Or lesbians.
          
                              CASS
                    I'm serious, Milo. This is gonna be
                    big. And here's what I'm willing to
                    do (magnanimous): I'm willing to
                    credit you in the article.
          
                              MILO
                    Oh, sure, like you credited me in
                    the 13th Street Article?
          
          Cass stares at him.
          
                              CASS
                    Why on earth would I have credited
                    you? I worked my ass off for that
                    story.
          
                              MILO
                    That's one way of putting it.
          
                                                                48.
          
          
                              CASS
                    What's that supposed to mean?
          
                              MILO
                    Forget it. I don't want to be in
                    your article. In fact, I would
                    rather eat a bowl of broken glass
                    than have my name in any way
                    associated with one of your lousy
                    articles...
          
                              CASS
                    Fine. Forget I mentioned it.
          
                              MILO
                    I already have.
          
                              CASS
                    I mean, you're not a cop anymore,
                    right? What do you care if people
                    were murdered?
          
                              MILO
                    Please. Nobody was murdered.
          
                              CASS
                    Just my source.

                    Oh yeah? How? Bullet to the back of
                    the head?
          
                              CASS
                    Well...

                              CASS
                        (FLUSTERED)
                    I don't know.
          
                              MILO
                    Car accident?
          
                              CASS
                    Ok, ok, maybe he wasn't murdered
                    yet. But I wouldn't be surprised
                    if...
          
          Milo breaks out into loud guffaws. Cass is furious.
          
                                                                   49.
          
          
                              CASS
                    Maybe this whole thing sounds like
                    no big deal to you...
          
                              MILO
                    You know what it sounds like? It
                    sounds like you're going to jail.
          
          Cass can't believe this.
          
                              CASS
                    Milo, listen, you have to believe
                    me, come on, you know me...
          
                              MILO
                        (getting red)
                    Exactly! I do know you. Which means
                    I know you are a deceptive, cold-
                    hearted bitch who is going to jail
                    where she belongs.
          
          Wow. That was pretty harsh. Cass looks at him, stunned. They
          stare at each other in silence.
          
          The waitress arrives with the drinks:
          
                              WAITRESS
                    Champagne. So. What are we
                    celebrating?
          
                              CASS
                        (GRIMLY)
                    I have to use the bathroom.
          
                              WAITRESS
                    Alrightee, then. Cheers.
          
          
          EXT BALLY'S CASINO PARKING LOT- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Stewart taps his steering wheel restlessly, watching the door
          of the casino for signs of Cass and Milo. Waiting in this
          parking lot is boring. Finally, he exits his car. Sidles over
          to Milo's car. Checks the door handle.
          
          IT'S UNLOCKED. Stewart glances around, then climbs in.
          
          
          INT BALLY'S CASINO BATHROOM- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Cass enters and Milo follows:
          
                              CASS
                    Can I have some privacy, please?
          
                                                                  50.
          
          
          Milo checks the room. Looks like there is no escape from
          here. He UNCUFFS HER, but then:
          
                              MILO
                    I'm gonna have to frisk you.
          
                              CASS
                    Get it over with, then.
          
          Milo checks her pockets. Her ankles. Her legs. He goes behind
          her and checks her shoulders. Her back. He reaches around and
          checks her belly.
          
                              MILO
                    You gain a little weight?
          
                              CASS
                        (snapping back)
                    You lose a little hair?
          
          Milo reaches higher and:
          
                              CASS
                    Yeah. Right. I'm hiding a weapon in
                    my breasts.
          
          Milo backs off, turning red.
          
                              MILO
                    Make it quick.
          
          He exits. As soon as he is gone, CASS PULLS MILO'S TASER GUN
          FROM HER CLEAVAGE.

          Stewart is rummaging around inside Milo's car when he looks
          up and sees: RAY, standing there, smiling at him.
          
                              STEWART
                    Shit, man, you startled me. (beat)
                    Can I help you?
          
                              RAY
                    Night-night.
          
          Suddenly, Ray GRABS STEWART'S HEAD AND SMASHES IT INTO THE
          STEERING WHEEL, KNOCKING HIM OUT COLD.

          Milo checks his watch, then raps on the door.

          Cass squints at the taser gun, trying to read the tiny
          instruction label on the side:
          
                              CASS
                    "Put open end in direct contact

                              MILO (O.S.)
                    Hello? Ok, that's long enough, I'm
                    coming in...
          
          He comes in and SHE JAMS THE TASER GUN INTO HIS NECK AND HITS
          THE BUTTON. HE SCREAMS AND HITS THE FLOOR. SHE SCREAMS, DROPS
          THE TASER GUN, AND FLEES.

                    Sorry...
          
          ...and keeps going. She hurries to the curb and tries to flag
          down a ride.
          
          RACK TO- SEVERAL YARDS AWAY, THE PERSON SHE BUMPED INTO IS
          STARING AFTER HER. IT'S MAHLER. Mahler compares her to the
          newspaper photo he is holding. Yup: THAT'S HER.
          
          Cass glances around, keeping an eye out for Milo, and SPOTS
          MAHLER STARING AT HER. Suddenly, he starts heading towards
          her. Cass backs up slightly, nervous. WHO IS THAT GUY?
          
                              VOICE
                    Need a lift?
          
          Cass looks around. A trucker has pulled up next to her.
          Relieved, she quickly climbs on board.
          
          RACK TO- MAHLER, WATCHING THE TRUCK PULL AWAY. He doesn't
          seem worried. He turns and heads for his car.

                    He says we made a terrible couple.
                    Which is true. I know that. I'm the
                    one who thought that first. I'm the
                    one who came up with that. The fact
                    is, I don't want to be with someone
                    who can't admit he was wrong.

                    So you're available.

          over and SMACKS HIM AS HARD AS SHE CAN.
          
          
          EXT HIGHWAY- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          The truck SCREECHES to a halt by the side of the road. Cass
          gets booted out the passenger door. The door is slammed shut
          behind her. Cass gives the guy the finger as he drives off.
          
          She turns to see a car headed her way. She starts flagging it
          down. But wait... Yup, IT'S MILO. Shit. She looks around, but
          where's she gonna go? Meanwhile, as Milo nears, HE SEEMS TO
          BE SPEEDING UP. Cass stares. He keeps coming, an evil look on
          his face. IT LOOKS LIKE HE IS GOING TO RUN HER OVER.
          
          She turns and STARTS TO RUN.
          
          
          INT CADILLAC- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Milo is laughing.
          
                              MILO
                    You better run.
          
                                                                  53.
          
          
          EXT FIELD- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Cass runs into a field. Milo drives off the road and follows.
          He gets her cornered by a pen. He looks triumphant. She
          scowls. Then she throws open the pen, REVEALING A HUGE BULL.
          Now she looks triumphant. He scowls.
          
          CUT TO- BULL RAMS INTO MILO'S CAR, SLAMMING MILO'S FACE INTO
          THE STEERING WHEEL. CASS LAUGHS. THE BULL TURNS AND NOTICES
          CASS FOR THE FIRST TIME.
          
          CUT TO- BULL CHASES CASS. MILO LAUGHS. CASS RUNS FOR THE CAR.
          MILO LOCKS THE DOORS.
          
                              CASS
                    Hey, it's locked!
          
                              MILO
                        (GRINNING)
                    I know.
          
          THE BULL IS SPEEDING THEIR WAY:
          
                              CASS
                    Open the door, you son of a bitch!
          
          Finally, Milo opens it. She DIVES INTO THE CAR AND SLAMS THE
          DOOR just before the BULL RAMS INTO THE SIDE OF THE CAR.
          
          Cass and Milo watch, stunned, as the bull looks at them for a
          moment, THEN TOPPLES OVER, UNCONSCIOUS. Milo and Cass hear a
          strange sound, and look over to see A SMALL HERD OF BULLS,
          GETTING READY TO CHARGE.
          
                               CASS
                    Uh-oh...
          
          MILO HITS THE GAS AND THEY FLEE THE SCENE, THE HERD OF BULLS
          IN MAD PURSUIT. CASS AND MILO ARE BOTH NOW LAUGHING
          HYSTERICALLY...

          Ray THROWS open the bathroom door to reveal: A VERY
          DISGRUNTLED STEWART, HANDCUFFED TO THE TOILET. Stewart blinks
          up at them, disoriented.
          
          Lorraine hands Dwight THE GOLF CLUB.

          DWIGHT WHACKS STEWART IN THE SHIN WITH THE CLUB. STEWART
          SCREAMS.

                    Who is this guy, anyway?
          
          Lorraine and Ray stare at him.

                    He was in Milo Boyd's Cadillac.
          
          They all look at Stewart, who moans in pain.

                    Both of you go this time, and make
                    sure you get the right guy. I don't
                    have time for this shit.

                    What about me?
          
          Lorraine considers him for a moment, then SLAMS the bathroom
          door in his face.
          
          
          INT CADILLAC- EARLY EVENING
          
          Milo and Cass are back on the highway, both looking a little
          worse for wear. Milo's nose is swollen, Cass' clothes are
          muddy.
          
                                                                 55.
          
          
          Milo MOVES HIS WEAPONS FROM THE DUFFLE INTO HIS OWN JACKET
          WHILE HE DRIVES. He smirks at Cass.
          
                              CASS
                    Clever. (noting all the weapons)
                    Wow. You were gonna use all that
                    stuff on me?
          
                              MILO
                    A guy can dream, can't he?
          
          NOW HIS JACKET IS FULL OF WEAPONS. He turns his attention
          back to the road. Cass studies his profile.
          
                              CASS
                    Ok, look, Milo, let's just clear
                    the air, Ok? So maybe it was a
                    mistake, thinking we could be
                    involved while working on the same
                    case...
          
                              MILO
                    Hey, I know it was a mistake. Don't
                    think you're telling me something I
                    don't know, cause you're not.
          
                              CASS
                        (deep breath)
                    Ok. Fine. But can we just put aside
                    our differences for two seconds?
                    Because back at the casino, I think
                    I saw someone following me.
          
                              MILO
                    Sure that wasn't me?
          
                              CASS
                    I don't think so. This guy was
                    lacking your trademark smell of
                    booze and KFC.
          
                              MILO
                    Ha ha.
          
          Milo surreptitiously sniffs himself.
          
                              CASS
                    Anywho. If these dirty cops have my
                    source hostage somewhere...
          
          Milo starts to laugh. Cass flushes:
          
                              CASS
                    What's so funny?
          
                                                                  56.
          
          
                              MILO
                    You think dirty cops are trying to
                    kill you? Look, I know you think
                    you're hot shit and everything, but
                    I'm pretty sure the only one around
                    here who might want to kill you is
                    me.
          
          Cass SEES A DARK CHEVY in the rearview mirror, gets a look at
          the driver and goes pale.
          
                              CASS
                    Oh no.
          
                              MILO
                    What?
          
                              CASS
                    Behind us. It's him. The guy I saw
                    back at the casino.
          
          Milo glances into the mirror, checking the guy out.
          
                              MILO
                    Yeah? He doesn't look like a cop to
                    me.
          
                              CASS
                        (freaking out)
                    Speed up!
          
                              MILO
                    Would you just calm down for a
                    second and...
          
                              CASS
                    NO!!
          
          Cass kicks a leg over and SLAMS HER FOOT ONTO THE GAS. The
          car LEAPS forward...
          
                              MILO
                    Jesus christ...
          
          Milo tries to push her foot off the gas while they wrestle
          for the wheel. THE CAR DOES A CRAZY ZIG-ZAG BACK AND FORTH...
          
                              MILO
                    LISTEN, YOU MANIAC...
          
                              CASS

                              MILO
                    ...LET GO...
          
                              CASS
                    MILO...
          
                              MILO
                    ...NO ONE IS TRYING TO KILL YOU...
          
                              CASS
                    MILO!!!
          
          She points past him. Milo turns to see MAHLER DRIVING BESIDE
          THEM, GUN POINTED AT MILO'S HEAD.
          
                              MILO
                    SHIT!!!
          
          They both duck as Mahler starts firing. GLASS SHATTERS ALL
          AROUND THEM. MILO PULLS OUT HIS GUN and STARTS FIRING BACK...
          
          
          EXT HIGHWAY- EARLY EVENING
          
          BOTH CARS VEER WILDLY FROM LANE TO LANE AS MILO AND MAHLER
          FIRE AT EACH OTHER...
          
          CLOSE ON- THE CADILLAC'S REAR TIRE, AS IT GOES FLAT FROM A

          INT CADILLAC- EARLY EVENING
          
          MILO GRIPS THE WHEEL AS THE CAR STARTS TO DRAG AND LOSE
          GROUND. Cass is hunched over in the passenger seat, excited
          and frightened at the same time.
          
          Mahler pulls alongside them again and Milo WRENCHES the wheel
          to the left, SLAMMING THE CADILLAC INTO MAHLER'S CAR.
          Mahler's car goes skidding across the road, hits a ditch and
          FLIPS ONTO ITS SIDE.
          
          
          EXT HIGHWAY- EARLY EVENING
          
          The cadillac SPEEDS away, leaving Mahler's car behind.
          
          
          EXT HIGHWAY- EARLY EVENING
          
          The Cadillac is parked on the shoulder, Milo changing the
          tire, Cass standing by the passenger door, still handcuffed,
          EXCITED:
          
                                                                  58.
          
          
                              CASS
                    I told you they were trying to kill
                    me!
          
                              MILO
                    Yeah, well, no one's killing you
                    until I get you to jail.
          
          Cass whips her head around to look at him:
          
                              CASS
                    You're still taking me to jail? But
                    it's the cops who are after me.
          
                              MILO
                    First of all: that guy was not a
                    cop. Second of all, we just left
                    him unconscious in a ditch. You'll
                    be fine.
          
                              CASS
                    But...this is important! This is my
                    job!
          
                               MILO
                    And this...(pointing between them)
                    is my job.
          
                              CASS
                    Milo, you don't understand what's
                    going on!
          
          Milo rolls his eyes and straightens up.
          
                              MILO
                    I'll lay it out for you: some loser
                    with a minor sheet calls you up and
                    says, hey, I've got a big story for
                    you, you interested? It'll only
                    cost you a couple hundred bucks,
                    and I'll tip you onto some criminal
                    activity, it's your chance to
                    expose some bad guys and write the
                    story of your life. Then the moron
                    gets himself caught, he's probably
                    in cold storage somewhere, and now
                    you think the bad guys are after
                    you. (beat) See? I get it. I just
                    don't care.
          
          Milo finishes with the tire, throws the jack in the back, and
          heads back around to the driver's seat.
          
                                                                 59.
          
          
          Cass watches him closely, getting an idea. She reaches into
          her pocket and pulls out the paper from Jimmy.
          
                               CASS
                         (CASUALLY)
                    If only I knew exactly when and
                    where this deal was going down.
                    Course, if I can't figure out that
                    part, then you definitely can't
                    figure out that part, because we
                    both know I'm much smarter than
                    you.
          
          Milo flinches, then forces a laugh.
          
                              MILO
                    Please. My brain can dance circles
                    around your brain.
          
                              CASS
                    I don't even know what that means.
          
                              MILO
                    Case closed.
          
                              CASS
                        (SHRUGGING)
                    Fine. Guess we'll never know.
          
          Milo hesitates. Then decides: fuck it. He strides around the
          car and SNATCHES the paper from her hand. He reads:
          
                              MILO
                    "Atlantic City. Xmas Eve. Sparrow."
                    What's "Sparrow"?
          
                              CASS
                    I knew you couldn't figure it out.
          
                              MILO
                        (QUICKLY)
                    It's a business.
          
                                CASS
                    No.
          
                                MILO
                    Casino.
          
                                CASS
                    Nope.
          
                                MILO
                    Stripper?
          
                                                                 60.
          
          
                              CASS
                    I don't think so. What kind of
                    strip bars have you been going to,
                    anyway?
          
          Milo stares at the paper, wracking his brain. Cass sighs
          loudly and SNATCHES the paper back.
          
                              CASS
                    Oh, well, forget it, I knew you
                    couldn't do it.
          
                              MILO
                    Please. I could crack that story
                    and still get you to jail on time.
          
                                 CASS
                    Oh yeah?
          
          Cass stares him in the eye and says the magic words:
          
                                 CASS
                    Wanna bet?
          
          Milo stares at her. She stares back. Long beat. Milo's face
          is red. He clenches his fists. He unclenches them. Fuck. He
          thrusts out his hand:
          
                                 MILO
                    You're on.
          
          They shake.
          
                              MILO
                    I have to make a call.
          
          He starts to walk away.
          
                              CASS
                    Hey. Aren't you going to uncuff me?
          
                              MILO
                    Why? You going somewhere?
          
                                 CASS
                    Um...no.
          
                              MILO
                    Then you don't need to be uncuffed.
          
                                                                  61.
          
          
          INT CADILLAC- MOMENTS LATER
          
          Cass sits in the passenger seat and watches in the rearview
          mirror while Milo paces behind the car, on the phone.
          
                              CASS
                        (to herself)
                    Asshole.
          
          
          EXT CADILLAC- EARLY EVENING
          
          Milo is talking to Sid:
          
                              MILO
                    So there's just gonna be a little
                    delay...
          
          SPLIT-SCREEN:
          
          INT MALL- EARLY EVENING
          
          Sid's at the mall. On Dec 23rd. With all the other desperate,
          last-minute shoppers. In other words, HE'S IN HELL.
          
                              SID
                    I don't get it. Why are you helping
                    her?
          
                              MILO
                    But that's the beauty of it, Sid,
                    I'm not helping her, she only
                    thinks I'm helping her.
          
                              SID
                    Yeah? If you're not helping her,
                    what are you doing?
          
          Milo notices Cass watching him and turns his back slightly.
          
          
          INT CADILLAC- EARLY EVENING
          
          Cass narrows her eyes:
          
                              CASS
                        (to herself)
                    What is he up to?
          
          
          EXT CADILLAC- EARLY EVENING
          
          Milo is making this up as he goes along:
          
                                                                  62.
          
          
                              MILO
                    I'll tell you what I'm doing: I'm
                    gonna crack this case first, and
                    I'm gonna take all the credit. Who
                    knows, maybe I'll even get my job
                    back....
          
                              SID
                    You are so full of shit. You don't
                    want your job back. You just want
                    to prove you're smarter than she
                    is.
          
                              MILO
                        (instantly heated)
                    I am smarter than she is. I would
                    have cracked that 13th Street case
                    way before she did if she hadn't...
          
                              SID
                    ...cheated, right, I know, you've
                    told me a million times. Did it
                    ever occur to you that a normal
                    couple wouldn't compete the way you
                    guys do in the first place?
          
          Sid spots what he is looking for. So does another last-minute
          shopper. They both reach for the toy.
          
                              MILO
                    This from the man currently trying
                    to prove to his wife he can handle
                    Xmas.
          
                              SID
                        (instantly heated)
                    I can handle Xmas!
          
          Sid WRENCHES the toy from the other shopper.
          
                              MILO
                    Just..trust me, Ok?
          
                              SID
                    Do I have a choice?
          
                              MILO
                    Nope.
          
          Milo hangs up and gets in the car.
          
                                                                 63.

          The cadillac pulls a U-turn and HEADS BACK TOWARDS ATLANTIC
          CITY.
          
          CHIRON: "6:00 PM. ROUTE 9 SOUTH. 39 HOURS TO GO."
          
                              MILO (O.S.)
                    So. Atlantic City. Xmas Eve...
          
          
          EXT HOTDOG STAND- EVENING
          
          Milo buys a chili dog while talking to Cass who stands next
          to him, handcuffed.
          
                              MILO
                    ...so what exactly are these dirty
                    cops supposed to be doing?
          
                              CASS
                    Stealing evidence from property
                    rooms. Then destroying it, for the
                    right price.
          
          Milo stares.
          
                              CASS
                    What?
          
                              MILO
                    Nothing. It's just...it's a good
                    idea. If it weren't, you know.
                    Wrong. (continuing) So. Your plan
                    is to catch them red-handed before
                    they can destroy the evidence, then
                    write an expose for the paper and
                    win yourself another big award.
          
                              CASS
                    Something like that.
          
                              MILO
                    Only, you don't know what Sparrow
                    is. (thinking) Could be a nickname.
                    Or the place where the evidence is
                    stashed. Or a code word of some
                    kind. But the guy who knows has
                    gone missing, and you think the
                    dirty cops got a hold of him.
          
                                                                  64.

                    When Jimmy called earlier, someone
                    else was there. And they
                    disconnected the call.
          
          Milo is staring at her.
          
                              MILO
                    So we find your source, we find the
                    dirty cops. Gimme your phone.
          
          She hands it to him. Milo checks the record of incoming calls
          and smiles.
          
                                CASS

                    I need an address to go with a

          EXT GARAGE- EVENING
          
          A tow truck is pulling up, towing Mahler's car. The tow truck
          driver turns to Mahler, who is in the passenger seat:
          
                              TOW TRUCK DRIVER
                    The garage is closed for the night.
                    Guess you'll have to wait til
                    tomorrow.
          
                                                                 65.
          
          
          Mahler thinks this over, then SMACKS THE DRIVER ACROSS THE
          FACE WITH THE BUTT OF HIS GUN. The driver crumples in his
          seat.
          
                                 MAHLER
                    Guess not.
          
          Mahler leans across him, opens the driver's side door, and
          BOOTS him out of the cab.

          The tow truck is driving away from the garage.

          Milo climbs back into the car, holding a piece of paper with
          the words "Trump Casino, room 2504" on it. He grins at Cass.
          
                              CASS
                    Pretty proud of yourself, ey?
          
                              MILO
                    Hey. You're a reporter. Great. But
                    I used to be a cop. Let's face it:
                    I'm naturally gonna be one step
                    ahead of you.
          
                              CASS
                        (under her breath)
                    You weren't last time.
          
          Milo whips his head around:
          
                              MILO
                    What did you say?
          
                              CASS
                    I said you're doing a great job.

          The Trump Casino on the strip, coming into view...
          
          
          EXT TRUMP CASINO- EVENING
          
          Milo pulls into the crowded parking lot and checks the
          cartridge of his gun. Beside him, Cass is bubbling over with
          excited energy:
          
                                                                  66.
          
          
                              CASS
                    Ok, here's what I think we should
                    do: I'll go up first, Jimmy knows
                    me, so if anything's wrong I'm sure
                    he'll give me a sign...
          
                              MILO
                    Excellent plan. Oh, except you're
                    staying in the car.
          
          Milo exits the car.
          
                              CASS
                        (shouting after him)
                    But...it's my story!
          
          But he is already headed for the casino entrance. He waves at
          her and disappears inside.
          
                                CASS
                    Asshole.
          
          
          INT TRUMP CASINO- EVENING
          
          Milo glides through the casino, past the blinking lights of
          the slot machines, headed for the elevators. A DRUNK GUY in a
          Hawaiian shirt is coming towards him and HE AND MILO
          COLLIDE...
          
                              MILO
                        (steadying the guy)
                    You Ok? My bad.
          
                              DRUNK GUY
                    Watch where you're going. (under
                    his breath) Prick.
          
          The drunk guy continues past. Milo holds up THE ROOM CARD KEY
          HE HAS JUST SWIPED FROM THE GUY:
          
                              MILO
                        (calling after him)
                    Merry Xmas to you, too!
          
          
          INT TRUMP CASINO 25TH FLOOR- EVENING
          
          The elevator dings and Milo exits. He turns a corner and
          heads down the hall. Another elevator DINGS behind him.
          
          Milo continues down the hall. Suddenly, he STOPS and looks
          behind him. No one is there.
          
                                                                    67.
          
          
          He turns another corner and FINDS 2504. There is a "DO NOT
          DISTURB" sign on the door. HE GOES PAST IT AND TAPS LIGHTLY
          ON 2505.
          
                              MILO
                    Room service.
          
          No answer. He glances down the hall and sees a slight
          movement. SOMEONE IS WATCHING HIM. He moves away from the
          door, continues down the hall, THEN SLIPS INTO THE ICE
          MACHINE ROOM...
          
          
          INT ICE MACHINE ROOM- CONTINUOUS
          
          Milo hits the light switch off and waits just inside the
          door. Someone steps in, and MILO GRABS THEM AND THROWS THEM
          AGAINST THE WALL. The person SCREAMS. Milo slaps a hand
          across the person's mouth and switches on the light. And
          finds himself face to face with:
          
          CASS.
          
                              MILO
                    What the...?
          
          He looks at the handcuff dangling from her wrist, STILL
          ATTACHED TO THE CAR DOOR ARM REST.
          
                              MILO
                        (loud whisper)
                    What the hell are you doing?
          
                               CASS
                        (SAME)
                    It's my story, I don't break
                    stories by staying in the car!
          
                              MILO
                    Yeah, well, (re: the armrest)
                    you're paying for that.
          
                              CASS
                    Oh, ok. Here's a nickle.
          
          Suddenly, Milo goes still. THERE IS A CREAKING SOUND as
          someone creeps down the hall. Milo puts a finger to Cass'
          lips.
          
          Then he peeks out the door.
          
          MILO'S POV- THE CLEANING CART BEING SLOWLY WHEELED DOWN THE
          HALL BY THE MAID. The maid stops by a room and enters.
          
                                                                  68.
          
          
                              MILO
                    Perfect. (to Cass) Play along.
          
          
          INT HALLWAY- EVENING
          
          Milo passes the maid's cart, glancing at her ROOM RECORD
          SHEET, then continues on to room 2505. He uses the CARD HE
          SWIPED on the door. Of course, IT DOESN'T WORK.
          
                               MILO
                        (LOUD)
                    Godammit. Son of a bitch.
          
          The maid peeks out into the hall.
          
                              MILO
                        (to Cass)
                    This is like the third card they've
                    given me...
          
                              CASS
                        (playing along)
                    Take it easy, honey...
          
                              MILO
                    Don't tell me to take it easy, now
                    we have to go all the way
                    downstairs again...
          
          Cass looks pleadingly at the maid.
          
                              MAID
                    What's the name?
          
                              MILO
                    Davenport. Room 2505.
          
          The maid checks her chart, then crosses the hall and USES HER
          PASS KEY TO OPEN THE DOOR.
          
                              MILO
                    You're an angel.
          
          Milo and Cass go inside.
          
          
          INT ROOM 2505- EVENING
          
          Milo closes the door carefully behind them, then tiptoes
          across the room to the connecting door, Cass close on his
          heels. All is silent.
          
                                                                    69.
          
          
                              CASS
                        (WHISPERING)
                    Wait a second: where's my gun?
          
                               MILO
                        (SAME)
                    I don't know. Where is your gun?
          
                              CASS
                    I don't have one.
          
                              MILO
                    Then you've answered your own
                    question.
          
          Milo tiptoes closer to the door. Cass pulls on his sleeve.
          
                              CASS
                    Come on, give me something. You've
                    got, like, a million weapons in the
                    jacket.
          
          She reaches for his jacket, and Milo pulls away.
          
                              MILO
                    Hey. These are not toys. You can't
                    just give them to someone and have
                    them know how to use them.
          
                              CASS
                    I seem to remember doing just fine
                    with your taser gun.
          
          They are at the door. Milo puts a finger to his lips and
          tries the doorknob: LOCKED. He is about to work the lock when
          THEY HEAR SCREAMS COMING FROM THE LOCKED ROOM.
          
          No time to do this quietly. MILO TAKES A STEP BACK, THEN
          KICKS THE DOOR IN...
          
          
          INT HALLWAY- EVENING
          
          Halfway down the hallway, THE MAID HEARS THE DOOR BEING
          KICKED IN. Nervous, she backs away, headed for the
          elevators...
          
          
          INT ROOM 2504- CONTINUOUS
          
          Milo QUICKLY ENTERS THE ROOM, GUN RAISED. THE SCREAMING IS
          COMING FROM THE TV. Milo clicks it off and checks the room.
          The place appears to be deserted. He crosses to the bathroom
          and peers in: EMPTY.
          
                                                                 70.
          
          
          Meanwhile, Cass has cautiously entered the room and sees
          spots on the rug:
          
                              CASS
                    Oh, god, is that blood?
          
                              MILO
                    Hey. Columbo. Wait by the door.
          
                              CASS
                    I'm just trying to...
          
                              MILO
                    This could be a crime scene. There
                    are clues all over this room that
                    only a trained eye can find. And as
                    I seem to recall, you were the one
                    who was unable to figure this out
                    by herself.
          
          Oooh. Cass grits her teeth.
          
                              CASS
                        (under her breath)
                    He is unbelievable.
          
                              MILO
                    Who are you talking to, your
                    imaginary friend Leslie?
          
                              CASS
                        (BLUSHING)
                    Hey. Lots of kids have imaginary
                    friends, despite what my mother
                    believes.
          
                              MILO
                    Whatever. You wait by the door. And
                    I'll handle this.
          
                              CASS
                        (PISSED)
                    Fine.
          
          She moves back to the door. As she does, she notices a
          matchbook on the floor: IT'S A GREEN MATCHBOOK WITH A BLACK
          SILHOUETTE OF A HORSE.
          
                              CASS
                    So you're saying you don't want my
                    help.
          
                              MILO
                    I'm saying I don't need your help.
          
                                                                 71.
          
          
                                CASS
                          (SHRUGGING)
                    Ok.
          
          As he turns away, SHE SLIPS THE MATCHBOOK INTO HER PURSE.
          Milo catches this movement out of the corner of his eye and
          glances back:
          
                              MILO
                    What was that?
          
                              CASS
                        (INNOCENTLY)
                    What was what?
          
                              MILO
                    Did you find something?
          
                              CASS
                    How could I find anything? I'm not
                    the detective.
          
                              MILO
                    Lemme see your purse...
          
          Milo takes a step closer to her, but:
          
                                VOICE
                    FREEZE!
          
          Cass and Milo turn to see A HOTEL SECURITY GUARD IN THE
          DOORWAY, EXCITEDLY POINTING HIS GUN AT THEM. Milo rolls his
          eyes.
          
                              GUARD
                    Hotel security! Stay where you are!
          
                              MILO
                    Ok, Ok, no problem. You're probably
                    gonna want this.
          
          Milo holds up HIS GUN.
          
                              GUARD
                        (PANICKED)
                    DROP THE WEAPON, NOW!
          
                              MILO
                    Take it easy. I'm just gonna unload
                    it.
          
          Milo drops the cartridge, then TOSSES THE GUN RIGHT AT THE
          GUARD'S FACE.
          
                                                                   72.
          
          
          The guard instinctively raises his hands and Milo CHARGES
          him, tackling him to the ground, then handcuffing him to the
          table.
          
          Milo GRABS Cass hand and races from the room.
          
          
          INT HALLWAY- EVENING
          
          Cass and Milo run up to the elevators. ALL CARS ARE RISING:
          BACK-UP IS ON THE WAY. Milo hits the fire alarm and pulls
          Cass into the stairwell...
          
          
          INT STAIRWELL- EVENING
          
          Milo and Cass are almost to the bottom, WHEN SECURITY APPEARS
          IN THE STAIRWELL BENEATH THEM. Milo looks up. SECURITY IS
          COMING FROM ABOVE, AS WELL. Shit. Milo cracks the stairwell
          window and peers out: THEY ARE 4 STORIES UP.
          
                              MILO
                    You're gonna have to jump.
          
                                 CASS
                    I can't.
          
          Milo considers this, then picks her up and TOSSES HER OUT THE
          WINDOW.
          
          
          EXT TRUMP CASINO- EVENING
          
          Cass screams as she falls. Milo falls next to her. They fall
          and fall and BOOSH: THEY LAND IN A SNOW BANK AND TUMBLE TO
          THE GROUND.
          
          Seconds later, they are on their feet, RUNNING FOR THE CAR.
          
                              BOBBY (O.S.)
                    Ok, so some guy you're looking for
                    has disappeared. You want me to put
                    out an all-points on him?
          
          
          INT CADILLAC- EVENING
          
          Milo and Cass are speeding away from the Trump Casino.
          
                              MILO
                        (into phone)
                    The thing is, Bob: Cass thinks
                    dirty cops might be involved.
          
                                                                 73.

          INT POLICE STATION- EVENING
          
          Bobby is in his office. His door opens onto the squad room,
          busy with police activity. Bobby sits up straighter in his
          chair.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're with
                    Cassidy? Shit, Milo, you know when
                    you're around her your brain turns
                    to mush.
          
                              MILO
                    Yeah, well, that doesn't change the
                    fact that someone took a couple
                    shots at us.
          
          Beat.
          
                              BOBBY
                    You get a plate number?
          
                              MILO
                    Happened too quick. But it was a
                    dark 4-door Chevy, blue or grey,
                    New Jersey plates, and the car was
                    wrecked, I know that.
          
          Bobby thinks this over.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Ok. Lemme look into it. See what I
                    can find. Just hold tight, Ok?
          
          Milo checks his watch.
          
                              MILO
                    Ok. But we're kinda on a clock
                    here.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Milo, don't fuck around with this.
                    If there are dirty cops in the
                    house, we all have a problem. So do
                    me a favor: get off the strip, find
                    somewhere to lie low and wait for
                    my call.
          
                                                                   74.
          
          
          EXT BACK OF TRUMP CASINO- EVENING
          
          The scene has calmed down a little. A DARK SEDAN appears and
          RAY AND DWIGHT exit the car, looking like a an ugly,
          dangerous Odd Couple.
          
          An employee slips out the back door and hands Ray a PHOTO
          FROM SECURITY OF MILO AND CASS IN THE CASINO PARKING LOT.
          Dwight snatches the photo from Ray.
          
                              DWIGHT
                    Yeah, that's him.
          
                              RAY
                    Who's the chick?
          
                              DWIGHT
                    Who gives a fuck? Anyway, they
                    can't be far.
          
          It's true. They aren't too far. They are:
          
          
          EXT OFF ROUTE 9- EVENING
          
          A LUXURIOUS, ROMANTIC B&B. Xmas lights winking on the trees,
          "Come All Ye Faithful" gently wafting out the oak front door.
          
          CHIRON: "9:00 PM. ROUTE 9 SOUTH. 36 HOURS TO GO."
          
          The whole scene looks beautiful, peaceful, romantic...
          
                              CASS (O.S.)
                    Ok. Kill me now.
          
          PULL BACK TO REVEAL MILO AND CASS, parked in front. REVEAL
          THE SIGN NEXT TO THEM: "WELCOME TO CUPID'S CABIN". Yup. The
          place Milo and Cass ran off to and got married 3 years ago.
          
                              MILO
                    I'm sorry, it's the only place I
                    know off the strip.
          
                              CASS
                    I'm not going in. What if they
                    remember us?
          
                              MILO
                    They won't remember us. Why would
                    they remember us? Just...try to act
                    normal.
          
                                                                    75.
          
          
          INT LUXURY B&B- EVENING
          
          A small, family-run, luxury bed and breakfast. The kind of
          place that prides itself on its service. DAWN (long, graying
          hair, glasses, moccasins) greets them with a smile:
          
                              DAWN
                    Can I help you? (realizing) Wait,
                    it can't be...
          
          She looks behind her at a bulletin board. At photos of all
          the happy couples who have passed through her. And finds: A
          PHOTO OF MILO AND CASS, ARMS AROUND EACH OTHER, DRINKING
          CHAMPAGNE, CASS SHOWING OFF AN ENGAGEMENT RING.

                    Edmund, come quick!
          
          A balding man in flannel comes out, takes one look, and
          clasps both hands to his chest.
          
                              EDMUND
                    Be still my beating heart.

                        (LOW)
                    Looks like they remember us.

                    What a lovely surprise. It's been,
                    what, 3 years?
          
          Milo and Cass both try to downplay:
          
                                 MILO
                    Has it?
          
                              CASS
                    I don't really remember...
          
                              DAWN

                              CASS
                    Actually, we're not...
          
                               DAWN
                    You know what? In light of this
                    special special occasion: it's on
                    the house!
          
          Before Cass can protest more, MILO GRABS HER ARM.
          
                              MILO
                    Honey? Can I talk to you?
          
          He pulls her slightly aside.
          
                              MILO
                        (LOW)
                    You have any money?
          
                               CASS
                        (SAME)
                    No, as you recall, I gave you all
                    my money at the blackjack table...
                    (realizing) You blew all the money!
          
                              MILO
                    Hey! I would have won it back if
                    someone hadn't tasered me in the
                    bathroom!
          
                              CASS
                    So. Use a credit card.
          
                              MILO
                    Mine's max'd. Lemme have yours.
          
                              CASS
                    Mine's max'd too. (off his look)
                    What, I like to shop.
          
          They give each other a horrified look as they both realize
          what this means. Then they turn back to the couple, put their
          arms around each other, and smile:
          
                              MILO/CASS
                    It's our third anniversary!
          
                              DAWN/EDMUND
                    Congratulations!

                    Thanks!
          
          Milo and Cass snuggle closer. He surreptitiously squeezes her
          ass. She surreptitiously STOMPS on his foot.
          
          
          INT LUXURY B&B DINING-ROOM- EVENING
          
          Full of couples in love. Young couples, old couples, gay
          couples, straight couples. Even a dog couple snuggled up by
          the fire.
          
          And then there's Milo and Cass, bruised and dishevelled,
          being served an elaborate romantic meal. They smile
          uncomfortably as Edmund arrives with a tray of oysters:
          
                              EDMUND
                    To begin: a little aphrodisiac!
          
          He gives them both a broad wink.
          
                                 MILO
                           (GRIMLY)
                    Wow.

                        (SAME)
                    Great.
          
                              EDMUND
                    So tell me: how have you managed to
                    keep the romance alive all this
                    time?
          
                              MILO
                    Well, I'll tell you, Edmund.
                    The secret to our success is that
                    the little woman here knows her
                    place. She cleans for me, cooks for
                    me, and every night when I come
                    home she gets down on her knees and
                    massages my feet.
          
          He beams at Cass. Cass grins through her teeth.
          
                              CASS
                    Yes, Edmund, it's true. I massage
                    his feet to help him feel like a
                    man. It's important, especially
                    when your husband has such a teeny
                    tiny...
          
          Just then, Dawn hustles over, interrupting:
          
                                                                 78.
          
          
                              DAWN
                    How is everything? Is it like that
                    magical night 3 years ago?
          
                              CASS
                    Uh-huh.
          
                              MILO
                    Yup. You betcha.
          
                              DAWN
                    This calls for a toast!
          
          She raises a glass, tapping it with a spoon. Milo and Cass
          both groan under their breath.
          
                              DAWN
                        (to the room)
                    May I have your attention please?
                    Edmund and I would like to share
                    with you the most romantic moment
                    we have ever seen. It was three
                    years ago today, in this very
                    restaurant, when this lovely young
                    man here, right in the middle of
                    the meal, threw down his napkin,
                    got down on one knee, and said
                    marry me, right now, right this
                    second, I want to go to sleep
                    tonight knowing you're my wife!
          
                              EDMUND
                        (jumping in)
                    And she said yes, with tears in her
                    eyes and a tremble in her hand,
                    let's get married, and they ran out
                    to the all night chapel and came
                    back an hour later, man and wife!
          
          The whole restaurant starts clapping. Milo turns to Edmund:
          
                              MILO
                    Can I get a whiskey?
          
                              CASS
                    Make that two.
          
          
          INT LUXURY B&B HALLWAY- NIGHT
          
          Milo and Cass stumble down the hall, laughing hysterically,
          falling down drunk.
          
                                                                  79.
          
          
                              MILO
                    After we broke up, I was so mad at
                    you, I told everyone I know you
                    have herpes.
          
                               CASS
                    I told everyone you flunked out of
                    3rd grade.
          
                               MILO
                    I told everyone you have a
                    moustache.
          
                              CASS
                    I told everyone you like to wear my
                    panties.
          
                              MILO
                    Hey!
          
          This one is obviously true. Both laugh harder.
          
          
          INT LUXURY B&B HONEYMOON SUITE- NIGHT
          
          Milo and Cass stagger in, blinking hazily at their new
          surroundings. A heart-shaped bed. Champagne. A bubble bath. A
          fireplace. The works. Like Cupid threw up in here.
          
          The laughter slowly fades. Long beat. Then:
          
                              CASS
                    Wow. This would be really awkward
                    if we still had feelings for each
                    other. Which we don't...
          
                              MILO
                    That's right. Luckily, we're
                    different people now. We don't feel
                    the way we used to.
          
                              CASS
                    Right. We've moved on.
          
                              MILO
                    We have no feelings about each
                    other whatsoever.
          
                              MILO
                    Just two people who used to know
                    each other.
          
                              CASS
                    Two casual acquaintances.
          
                                                                 80.
          
          
                                 MILO
                       Feels good, doesn't it?
          
                                 CASS
                       Feels fantastic.
          
                                 MILO
                       A platonic relationship. Working
                       together.
          
                                 CASS
                       Helping each other.
          
                                 MILO
                       Trusting each other.
          
          Which reminds them: THEY DON'T TRUST EACH OTHER. Awkward
          pause. Then:
          
                                 CASS
                       Well. Mind if I shower?
          
                                 MILO
                       Ladies first.
          
          Cass disappears into the bathroom, closing the door behind
          her. Beat. Then MILO HURRIES OVER TO THE DOOR AND LISTENS.
          
          
          INT LUXURY B&B BATHROOM- NIGHT
          
          CASS IS PRESSED ON HER SIDE OF THE DOOR, ALSO LISTENING. She
          reaches over and turns on the shower.
          
          
          INT LUXURY B&B HONEYMOON SUITE- NIGHT
          
          As soon as Milo hears the water, HE HURRIES OVER TO THE BED
          WHERE CASS LEFT HER PURSE. HE STARTS DIGGING THROUGH IT.
          
          MEANWHILE:
          
          
          INT LUXURY B&B BATHROOM- NIGHT
          
          Cass is seated on the toilet lid, HUNCHED OVER HER PHONE:
          
                                 CASS
                           (LOW)
                       Hey. It's me.
          
                                 MOM (O.S.)
                       Sheryl?
          
                                                                    81.

                                 CASS
                       No, not Sheryl. Cass. (beat) Your
                       daughter.

                       ya, Niagara Falls?
          
                                 CASS
                       No. You're not gonna believe this,
                       but: I'm at Cupid's Cabin with
                       Milo.

                       Mom. We're not back together.
          
          Long beat.

                       Why the hell not?

          Milo is looking through Cass' purse. HE KNOWS SHE WAS HIDING
          SOMETHING FROM HIM AT THE CASINO. While searching through her
          wallet, he suddenly stumbles across A WEDDING PHOTO OF
          HIMSELF AND CASS.
          
          Huh. He glances at the bathroom door. She carries their
          wedding photo around?
          
          
          INT LUXURY B&B BATHROOM- NIGHT
          
          Cass listens while Mom rants:
          
                                                                  82.
          
          
                              MOM
                    I mean, I just don't get it, you're
                    in this romantic place, you have a
                    perfect opportunity to win him
                    back...
          
                              CASS
                    Why should I have to win him back?
                    He should have to win me back! And
                    who says I want him back, anyway?
          
                              MOM
                    I have never understood this
                    competitive streak of yours...
          
                              CASS
                        (losing her patience)
                    Look, the reason I called: I
                    remember you worked at this one
                    place where they had these bright
                    green matches with, like, this
                    silhouette of a horse on them?
          
                              MOM
                        (immediately defensive)
                    That was a long time ago! And all I
                    did was serve drinks...
          
                              CASS
                    I just need to know the name of the
                    place.
          
                              MOM
                    Charley's. And Ok, I admit, maybe I
                    did a little dancing, but how often
                    do you make 200 an hour in tips?
          
                              CASS
                    I gotta go.
          
                              MOM
                    I want grandkids!
          
          Cass hangs up. She sits for a moment, staring at her phone.
          Is her mother right? Is she making a mistake right now? She
          looks around the bathroom. Candles, flowers, thick robes.
          
          A bottle of champagne chilling by the heart-shaped tub. She
          slowly stands and checks herself out in the mirror, brushing
          back her hair with her hands.
          
          Suddenly, on impulse, she grabs the bottle of champagne and
          two glasses. WHAT THE HELL, WHY NOT?
          
                                                                    83.
          
          
          They're here, maybe they should seize the moment. She peeks
          out the bathroom door and sees...
          
          
          INT LUXURY B&B SUITE- NIGHT
          
          MILO, DIGGING THROUGH HER PURSE, FINDING THE MATCHES...

          INT BATHROOM- NIGHT
          
          Cass is disappointed and vindicated all at once. She puts the
          champagne back.
          
                              CASS
                        (to herself)
                    Sneaky bastard.
          
          
          INT LUXURY B&B SUITE- NIGHT
          
          Milo hears the water go off. HE POCKETS THE MATCHES, tosses
          the purse away and lies on the bed, striking a casual pose.
          
          Cass emerges.
          
                              MILO
                    Good shower?
          
                                CASS
                    The best.
          
                                MILO
                    Great.
          
                              CASS
                    You know what's great? Trusting
                    each other.
          
                                MILO
                    I agree.
          
          He holds up the handcuffs:
          
                              MILO
                    Time for bed!

          INT LUXURY B&B SUITE- NIGHT
          
          SNOW IS FALLING OUTSIDE. PAN FROM THE WINDOW, ACROSS THE ROOM
          TO THE BED, ACROSS A SNORING MILO TO CASS, EYES CLOSED, HAND
          CUFFED TO THE HEADBOARD.
          
          Suddenly, CASS' EYES SNAP OPEN. She sits up a little and
          glances over at MILO'S NIGHT TABLE WHERE HE LEFT THE KEYS AND
          GUN IN PLAIN VIEW. She smiles...
          
          
          INT LUXURY B&B SUITE- TEN MINUTES LATER
          
          Cass is doing a slow, careful, ACROBATIC CLIMB ACROSS MILO'S
          BODY in an attempt to reach the gun without waking Milo up.
          She puts a hand on the headboard. She is lifting her knee
          over him, when he stirs.
          
          She freezes, waiting for him to settle. It's like playing
          Twister, only if the person you're playing with finds out,
          HE'S GOING TO KILL YOU.
          
          She manages to get herself STRADDLING HIM, arms stretched,
          THE GUN ALMOST WITHIN REACH, when:
          
                                 MILO
                    Excuse me.
          
          Cass FREEZES.
          
                              MILO
                    What are you doing?
          
          She looks down. Milo is watching her, wide awake. Hmm. This
          is going to be a tough one to explain.
          
                                 CASS
                    Um...
          
                              MILO
                    Are you trying to seduce me?
          
                              CASS
                        (SWALLOWING)
                    Yes. Yes I am.
          
          She tries to reach for the gun while they talk.
          
                              MILO
                        (INNOCENTLY)
                    I didn't know you were still so
                    attracted to me. I mean, I remember
                    how you used to like to greet me at
                    the door in nothing but a...
          
                                                                    85.
          
          
                              CASS
                        (INTERRUPTING)
                    Yes, it's true, I'm still attracted
                    to you.
          
          Her hand is groping around blindly, where the fuck is it? She
          stretches more, bringing her face even closer to Milo's.
          
                               MILO
                    Really? Wow. That's great news. You
                    know what would be really sexy
                    right now?
          
          Uh-oh.
          
                              CASS
                    If we both just went to sleep?
          
                              MILO
                    No. If you talked dirty to me.
          
          The gun seems to be getting father away. THEIR LIPS ARE
          ALMOST TOUCHING NOW...

                    No, I mean, tell me about your
                    attraction to me.
          
                              CASS
                    Um...I can't stop thinking about
                    you.
          
                              MILO
                    Really? What part of me?
          
                              CASS
                    Just...all of you.
          
                              MILO
                    Be specific.
          
          Cass blushes fiercely. If she didn't want that gun so bad...
          
                              MILO
                        (HELPFULLY)

                    Or...something lower like...
          
          He reaches down and WHIPS OUT:

          THE GUN IS IN HIS HAND. That's why she couldn't reach it. HE
          KNEW WHAT SHE WAS UP TO THIS WHOLE TIME. She flips off him
          and back onto her side. Milo sits up, flipping on the lights.
          
                              MILO
                    I knew I couldn't trust you!

                    the matches you found back there in
                    the hotel room?
          
                              CASS
                    When were you gonna tell me you
                    have no intention of helping me
                    with my story?
          
                              MILO
                        (SHRUGGING)
                    You're right. I'm not helping you.
                    This is my story now. This time I
                    get to come out on top! Karma,
                    babe. K-a-r-m-a. Karma....
          
                              CASS
                    Oh my god, would you get over it
                    already! So I cracked the case
                    before you did, it was 3 years ago,
                    it happened, stop being such a baby
                    and move on!
          
                               MILO
                    Oh I'm moving on. You know how I'm
                    moving on? By cracking this case
                    before you, then taking you in so
                    you can spend this Xmas in jail,
                    all alone.
          
          He rolls over, turning his back to her. Cass stares at the
          ceiling, fuming.

          EVIDENCE BOXES THAT ARE STACKED ALONG THE WALLS AND MOVES
          THEM ONTO A MOVER'S DOLLY.
          
                              JIMMY
                    So this is your place, huh? Nice.
                    Cozy. Probably more fun to sit

                    dancers, but...
          
          Mahler has all the boxes loaded up. He grabs a rag and
          approaches Jimmy.

                    Oh. Hey, listen, no need for that,

          Sid passes through, kids in tow, and carrying A HUGE, TANGLED
          BALL OF XMAS LIGHTS. Sid looks like he wants to put a bullet
          through his brain.

                    cleaned out her wallet in 3 years.

                    Nothing. I had her add mayo to your

                    Ok, look: I know you're probably
                    upset that you're not gonna get the
                    story. But a person can't win every

                              CASS
                    Depends on the person.

                    can't win every time.

          SLOWLY SLIDES OFF HIS CHAIR ONTO THE FLOOR. Cass calmly
          reaches across the table, taking his keys and unhandcuffing
          herself.

          Next to an ambulance, Milo is unconscious on a stretcher. An
          EMT prepares a HUGE SYRINGE, picks a spot on Milo's chest,
          then PLUNGES THE NEEDLE INTO IT.
          
                                                                  91.

                    Relax. That was an adrenaline shot.
          
                              MILO
                    I don't believe it. She tried to
                    kill me.
          
          The EMT exchanges a look with the ambulance driver, then
          helps Milo off the stretcher.
          
                              EMT
                    No one tried to kill you, buddy.
                    You just need to be more careful
                    about what you eat.

                    Thanks. Great tip.
          
          He checks his watch, then pulls out the GREEN MATCHBOOK:
          
                              MILO
                    Know where this place is?

                    Sure. Charley's, on the boardwalk.
                    And just FYI: when they say "don't
                    touch" the dancers, they mean with
                    with any part of your body, not
                    just your hands.
          
          The EMT folds the stretcher, loads it into the ambulance, and
          THEY DRIVE AWAY, leaving Milo in the parking lot.

          looking for a window to climb into, when she spots JIMMY'S
          METS' HAT ON THE GROUND.
          
          Shit. Cass stares at the hat: JIMMY IS HERE SOMEWHERE. She
          presses her ear up against the back door:

          Suddenly, SHE HEARS GROANING COMING FROM INSIDE. Or grunting.
          LIKE SOMEONE TRYING TO CALL OUT THROUGH A GAG. She looks
          around. There is a window higher up on the wall. Cass drags a
          trash can beneath the window, stacks another one on top of
          it, and cautiously climbs up.
          
          The window is locked and she can't see through it. Hmm. Fuck
          it. She takes her purse and SMASHES a pane of glass.
          
          She wobbles on trash cans and GRABS THE WINDOWSILL JUST AS
          THE CANS FALL AWAY, LEAVING HER DANGLING.

          see hands and can hear someone cursing under their breath.
          The top of a head appears, then a face: IT'S CASS.
          
          Relieved, Jimmy starts gesturing excitedly for her to come
          in. Cass climbs in, drops to the floor, hurries over to Jimmy
          and ungags him.

                              MILO
                    Don't look around. Just do it.
          
          CLICK. He hangs up.
          
                                                                    97.
          
          
          CLOSE ON- THE BOOTH.

                    You boys mind if I use the ladies
                    room?
          
          
          INT BATHROOM- MOMENTS LATER
          
          Cass enters. Milo is behind the door. He SLAMS the door
          closed after she is in, and blocks her escape.
          
                              MILO
                    You know what my mistake was? I
                    never should have let you out of
                    the trunk. I'm fine, by the way.
                    The doctor said I may have been
                    technically dead for a few seconds,
                    but I'm fine now.
          
          Cass is not impressed. She stares at him coldly.
          
                              CASS
                    So that's what you really think?
                    That I stole information from you?
          
                              MILO
                    It's not what I think, it's what I
                    know. How else did you beat me?
          
                              CASS
                        (as though to a 5 yr old)
                    Did it ever occur to you that I
                    just might be good at my job?
          
          Milo stares at her. Huh. It actually didn't occur to him...
          
                              CASS
                    That's what I thought. You know
                    what, Milo? You're an even bigger
                    asshole than I previously
                    suspected, and you deserve
                    everything that's happened to you.
                    (beat) And everything that's about
                    to happen to you.
          
          "About to happen"? Milo is just starting to realize...
          
                              MILO
                    You wouldn't...
          
                              CASS
                        (SCREAMING)
                    MILO BOYD IS IN HERE!
          
                                                                  98.
          
          
          Son of a bitch. The bathroom door SHOOTS open and DWIGHT AND
          RAY ENTER. They back Milo into a corner. Cass smiles at Milo,
          waves, and exits.

          Cass comes flying out of the club and runs right into:
          MAHLER. HE TAKES ONE LOOKS AT HER AND PUSHES HER BACK INSIDE.

          Dwight and Ray are frisking Milo, taking away his array of
          weapons.
          
                              DWIGHT
                    Wow. You always carry this much
                    gear?
          
                              MILO
                    Only during the holidays.

          Milo is pushed out of the bathroom, and comes face to face
          with CASS. MAHLER APPEARS FROM BEHIND HER, TAKES ONE LOOK AT
          MILO AND POINTS HIS GUN AT MILO'S HEAD.
          
                              MAHLER
                    Remember me?
          
                              DWIGHT
                    What the fuck?
          
          Dwight steps forward from behind Milo, AND POINTS HIS GUN AT
          MAHLER. MAHLER REACTS, SHIFTING THE GUN TO DWIGHT. RAY STEPS
          UP, GUN POINTED AT MAHLER.
          
          Momentary stand-off. Stuck between the bad guys, MILO AND
          CASS GIVE EACH OTHER EVIL LOOKS.
          
          A half-naked dancer appears:
          
                                DANCER
                    Lapdance?
          
          Everyone looks at her. She is just realizing...
          
                              DANCER
                    Maybe I should come back later...

          ...WHEN MILO AND CASS SIMULTANEOUSLY MAKE THEIR MOVES, CASS
          STOMPING ON MAHLER'S FOOT, CAUSING HIM TO LOOSEN HIS HOLD ON
          HER, MILO SLAMMING HIS ELBOW BACK ONTO RAY'S ABDOMEN.
          
          RAY'S GUN GOES OFF AS CASS AND MILO BOTH HIT THE FLOOR.
          MAHLER REACTS, FIRING AT RAY. DWIGHT FIRES AT MAHLER...
          
          TOTAL PANDEMONIUM. Girls screaming, patrons running for the
          exit.
          
          MAHLER AND DWIGHT BOTH GET HIT. Milo crawls over to a moaning
          Dwight and recovers his gun. He looks up in time to see CASS
          DISAPPEARING OUT THE FRONT DOOR.
          
          
          EXT BOARDWALK- AFTERNOON
          
          Milo comes out. THE BOARDWALK IS PACKED, CASS IS LOST IN THE
          CROWD. Milo raises his gun in the air and FIRES. People duck
          and scatter REVEALING CASS, climbing into the Cadillac.
          
          SIRENS...

          Cass jumps into the car and hits the gas. She is pulling
          away, victorious, WHEN THERE IS A SOUND ON THE ROOF.
          
          MILO'S FACE APPEARS, UPSIDE-DOWN, IN THE WINDSHIELD,
          GRINNING.
          
                                CASS
                      Get off the car, Milo.
          
          He gives her the finger.
          
                                CASS
                      Get off the car, you psychopath.
          
                                MILO
                      Oh, I am a psychopath, and you know
                      why? Cause you made me that way.
                      And if I'm going crazy, I'm taking
                      you with me.
          
          He reaches a hand through the driver's window, grabbing at
          her. Cass SCREAMS, squeezes her eyes shut and HITS THE GAS.
          
          MORE SIRENS, RAPIDLY APPROACHING...

          Milo falls into the car, grabbing at the wheel. They fight

          Then Milo turns and glares at Cass, and THE LOOK ON HER FACE
          SAYS SHE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT'S COMING NEXT:

          Milo looks around. He can just make out Pier 19 in the
          distance, a mile or two away.
          
                                                                 102.

          Milo and Cass drive up in the Cadillac and park out of sight.
          They exit the car and look around. The pier seems to be
          deserted. Then they hear a soft motor, and BOBBY APPEARS IN A
          MOTORBOAT.
          
                                 BOBBY

          Bobby is at the back of the boat, steering. Cass and Milo are
          up front, explaining:
          
                                 CASS
                       So, these guys have a bunch of
                       stolen evidence stashed somewhere
                       in Atlantic City...
          
                                 MILO
                       And we think they're ditching it
                       tonight.
          
          A SMALL YACHT APPEARS ON THE HORIZON. Bobby steers the
          motorboat towards it. MILO AND CASS TURN TO LOOK AS THE YACHT
          COMES INTO VIEW. AND AT THE SAME MOMENT, CASS AND MILO MAKE
          OUT THE NAME ON THE SIDE OF THE BOAT:
          
          "SPARROW".
          
                                 BOBBY
                           (CASUALLY)
                       You know, if I was them, I'd store
                       the evidence on a boat, drive the
                       boat about 30 miles out, and blow
                       the whole thing up.
          
          Cass and Milo both slowly turn to find BOBBY POINTING A GUN
          AT THE TWO OF THEM. Off Milo's disappointed look:
          
                                 BOBBY
                       Hey, man. I got mouths to feed.
          
                                                                 103.
          
          
                              MILO
                    Aw. That's what all the dirty cops
                    say.
          
          Bobby quickly frisks Cass, and frisks and disarms Milo. He
          steers the boat one-handed up next to the yacht and cuts the
          motorboats engine.
          
          Milo makes a sudden LUNGE for Bobby and BOBBY CRACKS HIM OVER
          THE BACK OF THE HEAD WITH THE BUTT OF THE GUN, SENDING MILO
          SPRAWLING TO THE BACK OF THE BOAT, RIGHT ON TOP OF THE MOTOR.
          
          Milo struggles back up to a seated position.
          
                              BOBBY
                    You've always been such a stubborn
                    asshole, Milo. You just don't
                    listen. All you had to do was stay
                    where I told you and none of this
                    would have happen. Now the two of
                    you are gonna have to go down with
                    the boat.

          IMAGINABLE: GUNS, VIDEOTAPES, DRUGS, ETC...
          
          PAN PAST A PILE OF EXPLOSIVES WRAPPED WITH CABLE AND ATTACHED
          TO A TIMER, COUNTING DOWN: "1:59, 1:58, 1:57..."
          
          PAN TO MILO AND CASS SEATED ON THE FLOOR, TIED TOGETHER, BACK
          TO BACK, ARMS STRAPPED TO THEIR SIDES.
          
          PAN TO THE DOORWAY, where Bobby stands, inspecting the room.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Ok. Guess that's it. Gotta go.
                    (checking them out) You know what?
                    You guys make a great couple.
          
          Bobby exits and Cass and Milo are alone.
          
          Suddenly, CASS STARTS GIGGLING.
          
                              MILO
                    What's so funny?
          
                              CASS
                    My mom was worried I wouldn't have
                    plans for Xmas Eve.
          
                                                                    104.
          
          
          Cass is laughing harder and harder until MILO REALIZES:
          
                              MILO
                    Hey, are you crying?
          
                              CASS
                        (SOBBING)
                    No. I'm not...
          
          Milo doesn't know what to do. His hands are trapped in front
          of him, he can't even pat her on the shoulder.
          
                              MILO
                    Ok, just don't...
          
                              CASS
                    I'm not crying.
          
                              MILO
                    I know you're not.
          
                              CASS
                    I just...(miserable) I can't
                    believe I going to die by being
                    blown up and sinking to the bottom
                    of the ocean with someone who
                    thinks I'm a total liar.
          
                              MILO
                    We're not gonna die.
          
                              CASS
                    Oh yeah? What's the plan?
          
                              MILO
                        (THINKING)
                    Well...
          
          Milo looks around. There is a SMALL PORTHOLE IN ONE WALL.
          Milo assumes a take-charge manner:
          
                              MILO
                    Ok. Here's what we do. We're going
                    to synchronize our efforts in order
                    to cross the room and manipulate
                    the bomb out of the room and into
                    the water in order to diffuse the
                    explosive impact.
          
          Beat.
          
                              CASS
                    You mean we're going to throw the
                    bomb out the window?
          
                                                                105.
          
          
                              MILO
                    Uh, yeah. Or we can just wait to
                    get blown up.
          
          CLOSE ON- THE TIMER: "1:19, 1:18, 1:17..."
          
                              CASS
                        (QUICKLY)
                    I'm with you. Go, team, go.
          
                              MILO
                    That's the spirit. Ok, first we're
                    going sideways: to the left...
          
          Milo leans one way, Cass leans the other: THEY DON'T MOVE.
          
                              MILO
                    Ok. My left this time...
          
          They both lean to the left and topple over. Milo is facing
          the direction of the bomb.
          
                              MILO
                    Now we're gonna work our way over
                    to the bomb.
          
          They start moving like a sideways inchworm, creeping along.
          
                              MILO
                    And I don't think you're a total
                    liar, but in my own defense, I was
                    one of the top detectives in my
                    division, I had been working that
                    case for months, and then you just
                    waltzed in and solved it.
          
                              CASS
                    I didn't just "waltz in". You know
                    I had been working it for months,
                    too. Isn't it possible that we're
                    both good at our jobs, and I just
                    happened to come out ahead?
          
          Beat.
          
                              MILO
                        (FUMBLING)
                    Oh. Well, I...(blurting out) Look,
                    I was confused, I had never been in
                    love before!
          
                              CASS
                    Well, neither had I!
          
                                                                    106.
          
          
          Milo seems surprised to hear this. But before he can respond,
          THE BOAT ROCKS ON A WAVE AND THEY ARE SENT ROLLING IN CASS'
          DIRECTION. AS THEY ROLL:
          
                                CASS
                    Ow...
          
                                MILO
                    Shit..
          
                                CASS
                    Dammit...
          
          They are stopped when MILO'S FACE IS SLAMMED INTO THE SIDE OF
          THE BOAT. Milo lets out a grunt. Beat.
          
                                CASS
                    Milo?
          
                              MILO
                        (MUFFLED)
                    I'm Ok. Ok, we need to turn to the
                    right, and wait for the next wave.
          
          They both start turning separate ways:
          
                                MILO
                    My right.
          
          They turn to the right and wait. After a moment:
          
                              MILO
                    So. You were in love with me?
          
                              CASS
                    Of course I was in love with you,
                    why do you think I married you?
          
          No response. Behind her back, Milo looks sheepish. Cass
          REALIZES:
          
                              CASS
                    Oh. My. God. You think I married
                    you so I could get info on the
                    case? Who am I, Mata Hari?
          
          Milo looks confused. He is trying to figure out...
          
                              CASS
                    She's a spy, Milo.
          
          Aaah.
          
                                                                 107.
          
          
                              MILO
                        (QUICKLY)
                    I know that. Everybody knows that.
                    Mata Hari the spy.
          
          Beat. Milo clears his throat.
          
                              MILO
                    Well. It might be a little late for
                    this. But...nice job on the
                    article.
          
                              CASS
                    You know, if I had something sharp
                    right now, I would stab you.
          
                              MILO
                    No, really, I mean, it was well-
                    written and...
          
                              CASS
                    Can you just get us out of here,
                    please?
          
          Suddenly, A WAVE HITS THE BOAT, AND THEY GO ROLLING TOWARDS
          THE BOMB. AS THEY ROLL:
          
                              CASS
                    Umph...
          
                              MILO
                    Ughh...
          
                              CASS
                    Son of a...
          
                              MILO
                    Ow...
          
          And they come to a stop, MILO'S FACE PRESSED RIGHT UP TO THE
          BOMB. He watches the timer: "00:44, 00:43, 00:42..."
          
                              CASS
                    Can you see the bomb?
          
                               MILO
                    Uh, yeah. I can see the bomb. Now
                    we get up.
          
          MILO GRABS THE BOMB AND HOLDS IT AGAINST HIS BELLY. Cass and
          Milo push against each other, and struggle up to a standing
          position.
          
          Great. So far, so good.
          
                                                                 108.
          
          
          Only, MILO CAN'T RAISE HIS ARMS. AND THE PORTHOLE IS SIX FEET
          ABOVE THE GROUND. NOW WHAT?
          
                              CASS
                    Did you throw it?
          
                              MILO
                    Not exactly.
          
                              CASS
                    Well, what are you waiting for?
          
                              MILO
                    I'm waiting for a pig to fly in
                    here and grab it.
          
                              CASS
                        (starting to panic again)
                    Milo...
          
                              MILO
                    Ok, Ok. Um, on 3, I need you to
                    jump.
          
          Beat.
          
                              CASS
                    What?
          
                              MILO
                    You know: "jump, jump, jump around,
                    jump."
          
                              CASS
                    Are you serious?
          
                              MILO
                    No. I'm fucking with you. For fun.
                    Just for my own personal
                    enjoyment...
          
                              CASS
                    Ok, Ok.
          
                              MILO
                    Ok: 1, 2, 3...
          
          
          EXT PORTHOLE- EVENING
          
          We see MILO'S HEAD POP INTO VIEW, THEN DISAPPEAR.
          
          CLOSE ON- THE TIMER "00:11, 00:10, 00:09..."
          
                                                                 109.
          
          
          MILO'S HEAD POPS UP HIGHER...
          
          CLOSE ON- THE TIMER "00:06, 00:05, 00:04..."
          
          This time, MILO POPS UP HIGH ENOUGH THAT WE SEE HIS HANDS...
          
          CLOSE ON- THE TIMER "00:03, 00:02, 00:01..."
          
          And finally, MILO IS HIGH ENOUGH THAT HE CAN THRUST THE BOMB
          OUT THE WINDOW...
          
          CLOSE ON THE BOMB AS IT CRASHES INTO THE WATER...
          
          
          INT HULL OF BOAT- EVENING
          
          Milo and Cass, both a little out of breath, stand still,
          listening. Silence.
          
                              CASS
                    Think the water defused it?
          
                              MILO
                    Lemme ask you this? Has anything
                    gone our way yet?
          
          SUDDENLY, A LOW ROAR FROM BENEATH GROWS AND RISES UP BENEATH
          THE BOAT, ROCKING IT WILDLY AS WATER EXPLODES ON ALL SIDES.
          
          Cass and Milo get drenched, BUT ARE SAFE.
          
                                CASS
                    Nice job.
          
                              MILO
                    Hey. You, too.
          
                                CASS
                    Thanks.
          
                              MILO
                    Now lets find something to cut
                    these ropes off...
          
                              CASS
                    Think we can catch that cop?
          
                              MILO
                    Trust me: we can definitely catch
                    that cop.
          
          Because at this very moment...
          
                                                                    110.
          
          
          INT MOTORBOAT- NIGHT
          
          ...Bobby is paddling frantically, pausing every once in a
          while to curse the motor, WHICH FOR SOME REASON REFUSES TO
          START. He see the lights of another boat coming up behind
          him, and he paddles faster.
          
          
          EXT DECK OF YACHT- NIGHT
          
          Milo steers the yacht right up behind Bobby, dwarfing the
          motorboat. Calling out:
          
                              MILO
                    Hey, Bobby. I got one for ya...
          
          Bobby looks up to see MILO POINTING AN ASSAULT RIFLE HE
          GRABBED FROM THE EVIDENCE BOXES:
          
                              MILO
                    What's the difference between a
                    snowman and a snowwoman? (holding
                    something up) The spark plug.
          
          Bobby checks the motor: SO THAT'S WHY IT WON'T RUN. MILO
          GRABBED THE SPARK PLUG. Milo and Cass grin down at Bobby
          while he kicks the motor and swears.
          
          
          EXT PIER 19- DAWN
          
          CHIRON: "6:00 AM. PIER 19. 3 HOURS TO GO."
          
          Cops are everywhere. Cass and Milo are seated on a bench,
          exhausted, watching as THE COPS UNLOAD BOXES OF STOLEN
          EVIDENCE FROM THE YACHT. Bobby is cuffed in the back of a
          squad car.
          
          After a moment:
          
                              MILO
                    Merry Xmas. I got you this.
          
          Milo hands Cass some seaweed.
          
                              CASS
                    You shouldn't have.
          
          Milo checks his watch.
          
                              MILO
                    Hey. I've still got three hours to
                    get you to jail. Looks like I'm
                    gonna win that bet after all.
          
                                                                  111.
          
          
          Cass' eyes go wide. Suddenly, she JUMPS UP and BOLTS.
          
                              MILO
                        (to himself)
                    You have got to be kidding me.
          
          
          EXT BEACH- DAWN
          
          Like an action sequence in slo-mo, Cass stumbles across the
          sand, exhausted, Milo at her heels. Finally, he makes one
          last effort, LUNGES for her, brings her down and SNAPS on the
          cuffs.
          
                               CASS
                        (muffled, face in the
                         SAND)
                    I'm not going without a fight.
          
                              MILO
                    Yeah. I'm getting that.
          
          He pulls her to her feet.
          
          INT JERSEY CITY POLICE STATION- MORNING
          
          Milo leads Cass up to the clerk, both of them looking like a
          mess. He checks his watch:
          
                              MILO
                    9am. See? Easy as pie.(nudging
                    Cass) Go on, say it.
          
                              CASS
                        (to the clerk)
                    I'd like to turn myself in. (can't
                    resist) Though I didn't do anything
                    wrong...
          
                              MILO
                    Stop talking.
          
                              CASS
                    ...and I was unjustly arrested...
          
          To shut her up, Milo GRABS HER AND KISSES HER. THEN SHE IS
          KISSING HIM BACK. TIME STOPS FOR A MOMENT.
          
          Then Milo hands her over to the clerk.
          
                              MILO
                        (to Cass)
                    See ya.
          
                                                                 112.
          
          
                              CASS
                        (a little disoriented)
                    Oh. Ok.
          
          The clerk leads her into the jail.
          
          
          EXT POLICE STATION- MORNING
          
          Milo exits. He passes some cops on their way in. ONE GELMAN,
          THE COP HE INSULTED IN THE BEGINNING.
          
                              GELMAN
                    Hey. It's that jerk-off bounty
                    hunter.
          
          Milo stops in his tracks. Mentally weighs the pros and cons.
          DECIDES:
          
                              MILO
                    Ah, what the hell.
          
          He turns around, walks back to Gelman, AND SMASHES HIM IN THE
          FACE WITH HIS FIST.
          
          
          INT HOLDING CELL- MORNING
          
          Cass is trying to find a clean place to sit down, when MILO
          GETS THROWN INTO THE HOLDING CELL NEXT TO HERS.
          
                              CASS
                    Oh my god, what happened?
          
                              MILO
                    Hey. I couldn't let you spend Xmas
                    alone. Besides, I didn't really
                    have any plans other than drinking
                    some cheap whiskey and putting my
                    fist through a wall.
          
                              CASS
                    I'm touched that you would give
                    that up for me.
          
                              MILO
                    Hey. It's the kind of guy I am.
          
          Cass grins. WEDDING MUSIC KICKS IN:

                               LOIS
                     Of course I was right. I knew
                     they'd get back together if they
                     were just stuck together long
                     enough. And thank god. Better she

                     I love you more.
          
          Cass smiles. Beat. Then:
          
                               CASS
                     Well, I doubt you love me more.
          
                               MILO
