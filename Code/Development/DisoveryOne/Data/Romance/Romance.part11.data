First, over BLACK, we hear the sound of a light rain.

Then:

                    A MAN'S VOICE
          I'm not a poet.  I've never moved
          anyone with my words.
              (beat)
          Maybe that's why they chose me.

EXT.  WOODS - DAY

A mural of leafless trees beneath an overcast sky.  Rain
continues to fall.

Maybe now we begin to notice a strange quality to the light
(or is it the sky?).  Something vaguely unsettling.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BEDROOM - MORNING

Still, the sound of rain is heard.

A MAN

40s, lies on his side in bed, staring at us.

He has not been sleeping.  In fact, judging from his distant
expression, he has not slept in ages.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Less like a road and more like a path that you maneuver a
vehicle through.

The Man, dressed in rain gear, walks down the middle.  He is
accompanied by a medium-sized LABRADOR, and seems in no
particular hurry.

The sound of tires appear and grow in intensity.  The Man,
without saying an actual word, instructs the dog to heal. 
The dog obeys as the Man moves off the road.  The vehicle
hurtles past him -- its engine quiet, its windows darkened --
spraying muddy debris in its wake.

Seconds later, the car brakes abruptly and skids to a stop.

THE MAN

Stops walking and stares at the car, which seems ominously
still.

The car then reverses direction and begins to move toward the
Man, who remains motionless.

When the car is alongside him, a darkened window turns
transparent and we see a WELL-DRESSED BUREAUCRAT in the rear
seat.  His demeanor is pleasant and professional.

                    WELL-DRESSED BUREAUCRAT
          Dr. Kelvin?

The Man he is addressing, who we now understand is CHRIS
KELVIN, stares back at him.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CABIN - DAY

The contrast between the cabin's rustic aesthetic and the
aggressively high-tech equipment contained therein isn't as
jarring as you might imagine.

Kelvin is seated in front of a desk, scrolling through a text
readout on a flat, transparent holographic screen.  Behind
him is the Well-Dressed Bureaucrat from the car, and two
others: A WOMAN in her 50s and a MAN in his 30s.  They are
also well-groomed.  Each of their suits are embroidered with
a small but distinctive LOGO of some sort that composes the
acronym DBA.

Kelvin scrolls through several menus, hits a few keys, and a
digitized VIDEO IMAGE appears on his screen: A MAN, unshaven,
looking into the camera.

The man, GIBARIAN, looks very tired and somewhat apologetic. 
The lower part of the screen has a time of day and date
display that reads: 0221 HRS 11/14/31.

                    GIBARIAN
          We take off into the cosmos, ready
          for anything: solitude, hardship,
          exhaustion, death.  We're proud of
          ourselves, in a way.  But our
          enthusiasm is a sham.  We don't
          want to conquer the cosmos -- we
          want to extend the boundaries of
          Earth to the cosmos.  We are only
          seeking Man.  We don't want Other
          Worlds.  We want mirrors.
              (beat)
          Maybe we don't need to know what it
          is, or why.  Maybe just knowing
          that it is should be enough.

Gibarian stares at the camera for a long moment before
switching it off and ending the transmission.

Kelvin sits back.

The visitors exchange glances.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  SPACE CAPSULE

Close on Kelvin.  We hold on him a long time, as a myriad of
readouts scroll and flash across his face.  A slit of
sunlight glides slowly through frame.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

KELVIN

in the same capsule, a month later.  He is asleep.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

KELVIN

in the same capsule, two months later.  He is dictating some
coordinates to Earth.  He absently scratches his heavy growth
of beard.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

KELVIN

two months later still.  He is looking out his small,
rectangular window, and for the fist time we cut around to
see the approaching planet: SOLARIS.

Kelvin stares at it, hypnotized.  It has a translucent
quality, as though it is lit from within, and its undulating,
ocean-like surface slowly changes colors.

Kelvin's attention is diverted as an orbiting ship, the
PROMETHEUS, edges into frame.

                    KELVIN
          Prometheus, this is Athena 7, on
          approach, do you read me?
              (beat)
          Prometheus, this is Athena 7, on
          approach, do you read me?

No response.  He exhales and types on a keyboard.

EXT.  SPACE

The Athena 7, sporting a DBA logo, advances toward the
Prometheus.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  PROMETHEUS

Kelvin, in a space suit, climbs with some difficulty out of
the Athena 7, which has come to rest in the DOCKING BAY of
the Prometheus.  Several exploratory PODS fill the remainder
of the area.

Kelvin gets his bearings and looks around, but sees no sign
of life.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CORRIDOR

Empty.

(NOTE: Except for some ROBOTIC, NON-SPEAKING CHARACTERS: the
AUTOMATED TASKMASTERS.  These are small, bug-like repair
units that constantly roam the ship, fixing things.  Their
tiny hum is virtually silent, and we see them all the time on
the Prometheus.  They can adhere to any surface at any
angle.)

Kelvin, now out of his space suit and holding a small
carrying case and a duffle bag, moves on.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  GIBARIAN'S ROOM

Ransacked.

Kelvin registers it, then moves to the corner of the room
where the computer terminal rests.  Within moments he has
discovered Gibarian has recorded a video message for him to
replay.

VIDEO

Gibarian addressing the camera.  He appears to be lucid, but
extremely fatigued.

                    GIBARIAN
          Hi, Chris.
              (a light smile)
          I'm so glad you came.
              (beat, the smile fades)
          I still have a little time, and I
          want to tell you something.  To
          warn you.  By now you know about
          me, or if you don't, get Snow or
          Sartorius to tell you; it doesn't
          matter.
              (beat)
          I didn't lose my mind.  You should
          be able to tell from this video. 
          I'm not mad.
              (beat)
          If it happens to you, remember that
          it isn't madness.
              (beat)
          You should know, I'm in favor of
          destroying Solaris.  I know
          that's... illegal.  And unethical. 
          And irresponsible.  But it's the
          only way to make it stop.

A long moment of silence is broken by a noise on the video,
which draws Gibarian's attention offscreen.

                    GIBARIAN
              (addressing whoever made
               the noise)
          Cut that out.  Do you hear me?

Gibarian switches off the video.

The computer screen freezes the last recorded frame and
overlays a readout indicating the file has ended.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CORRIDOR

Empty.  But there is a door at the end of it, slightly open. 
Kelvin moves toward it.

INT.  ROOM

A FIGURE, seated with its back to the door, turns to see
Kelvin enter.  This is SNOW.  He looks Kelvin up and down,
his expression wary and alert.

                    KELVIN
          Snow.  Didn't you hear me radio? 
          I'm Kelvin.

A long beat.  Snow just watches him.

                    SNOW
          Yes.  We heard.

Kelvin takes a step forward, and Snow recoils.

                    KELVIN
          What's wrong?  What happened to
          Gibarian?

                    SNOW
          He's dead.

                    KELVIN
          How?

A beat.

                    SNOW
          Suicide.

Snow exhales, then looks up as though he's remembered
something.

                    SNOW
          You didn't bring any chocolate, did
          you?

                    KELVIN
          What?

                    SNOW
              (musing)
          I love chocolate.  I realized just
          yesterday how much I love it.
              (beat, then he recovers)
          I thought maybe, if they let you
          bring personal effects, you might
          have snuck some through, because...
          well, I've been thinking about it.

A long beat as Kelvin stares at Snow.

                    KELVIN
          What happened here?

Snow lies back in his bunk.

                    SNOW
          I can't talk just now.  I'm too
          tired.

                    KELVIN
          Where's Sartorius?

                    SNOW
          In his lab.  He won't let you in.

                    KELVIN
              (leaving)
          He'll let me in.

                    SNOW
          Kelvin, if you see anything
          unusual...

Kelvin stops, but doesn't turn around.

                    SNOW
          ... try to stay calm.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CORRIDOR

Kelvin stands outside a door.

                    KELVIN
          Let me in.

A beat.

                    SARTORIUS
              (inside, muffled)
          You have to give me your word you
          won't come in.  Then I'll come out.

                    KELVIN
          All right.

Sartorius cracks the door open and slithers through the slit
and into the hallway.  He is of obvious intelligence and not
to be messed with; contentious, intimidating when he wants to
be, and probably brilliant.  Kelvin eyes him suspiciously.

                    KELVIN
          What happened to Gibarian?

                    SARTORIUS
          Didn't you talk to Snow?

                    KELVIN
          I want to hear your version.

                    SARTORIUS
              (incredulous)
          Who, here, could possibly care what
          you want?  At best, you're Employee
          of the Month for the highest bidder
          in the Solaris auction.  They have
          no idea what's going on up here.
          They've never even been in space.
          And I'm supposed to listen to you?

                    KELVIN
          I am here to recover this mission,
          report my findings, and make a
          recommendation.  Now: What happened
          to him?

                    SARTORIUS
          The same thing that could happen to
          any of us.

                    KELVIN
          Where's his body?

                    SARTORIUS
          In the lab.  With her, probably.

                    KELVIN
          Her?  Who are you talking about?

Sartorius is grabbed by something on the other side of his
door.  He struggles to keep his composure.

                    SARTORIUS
          His last wish was to be buried on
          Earth.  In dirt, he said.  "I want
          to buried in dirt."  What a clown.

Sartorius is losing the battle with whomever or whatever is
on the other side of his door.

                    KELVIN
          They shouldn't let people like you
          into space.

                    SARTORIUS
          Just so you know: I'm not going
          back until I understand what it is. 
          I am going to figure out what it
          is, make it stop, and then I will
          go home.

                    KELVIN
          Listen --

                    SARTORIUS
          We're done.  Oh, I should tell you,
          I don't trust Snow.  There's
          something wrong with him.

Sartorius rotates and zips back into his room.  As the door
closes Kelvin sees a flash of ANOTHER FIGURE in Sartorius'
room.  The glimpse was too quick to judge who or what the
other figure could have been.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CORRIDOR - DAY

Kelvin walks, exploring the ship.  He sees something that
stops him:

A NUDE WOMAN

Black, early 20s, slipping across a corridor up ahead.

Kelvin gives chase.  He sees her turn a corner, but by the
time he gets there, she is gone.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  SNOW'S ROOM

Snow is lying on his bunk.

                    KELVIN
          Is there anybody else here?

                    SNOW
              (sits up a little)
          Why, who did you see?

                    KELVIN
          Gibarian warned me.  He left me a
          message.

                    SNOW
          Who was it?

                    KELVIN
          She was real.  Where did she come
          from?

Snow looks at him but doesn't respond.

                    KELVIN
          Tell me.  I won't think you're
          insane.

                    SNOW
          Oh, that's a relief.

Snow lies back down.

                    KELVIN
          Where did she come from?

A beat.

                    SNOW
          How much sleep do you need?

                    KELVIN
          How much sleep?

                    SNOW
          How long can you go without sleep?

                    KELVIN
          That depends.

                    SNOW
          Well, when you do go to sleep:
          barricade your door.

Snow rolls over, away from Kelvin.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  SPACE

Solaris.  Quiet, but still active somehow.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          The Prometheus, as far as I can
          tell, is functionally intact.  Crew
          status: One dead, Gibarian.  Cause
          of death appears to be suicide.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin speaks into a video communication device.  As he does,
we see images of the things and people he describes.

                    KELVIN
          Interviews with the surviving
          members and a perusal of the
          deceased's personal effects
          indicate he was suffering from
          severe depression with psychotic
          features, along with bouts of
          hypomania, dementia, delirium, and
          primary insomnia.  All of these
          symptoms, combined with a profound
          sense of isolation, are commonly
          found in studies of low stimulation
          environments, particularly long
          range space travel.  Snow and
          Sartorius show indications of
          depression, including dysthymic and
          bipolar I; a variety of stress
          disorders, including acute and
          posttraumatic; and suggestions of
          agoraphobia, obsessive/compulsive
          disorder, and hypersomnia.  I
          emphasize these are preliminary
          opinions on my part.  I will
          attempt to convince Snow and
          Sartorius to return to Earth, but
          as they currently view me as an
          intruder of sorts, this may take
          some time.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Later.  Kelvin is lying down.  The lights are out, and he is
trying to sleep.

After a moment, he gets up, checks the lock on his door, and
lies back down.

Then he gets up and moves a chair in front of the door, and
lies back down.

Then he gets up and puts two heavy cases on top of the chair,
and lies back down.

Laughing to himself, he drifts off to sleep.

Silence.

ANOTHER ANGLE

On Kelvin, asleep.

ANOTHER ANGLE

On Kelvin, still asleep.  Then:

EXTREME CLOSE-UP:

A WOMAN'S LIPS, slightly parted.

BACK TO KELVIN

Asleep.  Then:

INT.  TRAIN - DAY

Continued silence, AND:

RHEYA, 30s, staring at us, practically daring us to look
away.  Her obvious intelligence and confidence make her
extremely compelling, along with the fact that it was her
parted lips we were looking at a moment ago.  Her expression
indicates she's in a very raw emotional state.

REVERSE ANGLE

Kelvin is the person she has locked eyes with on the TRAIN.

He is younger here; not just in age, but in spirit.  The
contrast with his older self is striking.

BACK TO KELVIN

Asleep on the ship.  After a beat:

EXTREME CLOSE-UP:

Rheya's LIPS.

Except the circumstance is clearly different: it's darker and
there isn't the side-to-side shimmy of the train car.

A WIDER VIEW

Reveals that Rheya is not sitting on the train -- she is
sitting in Kelvin's room on the Prometheus, right now.

She is staring at Kelvin and she is ethereal in her
stillness.

KELVIN

Awakens, blinks, and slowly recognizes her.

If he is not entirely surprised it is because he has
obviously dreamed of Rheya before.  He looks at her, simply.

RHEYA

Stands and makes her way to Kelvin.

Without hesitation she kisses him and they begin to explore
each other and we see all of it happen and two things are
obvious: first, they have done this before, and two: they
haven't done it in some time.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin is asleep, Rheya in his arms.

He wakes up and looks at her, perplexed.  After a beat he
rises to sit on the edge of the bed.

A wave of terror is barely suppressed as he puts his hand to
his forehead.  Rheya opens her eyes.

                    KELVIN
          Oh, God.  I'm awake.

                    RHEYA
          Yes.

He looks at her.

                    KELVIN
          Where did you come from?

She moves to him and kisses him as if that's all she wants to
do, forever.

Between kisses.

                    KELVIN
          How are you here?

She stops.

                    RHEYA
          How do you mean?
              (beat)
          Chris, what's wrong?

Hearing his name spoken by her (and those particular words,
perhaps) nearly causes Kelvin to scream.

He stands and moves to the chair.  Rheya watches him.

                    RHEYA
          I love you.

He looks up at her for as long as he can.  Then he looks
down.

                    RHEYA
          Do you love me?

He doesn't look up.

                    KELVIN
          Yes.

A beat.

                    KELVIN
          I need to see Snow.

                    RHEYA
          I'll go with you.

                    KELVIN
              (rising)
          I'll just be a minute.

She bolts out of bed.

                    RHEYA
          Don't.

                    KELVIN
          Why?

                    RHEYA
          I don't know.  I can't be alone.

                    KELVIN
          I'll be right back.

She is trying to accommodate him but her fear of being left
alone is palpable, even excessive.  He sees this and puts his
arms on her shoulders to comfort her.

                    KELVIN
          All right.  All right.  Here.

He hands her a few pills and retrieves a glass of water.

                    RHEYA
          What are they?

                    KELVIN
          To calm your anxiety.

                    RHEYA
          To calm my anxiety.

She takes the pills and smiles.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  DOCKING BAY

Kelvin leads Rheya to one of the exploratory pods.  They are
in space suits.

                    RHEYA
          We're taking a flight?

                    KELVIN
          Yes.

He opens the door of a pod and indicates for her to enter. 
She is unsure.

                    KELVIN
          Go ahead.  I'll close the door
          behind me.

She stares up and into the pod.  Kelvin watches her go with
difficulty and then CLOSES THE DOOR behind Rheya.

He walks across the docking bay to the control room and
begins preparations for the pod to be jettisoned.

KELVIN

In agony as he watches a real-time, beat-by-beat brand of
technological murder take place: Rheya's pod is pushed off
into space.

RHEYA

Her face contorted in confusion, watches through the pod
window as the docking bay doors close in front of her with a
brutal finality.

KELVIN

collapses to the ground, shattered.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin, on the edge of his bed.  He wants to tear himself
inside out.

A voice calls over the intercom: Snow's.

                    SNOW
          Was her breakfast conversation that
          bad?

                    KELVIN
          Shut up.

                    SNOW
          I told you, try to stay calm. 
          You're supposed to be the
          psychologist of the bunch.

                    KELVIN
          What was it?

Kelvin rises and goes to wash his face.

                    SNOW
          Personally, I think it's God.  At
          least, it fits my definition.

                    KELVIN
          And professionally?

                    SNOW
          I'm not sure.
              (beat)
          It started with Gibarian.  He
          locked himself in his room and
          refused to talk except through a
          crack in the door.  He covered the
          video lens.  Obviously we thought
          he was having a nervous breakdown.
          I don't know why he didn't tell us
          he had somebody in there.  By this
          time, we were getting visitors,
          too.  He was desperately trying to
          figure it out.  Day and night.
              (beat)
          Who was she?

                    KELVIN
          My wife.

                    SNOW
          Dead?

Kelvin nods.

                    SNOW
          She has materialized from your
          memory of her.  What was her name?

                    KELVIN
          Rheya.

                    SNOW
          It started about three months ago. 
          Right after the government sold the
          expedition.  We were ready to go
          home.

                    KELVIN
          Will she come back?

                    SNOW
          Probably.

                    KELVIN
          I wish you'd told me.

                    SNOW
          Told you what?

A beat.

                    SNOW
          What will you say?

                    KELVIN
          To who?

                    SNOW
          What are you going to report back
          to Earth?

                    KELVIN
          I don't know.

                    SNOW
          An enormous amount of money changed
          hands to get control of this
          project.  We are in little danger
          of being left alone for long.
              (beat)
          You'll need to do something. 
          Otherwise they'll be sending
          someone out to recover you.

                    KELVIN
          Gibarian said he thinks Solaris
          should be destroyed.

                    SNOW
          That's ludicrous.  This is contact. 
          We have found God.  The only issue
          is figuring out how to prove this
          in a way that will make sense back
          on Earth.  So how will we describe
          it, if we choose to describe it at
          all?

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM

Before Kelvin's arrival.

Gibarian is talking to Snow and Sartorius.

                    GIBARIAN
          A pre-biological colloidal
          envelope, possibly exceeding
          terrestrial structures in
          complexity; a plasmic mechanism. 
          Probably without life as we
          conceive it, but capable of
          performing functional activities on
          an astronomic scale.  My view is
          that Solaris has reached, in a
          single bound, the "homeostatic
          ocean" stage without passing
          through stages of terrestrial
          evolution.  I think it bypassed
          cellular development altogether. 
          It hasn't taken endless eons to
          adapt itself to its environment,
          but in fact dominated its
          environment immediately.  From the
          moment it existed, it was the most
          superior element in the Universe.
          And now it passes the time doing
          extravagant theoretical thinking
          about the Universe, with us as the
          cast.

We now show this scene being played out on a video monitor,
watched by Kelvin.

                    GIBARIAN
          It's engaged in a never-ending
          process of transformation; an
          ontological autometamorphosis,
          begging the question: Can thought
          exist separately from
          consciousness?

                    SNOW
          It's God.

                    SARTORIUS
          I don't care what it is, we need to
          figure out how to make it stop.

                    GIBARIAN
          Nelson, we have the opportunity --

                    SARTORIUS
          What if this thing follows us back
          to Earth?  What if what's happening
          here started happening on Earth, on
          a mass scale?  Don't you see that
          as a problem?  I think it's a
          serious mistake to assume it's
          benign.  For all we know it's
          driving us crazy so it can watch us
          kill each other.

Gibarian considers this.

                    SNOW
          We're not even sure it will let us
          leave.

                                                  CUT TO:

ANOTHER VIDEO

This time, Gibarian alone.  Near the end.

                    GIBARIAN
          Maybe it's stuck.  Maybe its power
          isn't that God-like.  I mean, we
          have God-like power relative to an
          insect, but that doesn't mean we
          can move the Earth around at will.
          Maybe it's like a spider web,
          waiting for something to show up.
              (beat)
          We intercepted some brief fragments
          of what must be an everlasting
          monologue with itself.  Of course
          it was beyond our understanding.
              (beat)
          I've come to hate it here.  There's
          only one way out of its reach, for
          us.  Humans.

INT.  LAB

Kelvin stares at Gibarian's body, which is lying under a
sheet in the ship's operating room.  Also under the sheet,
next to Gibarian: The Young Girl.

                    GIBARIAN
              (from a video)
          I thought I'd been behaving
          normally, rationally.  But a sign
          of insanity is the inability to
          think about more than one thing. 
          So if I am consumed by the idea
          that I am insane and can't think of
          anything else, then I am insane.
              (beat, smiles)
          You ask questions at the end of
          your life, the sort of questions
          people who are content don't ask.
              (beat)
          Maybe life just can't be solved.

RHEYA leans into frame and kisses him.

Without even waking, he kisses her back, hungrily.

          Rheya...

                    RHEYA
          I want you inside me right now.

They make love.  It's even better than before.

INT.  TRAIN - DAY

Kelvin, staring intently.  What he is staring at is Rheya,
who is seated across from him.  She doesn't see him, yet. 
When she does, she locks eyes with his and doesn't look away.

This continues until she gets off the train.  Kelvin watches
her go, and she looks back at him through the window as the
train pulls away.

INT.  PARTY - NIGHT

Rheya enters, looks around.  She spots Kelvin, who has
already spotted her.  Their expressions indicate they are
pleased to see each other again.  He approaches her, and they
stare at each other a long time, until:

                    KELVIN
          "And Death Shall Have No Dominion".

                    RHEYA
          Book?

                    KELVIN
          Poem.  Dylan Thomas.  I thought of
          it when I saw you on the train.

                    RHEYA
          My Thomas is a little rusty.

He leans over and whispers into her ear.  She listens, and
when he finishes, she leans back and looks at him, intrigued. 
Genuinely intrigued.  He smiles.

                    RHEYA
          Not a very happy poem.

                    KELVIN
          You didn't look very happy.

                    RHEYA
          I wasn't.

                    KELVIN
          And tonight?

                    RHEYA
          Better.

He nods, and they smile.  They seem to be rooting for each
other.  After an extended pleasurable moment, Rheya leans
over and whispers in his ear.  He listens, then leans back
and looks at her.

                    KELVIN
          That's good to know.

INT.  FRIEND'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Another night.

Rheya is wound up.  Not drunk, something else.  She has an
odd look in her eyes.

We are at a dinner party, and there are people trying -- but
failing -- not to watch.

                    RHEYA
          You want to fuck her?

                    KELVIN
          Stop it.

                    RHEYA
          You behave as though you want to
          fuck her.

                    KELVIN
          Rheya.  Not here.

                    RHEYA
          And I just want to know if I'm
          crazy or not -- if what I think is
          happening is actually happening. 
          Or am I one of those people, those
          women, who are blind to what's
          going on?  Who pretend not to see
          their husband's attention toward
          another woman?

                    KELVIN
          Let's go home.

                    RHEYA
          You go home.

                    KELVIN
          I am.  Please come with me.  I
          don't want to do this here.

He is unmoved, but she labors to change his mind.

Rheya, in a chair, remorseful, Kelvin is dressing.

          You're better when you take them.

                    RHEYA
          I know, I know.  But still, somehow
          I don't feel better.

                    KELVIN
          All right.  How about I feel better
          when you take them?

A beat.

                    RHEYA
          Right.

They look at each other and understand; she will take the
pills.

INT.  PROMETHEUS

Rheya is taking her pills.  Kelvin watches.

                    KELVIN
          What do you remember?

                    RHEYA
          What do you mean?

                    KELVIN
          Do you remember Beethoven?  The
          Beatles?  Movies, books,
          restaurants, friends?

                    RHEYA
              (thinking)
          Yes.  But not until you mentioned
          them.  As soon as you said those
          things, I remembered them.  And
          they have associations that make me
          think of other things I remember. 
          It's like filling up.

She looks out the portal at Solaris.

                    RHEYA
          Is it a planet?

                    KELVIN
          Not exactly.  It exists in a
          continuum that wasn't proven until
          ten years ago, a higher
          mathematical dimension superimposed
          on top of the Universe.  An
          infinite number of them, in fact. 
          It was a violation of all of our
          various laws regarding the
          Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It
          was completely counter-intuitive. 
          We had to unlearn everything.

                    RHEYA
          Is it intelligent?

                    KELVIN
          Intelligent beyond our
          comprehension.

                    RHEYA
          Then it's God, right?

                    KELVIN
          It's something.

                    RHEYA
          You still don't believe in God?

                    KELVIN
          The whole idea of God was dreamed
          up by a silly animal with a small
          brain called Man.  Even the limits
          we put on it are human limits.  It
          can do this, it can do that!  It
          designs, it creates!

                    RHEYA
          Even a God that wasn't active, that
          just created something and stood
          back and watched?

                    KELVIN
          You're talking about a man in a
          white beard again.  You're
          ascribing human characteristics to
          something that isn't human.  Human
          beings look for causes and
          patterns.  How could we know what
          Solaris is up to, if anything?

A beat.

                    RHEYA
          But what if Solaris is what there
          was before The Big Bang?

                    KELVIN
          As I said, it is beyond our
          comprehension.

                    RHEYA
          As I said, then it's God, right?

She looks at him and can't keep from smiling, eventually.

                    RHEYA
          Why are we talking about this shit
          when we could be fucking?

Kelvin smiles.

The intercom comes to life.

                    SNOW
          Kelvin, you awake?

                    KELVIN
          What is it?

                    SNOW
          Can you meet me and Sartorius on B
          deck in an hour?

                    KELVIN
          Why?

                    SNOW
          Just a little strategy session. 
          But in person this time.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin is getting ready to leave.  Rheya sits on the edge of
the bed, nervous.

                    KELVIN
          All right?

She nods and Kelvin exits, locking the door behind him.

We sit with her for a moment as she tries to remain calm.

IN THE CORRIDOR

Kelvin listens.  A long time.

Satisfied, he begins to walk away but is stopped by the
sounding of a CRASHING GLASS from within.  He hears footsteps
approach the door, and then a fierce POUNDING.

He takes a step back.  An INHUMAN AMOUNT OF NOISE begins
emanating from the other side of the door, which is now
threatening to break apart.  It sounds like a plane is
crashing in Kelvin's room -- no human could create this kind
of cacophony.

Finally, he steps forward and presses the button to open the
door.

RHEYA

Is revealed, covered in blood.  She has completely torn the
inside of the cabin door apart and has badly injured herself
in the process.

                    KELVIN
          Rheya...

Confused, she looks up at him as he takes her in his arms and
carries her to the bed.

                    RHEYA
          What happened?

                    KELVIN
          You were trying to break down the
          door.  Do you know why?

                    RHEYA
          When I saw you were gone I got
          scared.

He puts her down on the bed and runs to the bathroom, where
he gathers all the first aid materials he can find.

Returning, he blanches.

Rheya's wounds have HEALED; in fact, they are HEALING in
front of us.

She looks up at him and doesn't like the look on his face.

                    RHEYA
          Chris, what's wrong with me?

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  LAB

Kelvin runs Rheya through a battery of tests and studies the
results.

                    RHEYA
          Am I all right?

A beat.

                    KELVIN
          Yes.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  B DECK CONFERENCE ROOM

Snow and Sartorius wait for Kelvin.

                    SNOW
          He won't do it.

                    SARTORIUS
          Why do you say that?

                    SNOW
          He won't.

Kelvin enters, with Rheya.  Snow and Sartorius exchange
glances.

                    KELVIN
          This is my wife, Rheya.

She looks at Snow and nods.  Sartorius she hates instantly,
and the feeling seems to be mutual.

                    SARTORIUS
          We thought you'd be alone.  We want
          to talk about...

                    SNOW
          We want to talk freely.

                    KELVIN
          Go ahead.

Sartorius begins.

                    SARTORIUS
          I suggest we pool our knowledge
          regarding the... visitors.  We can
          express whatever questions or
          conclusions we might have... share
          information about our various...
          experiments.  Agreed?

Kelvin and Snow nod.

                    SARTORIUS
          I would like to start with
          motivation.  Why are they here?

Sartorius looks at Rheya.  She looks away.

                    SARTORIUS
          They are not autonomous individuals
          and they're not actual persons. 
          They are projections materializing
          from our minds, based on a given
          individual.

                    SNOW
          It's an experiment.

                    KELVIN
          No.  There's no behavior
          modification.

                    SARTORIUS
          She reappeared exactly as she had
          before?

Kelvin looks at Rheya and nods.  She is struck by the word
"before".

                    SNOW
          The same vulnerabilities?

He nods again.

                    SARTORIUS
          A recoil, with no compensating
          mechanism.

                    SNOW
          And when a given situation no
          longer corresponds to the normal
          faculties of the... original, the
          visitor suffers some sort of
          disconnected consciousness.

                    SARTORIUS
          Followed by non-human
          manifestations.

                    SNOW
          Are the actions of Solaris
          premeditated?

                    KELVIN
          Is it being deliberately cruel, you
          mean?  I don't think so.

                    SNOW
          I'm just trying to find an
          explanation for the continual
          reappearances.

                    KELVIN
              (to Rheya)
          When you cut yourself pounding the
          door, did it hurt?

                    RHEYA
          Yes.
              (looks around)
          Of course.

                    SARTORIUS
          If they're not learning anything
          and they're not modifying their
          behavior, why do they come back?

                    SNOW
          It's like they're plugged into a
          game, which goes around and around,
          endlessly repeating itself.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  APARTMENT - NIGHT

This is ten years ago.  Rheya enters, alone.

She crosses to the kitchen and makes a drink.  Almost
immediately, the labrador puppy enters from the bedroom and
stands beside her, tail wagging.  She ignores it and
continues mixing her drink.

Halfway through this activity, the bedroom light comes on.  A
moment later, Kelvin is in the doorway.  Eventually, but not
angrily, because he's still not really awake:

                    KELVIN
          Where've you been?

                    RHEYA
          I been thinking about how much I
          hate you.

She finishes making her drink, drinks it, and walks out the
door.

Kelvin stands in the doorway for a beat, then pivots and
returns to bed.  The light goes out.

                    RHEYA (V.O.)
          Yes, I remember that.  I went back
          to Lois' house and spent the night. 
          Those were dark days.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  PARTY - NIGHT

Kelvin and Rheya, later in the evening when they spoke for
the first time.  They are absolutely infatuated with each
other; they know something is happening between them, will
happen between them.

                    RHEYA
          I would have these -- I don't know
          how to describe them -- visions,
          when I was younger.  Maybe not
          visions, but like these waking
          dream states.  Time would just
          collapse, I would be inside time. 
          I would stare at a second hand on a
          clock until it stopped.  Freaky
          stuff.

                    KELVIN
          How old were you?

                    RHEYA
          Seven, eight.  So one day my mother
          catches me sort of staring off into
          space, and she asks me what I'm
          doing, and I start trying to
          explain to her, about this state
          that I can put myself in, and this
          look comes over her face.

                    KELVIN
          What kind of look?

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin and Rheya sit together in the Prometheus.  Rheya
continues her story without a beat.

                    RHEYA
          Scared.  No, not scared.  Wary. 
          Like I was something to be... her
          guard went up.  I was a threat. 
          Now I know why.  She was afraid
          she'd be seen.  That I would see
          her for the self-obsessed neurotic
          that she was.  I think she thought
          she had a few more years of being
          on a pedestal.  But that's the
          cycle, right?  I knew a little more
          than she did, she knew a little
          more than her mother, and on and
          on.
              (beat)
          I guess that's part of the reason
          why --

                    KELVIN
          I know.  I know.  We don't have to
          talk about that.

Another beat.

                    RHEYA
          I remember days of just thinking
          about you.

INT.  OFFICES - DAY

Intercut Kelvin and Rheya at their respective jobs, going
through a normal day.  There is no sound.  As we see these
images, it's clear that Kelvin and Rheya are slightly not
present in their respective encounters with other people;
they are distracted by the idea of each other.

And they like it.

                    RHEYA
          Thinking what you were doing and
          saying, just being consumed by
          thinking of you.  I loved it so
          much, that feeling.

                    KELVIN
          I did too.

INT.  APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rheya on the edge of the bed, facing away.

                    KELVIN
          I used to watch you undress.

As she does:

                    KELVIN
          I never tired of watching you
          undress.  Every time, it was
          exciting.  Right until... to the
          end.

A beat.  Then a shot of Kelvin that we've seen before: Him
leaving their apartment, angry.

ON THE PROMETHEUS

A beat.

                    RHEYA
          What happened to us, exactly?

                    KELVIN
          You don't know?

Rheya shakes her head.

Kelvin just watches her.

                    RHEYA
          I remember... something burning. 
          Coffee burning.

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

The rain-streaked window.

An automated coffee maker has been left on, and the
solidified coffee at the bottom of the pot is smoking.

Rheya's body is on the floor of the kitchen.

RHEYA (ON PROMETHEUS)

She is looking at Kelvin.  He is dreading this.

                    RHEYA
          You found me?

He nods.  It's coming back to her.

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Kelvin is yelling at Rheya.  We don't hear what he's saying,
but judging from her reaction, it's not pleasant.  She is
crying.

RHEYA (ON PROMETHEUS)

Experiencing this all over again.  Kelvin comes and sits in
front of her.

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Kelvin, still yelling, is packing some things into a
suitcase.  Rheya, between sobs, pleads with him.

RHEYA (ON PROMETHEUS)

Her eyes fill with tears.  Kelvin embraces her.

                    KELVIN
          I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

Rheya is devastated, inconsolable.

                    RHEYA
          Why did you say those things?

                    KELVIN
          I don't know.  I couldn't
          understand why you didn't tell me.

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Rheya lies on the kitchen floor, dead.  There is a NOTE in
her hand.

Kelvin kneels next to her.

KELVIN (ON PROMETHEUS)

With Rheya still in his arms.

                    KELVIN
          When you said you wouldn't make
          it... I didn't believe you.  Or I
          didn't take you seriously, which is
          worse.

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Kelvin holds the dead Rheya.

KELVIN (ON PROMETHEUS)

Squeezing her.

                    KELVIN
          I should have believed you.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin lies in bed, his eyes open.  Rheya is in his arms.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Rheya, talking to Chris.  Obviously during a period when they
were getting along.  Or at least: not fighting.

                    RHEYA
          I can't help feeling that I'm
          cheating when I take them.

                    KELVIN
          It's genetics.  You know this.  You
          know where it comes from.  There is
          nothing wrong with uncrossing a few
          crossed wires.

She knows, intellectually, that he is right.  But it doesn't
matter.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin is out of bed and speaking into a videophone to Snow. 
Rheya is asleep in the background.  The room is dark except
for the glow of the screen.

                    SNOW
          You're unnerved because you've
          spent your whole life thinking
          nobody is looking over you, and
          suddenly your subconscious is an
          open book.  We are, for the first
          time, experiencing changes in
          natural reality by a force not our
          own.  That proves that --

                    KELVIN
          -- we are not sure of that.  We are
          not sure we aren't all
          hallucinating.

                    SNOW
          If God is beyond our comprehension,
          and she --
              (meaning Rheya)
          -- is here for reasons that can't
          be understood, isn't God here?

                    KELVIN
          Not necessarily.

                    SNOW
          Stop equivocating!  Unbelievable,
          how you equivocate!  You, the
          atheist, you're more dogmatic than
          any holy person I've ever seen! 
          This is happening, Kevin.  Wake up.

                    KELVIN
          Consciousness is enough, that's all
          I've saying.  Consciousness should
          be enough for anybody.

                    SNOW
          Who are you trying to convince?

Kelvin just looks back at Rheya.

                    SNOW
          It will end badly.  As inevitably
          as the rising of a bubble.

Kelvin doesn't respond.

                    SNOW
          Let's all meet tomorrow.  Sartorius
          has some new ideas, about making it
          stop.

Kelvin just keeps staring at Rheya, asleep.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin is eating with Rheya.  Looking at her.  Desiring her.

                    RHEYA
          Do you have any idea how much I
          like fucking you?

                    KELVIN
          I think so.

                    RHEYA
          Good.  Because I want you to know. 
          I really like fucking you.

He leans over and whispers in her ear.  She smiles and leans
back.

                    RHEYA
          I like that too.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          How could she not be real?  I can
          smell her, taste her.  She does
          exactly what she did... it's not
          possible.

                    RHEYA
              (smiles, teasing)
          You know, I've decided: I'm just
          gonna believe what you believe
          about this whole Solaris thing,
          it'll make life so much easier; the
          little wife agreeing with her big,
          strong husband.  You must get such
          a headache thinking about those
          Great Big Problems all day.

He just stares at her -- he really likes this.  It's
familiar, this type of teasing, and it reminds him of when
things were good.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          Like I said, it's not possible.

A beat.

                    RHEYA
          So, Chris, seriously, aren't you
          afraid you're going to get fired?

They laugh.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin and Rheya, post-coital.  Relaxed.  On the verge of
sleep.

                    RHEYA
          You sure say "God" a lot when we're
          doing it.

                    KELVIN
          I know.  I'm putting that in my
          next report.

She smiles.

                    RHEYA
          Right.  The report.  Report and
          recommend.

They consider that.

                    RHEYA
          What does Snow think you should do?

                    KELVIN
          Snow thinks we shouldn't leave
          until we figure out a way to
          document it, to prove its existence
          to the planet Earth.  This is
          hilarious: He thinks it's God, but
          he wants it to sit still for a
          photograph so he can show the folks
          back home.

They smile at this.  Rheya's smile fades before Kelvin's.

                    RHEYA
          Sartorius wants to destroy it.

                    KELVIN
          Well.  He doesn't think it's God,
          but for different reasons than me. 
          He's thinking: If I can figure out
          how to make it stop, than I am
          smarter than it is, and therefore
          it cannot be God.

                    RHEYA
          He has a point.

                    KELVIN
          He does have a point.  That's just
          not the way I'd like to see it
          proven.

                    RHEYA
          You feel sorry for Solaris, or for
          me?

                    KELVIN
          It's a violent response to
          something we haven't figured out. 
          Don't let the cowardly demeanor
          fool you: He is ruthless. 
          Unblinking in his prejudice.

                    RHEYA
          It was obvious from the way he
          first looked at me.

A beat.  He holds her.

                    RHEYA
          Do I really feel like... I am...?

                    KELVIN
          Yes.  Yes.

                    RHEYA
          I'm glad.

A beat.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  SOLARIS

Turning, slowly.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  APARTMENT - NIGHT

Then years ago.  Kelvin, naked, sitting in a chair, in the
dark.  Rheya, also naked, is smoking a cigarette in bed.

                    KELVIN
          Everything you pursue, you end up
          becoming disinterested in.  The
          fact that you're good at everything
          you try makes it worse.  You have a
          degree in animal science, you could
          be a terrific vet. 
          You drifted into writing and turned
          out to be a perceptive journalist. 
          Then it was politics, which seemed
          best of all, you had an actual gift
          for understanding the best pattern
          for a group of people to be
          arranged for you to achieve your
          goal.  And they didn't even know
          they were being arranged.  But you
          got bored with it, like you do with
          everything.

She just smokes, not really looking at him.  Maybe it's a
common observation and she's past being defensive about it.

                    KELVIN
          I don't know what it's really like,
          to not know what you want to do. 
          To not have anything that you love
          to do more than anything else.

A beat.  He looks at her.  She seems more interested in her
cigarette at the moment.

                    RHEYA
              (sarcastic)
          Imagine my frustration.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

On the Prometheus.  Rheya is awake, Kelvin asleep.

She rises and goes to sit in a chair; she is anxious,
something we haven't seen before.

Kelvin wakes up, looks at her.  Noting her expression:

                    KELVIN
          What's wrong.

                    RHEYA
          You don't love me.

                    KELVIN
          Stop.

A beat.  She looks down.

                    RHEYA
          I have to talk to you... I... I
          don't know where I came from.
              (up at him)
          Do you know?

He doesn't respond.

                    RHEYA
          If you know but can't tell me
          now... will you ever be able to?

Calmly:

                    KELVIN
          What are you talking about?

                    RHEYA
          That I am not Rheya.  That Rheya
          died.  Killed herself.  I'm
          different.

He's looking at her, and knows this is dangerous territory.

                    KELVIN
          Who have you been talking to?

                    RHEYA
              (no reason to lie)
          Sartorius.

                    KELVIN
          When?  When I'm asleep?

She nods.  He can only imagine what form Sartorius' anecdotes
must have taken.

                    KELVIN
          I'm sure there are worse people to
          talk to, but I don't know who they
          are.

                    RHEYA
          I'm just trying to understand
          what's going on.

A beat.

                    RHEYA
          How have you lived the last ten
          years?  Did you love anyone?

A long beat.  Kelvin shakes his head.

                    RHEYA
          Did you think about me?

Another beat.  He nods.  Then:

                    RHEYA
          But we fought.

                    KELVIN
          Yes.  Especially toward the end.

                    RHEYA
          Why did she do it?

                    KELVIN
          You... she said I didn't love her.

                    RHEYA
          Was she right?

                    KELVIN
          No.  I love you.

                    RHEYA
              (reflexive, but genuine)
          I love you, too.

If she seems satisfied for the moment, Kelvin knows the
feeling won't last.

                    KELVIN
          Can you sleep?

                    RHEYA
          I don't think do.  It's not sleep;
          it's something else.  It's all
          around me.

                    KELVIN
          Those are dreams.

She falls asleep.

                                                FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM

Kelvin, Rheya, Sartorius, and Snow.  They are in the middle
of a heated discussion.

                    SNOW
          Gibarian was under enormous --

                    SARTORIUS
          Gibarian was helpless.  It's very
          simple: Man created the science
          that resulted in the discovery of
          Solaris, and the ship that brought
          us here.

                    KELVIN
          Meaning Man can do whatever the
          fuck it wants?

                    SARTORIUS
          Yes.

                    KELVIN
          That's fantastic.

                    SARTORIUS
          Why did you agree to come here?

A beat.

                    SARTORIUS
          Too tired to answer?

Looks at Rheya, then back to Kelvin.

                    SARTORIUS
          I'll bet.  Is this what they sent
          you here to do?  You've lost it,
          you've gone native.

Kelvin moves toward him.  Sartorius just lets him come.

                    RHEYA
              (to Sartorius)
          You're the coward.

                    KELVIN
          Don't debate him; he'll say
          anything.

                    RHEYA
              (still, to Sartorius)
          I'm just as human as you.  I see, I
          hear, I touch, and I feel just like
          you do.

                    SARTORIUS
          Prove it.

                    RHEYA
          These "guests" are a part of you,
          of your subconscious.  Chris loves
          me.

                    SARTORIUS
          YOU ARE NOT HUMAN!  Try to
          understand that if you can
          understand anything!

Kelvin is within an inch of his face.

                    KELVIN
          Get out of here.

Slowly, carefully, Sartorius grasps Kelvin by the shoulders. 
Then he leans in and whispers in Kelvin's ear:

                    SARTORIUS
          Rheya is dead.  She's a copy.  A
          facsimile.  And she's seducing you
          all over again.  You're sick.  You
          think of fucking her as research
          for humanity.  It's just fucking.

Kelvin backs away.

                    SARTORIUS
          There's nothing grandiose about it. 
          You've jumped out of a plane and
          you're trying to sew a parachute
          together while you fall.

Sartorius turns...

                    SARTORIUS
          It'd be hilarious if it weren't so
          damn sad.

And leaves.

A beat.

                    SNOW
          We didn't even get to hear his new
          ideas.

Snow wanders toward the door.

                    SNOW
          I'm not feeling well.

He passes Kelvin and leaves.

Kelvin watches him, then looks at Rheya.  She seems dazed.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  SOLARIS

The fog-shrouded surface, shifting and turning like an ocean.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Rheya is asleep.  Kelvin is talking to Snow on the
videophone.

                    SNOW
          We can liquidate the station.  Take
          the Athena back.

                    KELVIN
          No.

                    SNOW
          Of course, when we return, we'll be
          regarded as lunatics if we tell the
          truth.
              (shrugs)
          We'll chalk it up to isolation,
          collective derangement.

                    KELVIN
          I've never heard you express any
          desire to leave before now.  Why
          now?

                    SNOW
          Well, I think we're reaching the
          point of diminishing returns here,
          right?  Certainly it's learning
          more about us than we'll ever learn
          about it.

                    KELVIN
          But why is it doing what it's
          doing?  Given it's resources, it
          could have done anything. 
          Presented me with your double, and
          you with mine.

                    SNOW
          Perhaps it did.

                    KELVIN
          Human beings can die.

                    SNOW
          But they are human.  They certainly
          become human with incredible speed. 
          First they're like they were in our
          memory, but then they fill in on
          their own.  DNA doesn't determine
          the hundreds of trillions of
          connections that occur in the
          brain, it's not dense enough.  They
          build up with experience.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM - EARLIER

Quick glimpses of Rheya.  In several of them she is in
repose, thinking, as if to illustrate Snow's point.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Back to Kelvin, thinking.

                    KELVIN
          They come when you sleep.

                    SNOW
          That's right.  And we all have to
          sleep, eventually.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin on the bed with Rheya.  Their eyes are closed.

We think they are asleep until:

                    RHEYA
          You don't want me.

                    KELVIN
          Rheya.

                    RHEYA
          That's what you were saying.  I
          heard what you were saying.

                    KELVIN
          For a reason that neither of us
          understand, you are forced to stay
          near me.  That's all I know right
          now.

She realizes she doesn't want to argue.  Not right now,
anyway.

                    RHEYA
          I have these strange thoughts, I
          don't know where they come from.
              (beat)
          I can't explain it.

                    KELVIN
          Neither can I.  Not any of it. 
          There's no reference point for
          what's going on; it's never
          happened before.  It's a clean
          break in the fabric of the
          Universe; a gap.  There is nothing
          to do but experience it, moment-to-
          moment, and not let it destroy us.

                    RHEYA
          But that's what happened before.

                    KELVIN
          Not this time.

He kisses her.  She wants to believe him, so she says
nothing.  Then:

                    RHEYA
          Do you want to stay here?

                    KELVIN
          Do you?

                    RHEYA
          If you're here.

They kiss again...

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin is asleep.  Rheya is next to him.

Offscreen, we hear the door open.

Someone walks quietly (though not surreptitiously) through
the frame and sits.

After a long beat, Kelvin bolts upright, his mind struggling
to clear.  When it does:

                    KELVIN
          Gibarian.

                    GIBARIAN
          Leave the light off.

A beat.  Kelvin tries to get his bearings.

                    GIBARIAN
          I wish you'd come a little sooner. 
          I might not have had to kill
          myself.

He smiles, looking at Kelvin.

                    GIBARIAN
          You think you're dreaming me, like
          you dream her.  Understand
          something: I am the real Gibarian. 
          Just a new incarnation.

                    KELVIN
          What do you want?

                    GIBARIAN
          You're being tricked.  Sartorius
          picked a fight with you to avoid
          telling you about his idea for
          getting rid of the visitors.  He's
          figured out they're made of
          subatomic particles called
          neutrinos, and he's going to create
          a negative neutrino field.  Twenty
          four hours a day, until they're
          back on Earth.

                    KELVIN
          Can it work?

                    GIBARIAN
          It can.  Ordinary matter, like
          ours?  Not affected.  Everything
          else, disintegrates.

Kelvin registers this.

                    GIBARIAN
          What I'm saying is: Don't trust
          anyone.  Find yourself a weapon of
          some sort.

                    KELVIN
          I can trust Rheya.

                    GIBARIAN
          You'll end up like me.

                    KELVIN
          You're not Gibarian...

                    GIBARIAN
          No?  Who am I, then?

                    KELVIN
          A puppet.

                    GIBARIAN
          And you're not?  Maybe you're my
          puppet.  But like all puppets, you
          think you're actually human.  It's
          The Puppet's Dream.  Wondering if
          they're human!

Gibarian smiles.

KELVIN

wakes up, gulping air.  Rheya, startled:

                    RHEYA
          What's wrong?

                    KELVIN
          Gibarian.  He was here.

                    RHEYA
          You said he was dead.

                    KELVIN
          He is.  But he was here...

He moves to the chair, looking for some residue of Gibarian,
some proof.  Finding none:

                    KELVIN
          He spoke to me.

Kelvin leaves the room.  After a few beats, Rheya follows.

INT.  LAB

Rheya lingers behind Kelvin, who is looking at Gibarian's
body.

It is there, alone on its slab; even the Young Girl is not
with him.  

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin, thinking.  He gives Rheya some pills to take.  She
just looks at them.

                    KELVIN
          Are you going to take them?

She nods and takes them.

                    RHEYA
          What's happening to us?

                    KELVIN
          It's all right.

                    RHEYA
          Please don't lie.  I told you
          before, I don't know how I came to
          be here.  Whatever you think you
          can't say to me, I need to hear you
          say it.

                    KELVIN
          I love you.

                    RHEYA
          Don't.  I'm the one at risk here. 
          If we're playing out what happened
          before, I won't survive.

He goes to her.

                    KELVIN
          That won't happen again.  We're
          different.

                    RHEYA
          How can I tell?  You've seen both
          of me.  I only know what you're
          like here.  You're all I know. 
          There is no "You" from before.

She sits, frustrated.  Sad.

                    RHEYA
          How could it be so cruel?  How
          could it torture us like this?

                    KELVIN
          I don't think it knows it's
          torturing us.  It's just watching.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin and Rheya, in bed.  She looks despondent.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin is asleep.  Alone.

After a long period of silence, we hear the faint sound of an
instrument of some sort hitting the ground.  After another
beat, Kelvin awakens.  He notices that he is alone, and
something tells him that's not a good sign.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  LAB

Rheya is on the ground, convulsing.  Beside her is a SMALL
STEEL DRUM, which is spilling a strange-looking LIQUID that
solidifies and vaporizes with a smoky hiss.

Kelvin moves to Rheya and is startled to see that half of her
face and throat are burned away -- not melted as in a fire,
but merely eaten cleanly away.  He picks her up.

INT.  CORRIDOR

Kelvin is carrying Rheya.  Snow sticks his head out of a
passing room.

                    SNOW
          What happened?

                    KELVIN
          She drank liquid oxygen.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin puts Rheya on the bed.  Her face and throat have
returned to normal, but she is not breathing.  Kelvin goes
and puts his head to her chest, but doesn't hear what he
hoped to hear.  He stands, still looking at her.  Snow seems
very detached.

An uncomfortably long moment as we realize she is actually
not going to wake up.

                    KELVIN
          She's dead.

Snow says nothing.

Then:

Her finger twitches.

Barely noticeable at first, but growing in intensity.  Kelvin
sees it, and goes to her.  She is starting to shake a little,
as though cold.

                    SNOW
          She'll come back, don't worry.  But
          then what?  My theory is she can
          only live here, that she will die
          if she leaves this ship.

Kelvin is still looking at Rheya, who is shaking a little
harder; it's feeling like a seizure now.

                    SNOW
          Why do you think she hasn't
          suggested that?  It's the most
          obvious solution: Escape.  She
          knows she can't leave here --

                    KELVIN
          Get out --

                    SNOW
          Oh, this one you love?  What about
          the first one, the one you fucked
          and then put into a rocket and
          blasted into space?  You didn't
          love her?

Rheya is shaking much harder now, Kelvin tries to hold her
still, but she's too strong.  He stands, reluctantly, and
watches her.

                    SNOW
          What happens if she comes back?  Is
          that polygamy?  And even if you
          could take her home, how would you
          get her through?  You think they're
          not going to notice her?

Rheya is shaking violently now, as if a rippling rhythmic
force were coursing through her.  Snow, as he looks
dispassionately on the two of them:

                    SNOW
          I never get used to them, these...
          "Resurrections".

He leaves.

Rheya continues her process of "waking up" -- it's violent,
even sexual.  She spasms to a peak of some sort, and then
slowly returns to normal.

Kelvin puts his hand on her forehead.

She gradually begins to open her eyes.  She looks at Kelvin.

It takes her a moment to realize she shouldn't be seeing him;
she shouldn't be seeing anything.  She should be dead.

She begins to cry.

                    RHEYA
          What am I?  Why can't I die?

She turns away.

                    RHEYA
          I'm not Rheya.  You're always known
          that.

                    KELVIN
          Rheya --

                    RHEYA
          Don't call me that.

He turns her over.

                    KELVIN
          Listen: I don't care about anything
          but the fact that you are here. 
          You are her, you are Rheya.

                    RHEYA
          I'm disgusting.

                    KELVIN
          No.

                    RHEYA
          You're lying.  I'm not human.

                    KELVIN
          Rheya, I am not going back.  I'm
          staying here with you.

                    RHEYA
          Then you'll die.

                    KELVIN
          I want every second I can get with
          you.

A beat.

                    RHEYA
          What will I do, if you die?

He doesn't know.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  SOLARIS

Turning slowly.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin and Rheya, in bed.

                    RHEYA
          Do you think I can get pregnant
          here?

A long beat.

                    KELVIN
          We'll know soon enough.

INSERT:

The first time Kelvin and Rheya spoke, at the party ten years
ago.  Again we see her whisper in Kelvin's ear, but this time
we hear what she is saying:

                    RHEYA
          I can't be a mother.

She pulls back.

                    KELVIN
          That's good to know.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Kelvin, as he packs to leave Rheya.

                    RHEYA
          Don't do this.  I am literally
          begging you not to do this.  Chris.

                    KELVIN
          You should have told me.

                    RHEYA
          It wouldn't have made any
          difference.

                    KELVIN
          Thank you.

                    RHEYA
          Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I
          didn't think you'd react like this.

                    KELVIN
          Neither did I.

                    RHEYA
          You never said you wanted one.

                    KELVIN
          I never said I didn't.

                    RHEYA
          Chris --

                    KELVIN
          I can't stay here.

                    RHEYA
          Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. 
          I won't make it.

                    KELVIN
          Then you won't make it.

He leaves, brushing past her.

Rheya, unconscious, on the kitchen floor.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

A long, held shot of Rheya, crying.  She is curled up,
retreating into herself.  Kelvin is trying to console her.

                    KELVIN
          I came back.  You have to know
          that.  I came back that night.

                                                  CUT TO:

Rheya on the kitchen floor, the note in her hand.

Kelvin is kneeling over her.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin and Rheya.  She is sobbing, but somewhat calmer.

                    KELVIN
          I couldn't make it, either.
              (beat)
          I'm so sorry.

Kelvin, asleep.

GIBARIAN

As we saw him before, sitting in the chair.  But we didn't
hear him say this before:

                    GIBARIAN
          If they succeed, you'll never see
          her again.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

In the immediate aftermath of her suicide attempt with the
liquid oxygen:

                    RHEYA
          You're afraid of me.  I can't do
          this anymore.  I still don't
          understand.  It's not possible.

He tries to console her, but she recoils.

                    RHEYA
          Don't --

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Rheya, as Kelvin brushes past her on his way out.  She looks
desperate.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Rheya and Kelvin.

                    RHEYA
          What do I have to do to stop it?

                    KELVIN
          I want you here.

                    RHEYA
          You're lying.

                    KELVIN
          You exist here.  I keep telling
          you.

                    RHEYA
          That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.

                    KELVIN
          Who are you, then?

                    RHEYA
          I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the
          woman you loved ten years ago.

                    KELVIN
          Yes, you are --

                    RHEYA
          Did you hear what Gibarian said? 
          I'm not a human being.  I'm an
          instrument.  I came from your
          memory and your imagination and I
          will torture you no matter what.
          Even if I remain passive.  That's
          when I drank the...
              (beat)
          I was going mad.  It felt like
          there was no body underneath my
          skin.  There was something else. 
          An illusion.  But I could feel my
          heart beating, and I remembered you
          tested my blood.  Is it like yours?

                    KELVIN
          Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly
          like mine.

                    RHEYA
          But then I would be dead now.

A beat.

                    KELVIN
          Is that really what you want?

                    RHEYA
          I want to stop taking those pills.

                    KELVIN
          I wish you wouldn't.

                    RHEYA
          They do something to me.  It's hard
          to think straight.

                    KELVIN
          I think they help.

                    RHEYA
          I have consciousness, but I am not
          mortal.  Don't you see why I'm
          going crazy?

                    KELVIN
          You have to remember that I love
          you, that's all that matters --

                    RHEYA
          I can't --

                    KELVIN
          It put you here.  I'll admit it, it
          acted like a God and put you here,
          put you into my consciousness. 
          I was asleep, and it put you into
          my dream.  I saw your mouth.  And
          there you were.
              (beat)
          Whether you've been sent here to
          make me happy or punish me, it
          doesn't matter.  The decision we
          make now is all that matters.  Stay
          with me.

                    RHEYA
          Am I really her?

                    KELVIN
          I don't know anymore.  All I see is
          you.

They kiss.

                    KELVIN
          Stay with me.
              (beat)
          Stay with me.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin is on the videophone to Snow.

                    KELVIN
          She knows everything.  She knows
          who she is.

                    SNOW
          She knows everything?  Does she
          know she came once before and you
          put her in --

                    KELVIN
          No.

A beat.

                    SNOW
          What do you want?

                    KELVIN
          I want you to get Sartorius to
          abandon his plan.

                    SNOW
              (feigning innocence)
          What plan?

                    KELVIN
          Just get him to stop.

                    SNOW
          What do you want to do, leave the
          station with her?

                    KELVIN
          Yes.

                    SNOW
          Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You
          don't believe me?  Let's radio that
          shuttle pod you launched -- better
          yet, let's go get it.  I've charted
          it's trajectory, only take a few
          hours...

                    KELVIN
          Her oxygen would have run out.

                    SNOW
          Maybe she doesn't need any.  Should
          we check?

Kelvin just stares at him.

                    SNOW
          Who are you trying to please? 
          Yourself?  Her?  Which her, this
          one or that one.  Can you face
          both?  We are in a situation that
          is beyond morality.  So: Leave with
          her.  You'll see the
          transformation.

                    KELVIN
          Into what?

                    SNOW
          You'll see her die, that's all. 
          They're mortal, despite what she
          told you.  She will die.  Then what
          will you do?

                    KELVIN
          I love her.

                    SNOW
          You do, you don't.  She's willing
          to give her life, you're willing to
          give yours, it's touching and
          magnificent, anything you want but 
          -- this isn't the place for it. 
          Don't you see?  No, you don't.

He is playing back a message sent by Sartorius.

                    SARTORIUS
          I'm sending you a message because I
          feel sorry for you.  I really do,
          Kelvin.
              (beat)
          It is a mistake to become
          emotionally engaged with one of
          them.  You are being manipulated. 
          You are going around in circles to
          satisfy the curiosity of a power we
          don't understand and can't control,
          and she is the living proof that
          power exists.  If she were ugly,
          you wouldn't want her around;
          that's why she's not ugly.  She is
          a mirror that reflects part of your
          mind.  You provide the formula. 
          You can only finish where you
          started, remember that.

          They sold us out to the highest

          that.  We should have been
          consulted.  We're not fucking
          hardware.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin wakes up.  Rheya is beside him.  He rises and heads
for the bathroom.

He swallows two pills and a small cup of water.

When he returns to the bed, Rheya is looking at him.

                    RHEYA
          What are you taking?

                    KELVIN
          A sleeping pill.  Do you want
          yours?

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Rheya, on the kitchen floor.  The bottle of sleeping pills
just beyond her hand.

BACK ON THE PROMETHEUS

Kelvin looks at Rheya.  She shakes her head; she doesn't want
the pills.  Kelvin comes and sits beside her.

                    KELVIN
          What does it want?

                    RHEYA
          I don't know.  Something. 
          Anything.

She goes to a portal and stares out at Solaris.

                    RHEYA
          It created me and yet I can't
          communicate with it.  It must hear
          me, though.  It must know what's
          happening to me.  Don't you think?

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Snow on the videophone to Kelvin.  Rheya is asleep in the
background.

                    SNOW
          I don't think it dislikes us.  I
          think it just noticed us.  It
          lives, thinks, and acts.  We are
          dealing with a living creature
          here, no question.  And it's done
          something we've never been able to
          do: create a perfect human body. 
          Perfect except for the subatomic
          alterations, but...

GIBARIAN

On his suicide tape:

                    GIBARIAN
          If Solaris is inside our brain, and
          it knows everything, and we're only
          consciously aware of what 2% of our
          brain is up to at any given moment,
          it knows us better than we know
          ourselves.  It's not even close.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Rheya and Kelvin.

                    RHEYA
          I've decided that if it is God,
          it's a sick God.  Its ambitions
          exceed its powers, but it doesn't
          realize it.
              (beat)
          It's created a situation without a
          goal, and I hate that.  A God whose
          passion is not a redemption, who
          saves nothing, fulfills no purpose.
              (beat)
          And us?  We would have to have "an
          arrangement".  An unspoken
          understanding that I am not human. 
          How can I not hate something that
          does that?

                    KELVIN
          Please.  Don't.

someone.

KELVIN

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin, in a fever, eyes open but glazed.

Rheya is putting a compress on his forehead.

KELVIN'S POV

Of the room.

His LABRADOR FROM THE OPENING SEQUENCE is sitting by the
chair.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S CABIN (EARTH)

Kelvin sits in a chair, looking at:

THE LABRADOR

Sitting in the same position as it was on the Prometheus.

KELVIN

Breathes a sigh of relief at being home.  Everything seems
slowed down, somehow.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I though I was home.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

On the Prometheus.  Kelvin is in bed, feverish.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I thought it was over.

He sees Rheya, in the hallway again, talking to someone we
can't see.

KELVIN

Wakes up again.  Rheya is asleep beside him.

EXT.  STREET CORNER - DAY

Ten years ago.  Kelvin and Rheya standing on a street corner. 
They seem to be pausing in the midst of a very serious
conversation.  It is raining.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin in bed, on the Prometheus.  Still feverish.

Rheya is mopping his brow.

INT.  KELVIN'S CABIN (EARTH)

Kelvin in bed, feverish.

Rheya is there, wiping his forehead.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

On the Prometheus.  Kelvin looks over to Rheya.

                    KELVIN
          Where did you go before?

                    RHEYA
          When?

                    KELVIN
          Last night.  You were talking to
          someone in the corridor.

                    RHEYA
          You must have been dreaming.

She begins to cry.

                    KELVIN
          What's the matter?

She just shakes her head.

                    KELVIN
          Rheya?

From Kelvin's point of view: Rheya, in the chair, crying.

Then he looks right to see: Rheya, in the doorway, talking to
someone we cannot see.

Then he looks further to the right, and there she is again,
staring at him from the bathroom doorway.  She moves to the
edge of the bed in order to be near.

KELVIN

Sweating.  Struggling.  Beyond fear.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I'm losing my mind.
              (beat)
          I'm breaking apart.

INT.  CABIN - DAY

Kelvin sits in his chair, as he did at the beginning, with
the three officials from DBA behind him.

Only now the three officials are Snow, Sartorius, and
Gibarian.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM (PROMETHEUS)

Kelvin, transfixed.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          Is this what it means to die?
              (beat)
          Am I in the moment of my own death?
              (beat)
          Is this the last thought I will
          ever have?

This idea forces him to rise, and he does, slowly.

INT.  CORRIDOR

Behind Kelvin as he somehow keeps moving.

We hold a long time, and then:

EXT.  STREET

Kelvin moving down a crowded sidewalk, in slow motion.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I am home now.
              (beat)
          I try to find the rhythm of the
          world where I used to live... but I
          feel completely and continually out
          of-sync.  I am separate.  Why did I
          return to Earth and lie about what
          happened?  Lie about having contact
          with something like Solaris?  I
          knew something else was out there,
          and didn't tell a soul.  I left
          them in the dark.  We all did.

EXT.  KELVIN'S CABIN - DAY

Kelvin returns.  He stops and looks around before entering
his front door.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          So why come back at all?  To see if
          she comes here?

KEVIN'S POV

Of the woods.

But there are strange incongruities in the image -- pieces of
the Prometheus breaking through; for instance, a few of the
AUTOMATED TASKMASTERS are crawling along the ground.

KELVIN

Looking from the doorway, notes this.  He doesn't seem
surprised, though.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I don't believe it will happen.

INT.  KELVIN'S CABIN - NIGHT

Kelvin, in his bed, awake.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          But I will wait, anyway.

                                                  CUT TO:

Kelvin is in his bed, still feverish.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I thought it was over.

He looks around the room.  He is alone.

A flashing light on his computer demands attention.

ON THE COMPUTER

A video message from Rheya.

                    RHEYA
          Don't blame them.  I begged them to
          do it.  It's better this way.
              (beat)
          I'm sorry.
              (beat)
          I'm sorry I tried to make you think
          I was human.
              (beat)
          I read my own suicide note.  I
          found it in your things.  I
          realized I was not her.

She looks away.

                    RHEYA
          I know that you loved me, Chris.  I
          know that.
              (beat)
          I love you.

Kelvin breaks down.

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Kelvin, with the dead Rheya in his arms, crying.  Beyond him
is the rain-streaked window.  On the floor, by her hand, is
the note.  On it is scrawled the end of a Dylan Thomas poem,
the one Kelvin quoted to her the first time they spoke.

INT.  PARTY - NIGHT

The first night.  Again, Kelvin leans into Rheya's ear and
whispers.  This time we hear what he says:

                    KELVIN
          "Though they go mad they shall be
          sane.  Though they sink through the
          sea they shall rise again."

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Kevin holding Rheya.

The note on the floor.

The rain-streaked window.

                    RHEYA (V.O.)
          "Though lovers be lost love shall
          not.  And death shall have no
          dominion."

Kelvin wipes the hair from her face.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          You killed her!

                    SARTORIUS (V.O.)
          Not her.  It.

INT.  PROMETHEUS

Kelvin, furious, is talking through a slit in Sartorius'
door.

                    KELVIN
          You murdered her!

                    SARTORIUS
          Kelvin, she begged me.  I had a
          short-range version of the
          destabilizer prototype, a miniature
          with a range of a few meters.  She
          walked into it and disappeared. 
          She was gone.

Kelvin looks around.

                    KELVIN
          She'll come back.

                    SARTORIUS
          No, she won't.

                    KELVIN
          Why would you let her to do that?

                    SARTORIUS
          It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever
          it is, it's not human, and I am
          threatened by that.  Evolution-of-
          the-species-at-stake threatened. 
          And I want to win.  I want humans
          to win.  So I am killing it before
          it kills me.

                    KELVIN
          You fucking bastard...

                    SARTORIUS
          Whose side are you on?

Kelvin moves away.

EXT.  SOLARIS

Still turning, slowly.

But something about its appearance is different.

INT.  PROMETHEUS

Complete chaos.

Kelvin is chasing Sartorius to the flight deck.

                    SARTORIUS
              (yelling as he runs)
          It's changing characteristics. 
          It's solidifying taking on weight.

                    KELVIN
          How quickly?

                    SARTORIUS
          If it continues, it will implode
          from its own weight and turn into a
          black hole in about four hours and
          pulls us in with it.

INT.  FLIGHT DECK

Kelvin and Sartorius get the ship ready for take off.

                    KELVIN
          Where's Snow?  Did you call him?

                    SARTORIUS
          Yes.

Kelvin turns and sees one of the video monitors that Snow is
sitting in his room.

                    KELVIN
              (via intercom)
          Snow!  We need you up here.

Snow doesn't reply.

                    KELVIN
          Snow!

Snow looks up.  There's a strange look on his face.

                    KELVIN
          What's wrong with you?  We need
          your help.

                    SNOW
          I won't be making the trip.

                    SARTORIUS
          Snow, get up here, now.

                    SNOW
          I'm not Snow.

This stops Kelvin and Sartorius.  They look at each other and
then at the monitor.

                    SNOW
          I got rid of him.  I wanted to see
          if... I wanted to be the only one. 
          I wanted to be Snow.

                    SARTORIUS
          Fuck me.  I knew it.

                    KELVIN
          When did this happen?

                    SNOW
          Oh, right away.  That's why you
          never saw me with anyone.  You
          should've noticed that.  I miss
          him, though.  I think I made a
          mistake.

                    KELVIN
          Jesus...

                    SNOW
          But I can't leave with you.  I
          won't make it.

                    KELVIN
          Maybe you can.

                    SARTORIUS
          You want it coming back with us?

                    SNOW
          You go ahead.  Of what I remember
          about Earth... it's all one thing
          now.  Everything's a blur.  I like
          distinctions.

Snow lies down on his bed.  Kelvin looks at Sartorius.

                    SARTORIUS
          We do not have time to deal with
          this.  Get the diode sail into
          position and let me know when the
          bias drive and the induction ring
          are at zero point.

Kelvin nods and obeys.  He then takes one last look at the
monitor to see Snow lying in bed.  Kelvin reaches over and
shuts the monitor off.

EXT.  SPACE

Silence.

The Prometheus moves away from Solaris.

CLOSER ON SOLARIS

After the ship has gone.

A soft black spot begins to form in the center of the planet.

Slowly, inexorably, this black spot begins to expand.

Within a minute Solaris has disappeared.

EXT.  STREET CORNER - DAY

Kelvin, back on Earth.  Silent and still.  And the rain
continues.

He watches the activity; the cars, buses, and people moving
to and fro.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          Earth.
              (beat)
          What did that word mean to me?
              (beat)
          I have returned.  Finally.

Kelvin begins to walk.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I work in the city now.  After work
          I wander and lose myself.  I am
          silent and attentive.  I follow the
          current.  I make a conscious effort
          to smile, nod, stand, and perform
          the millions of gestures that
          constitute life on Earth.

INT.  TRAIN - DAY

Kelvin taking the train to the suburbs.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I will study these gestures until
          they become reflexes again.  I will
          find new interests and occupations,
          but --

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Kelvin makes his way toward his cabin.  As he nears, his
LABRODOR recognizes him and approaches.

Kelvin pats the dog's coat.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I will not... give myself.  I will
          not give myself to anything or
          anyone, because I am haunted by the
          idea that I remembered her wrong. 
          That I shaded my memory of her to
          suit myself.  That I was unfair to
          her and caused her destruction. 
          What if I was wrong about
          everything?
              (beat)
          I've come to believe that memory is
          a curse.

EXT.  CABIN - DAY

Kelvin is near the front door, dog at his heel.  He looks in
as he brings his key to the lock and his face FREEZES.

RHEYA

Is in the living room, waiting for him.

She is sitting on the sofa, looking toward the other side of
the room.  Sensing someone, she turns to see Kelvin, and her
face melts into a smile.

KELVIN

Opens the door.  He cannot speak.

RHEYA

Rises and moves toward him.

They embrace.

He breathes her in.  She squeezes him.

After a long beat:

                    KELVIN
          How can you be here...

                    RHEYA
              (whispering)
          Shhhh.  Just stay with me.
              (beat)
          Stay with me.  Everything is
          forgiven.  Everything.

She sways with him, gently.  His body relaxes.

                    KELVIN
          I love you.

EXT.  CABIN - DAY

A tableau of the cabin.  The dog is on the front step,
seemingly content despite the light rain.

As fog drifts in, we RISE, and soon the mist has nearly
obscured the house.  The fog turns into clouds and we get
fleeting glimpses of the cabin, as we move farther and
farther away.

We stay in a translucent white stage for a few moments, until
gradually the edges of a circle become apparent in the
corners of the frame.  Still there is a light rain sound.

These dark, rounded edges penetrate further until they are
forming the shape of a circle.

The misty consistency begins to gain some color and body.

And we realize we are now looking at the surface of Solaris.

                                                FADE OUT.

First, over BLACK, we hear the sound of a light rain.

Then:

                    A MAN'S VOICE
          I'm not a poet.  I've never moved
          anyone with my words.
              (beat)
          Maybe that's why they chose me.

EXT.  WOODS - DAY

A mural of leafless trees beneath an overcast sky.  Rain
continues to fall.

Maybe now we begin to notice a strange quality to the light
(or is it the sky?).  Something vaguely unsettling.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  BEDROOM - MORNING

Still, the sound of rain is heard.

A MAN

40s, lies on his side in bed, staring at us.

He has not been sleeping.  In fact, judging from his distant
expression, he has not slept in ages.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Less like a road and more like a path that you maneuver a
vehicle through.

The Man, dressed in rain gear, walks down the middle.  He is
accompanied by a medium-sized LABRADOR, and seems in no
particular hurry.

The sound of tires appear and grow in intensity.  The Man,
without saying an actual word, instructs the dog to heal. 
The dog obeys as the Man moves off the road.  The vehicle
hurtles past him -- its engine quiet, its windows darkened --
spraying muddy debris in its wake.

Seconds later, the car brakes abruptly and skids to a stop.

THE MAN

Stops walking and stares at the car, which seems ominously
still.

The car then reverses direction and begins to move toward the
Man, who remains motionless.

When the car is alongside him, a darkened window turns
transparent and we see a WELL-DRESSED BUREAUCRAT in the rear
seat.  His demeanor is pleasant and professional.

                    WELL-DRESSED BUREAUCRAT
          Dr. Kelvin?

The Man he is addressing, who we now understand is CHRIS
KELVIN, stares back at him.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CABIN - DAY

The contrast between the cabin's rustic aesthetic and the
aggressively high-tech equipment contained therein isn't as
jarring as you might imagine.

Kelvin is seated in front of a desk, scrolling through a text
readout on a flat, transparent holographic screen.  Behind
him is the Well-Dressed Bureaucrat from the car, and two
others: A WOMAN in her 50s and a MAN in his 30s.  They are
also well-groomed.  Each of their suits are embroidered with
a small but distinctive LOGO of some sort that composes the
acronym DBA.

Kelvin scrolls through several menus, hits a few keys, and a
digitized VIDEO IMAGE appears on his screen: A MAN, unshaven,
looking into the camera.

The man, GIBARIAN, looks very tired and somewhat apologetic. 
The lower part of the screen has a time of day and date
display that reads: 0221 HRS 11/14/31.

                    GIBARIAN
          We take off into the cosmos, ready
          for anything: solitude, hardship,
          exhaustion, death.  We're proud of
          ourselves, in a way.  But our
          enthusiasm is a sham.  We don't
          want to conquer the cosmos -- we
          want to extend the boundaries of
          Earth to the cosmos.  We are only
          seeking Man.  We don't want Other
          Worlds.  We want mirrors.
              (beat)
          Maybe we don't need to know what it
          is, or why.  Maybe just knowing
          that it is should be enough.

Gibarian stares at the camera for a long moment before
switching it off and ending the transmission.

Kelvin sits back.

The visitors exchange glances.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  SPACE CAPSULE

Close on Kelvin.  We hold on him a long time, as a myriad of
readouts scroll and flash across his face.  A slit of
sunlight glides slowly through frame.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

KELVIN

in the same capsule, a month later.  He is asleep.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

KELVIN

in the same capsule, two months later.  He is dictating some
coordinates to Earth.  He absently scratches his heavy growth
of beard.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

KELVIN

two months later still.  He is looking out his small,
rectangular window, and for the fist time we cut around to
see the approaching planet: SOLARIS.

Kelvin stares at it, hypnotized.  It has a translucent
quality, as though it is lit from within, and its undulating,
ocean-like surface slowly changes colors.

Kelvin's attention is diverted as an orbiting ship, the
PROMETHEUS, edges into frame.

                    KELVIN
          Prometheus, this is Athena 7, on
          approach, do you read me?
              (beat)
          Prometheus, this is Athena 7, on
          approach, do you read me?

No response.  He exhales and types on a keyboard.

EXT.  SPACE

The Athena 7, sporting a DBA logo, advances toward the
Prometheus.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  PROMETHEUS

Kelvin, in a space suit, climbs with some difficulty out of
the Athena 7, which has come to rest in the DOCKING BAY of
the Prometheus.  Several exploratory PODS fill the remainder
of the area.

Kelvin gets his bearings and looks around, but sees no sign
of life.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CORRIDOR

Empty.

(NOTE: Except for some ROBOTIC, NON-SPEAKING CHARACTERS: the
AUTOMATED TASKMASTERS.  These are small, bug-like repair
units that constantly roam the ship, fixing things.  Their
tiny hum is virtually silent, and we see them all the time on
the Prometheus.  They can adhere to any surface at any
angle.)

Kelvin, now out of his space suit and holding a small
carrying case and a duffle bag, moves on.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  GIBARIAN'S ROOM

Ransacked.

Kelvin registers it, then moves to the corner of the room
where the computer terminal rests.  Within moments he has
discovered Gibarian has recorded a video message for him to
replay.

VIDEO

Gibarian addressing the camera.  He appears to be lucid, but
extremely fatigued.

                    GIBARIAN
          Hi, Chris.
              (a light smile)
          I'm so glad you came.
              (beat, the smile fades)
          I still have a little time, and I
          want to tell you something.  To
          warn you.  By now you know about
          me, or if you don't, get Snow or
          Sartorius to tell you; it doesn't
          matter.
              (beat)
          I didn't lose my mind.  You should
          be able to tell from this video. 
          I'm not mad.
              (beat)
          If it happens to you, remember that
          it isn't madness.
              (beat)
          You should know, I'm in favor of
          destroying Solaris.  I know
          that's... illegal.  And unethical. 
          And irresponsible.  But it's the
          only way to make it stop.

A long moment of silence is broken by a noise on the video,
which draws Gibarian's attention offscreen.

                    GIBARIAN
              (addressing whoever made
               the noise)
          Cut that out.  Do you hear me?

Gibarian switches off the video.

The computer screen freezes the last recorded frame and
overlays a readout indicating the file has ended.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CORRIDOR

Empty.  But there is a door at the end of it, slightly open. 
Kelvin moves toward it.

INT.  ROOM

A FIGURE, seated with its back to the door, turns to see
Kelvin enter.  This is SNOW.  He looks Kelvin up and down,
his expression wary and alert.

                    KELVIN
          Snow.  Didn't you hear me radio? 
          I'm Kelvin.

A long beat.  Snow just watches him.

                    SNOW
          Yes.  We heard.

Kelvin takes a step forward, and Snow recoils.

                    KELVIN
          What's wrong?  What happened to
          Gibarian?

                    SNOW
          He's dead.

                    KELVIN
          How?

A beat.

                    SNOW
          Suicide.

Snow exhales, then looks up as though he's remembered
something.

                    SNOW
          You didn't bring any chocolate, did
          you?

                    KELVIN
          What?

                    SNOW
              (musing)
          I love chocolate.  I realized just
          yesterday how much I love it.
              (beat, then he recovers)
          I thought maybe, if they let you
          bring personal effects, you might
          have snuck some through, because...
          well, I've been thinking about it.

A long beat as Kelvin stares at Snow.

                    KELVIN
          What happened here?

Snow lies back in his bunk.

                    SNOW
          I can't talk just now.  I'm too
          tired.

                    KELVIN
          Where's Sartorius?

                    SNOW
          In his lab.  He won't let you in.

                    KELVIN
              (leaving)
          He'll let me in.

                    SNOW
          Kelvin, if you see anything
          unusual...

Kelvin stops, but doesn't turn around.

                    SNOW
          ... try to stay calm.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CORRIDOR

Kelvin stands outside a door.

                    KELVIN
          Let me in.

A beat.

                    SARTORIUS
              (inside, muffled)
          You have to give me your word you
          won't come in.  Then I'll come out.

                    KELVIN
          All right.

Sartorius cracks the door open and slithers through the slit
and into the hallway.  He is of obvious intelligence and not
to be messed with; contentious, intimidating when he wants to
be, and probably brilliant.  Kelvin eyes him suspiciously.

                    KELVIN
          What happened to Gibarian?

                    SARTORIUS
          Didn't you talk to Snow?

                    KELVIN
          I want to hear your version.

                    SARTORIUS
              (incredulous)
          Who, here, could possibly care what
          you want?  At best, you're Employee
          of the Month for the highest bidder
          in the Solaris auction.  They have
          no idea what's going on up here.
          They've never even been in space.
          And I'm supposed to listen to you?

                    KELVIN
          I am here to recover this mission,
          report my findings, and make a
          recommendation.  Now: What happened
          to him?

                    SARTORIUS
          The same thing that could happen to
          any of us.

                    KELVIN
          Where's his body?

                    SARTORIUS
          In the lab.  With her, probably.

                    KELVIN
          Her?  Who are you talking about?

Sartorius is grabbed by something on the other side of his
door.  He struggles to keep his composure.

                    SARTORIUS
          His last wish was to be buried on
          Earth.  In dirt, he said.  "I want
          to buried in dirt."  What a clown.

Sartorius is losing the battle with whomever or whatever is
on the other side of his door.

                    KELVIN
          They shouldn't let people like you
          into space.

                    SARTORIUS
          Just so you know: I'm not going
          back until I understand what it is. 
          I am going to figure out what it
          is, make it stop, and then I will
          go home.

                    KELVIN
          Listen --

                    SARTORIUS
          We're done.  Oh, I should tell you,
          I don't trust Snow.  There's
          something wrong with him.

Sartorius rotates and zips back into his room.  As the door
closes Kelvin sees a flash of ANOTHER FIGURE in Sartorius'
room.  The glimpse was too quick to judge who or what the
other figure could have been.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CORRIDOR - DAY

Kelvin walks, exploring the ship.  He sees something that
stops him:

A NUDE WOMAN

Black, early 20s, slipping across a corridor up ahead.

Kelvin gives chase.  He sees her turn a corner, but by the
time he gets there, she is gone.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  SNOW'S ROOM

Snow is lying on his bunk.

                    KELVIN
          Is there anybody else here?

                    SNOW
              (sits up a little)
          Why, who did you see?

                    KELVIN
          Gibarian warned me.  He left me a
          message.

                    SNOW
          Who was it?

                    KELVIN
          She was real.  Where did she come
          from?

Snow looks at him but doesn't respond.

                    KELVIN
          Tell me.  I won't think you're
          insane.

                    SNOW
          Oh, that's a relief.

Snow lies back down.

                    KELVIN
          Where did she come from?

A beat.

                    SNOW
          How much sleep do you need?

                    KELVIN
          How much sleep?

                    SNOW
          How long can you go without sleep?

                    KELVIN
          That depends.

                    SNOW
          Well, when you do go to sleep:
          barricade your door.

Snow rolls over, away from Kelvin.

EXT.  SPACE

Solaris.  Quiet, but still active somehow.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          The Prometheus, as far as I can
          tell, is functionally intact.  Crew
          status: One dead, Gibarian.  Cause
          of death appears to be suicide.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin speaks into a video communication device.  As he does,
we see images of the things and people he describes.

                    KELVIN
          Interviews with the surviving
          members and a perusal of the
          deceased's personal effects
          indicate he was suffering from
          severe depression with psychotic
          features, along with bouts of
          hypomania, dementia, delirium, and
          primary insomnia.  All of these
          symptoms, combined with a profound
          sense of isolation, are commonly
          found in studies of low stimulation
          environments, particularly long
          range space travel.  Snow and
          Sartorius show indications of
          depression, including dysthymic and
          bipolar I; a variety of stress
          disorders, including acute and
          posttraumatic; and suggestions of
          agoraphobia, obsessive/compulsive
          disorder, and hypersomnia.  I
          emphasize these are preliminary
          opinions on my part.  I will
          attempt to convince Snow and
          Sartorius to return to Earth, but
          as they currently view me as an
          intruder of sorts, this may take
          some time.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Later.  Kelvin is lying down.  The lights are out, and he is
trying to sleep.

After a moment, he gets up, checks the lock on his door, and
lies back down.

Then he gets up and moves a chair in front of the door, and
lies back down.

Then he gets up and puts two heavy cases on top of the chair,
and lies back down.

Laughing to himself, he drifts off to sleep.

Silence.

ANOTHER ANGLE

On Kelvin, asleep.

ANOTHER ANGLE

On Kelvin, still asleep.  Then:

EXTREME CLOSE-UP:

A WOMAN'S LIPS, slightly parted.

BACK TO KELVIN

Asleep.  Then:

INT.  TRAIN - DAY

Continued silence, AND:

RHEYA, 30s, staring at us, practically daring us to look
away.  Her obvious intelligence and confidence make her
extremely compelling, along with the fact that it was her
parted lips we were looking at a moment ago.  Her expression
indicates she's in a very raw emotional state.

REVERSE ANGLE

Kelvin is the person she has locked eyes with on the TRAIN.

He is younger here; not just in age, but in spirit.  The
contrast with his older self is striking.

BACK TO KELVIN

Asleep on the ship.  After a beat:

EXTREME CLOSE-UP:

Rheya's LIPS.

Except the circumstance is clearly different: it's darker and
there isn't the side-to-side shimmy of the train car.

A WIDER VIEW

Reveals that Rheya is not sitting on the train -- she is
sitting in Kelvin's room on the Prometheus, right now.

She is staring at Kelvin and she is ethereal in her
stillness.

KELVIN

Awakens, blinks, and slowly recognizes her.

If he is not entirely surprised it is because he has
obviously dreamed of Rheya before.  He looks at her, simply.

RHEYA

Stands and makes her way to Kelvin.

Without hesitation she kisses him and they begin to explore
each other and we see all of it happen and two things are
obvious: first, they have done this before, and two: they
haven't done it in some time.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin is asleep, Rheya in his arms.

He wakes up and looks at her, perplexed.  After a beat he
rises to sit on the edge of the bed.

A wave of terror is barely suppressed as he puts his hand to
his forehead.  Rheya opens her eyes.

                    KELVIN
          Oh, God.  I'm awake.

                    RHEYA
          Yes.

He looks at her.

                    KELVIN
          Where did you come from?

She moves to him and kisses him as if that's all she wants to
do, forever.

Between kisses.

                    KELVIN
          How are you here?

She stops.

                    RHEYA
          How do you mean?
              (beat)
          Chris, what's wrong?

Hearing his name spoken by her (and those particular words,
perhaps) nearly causes Kelvin to scream.

He stands and moves to the chair.  Rheya watches him.

                    RHEYA
          I love you.

He looks up at her for as long as he can.  Then he looks
down.

                    RHEYA
          Do you love me?

He doesn't look up.

                    KELVIN
          Yes.

A beat.

                    KELVIN
          I need to see Snow.

                    RHEYA
          I'll go with you.

                    KELVIN
              (rising)
          I'll just be a minute.

She bolts out of bed.

                    RHEYA
          Don't.

                    KELVIN
          Why?

                    RHEYA
          I don't know.  I can't be alone.

                    KELVIN
          I'll be right back.

She is trying to accommodate him but her fear of being left
alone is palpable, even excessive.  He sees this and puts his
arms on her shoulders to comfort her.

                    KELVIN
          All right.  All right.  Here.

He hands her a few pills and retrieves a glass of water.

                    RHEYA
          What are they?

                    KELVIN
          To calm your anxiety.

                    RHEYA
          To calm my anxiety.

She takes the pills and smiles.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  DOCKING BAY

Kelvin leads Rheya to one of the exploratory pods.  They are
in space suits.

                    RHEYA
          We're taking a flight?

                    KELVIN
          Yes.

He opens the door of a pod and indicates for her to enter. 
She is unsure.

                    KELVIN
          Go ahead.  I'll close the door
          behind me.

She stares up and into the pod.  Kelvin watches her go with
difficulty and then CLOSES THE DOOR behind Rheya.

He walks across the docking bay to the control room and
begins preparations for the pod to be jettisoned.

KELVIN

In agony as he watches a real-time, beat-by-beat brand of
technological murder take place: Rheya's pod is pushed off
into space.

RHEYA

Her face contorted in confusion, watches through the pod
window as the docking bay doors close in front of her with a
brutal finality.

KELVIN

collapses to the ground, shattered.

INSERT:

A woman's HAND, resting on the floor of an apartment.  The
fingers are being licked by a LABRADOR PUPPY.

ANOTHER INSERT:

A pot of coffee, on the boil.  Except that it has been left
unattended for too long...

ANOTHER INSERT:

A rain-streaked window.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin, on the edge of his bed.  He wants to tear himself
inside out.

A voice calls over the intercom: Snow's.

                    SNOW
          Was her breakfast conversation that
          bad?

                    KELVIN
          Shut up.

                    SNOW
          I told you, try to stay calm. 
          You're supposed to be the
          psychologist of the bunch.

                    KELVIN
          What was it?

Kelvin rises and goes to wash his face.

                    SNOW
          Personally, I think it's God.  At
          least, it fits my definition.

                    KELVIN
          And professionally?

                    SNOW
          I'm not sure.
              (beat)
          It started with Gibarian.  He
          locked himself in his room and
          refused to talk except through a
          crack in the door.  He covered the
          video lens.  Obviously we thought
          he was having a nervous breakdown.
          I don't know why he didn't tell us
          he had somebody in there.  By this
          time, we were getting visitors,
          too.  He was desperately trying to
          figure it out.  Day and night.
              (beat)
          Who was she?

                    KELVIN
          My wife.

                    SNOW
          Dead?

Kelvin nods.

                    SNOW
          She has materialized from your
          memory of her.  What was her name?

                    KELVIN
          Rheya.

                    SNOW
          It started about three months ago. 
          Right after the government sold the
          expedition.  We were ready to go
          home.

                    KELVIN
          Will she come back?

                    SNOW
          Probably.

                    KELVIN
          I wish you'd told me.

                    SNOW
          Told you what?

A beat.

                    SNOW
          What will you say?

                    KELVIN
          To who?

                    SNOW
          What are you going to report back
          to Earth?

                    KELVIN
          I don't know.

                    SNOW
          An enormous amount of money changed
          hands to get control of this
          project.  We are in little danger
          of being left alone for long.
              (beat)
          You'll need to do something. 
          Otherwise they'll be sending
          someone out to recover you.

                    KELVIN
          Gibarian said he thinks Solaris
          should be destroyed.

                    SNOW
          That's ludicrous.  This is contact. 
          We have found God.  The only issue
          is figuring out how to prove this
          in a way that will make sense back
          on Earth.  So how will we describe
          it, if we choose to describe it at
          all?

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM

Before Kelvin's arrival.

Gibarian is talking to Snow and Sartorius.

                    GIBARIAN
          A pre-biological colloidal
          envelope, possibly exceeding
          terrestrial structures in
          complexity; a plasmic mechanism. 
          Probably without life as we
          conceive it, but capable of
          performing functional activities on
          an astronomic scale.  My view is
          that Solaris has reached, in a
          single bound, the "homeostatic
          ocean" stage without passing
          through stages of terrestrial
          evolution.  I think it bypassed
          cellular development altogether. 
          It hasn't taken endless eons to
          adapt itself to its environment,
          but in fact dominated its
          environment immediately.  From the
          moment it existed, it was the most
          superior element in the Universe.
          And now it passes the time doing
          extravagant theoretical thinking
          about the Universe, with us as the
          cast.

We now show this scene being played out on a video monitor,
watched by Kelvin.

                    GIBARIAN
          It's engaged in a never-ending
          process of transformation; an
          ontological autometamorphosis,
          begging the question: Can thought
          exist separately from
          consciousness?

                    SNOW
          It's God.

                    SARTORIUS
          I don't care what it is, we need to
          figure out how to make it stop.

                    GIBARIAN
          Nelson, we have the opportunity --

                    SARTORIUS
          What if this thing follows us back
          to Earth?  What if what's happening
          here started happening on Earth, on
          a mass scale?  Don't you see that
          as a problem?  I think it's a
          serious mistake to assume it's
          benign.  For all we know it's
          driving us crazy so it can watch us
          kill each other.

Gibarian considers this.

                    SNOW
          We're not even sure it will let us
          leave.

                                                  CUT TO:

ANOTHER VIDEO

This time, Gibarian alone.  Near the end.

                    GIBARIAN
          Maybe it's stuck.  Maybe its power
          isn't that God-like.  I mean, we
          have God-like power relative to an
          insect, but that doesn't mean we
          can move the Earth around at will.
          Maybe it's like a spider web,
          waiting for something to show up.
              (beat)
          We intercepted some brief fragments
          of what must be an everlasting
          monologue with itself.  Of course
          it was beyond our understanding.
              (beat)
          I've come to hate it here.  There's
          only one way out of its reach, for
          us.  Humans.

INT.  LAB

Kelvin stares at Gibarian's body, which is lying under a
sheet in the ship's operating room.  Also under the sheet,
next to Gibarian: The Young Girl.

                    GIBARIAN
              (from a video)
          I thought I'd been behaving
          normally, rationally.  But a sign
          of insanity is the inability to
          think about more than one thing. 
          So if I am consumed by the idea
          that I am insane and can't think of
          anything else, then I am insane.
              (beat, smiles)
          You ask questions at the end of
          your life, the sort of questions
          people who are content don't ask.
              (beat)
          Maybe life just can't be solved.

          Rheya...

                    RHEYA
          I want you inside me right now.

They make love.  It's even better than before.

INT.  TRAIN - DAY

Kelvin, staring intently.  What he is staring at is Rheya,
who is seated across from him.  She doesn't see him, yet. 
When she does, she locks eyes with his and doesn't look away.

This continues until she gets off the train.  Kelvin watches
her go, and she looks back at him through the window as the
train pulls away.

INT.  PARTY - NIGHT

Rheya enters, looks around.  She spots Kelvin, who has
already spotted her.  Their expressions indicate they are
pleased to see each other again.  He approaches her, and they
stare at each other a long time, until:

                    KELVIN
          "And Death Shall Have No Dominion".

                    RHEYA
          Book?

                    KELVIN
          Poem.  Dylan Thomas.  I thought of
          it when I saw you on the train.

                    RHEYA
          My Thomas is a little rusty.

He leans over and whispers into her ear.  She listens, and
when he finishes, she leans back and looks at him, intrigued. 
Genuinely intrigued.  He smiles.

                    RHEYA
          Not a very happy poem.

                    KELVIN
          You didn't look very happy.

                    RHEYA
          I wasn't.

                    KELVIN
          And tonight?

                    RHEYA
          Better.

He nods, and they smile.  They seem to be rooting for each
other.  After an extended pleasurable moment, Rheya leans
over and whispers in his ear.  He listens, then leans back
and looks at her.

                    KELVIN
          That's good to know.

INT.  FRIEND'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Another night.

Rheya is wound up.  Not drunk, something else.  She has an
odd look in her eyes.

We are at a dinner party, and there are people trying -- but
failing -- not to watch.

                    RHEYA
          You want to fuck her?

                    KELVIN
          Stop it.

                    RHEYA
          You behave as though you want to
          fuck her.

                    KELVIN
          Rheya.  Not here.

                    RHEYA
          And I just want to know if I'm
          crazy or not -- if what I think is
          happening is actually happening. 
          Or am I one of those people, those
          women, who are blind to what's
          going on?  Who pretend not to see
          their husband's attention toward
          another woman?

                    KELVIN
          Let's go home.

                    RHEYA
          You go home.

                    KELVIN
          I am.  Please come with me.  I
          don't want to do this here.

He is unmoved, but she labors to change his mind.

          You're better when you take them.

                    RHEYA
          I know, I know.  But still, somehow
          I don't feel better.

                    KELVIN
          All right.  How about I feel better
          when you take them?

A beat.

                    RHEYA
          Right.

They look at each other and understand; she will take the
pills.

INT.  PROMETHEUS

Rheya is taking her pills.  Kelvin watches.

                    KELVIN
          What do you remember?

                    RHEYA
          What do you mean?

                    KELVIN
          Do you remember Beethoven?  The
          Beatles?  Movies, books,
          restaurants, friends?

                    RHEYA
              (thinking)
          Yes.  But not until you mentioned
          them.  As soon as you said those
          things, I remembered them.  And
          they have associations that make me
          think of other things I remember. 
          It's like filling up.

She looks out the portal at Solaris.

                    RHEYA
          Is it a planet?

                    KELVIN
          Not exactly.  It exists in a
          continuum that wasn't proven until
          ten years ago, a higher
          mathematical dimension superimposed
          on top of the Universe.  An
          infinite number of them, in fact. 
          It was a violation of all of our
          various laws regarding the
          Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It
          was completely counter-intuitive. 
          We had to unlearn everything.

                    RHEYA
          Is it intelligent?

                    KELVIN
          Intelligent beyond our
          comprehension.

                    RHEYA
          Then it's God, right?

                    KELVIN
          It's something.

                    RHEYA
          You still don't believe in God?

                    KELVIN
          The whole idea of God was dreamed
          up by a silly animal with a small
          brain called Man.  Even the limits
          we put on it are human limits.  It
          can do this, it can do that!  It
          designs, it creates!

                    RHEYA
          Even a God that wasn't active, that
          just created something and stood
          back and watched?

                    KELVIN
          You're talking about a man in a
          white beard again.  You're
          ascribing human characteristics to
          something that isn't human.  Human
          beings look for causes and
          patterns.  How could we know what
          Solaris is up to, if anything?

A beat.

                    RHEYA
          But what if Solaris is what there
          was before The Big Bang?

                    KELVIN
          As I said, it is beyond our
          comprehension.

                    RHEYA
          As I said, then it's God, right?

She looks at him and can't keep from smiling, eventually.

                    RHEYA
          Why are we talking about this shit
          when we could be fucking?

Kelvin smiles.

The intercom comes to life.

                    SNOW
          Kelvin, you awake?

                    KELVIN
          What is it?

                    SNOW
          Can you meet me and Sartorius on B
          deck in an hour?

                    KELVIN
          Why?

                    SNOW
          Just a little strategy session. 
          But in person this time.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin is getting ready to leave.  Rheya sits on the edge of
the bed, nervous.

                    KELVIN
          All right?

She nods and Kelvin exits, locking the door behind him.

We sit with her for a moment as she tries to remain calm.

IN THE CORRIDOR

Kelvin listens.  A long time.

Satisfied, he begins to walk away but is stopped by the
sounding of a CRASHING GLASS from within.  He hears footsteps
approach the door, and then a fierce POUNDING.

He takes a step back.  An INHUMAN AMOUNT OF NOISE begins
emanating from the other side of the door, which is now
threatening to break apart.  It sounds like a plane is
crashing in Kelvin's room -- no human could create this kind
of cacophony.

Finally, he steps forward and presses the button to open the
door.

RHEYA

Is revealed, covered in blood.  She has completely torn the
inside of the cabin door apart and has badly injured herself
in the process.

                    KELVIN
          Rheya...

Confused, she looks up at him as he takes her in his arms and
carries her to the bed.

                    RHEYA
          What happened?

                    KELVIN
          You were trying to break down the
          door.  Do you know why?

                    RHEYA
          When I saw you were gone I got
          scared.

He puts her down on the bed and runs to the bathroom, where
he gathers all the first aid materials he can find.

Returning, he blanches.

Rheya's wounds have HEALED; in fact, they are HEALING in
front of us.

She looks up at him and doesn't like the look on his face.

                    RHEYA
          Chris, what's wrong with me?

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  LAB

Kelvin runs Rheya through a battery of tests and studies the
results.

                    RHEYA
          Am I all right?

A beat.

                    KELVIN
          Yes.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  B DECK CONFERENCE ROOM

Snow and Sartorius wait for Kelvin.

                    SNOW
          He won't do it.

                    SARTORIUS
          Why do you say that?

                    SNOW
          He won't.

Kelvin enters, with Rheya.  Snow and Sartorius exchange
glances.

                    KELVIN
          This is my wife, Rheya.

She looks at Snow and nods.  Sartorius she hates instantly,
and the feeling seems to be mutual.

                    SARTORIUS
          We thought you'd be alone.  We want
          to talk about...

                    SNOW
          We want to talk freely.

                    KELVIN
          Go ahead.

Sartorius begins.

                    SARTORIUS
          I suggest we pool our knowledge
          regarding the... visitors.  We can
          express whatever questions or
          conclusions we might have... share
          information about our various...
          experiments.  Agreed?

Kelvin and Snow nod.

                    SARTORIUS
          I would like to start with
          motivation.  Why are they here?

Sartorius looks at Rheya.  She looks away.

                    SARTORIUS
          They are not autonomous individuals
          and they're not actual persons. 
          They are projections materializing
          from our minds, based on a given
          individual.

                    SNOW
          It's an experiment.

                    KELVIN
          No.  There's no behavior
          modification.

                    SARTORIUS
          She reappeared exactly as she had
          before?

Kelvin looks at Rheya and nods.  She is struck by the word
"before".

                    SNOW
          The same vulnerabilities?

He nods again.

                    SARTORIUS
          A recoil, with no compensating
          mechanism.

                    SNOW
          And when a given situation no
          longer corresponds to the normal
          faculties of the... original, the
          visitor suffers some sort of
          disconnected consciousness.

                    SARTORIUS
          Followed by non-human
          manifestations.

                    SNOW
          Are the actions of Solaris
          premeditated?

                    KELVIN
          Is it being deliberately cruel, you
          mean?  I don't think so.

                    SNOW
          I'm just trying to find an
          explanation for the continual
          reappearances.

                    KELVIN
              (to Rheya)
          When you cut yourself pounding the
          door, did it hurt?

                    RHEYA
          Yes.
              (looks around)
          Of course.

                    SARTORIUS
          If they're not learning anything
          and they're not modifying their
          behavior, why do they come back?

                    SNOW
          It's like they're plugged into a
          game, which goes around and around,
          endlessly repeating itself.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  APARTMENT - NIGHT

This is ten years ago.  Rheya enters, alone.

She crosses to the kitchen and makes a drink.  Almost
immediately, the labrador puppy enters from the bedroom and
stands beside her, tail wagging.  She ignores it and
continues mixing her drink.

Halfway through this activity, the bedroom light comes on.  A
moment later, Kelvin is in the doorway.  Eventually, but not
angrily, because he's still not really awake:

                    KELVIN
          Where've you been?

                    RHEYA
          I been thinking about how much I
          hate you.

She finishes making her drink, drinks it, and walks out the
door.

Kelvin stands in the doorway for a beat, then pivots and
returns to bed.  The light goes out.

                    RHEYA (V.O.)
          Yes, I remember that.  I went back
          to Lois' house and spent the night. 
          Those were dark days.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  PARTY - NIGHT

Kelvin and Rheya, later in the evening when they spoke for
the first time.  They are absolutely infatuated with each
other; they know something is happening between them, will
happen between them.

                    RHEYA
          I would have these -- I don't know
          how to describe them -- visions,
          when I was younger.  Maybe not
          visions, but like these waking
          dream states.  Time would just
          collapse, I would be inside time. 
          I would stare at a second hand on a
          clock until it stopped.  Freaky
          stuff.

                    KELVIN
          How old were you?

                    RHEYA
          Seven, eight.  So one day my mother
          catches me sort of staring off into
          space, and she asks me what I'm
          doing, and I start trying to
          explain to her, about this state
          that I can put myself in, and this
          look comes over her face.

                    KELVIN
          What kind of look?

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin and Rheya sit together in the Prometheus.  Rheya
continues her story without a beat.

                    RHEYA
          Scared.  No, not scared.  Wary. 
          Like I was something to be... her
          guard went up.  I was a threat. 
          Now I know why.  She was afraid
          she'd be seen.  That I would see
          her for the self-obsessed neurotic
          that she was.  I think she thought
          she had a few more years of being
          on a pedestal.  But that's the
          cycle, right?  I knew a little more
          than she did, she knew a little
          more than her mother, and on and
          on.
              (beat)
          I guess that's part of the reason
          why --

                    KELVIN
          I know.  I know.  We don't have to
          talk about that.

Another beat.

                    RHEYA
          I remember days of just thinking
          about you.

INT.  OFFICES - DAY

Intercut Kelvin and Rheya at their respective jobs, going
through a normal day.  There is no sound.  As we see these
images, it's clear that Kelvin and Rheya are slightly not
present in their respective encounters with other people;
they are distracted by the idea of each other.

And they like it.

                    RHEYA
          Thinking what you were doing and
          saying, just being consumed by
          thinking of you.  I loved it so
          much, that feeling.

                    KELVIN
          I did too.

INT.  APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rheya on the edge of the bed, facing away.

                    KELVIN
          I used to watch you undress.

As she does:

                    KELVIN
          I never tired of watching you
          undress.  Every time, it was
          exciting.  Right until... to the
          end.

A beat.  Then a shot of Kelvin that we've seen before: Him
leaving their apartment, angry.

ON THE PROMETHEUS

A beat.

                    RHEYA
          What happened to us, exactly?

                    KELVIN
          You don't know?

Rheya shakes her head.

Kelvin just watches her.

                    RHEYA
          I remember... something burning. 
          Coffee burning.

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

The rain-streaked window.

An automated coffee maker has been left on, and the
solidified coffee at the bottom of the pot is smoking.

Rheya's body is on the floor of the kitchen.

RHEYA (ON PROMETHEUS)

She is looking at Kelvin.  He is dreading this.

                    RHEYA
          You found me?

He nods.  It's coming back to her.

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Kelvin is yelling at Rheya.  We don't hear what he's saying,
but judging from her reaction, it's not pleasant.  She is
crying.

RHEYA (ON PROMETHEUS)

Experiencing this all over again.  Kelvin comes and sits in
front of her.

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Kelvin, still yelling, is packing some things into a
suitcase.  Rheya, between sobs, pleads with him.

RHEYA (ON PROMETHEUS)

Her eyes fill with tears.  Kelvin embraces her.

                    KELVIN
          I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

Rheya is devastated, inconsolable.

                    RHEYA
          Why did you say those things?

                    KELVIN
          I don't know.  I couldn't
          understand why you didn't tell me.

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Rheya lies on the kitchen floor, dead.  There is a NOTE in
her hand.

Kelvin kneels next to her.

KELVIN (ON PROMETHEUS)

With Rheya still in his arms.

                    KELVIN
          When you said you wouldn't make
          it... I didn't believe you.  Or I
          didn't take you seriously, which is
          worse.

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Kelvin holds the dead Rheya.

KELVIN (ON PROMETHEUS)

Squeezing her.

                    KELVIN
          I should have believed you.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin lies in bed, his eyes open.  Rheya is in his arms.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Rheya, talking to Chris.  Obviously during a period when they
were getting along.  Or at least: not fighting.

                    RHEYA
          I can't help feeling that I'm
          cheating when I take them.

                    KELVIN
          It's genetics.  You know this.  You
          know where it comes from.  There is
          nothing wrong with uncrossing a few
          crossed wires.

She knows, intellectually, that he is right.  But it doesn't
matter.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin is out of bed and speaking into a videophone to Snow. 
Rheya is asleep in the background.  The room is dark except
for the glow of the screen.

                    SNOW
          You're unnerved because you've
          spent your whole life thinking
          nobody is looking over you, and
          suddenly your subconscious is an
          open book.  We are, for the first
          time, experiencing changes in
          natural reality by a force not our
          own.  That proves that --

                    KELVIN
          -- we are not sure of that.  We are
          not sure we aren't all
          hallucinating.

                    SNOW
          If God is beyond our comprehension,
          and she --
              (meaning Rheya)
          -- is here for reasons that can't
          be understood, isn't God here?

                    KELVIN
          Not necessarily.

                    SNOW
          Stop equivocating!  Unbelievable,
          how you equivocate!  You, the
          atheist, you're more dogmatic than
          any holy person I've ever seen! 
          This is happening, Kevin.  Wake up.

                    KELVIN
          Consciousness is enough, that's all
          I've saying.  Consciousness should
          be enough for anybody.

                    SNOW
          Who are you trying to convince?

Kelvin just looks back at Rheya.

                    SNOW
          It will end badly.  As inevitably
          as the rising of a bubble.

Kelvin doesn't respond.

                    SNOW
          Let's all meet tomorrow.  Sartorius
          has some new ideas, about making it
          stop.

Kelvin just keeps staring at Rheya, asleep.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin is eating with Rheya.  Looking at her.  Desiring her.

                    RHEYA
          Do you have any idea how much I
          like fucking you?

                    KELVIN
          I think so.

                    RHEYA
          Good.  Because I want you to know. 
          I really like fucking you.

He leans over and whispers in her ear.  She smiles and leans
back.

                    RHEYA
          I like that too.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          How could she not be real?  I can
          smell her, taste her.  She does
          exactly what she did... it's not
          possible.

                    RHEYA
              (smiles, teasing)
          You know, I've decided: I'm just
          gonna believe what you believe
          about this whole Solaris thing,
          it'll make life so much easier; the
          little wife agreeing with her big,
          strong husband.  You must get such
          a headache thinking about those
          Great Big Problems all day.

He just stares at her -- he really likes this.  It's
familiar, this type of teasing, and it reminds him of when
things were good.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          Like I said, it's not possible.

A beat.

                    RHEYA
          So, Chris, seriously, aren't you
          afraid you're going to get fired?

They laugh.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin and Rheya, post-coital.  Relaxed.  On the verge of
sleep.

                    RHEYA
          You sure say "God" a lot when we're
          doing it.

                    KELVIN
          I know.  I'm putting that in my
          next report.

She smiles.

                    RHEYA
          Right.  The report.  Report and
          recommend.

They consider that.

                    RHEYA
          What does Snow think you should do?

                    KELVIN
          Snow thinks we shouldn't leave
          until we figure out a way to
          document it, to prove its existence
          to the planet Earth.  This is
          hilarious: He thinks it's God, but
          he wants it to sit still for a
          photograph so he can show the folks
          back home.

They smile at this.  Rheya's smile fades before Kelvin's.

                    RHEYA
          Sartorius wants to destroy it.

                    KELVIN
          Well.  He doesn't think it's God,
          but for different reasons than me. 
          He's thinking: If I can figure out
          how to make it stop, than I am
          smarter than it is, and therefore
          it cannot be God.

                    RHEYA
          He has a point.

                    KELVIN
          He does have a point.  That's just
          not the way I'd like to see it
          proven.

                    RHEYA
          You feel sorry for Solaris, or for
          me?

                    KELVIN
          It's a violent response to
          something we haven't figured out. 
          Don't let the cowardly demeanor
          fool you: He is ruthless. 
          Unblinking in his prejudice.

                    RHEYA
          It was obvious from the way he
          first looked at me.

A beat.  He holds her.

                    RHEYA
          Do I really feel like... I am...?

                    KELVIN
          Yes.  Yes.

                    RHEYA
          I'm glad.

A beat.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  SOLARIS

Turning, slowly.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  APARTMENT - NIGHT

Then years ago.  Kelvin, naked, sitting in a chair, in the
dark.  Rheya, also naked, is smoking a cigarette in bed.

                    KELVIN
          Everything you pursue, you end up
          becoming disinterested in.  The
          fact that you're good at everything
          you try makes it worse.  You have a
          degree in animal science, you could
          be a terrific vet. 
          You drifted into writing and turned
          out to be a perceptive journalist. 
          Then it was politics, which seemed
          best of all, you had an actual gift
          for understanding the best pattern
          for a group of people to be
          arranged for you to achieve your
          goal.  And they didn't even know
          they were being arranged.  But you
          got bored with it, like you do with
          everything.

She just smokes, not really looking at him.  Maybe it's a
common observation and she's past being defensive about it.

                    KELVIN
          I don't know what it's really like,
          to not know what you want to do. 
          To not have anything that you love
          to do more than anything else.

A beat.  He looks at her.  She seems more interested in her
cigarette at the moment.

                    RHEYA
              (sarcastic)
          Imagine my frustration.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

On the Prometheus.  Rheya is awake, Kelvin asleep.

She rises and goes to sit in a chair; she is anxious,
something we haven't seen before.

Kelvin wakes up, looks at her.  Noting her expression:

                    KELVIN
          What's wrong.

                    RHEYA
          You don't love me.

                    KELVIN
          Stop.

A beat.  She looks down.

                    RHEYA
          I have to talk to you... I... I
          don't know where I came from.
              (up at him)
          Do you know?

He doesn't respond.

                    RHEYA
          If you know but can't tell me
          now... will you ever be able to?

Calmly:

                    KELVIN
          What are you talking about?

                    RHEYA
          That I am not Rheya.  That Rheya
          died.  Killed herself.  I'm
          different.

He's looking at her, and knows this is dangerous territory.

                    KELVIN
          Who have you been talking to?

                    RHEYA
              (no reason to lie)
          Sartorius.

                    KELVIN
          When?  When I'm asleep?

She nods.  He can only imagine what form Sartorius' anecdotes
must have taken.

                    KELVIN
          I'm sure there are worse people to
          talk to, but I don't know who they
          are.

                    RHEYA
          I'm just trying to understand
          what's going on.

A beat.

                    RHEYA
          How have you lived the last ten
          years?  Did you love anyone?

A long beat.  Kelvin shakes his head.

                    RHEYA
          Did you think about me?

Another beat.  He nods.  Then:

                    RHEYA
          But we fought.

                    KELVIN
          Yes.  Especially toward the end.

                    RHEYA
          Why did she do it?

                    KELVIN
          You... she said I didn't love her.

                    RHEYA
          Was she right?

                    KELVIN
          No.  I love you.

                    RHEYA
              (reflexive, but genuine)
          I love you, too.

If she seems satisfied for the moment, Kelvin knows the
feeling won't last.

                    KELVIN
          Can you sleep?

                    RHEYA
          I don't think do.  It's not sleep;
          it's something else.  It's all
          around me.

                    KELVIN
          Those are dreams.

She falls asleep.

                                                FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM

Kelvin, Rheya, Sartorius, and Snow.  They are in the middle
of a heated discussion.

                    SNOW
          Gibarian was under enormous --

                    SARTORIUS
          Gibarian was helpless.  It's very
          simple: Man created the science
          that resulted in the discovery of
          Solaris, and the ship that brought
          us here.

                    KELVIN
          Meaning Man can do whatever the
          fuck it wants?

                    SARTORIUS
          Yes.

                    KELVIN
          That's fantastic.

                    SARTORIUS
          Why did you agree to come here?

A beat.

                    SARTORIUS
          Too tired to answer?

Looks at Rheya, then back to Kelvin.

                    SARTORIUS
          I'll bet.  Is this what they sent
          you here to do?  You've lost it,
          you've gone native.

Kelvin moves toward him.  Sartorius just lets him come.

                    RHEYA
              (to Sartorius)
          You're the coward.

                    KELVIN
          Don't debate him; he'll say
          anything.

                    RHEYA
              (still, to Sartorius)
          I'm just as human as you.  I see, I
          hear, I touch, and I feel just like
          you do.

                    SARTORIUS
          Prove it.

                    RHEYA
          These "guests" are a part of you,
          of your subconscious.  Chris loves
          me.

                    SARTORIUS
          YOU ARE NOT HUMAN!  Try to
          understand that if you can
          understand anything!

Kelvin is within an inch of his face.

                    KELVIN
          Get out of here.

Slowly, carefully, Sartorius grasps Kelvin by the shoulders. 
Then he leans in and whispers in Kelvin's ear:

                    SARTORIUS
          Rheya is dead.  She's a copy.  A
          facsimile.  And she's seducing you
          all over again.  You're sick.  You
          think of fucking her as research
          for humanity.  It's just fucking.

Kelvin backs away.

                    SARTORIUS
          There's nothing grandiose about it. 
          You've jumped out of a plane and
          you're trying to sew a parachute
          together while you fall.

Sartorius turns...

                    SARTORIUS
          It'd be hilarious if it weren't so
          damn sad.

And leaves.

A beat.

                    SNOW
          We didn't even get to hear his new
          ideas.

Snow wanders toward the door.

                    SNOW
          I'm not feeling well.

He passes Kelvin and leaves.

Kelvin watches him, then looks at Rheya.  She seems dazed.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  SOLARIS

The fog-shrouded surface, shifting and turning like an ocean.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Rheya is asleep.  Kelvin is talking to Snow on the
videophone.

                    SNOW
          We can liquidate the station.  Take
          the Athena back.

                    KELVIN
          No.

                    SNOW
          Of course, when we return, we'll be
          regarded as lunatics if we tell the
          truth.
              (shrugs)
          We'll chalk it up to isolation,
          collective derangement.

                    KELVIN
          I've never heard you express any
          desire to leave before now.  Why
          now?

                    SNOW
          Well, I think we're reaching the
          point of diminishing returns here,
          right?  Certainly it's learning
          more about us than we'll ever learn
          about it.

                    KELVIN
          But why is it doing what it's
          doing?  Given it's resources, it
          could have done anything. 
          Presented me with your double, and
          you with mine.

                    SNOW
          Perhaps it did.

                    KELVIN
          Human beings can die.

                    SNOW
          But they are human.  They certainly
          become human with incredible speed. 
          First they're like they were in our
          memory, but then they fill in on
          their own.  DNA doesn't determine
          the hundreds of trillions of
          connections that occur in the
          brain, it's not dense enough.  They
          build up with experience.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM - EARLIER

Quick glimpses of Rheya.  In several of them she is in
repose, thinking, as if to illustrate Snow's point.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Back to Kelvin, thinking.

                    KELVIN
          They come when you sleep.

                    SNOW
          That's right.  And we all have to
          sleep, eventually.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin on the bed with Rheya.  Their eyes are closed.

We think they are asleep until:

                    RHEYA
          You don't want me.

                    KELVIN
          Rheya.

                    RHEYA
          That's what you were saying.  I
          heard what you were saying.

                    KELVIN
          For a reason that neither of us
          understand, you are forced to stay
          near me.  That's all I know right
          now.

She realizes she doesn't want to argue.  Not right now,
anyway.

                    RHEYA
          I have these strange thoughts, I
          don't know where they come from.
              (beat)
          I can't explain it.

                    KELVIN
          Neither can I.  Not any of it. 
          There's no reference point for
          what's going on; it's never
          happened before.  It's a clean
          break in the fabric of the
          Universe; a gap.  There is nothing
          to do but experience it, moment-to-
          moment, and not let it destroy us.

                    RHEYA
          But that's what happened before.

                    KELVIN
          Not this time.

He kisses her.  She wants to believe him, so she says
nothing.  Then:

                    RHEYA
          Do you want to stay here?

                    KELVIN
          Do you?

                    RHEYA
          If you're here.

They kiss again...

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin is asleep.  Rheya is next to him.

Offscreen, we hear the door open.

Someone walks quietly (though not surreptitiously) through
the frame and sits.

After a long beat, Kelvin bolts upright, his mind struggling
to clear.  When it does:

                    KELVIN
          Gibarian.

                    GIBARIAN
          Leave the light off.

A beat.  Kelvin tries to get his bearings.

                    GIBARIAN
          I wish you'd come a little sooner. 
          I might not have had to kill
          myself.

He smiles, looking at Kelvin.

                    GIBARIAN
          You think you're dreaming me, like
          you dream her.  Understand
          something: I am the real Gibarian. 
          Just a new incarnation.

                    KELVIN
          What do you want?

                    GIBARIAN
          You're being tricked.  Sartorius
          picked a fight with you to avoid
          telling you about his idea for
          getting rid of the visitors.  He's
          figured out they're made of
          subatomic particles called
          neutrinos, and he's going to create
          a negative neutrino field.  Twenty
          four hours a day, until they're
          back on Earth.

                    KELVIN
          Can it work?

                    GIBARIAN
          It can.  Ordinary matter, like
          ours?  Not affected.  Everything
          else, disintegrates.

Kelvin registers this.

                    GIBARIAN
          What I'm saying is: Don't trust
          anyone.  Find yourself a weapon of
          some sort.

                    KELVIN
          I can trust Rheya.

                    GIBARIAN
          You'll end up like me.

                    KELVIN
          You're not Gibarian...

                    GIBARIAN
          No?  Who am I, then?

                    KELVIN
          A puppet.

                    GIBARIAN
          And you're not?  Maybe you're my
          puppet.  But like all puppets, you
          think you're actually human.  It's
          The Puppet's Dream.  Wondering if
          they're human!

Gibarian smiles.

KELVIN

wakes up, gulping air.  Rheya, startled:

                    RHEYA
          What's wrong?

                    KELVIN
          Gibarian.  He was here.

                    RHEYA
          You said he was dead.

                    KELVIN
          He is.  But he was here...

He moves to the chair, looking for some residue of Gibarian,
some proof.  Finding none:

                    KELVIN
          He spoke to me.

Kelvin leaves the room.  After a few beats, Rheya follows.

INT.  LAB

Rheya lingers behind Kelvin, who is looking at Gibarian's
body.

It is there, alone on its slab; even the Young Girl is not
with him.  

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin, thinking.  He gives Rheya some pills to take.  She
just looks at them.

                    KELVIN
          Are you going to take them?

She nods and takes them.

                    RHEYA
          What's happening to us?

                    KELVIN
          It's all right.

                    RHEYA
          Please don't lie.  I told you
          before, I don't know how I came to
          be here.  Whatever you think you
          can't say to me, I need to hear you
          say it.

                    KELVIN
          I love you.

                    RHEYA
          Don't.  I'm the one at risk here. 
          If we're playing out what happened
          before, I won't survive.

He goes to her.

                    KELVIN
          That won't happen again.  We're
          different.

                    RHEYA
          How can I tell?  You've seen both
          of me.  I only know what you're
          like here.  You're all I know. 
          There is no "You" from before.

She sits, frustrated.  Sad.

                    RHEYA
          How could it be so cruel?  How
          could it torture us like this?

                    KELVIN
          I don't think it knows it's
          torturing us.  It's just watching.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin and Rheya, in bed.  She looks despondent.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin is asleep.  Alone.

After a long period of silence, we hear the faint sound of an
instrument of some sort hitting the ground.  After another
beat, Kelvin awakens.  He notices that he is alone, and
something tells him that's not a good sign.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  LAB

Rheya is on the ground, convulsing.  Beside her is a SMALL
STEEL DRUM, which is spilling a strange-looking LIQUID that
solidifies and vaporizes with a smoky hiss.

Kelvin moves to Rheya and is startled to see that half of her
face and throat are burned away -- not melted as in a fire,
but merely eaten cleanly away.  He picks her up.

INT.  CORRIDOR

Kelvin is carrying Rheya.  Snow sticks his head out of a
passing room.

                    SNOW
          What happened?

                    KELVIN
          She drank liquid oxygen.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin puts Rheya on the bed.  Her face and throat have
returned to normal, but she is not breathing.  Kelvin goes
and puts his head to her chest, but doesn't hear what he
hoped to hear.  He stands, still looking at her.  Snow seems
very detached.

An uncomfortably long moment as we realize she is actually
not going to wake up.

                    KELVIN
          She's dead.

Snow says nothing.

Then:

Her finger twitches.

Barely noticeable at first, but growing in intensity.  Kelvin
sees it, and goes to her.  She is starting to shake a little,
as though cold.

                    SNOW
          She'll come back, don't worry.  But
          then what?  My theory is she can
          only live here, that she will die
          if she leaves this ship.

Kelvin is still looking at Rheya, who is shaking a little
harder; it's feeling like a seizure now.

                    SNOW
          Why do you think she hasn't
          suggested that?  It's the most
          obvious solution: Escape.  She
          knows she can't leave here --

                    KELVIN
          Get out --

                    SNOW
          Oh, this one you love?  What about
          the first one, the one you fucked
          and then put into a rocket and
          blasted into space?  You didn't
          love her?

Rheya is shaking much harder now, Kelvin tries to hold her
still, but she's too strong.  He stands, reluctantly, and
watches her.

                    SNOW
          What happens if she comes back?  Is
          that polygamy?  And even if you
          could take her home, how would you
          get her through?  You think they're
          not going to notice her?

Rheya is shaking violently now, as if a rippling rhythmic
force were coursing through her.  Snow, as he looks
dispassionately on the two of them:

                    SNOW
          I never get used to them, these...
          "Resurrections".

He leaves.

Rheya continues her process of "waking up" -- it's violent,
even sexual.  She spasms to a peak of some sort, and then
slowly returns to normal.

Kelvin puts his hand on her forehead.

She gradually begins to open her eyes.  She looks at Kelvin.

It takes her a moment to realize she shouldn't be seeing him;
she shouldn't be seeing anything.  She should be dead.

She begins to cry.

                    RHEYA
          What am I?  Why can't I die?

She turns away.

                    RHEYA
          I'm not Rheya.  You're always known
          that.

                    KELVIN
          Rheya --

                    RHEYA
          Don't call me that.

He turns her over.

                    KELVIN
          Listen: I don't care about anything
          but the fact that you are here. 
          You are her, you are Rheya.

                    RHEYA
          I'm disgusting.

                    KELVIN
          No.

                    RHEYA
          You're lying.  I'm not human.

                    KELVIN
          Rheya, I am not going back.  I'm
          staying here with you.

                    RHEYA
          Then you'll die.

                    KELVIN
          I want every second I can get with
          you.

A beat.

                    RHEYA
          What will I do, if you die?

He doesn't know.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT.  SOLARIS

Turning slowly.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin and Rheya, in bed.

                    RHEYA
          Do you think I can get pregnant
          here?

A long beat.

                    KELVIN
          We'll know soon enough.

INSERT:

The first time Kelvin and Rheya spoke, at the party ten years
ago.  Again we see her whisper in Kelvin's ear, but this time
we hear what she is saying:

                    RHEYA
          I can't be a mother.

She pulls back.

                    KELVIN
          That's good to know.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Kelvin, as he packs to leave Rheya.

                    RHEYA
          Don't do this.  I am literally
          begging you not to do this.  Chris.

                    KELVIN
          You should have told me.

                    RHEYA
          It wouldn't have made any
          difference.

                    KELVIN
          Thank you.

                    RHEYA
          Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I
          didn't think you'd react like this.

                    KELVIN
          Neither did I.

                    RHEYA
          You never said you wanted one.

                    KELVIN
          I never said I didn't.

                    RHEYA
          Chris --

                    KELVIN
          I can't stay here.

                    RHEYA
          Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. 
          I won't make it.

                    KELVIN
          Then you won't make it.

He leaves, brushing past her.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

A long, held shot of Rheya, crying.  She is curled up,
retreating into herself.  Kelvin is trying to console her.

                    KELVIN
          I came back.  You have to know
          that.  I came back that night.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Rheya on the kitchen floor, the note in her hand.

Kelvin is kneeling over her.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin and Rheya.  She is sobbing, but somewhat calmer.

                    KELVIN
          I couldn't make it, either.
              (beat)
          I'm so sorry.

Kelvin, asleep.

GIBARIAN

As we saw him before, sitting in the chair.  But we didn't
hear him say this before:

                    GIBARIAN
          If they succeed, you'll never see
          her again.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

In the immediate aftermath of her suicide attempt with the
liquid oxygen:

                    RHEYA
          You're afraid of me.  I can't do
          this anymore.  I still don't
          understand.  It's not possible.

He tries to console her, but she recoils.

                    RHEYA
          Don't --

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Rheya, as Kelvin brushes past her on his way out.  She looks
desperate.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Rheya and Kelvin.

                    RHEYA
          What do I have to do to stop it?

                    KELVIN
          I want you here.

                    RHEYA
          You're lying.

                    KELVIN
          You exist here.  I keep telling
          you.

                    RHEYA
          That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.

                    KELVIN
          Who are you, then?

                    RHEYA
          I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the
          woman you loved ten years ago.

                    KELVIN
          Yes, you are --

                    RHEYA
          Did you hear what Gibarian said? 
          I'm not a human being.  I'm an
          instrument.  I came from your
          memory and your imagination and I
          will torture you no matter what.
          Even if I remain passive.  That's
          when I drank the...
              (beat)
          I was going mad.  It felt like
          there was no body underneath my
          skin.  There was something else. 
          An illusion.  But I could feel my
          heart beating, and I remembered you
          tested my blood.  Is it like yours?

                    KELVIN
          Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly
          like mine.

                    RHEYA
          But then I would be dead now.

A beat.

                    KELVIN
          Is that really what you want?

                    RHEYA
          I want to stop taking those pills.

                    KELVIN
          I wish you wouldn't.

                    RHEYA
          They do something to me.  It's hard
          to think straight.

                    KELVIN
          I think they help.

                    RHEYA
          I have consciousness, but I am not
          mortal.  Don't you see why I'm
          going crazy?

                    KELVIN
          You have to remember that I love
          you, that's all that matters --

                    RHEYA
          I can't --

                    KELVIN
          It put you here.  I'll admit it, it
          acted like a God and put you here,
          put you into my consciousness. 
          I was asleep, and it put you into
          my dream.  I saw your mouth.  And
          there you were.
              (beat)
          Whether you've been sent here to
          make me happy or punish me, it
          doesn't matter.  The decision we
          make now is all that matters.  Stay
          with me.

                    RHEYA
          Am I really her?

                    KELVIN
          I don't know anymore.  All I see is
          you.

They kiss.

                    KELVIN
          Stay with me.
              (beat)
          Stay with me.

Kelvin is asleep.  Rheya is next to him.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin is on the videophone to Snow.

                    KELVIN
          She knows everything.  She knows
          who she is.

                    SNOW
          She knows everything?  Does she
          know she came once before and you
          put her in --

                    KELVIN
          No.

A beat.

                    SNOW
          What do you want?

                    KELVIN
          I want you to get Sartorius to
          abandon his plan.

                    SNOW
              (feigning innocence)
          What plan?

                    KELVIN
          Just get him to stop.

                    SNOW
          What do you want to do, leave the
          station with her?

                    KELVIN
          Yes.

                    SNOW
          Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You
          don't believe me?  Let's radio that
          shuttle pod you launched -- better
          yet, let's go get it.  I've charted
          it's trajectory, only take a few
          hours...

                    KELVIN
          Her oxygen would have run out.

                    SNOW
          Maybe she doesn't need any.  Should
          we check?

Kelvin just stares at him.

                    SNOW
          Who are you trying to please? 
          Yourself?  Her?  Which her, this
          one or that one.  Can you face
          both?  We are in a situation that
          is beyond morality.  So: Leave with
          her.  You'll see the
          transformation.

                    KELVIN
          Into what?

                    SNOW
          You'll see her die, that's all. 
          They're mortal, despite what she
          told you.  She will die.  Then what
          will you do?

                    KELVIN
          I love her.

                    SNOW
          You do, you don't.  She's willing
          to give her life, you're willing to
          give yours, it's touching and
          magnificent, anything you want but

He is playing back a message sent by Sartorius.

                    SARTORIUS
          I'm sending you a message because I
          feel sorry for you.  I really do,
          Kelvin.
              (beat)
          It is a mistake to become
          emotionally engaged with one of
          them.  You are being manipulated. 
          You are going around in circles to
          satisfy the curiosity of a power we
          don't understand and can't control,
          and she is the living proof that
          power exists.  If she were ugly,
          you wouldn't want her around;
          that's why she's not ugly.  She is
          a mirror that reflects part of your
          mind.  You provide the formula. 
          You can only finish where you
          started, remember that.
              (beat)
          They sold us out to the highest
          bidder.  They had no right to do
          that.  We should have been
          consulted.  We're not fucking
          hardware.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

Kelvin wakes up.  Rheya is beside him.  He rises and heads
for the bathroom.

He swallows two pills and a small cup of water.

When he returns to the bed, Rheya is looking at him.

                    RHEYA
          What are you taking?

                    KELVIN
          A sleeping pill.  Do you want
          yours?

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Rheya, on the kitchen floor.  The bottle of sleeping pills
just beyond her hand.

BACK ON THE PROMETHEUS

Kelvin looks at Rheya.  She shakes her head; she doesn't want
the pills.  Kelvin comes and sits beside her.

                    KELVIN
          What does it want?

                    RHEYA
          I don't know.  Something. 
          Anything.

She goes to a portal and stares out at Solaris.

                    RHEYA
          It created me and yet I can't
          communicate with it.  It must hear
          me, though.  It must know what's
          happening to me.  Don't you think?

Snow on the videophone to Kelvin.  Rheya is asleep in the
background.

          I don't think it dislikes us.  I
          think it just noticed us.  It
          lives, thinks, and acts.  We are
          dealing with a living creature
          here, no question.  And it's done
          something we've never been able to
          do: create a perfect human body. 
          Perfect except for the subatomic
          alterations, but...

On his suicide tape:

                    GIBARIAN
          If Solaris is inside our brain, and
          it knows everything, and we're only
          consciously aware of what 2% of our
          brain is up to at any given moment,
          it knows us better than we know
          ourselves.  It's not even close.

Rheya and Kelvin.

                    RHEYA
          I've decided that if it is God,
          it's a sick God.  Its ambitions
          exceed its powers, but it doesn't
          realize it.
              (beat)
          It's created a situation without a
          goal, and I hate that.  A God whose
          passion is not a redemption, who
          saves nothing, fulfills no purpose.
              (beat)
          And us?  We would have to have "an
          arrangement".  An unspoken
          understanding that I am not human. 
          How can I not hate something that
          does that?

                    KELVIN
          Please.  Don't.

Rheya is putting a compress on his forehead.

KELVIN'S POV

Of the room.

His LABRADOR FROM THE OPENING SEQUENCE is sitting by the
chair.

INT.  KELVIN'S CABIN (EARTH)

Kelvin sits in a chair, looking at:

THE LABRADOR

Sitting in the same position as it was on the Prometheus.

KELVIN

Breathes a sigh of relief at being home.  Everything seems
slowed down, somehow.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I though I was home.

On the Prometheus.  Kelvin is in bed, feverish.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I thought it was over.

He sees Rheya, in the hallway again, talking to someone we
can't see.

KELVIN

Wakes up again.  Rheya is asleep beside him.

Ten years ago.  Kelvin and Rheya standing on a street corner. 
They seem to be pausing in the midst of a very serious
conversation.  It is raining.

Kelvin in bed, on the Prometheus.  Still feverish.

Rheya is mopping his brow.

INT.  KELVIN'S CABIN (EARTH)

Kelvin in bed, feverish.

Rheya is there, wiping his forehead.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM

On the Prometheus.  Kelvin looks over to Rheya.

                    KELVIN
          Where did you go before?

                    RHEYA
          When?

                    KELVIN
          Last night.  You were talking to
          someone in the corridor.

                    RHEYA
          You must have been dreaming.

She begins to cry.

                    KELVIN
          What's the matter?

She just shakes her head.

                    KELVIN
          Rheya?

From Kelvin's point of view: Rheya, in the chair, crying.

Then he looks right to see: Rheya, in the doorway, talking to
someone we cannot see.

Then he looks further to the right, and there she is again,
staring at him from the bathroom doorway.  She moves to the
edge of the bed in order to be near.

KELVIN

Sweating.  Struggling.  Beyond fear.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I'm losing my mind.
              (beat)
          I'm breaking apart.

INT.  CABIN - DAY

Kelvin sits in his chair, as he did at the beginning, with
the three officials from DBA behind him.

Only now the three officials are Snow, Sartorius, and
Gibarian.

INT.  KELVIN'S ROOM (PROMETHEUS)

Kelvin, transfixed.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          Is this what it means to die?
              (beat)
          Am I in the moment of my own death?
              (beat)
          Is this the last thought I will
          ever have?

This idea forces him to rise, and he does, slowly.

INT.  CORRIDOR

Behind Kelvin as he somehow keeps moving.

We hold a long time, and then:

          I am home now.
              (beat)
          I try to find the rhythm of the
          world where I used to live... but I
          feel completely and continually out
          of-sync.  I am separate.  Why did I
          return to Earth and lie about what
          happened?  Lie about having contact
          with something like Solaris?  I
          knew something else was out there,
          and didn't tell a soul.  I left
          them in the dark.  We all did.

Kelvin returns.  He stops and looks around before entering
his front door.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          So why come back at all?  To see if
          she comes here?

KEVIN'S POV

Of the woods.

But there are strange incongruities in the image -- pieces of
the Prometheus breaking through; for instance, a few of the
AUTOMATED TASKMASTERS are crawling along the ground.

KELVIN

Looking from the doorway, notes this.  He doesn't seem
surprised, though.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I don't believe it will happen.

INT.  KELVIN'S CABIN - NIGHT

Kelvin, in his bed, awake.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          But I will wait, anyway.

Kelvin is in his bed, still feverish.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I thought it was over.

He looks around the room.  He is alone.

A flashing light on his computer demands attention.

ON THE COMPUTER

A video message from Rheya.

                    RHEYA
          Don't blame them.  I begged them to
          do it.  It's better this way.
              (beat)
          I'm sorry.
              (beat)
          I'm sorry I tried to make you think
          I was human.
              (beat)
          I read my own suicide note.  I
          found it in your things.  I
          realized I was not her.

She looks away.

                    RHEYA
          I know that you loved me, Chris.  I
          know that.
              (beat)
          I love you.

Kelvin, with the dead Rheya in his arms, crying.  Beyond him
is the rain-streaked window.  On the floor, by her hand, is
the note.  On it is scrawled the end of a Dylan Thomas poem,
the one Kelvin quoted to her the first time they spoke.

INT.  PARTY - NIGHT

The first night.  Again, Kelvin leans into Rheya's ear and
whispers.  This time we hear what he says:

                    KELVIN
          "Though they go mad they shall be
          sane.  Though they sink through the
          sea they shall rise again."

INT.  APARTMENT - DAY

Kevin holding Rheya.

The note on the floor.

The rain-streaked window.

                    RHEYA (V.O.)
          "Though lovers be lost love shall
          not.  And death shall have no
          dominion."

Kelvin wipes the hair from her face.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          You killed her!

                    SARTORIUS (V.O.)
          Not her.  It.

INT.  PROMETHEUS

Kelvin, furious, is talking through a slit in Sartorius'
door.

                    KELVIN
          You murdered her!

                    SARTORIUS
          Kelvin, she begged me.  I had a
          short-range version of the
          destabilizer prototype, a miniature
          with a range of a few meters.  She
          walked into it and disappeared. 
          She was gone.

Kelvin looks around.

                    KELVIN
          She'll come back.

                    SARTORIUS
          No, she won't.

                    KELVIN
          Why would you let her to do that?

                    SARTORIUS
          It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever
          it is, it's not human, and I am
          threatened by that.  Evolution-of-
          the-species-at-stake threatened. 
          And I want to win.  I want humans
          to win.  So I am killing it before
          it kills me.

                    KELVIN
          You fucking bastard...

                    SARTORIUS
          Whose side are you on?

Kelvin moves away.

But something about its appearance is different.

Complete chaos.

Kelvin is chasing Sartorius to the flight deck.

                    SARTORIUS
              (yelling as he runs)
          It's changing characteristics. 
          It's solidifying taking on weight.

                    KELVIN
          How quickly?

                    SARTORIUS
          If it continues, it will implode
          from its own weight and turn into a
          black hole in about four hours and
          pulls us in with it.

INT.  FLIGHT DECK

Kelvin and Sartorius get the ship ready for take off.

                    KELVIN
          Where's Snow?  Did you call him?

                    SARTORIUS
          Yes.

Kelvin turns and sees one of the video monitors that Snow is
sitting in his room.

                    KELVIN
              (via intercom)
          Snow!  We need you up here.

Snow doesn't reply.

                    KELVIN
          Snow!

Snow looks up.  There's a strange look on his face.

                    KELVIN
          What's wrong with you?  We need
          your help.

                    SNOW
          I won't be making the trip.

                    SARTORIUS
          Snow, get up here, now.

                    SNOW
          I'm not Snow.

This stops Kelvin and Sartorius.  They look at each other and
then at the monitor.

                    SNOW
          I got rid of him.  I wanted to see
          if... I wanted to be the only one. 
          I wanted to be Snow.

                    SARTORIUS
          Fuck me.  I knew it.

                    KELVIN
          When did this happen?

                    SNOW
          Oh, right away.  That's why you
          never saw me with anyone.  You
          should've noticed that.  I miss
          him, though.  I think I made a
          mistake.

                    KELVIN
          Jesus...

                    SNOW
          But I can't leave with you.  I
          won't make it.

                    KELVIN
          Maybe you can.

                    SARTORIUS
          You want it coming back with us?

                    SNOW
          You go ahead.  Of what I remember
          about Earth... it's all one thing
          now.  Everything's a blur.  I like
          distinctions.

Snow lies down on his bed.  Kelvin looks at Sartorius.

                    SARTORIUS
          We do not have time to deal with
          this.  Get the diode sail into
          position and let me know when the
          bias drive and the induction ring
          are at zero point.

Kelvin nods and obeys.  He then takes one last look at the
monitor to see Snow lying in bed.  Kelvin reaches over and
shuts the monitor off.

Silence.

The Prometheus moves away from Solaris.

CLOSER ON SOLARIS

After the ship has gone.

A soft black spot begins to form in the center of the planet.

Slowly, inexorably, this black spot begins to expand.

Within a minute Solaris has disappeared.

Kelvin begins to walk.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I work in the city now.  After work
          I wander and lose myself.  I am
          silent and attentive.  I follow the
          current.  I make a conscious effort
          to smile, nod, stand, and perform
          the millions of gestures that
          constitute life on Earth.

INT.  TRAIN - DAY

Kelvin taking the train to the suburbs.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I will study these gestures until
          they become reflexes again.  I will
          find new interests and occupations,
          but --

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Kelvin makes his way toward his cabin.  As he nears, his
LABRODOR recognizes him and approaches.

Kelvin pats the dog's coat.

                    KELVIN (V.O.)
          I will not... give myself.  I will
          not give myself to anything or
          anyone, because I am haunted by the
          idea that I remembered her wrong. 
          That I shaded my memory of her to
          suit myself.  That I was unfair to
          her and caused her destruction. 
          What if I was wrong about
          everything?
              (beat)
          I've come to believe that memory is
          a curse.

EXT.  CABIN - DAY

Kelvin is near the front door, dog at his heel.  He looks in
as he brings his key to the lock and his face FREEZES.

RHEYA

Is in the living room, waiting for him.

She is sitting on the sofa, looking toward the other side of
the room.  Sensing someone, she turns to see Kelvin, and her
face melts into a smile.

KELVIN

Opens the door.  He cannot speak.

RHEYA

Rises and moves toward him.

They embrace.

He breathes her in.  She squeezes him.

After a long beat:

                    KELVIN
          How can you be here...

                    RHEYA
              (whispering)
          Shhhh.  Just stay with me.
              (beat)
          Stay with me.  Everything is
          forgiven.  Everything.

She sways with him, gently.  His body relaxes.

                    KELVIN
          I love you.

EXT.  CABIN - DAY

A tableau of the cabin.  The dog is on the front step,
seemingly content despite the light rain.

As fog drifts in, we RISE, and soon the mist has nearly
obscured the house.  The fog turns into clouds and we get
fleeting glimpses of the cabin, as we move farther and
farther away.

We stay in a translucent white stage for a few moments, until
gradually the edges of a circle become apparent in the
corners of the frame.  Still there is a light rain sound.

These dark, rounded edges penetrate further until they are
forming the shape of a circle.

The misty consistency begins to gain some color and body.

And we realize we are now looking at the surface of Solaris.

                                                FADE OUT.
SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE










                 Nancy Meyers
                June 14, 2002













                                                            1.








OVER BLACK

We hear, Ja Rule's "Livin' It Up"...







EXT. NEW YORK CITY - A HOT AUGUST NIGHT - MUSIC OVER

MIDTOWN. A Brunette Beauty crosses in front of a stack of
cabs, her sheer dress clinging to her remarkable body.
A Club in THE MEATPACKING DISTRICT. A long line waits to get
in. A couple of Gorgeous Girls show up at the velvet rope and
are promptly" let inside.
SOHO. A Crowd spills out of a Bar and onto the sidewalk. A
Confident Knock Out in jeans and a tank top laughs, drinking
a beer out of the bottle.

                       HARRY (V.O.)

             Ahhhh... The sweet, uncomplicated
             satisfaction of The Younger Woman. That
             fleeting age when everything just falls
             right into place. It's magic time and it
             can render any man, anywhere --
             absolutely helpless. Some say I'm an
             expert on The Younger Woman. Guess that's
             'cause I've been dating them for over
             forty years...







INTO AN EMPTY FRAME COMES HARRY LANGER

What is it about him? Could be his eyes, the turn of his
mouth...something about this guy is just so damn appealing.
Maybe it's just the way he wears the Young Slinky Girl on his
arm. He's confident, cool, enviable. We're in:







A CHIC EATERY - DOWNTOWN

The place is full. Everybody is somebody here.

                        HARRY

                 (to Hostess)
             Langer. ..
The Maitre'd snaps to attention at the sight of him.

                       MAITRE'D

             Mr. Langer, got your table waiting.
As Harry and his Girl wend their way around tables, we pass Other
Couples. Young Couples. Middle-aged couples. Not talking Couples.

                       HARRY (V.O.)

             So what does a life of bucking the system
             all add up to?




                                                         2.











                    HARRY (V.O.) (CONT'D)

          To never settle down with the right woman
          for a life of leftovers and Christmas
          mornings. No his and her IRA accounts, no
          mini van parked in the garage. I think
          it's made me what I am today.
              (Harry smiles to someone
               across the room)
          The luckiest son of a bitch on earth.
          Look at me. I'm positively debonair. I
          should be illegal I'm lookin' so good.
Harry passes a table where a BEATEN SIXTY YEAR OLD dines with
his AGE APPROPRIATE, WELL-FED WIFE. IN SLOW MOTION, Harry and
The Beaten Man catch each other's glance.

                    HARRY (V.O.)

          It isn't as if I haven't wondered what my
          life would be like if I was a Regular Joe
          and came in here once a month with a dame
          my age' for a porterhouse and a side of
I         spinach. I've wondered...







 NT. CHIC EATERY - HARRY'S IMAGINATION

Harry ENTERS all over again. This time he looks older,
something in his walk and the boxy cut of his jacket. With
him is a regular looking, nothing-to-write-home-about WOMAN

IN HER FIFTIES.


                    HARRY (V.O.)

          No, come on, let's be honest. ..a dame
          really my age. . .







INT. CHIC EATERY - HARRY'S IMAGINATION - TAKE TWO

Again, the identical set up. Harry ENTERS again. This time he
looks ten years older. The bounce to his step is gone. The
twinkle in his eye, long dead. On his arm is a 63 YEAR OLD
BATTLE AX, built just like Harry. The Maitre'd reluctantly
shows them to a shitty table.

                    HARRY (V.O.)

          There you have it. The story in a
          nutshell. Not exactly debonair, am I?
              (Harry TRIPS, his wife
               looks disgusted)
          Awww, man, it's down right sad. Look at
          me. I look like I'm about to die. God
          help me. I do not want to die.

                                            SMASH CUT TO:





                                                         3.














A LONG STRETCH OF PRISTINE COUNTRY ROAD - THE HAMPTONS - DAY

A Silver Mercedes convertible bursts into FRAME. Harry's
behind the wheel, shades, smoking a cigar, livin' large. Next
to him sits a thoroughbred of a girl. An "IT" Girl. Smart,
sexy and built for fun. She has perfected flirting to an art.
Her hand rests on Harry's neck. There's a good thirty year
age difference between them. Her name is MARIN. She SINGS
along with Ja Rule, now coming from a CD.

                    MARIN

              ( singing)
          To all my thugs that be livin' it
          up, we say, what I do. To all my...
              (stops)
          Oh! This is it. Make a right.

                    HARRY

              (admiring the
               neighborhood)
          So baby, you're rich... .

                    MARIN

          Well, my mother is, sort of. Not
          really...

                    HARRY

          If she lives within a mile of here, she's
          rich.

                    MARIN

          I guess a hit play will buy you a house
          in The Hamptons.

                    HARRY

          I'd like to meet your mother.

                    MARIN

          No you wouldn't. I mean, she's
          great. She's totally brilliant, but
          she's not your type.

                    HARRY

          You're overlooking one of the great
          things about me. I don't have a type.

                    MARIN

              (very directly)
          She's over thirty.
Harry looks to Marin, feigning hurt.

                    MARIN

          Oh, what?! Like you don't know you
          have a slight reputation for...




                                                         4.










Just then the CAR PHONE RINGS. Harry keeps looking at Marin.

                    HARRY

          -- For what?
Harry waits. RINGGG!
He doesn't look away.

                    MARIN

          For never dating anyone over 30.
          Don't look at me like that.

                    HARRY

          It's just not true.

                    MARIN

          Okay. Sorry. Over 31?

                     HARRY

          Oh, so you wait 'til we get out to The
          Hamptons to let me know you're a wise
          ass.
               (answers phone)
          Hold on. . .
               (then to Marin)
          It just so happens, my dear, that women
          of a certain age, don't date me. You ever
          think of it that way? No, it's always me.
          You dames are all alike.
               (then into phone)
          Hey...

                    MARIN

              (amused, to herself)
          Dames...
Marin continues singing along with Ja Rule as Harry
confidently slips his hand onto her thigh.

                    BARRY

              (into phone)
          Vh-huh.. .I'll call back Monday. Who
          else? Monday... Monday... Say you couldn't
          find me. Who?
              (glances at Marin, she's
               not listening)
          I'll call her later. No, I have it.
Harry hangs up, doesn't look in Marin's direction to see if'
she caught that. This brand of cool is about not playing that
card. Marin turns toward him, she has been listening. They've
reached the end of the road, sand dunes, long lilting grass
and the ocean stretch before them.




                                                          5.











                    MARIN

              (all business)
          Make a right, left at the second
          fence.
Marin turns up the CD, getting herself out of whatever just
came over her, looks out the window.

                    HARRY

          Have I mentioned how gorgeous your
          breasts look in this sweater?

                    MARIN

              (blushing)
          Yes you have actually.

                     HARRY

          So it would be too much to mention it
          again. . .
Marin laughs, softening, as Harry turns down a dirt driveway,
driving toward a DREAM BEACH HOUSE.

                    HARRY

          Wow. It's the perfect beach house.

                    MARIN

          I know. My mother doesn't know how
          to do things that aren't perfect.

                    HARRY

          Which explains you.
That got her. Harry parks. She looks over at him but he's
grabbing some cigars for his shirt pocket, then looks up at
her with an innocent look that suggests he did not just say
such a lovely thought.

                    MARIN

              (trying to keep up with
               him)
          Yeah, okay, right...
They both grab their H
                     overnight bags and step out of the car.

                     ARRY

          So, what are we gonna do out here,
          just the two of us, for two whole
          days?
Marin sets her bag down, walks to Harry, wraps her arms
around his neck.

                    MARIN

          Tell me the truth, are you at all
          glad we waited?




                                                            6.











                       HARRY

             I'm incredibly glad we're finally
             going to do it.
                 (she's a bit disappointed)
             If that's the same as being glad we
             waited, then baby doll, I'm ecstatic.
Marin smiles then kisses him. He's one of those guys that
lets you kiss them.

                       HARRY

                 (slaps her tush)
             Let's go for a swim, how long will
             it take you to change?

                       MARIN

             Two minutes.
Marin starts UNBUTTONING HER SWEATER as she dances
seductively toward the front door, then notices Harry's
cigars.

                         MARIN

             Oh Har... No smoking in the house. My
             Mom doesn't allow it.

                       HARRY

             But she allows you to strip in the
             front yard and bring men you're
             dating here to...

                       MARIN

             She doesn't know everything I do...Or
             when I do it.. or where I do it.
She SLIPS OFF her sweater and DROPS IT ON HARRY'S HEAD.







INT. HOUSE

It's one of those great Beach Houses. Light filled and warm
with spectacular views of the sandy landscape wrapping around
the rear of the house. Marin, now in a tight tank, tight
pants, gives Harry the grand tour as she continues to
undress.

                       MARIN

                 (TAKING OFF her belt)
             The fabulous living room, perfect for
             entertaining an intimate group of friends
             or that special someone.
                 (DROPS her belt then
                  UNBUTTONS Harry's shirt)
             Behind me, the requisite Hampton's deck
             complete with pool and ocean view.




                                                           7.











                    MARIN (CONT'D)

              (UNBUCKLES Harry's belt)
          Your pants, please...

                    HARRY

          Ladies first.
Marin provocatively UNZIPS her pants and wriggles out of
them. She's now in a TINY TANK AND BIKINI PANTIES.

                    MARIN

          Gourmet kitchen's to your left
          where tonight I will whip you up a
          culinary feast of Mac and Cheese.
Marin HEARS Harry's ZIPPER UNZIP. She turns, her EYES
WIDENING as Harry's PANTS land on a chair. Harry is now down
to his Boxers, an Open Shirt and a fearless smile.

                    MARIN

              (smiling)
          .. O-kay, going quickly now...
          Master bedroom is that away...
They arrive in a warmly decorated GUEST BEDROOM.

                     M


                     ARIN

          And this as they say on 'Cribs',
          your favorite show, is where the
          magic happens. Do we like it? Going
          once, going twice ...

                    HARRY

          Sold.
Harry takes Marin's hand and pulls her OUT OF FRAME and ONTO
THE BED. She playfully rolls on top of him. His hands cup her
ass.

                    MARIN

          You know when I first started
          auctioneering someone told me if I was
          nervous to just picture everyone in the
          audience in their underwear. This sort of
          gives that a whole new meaning.

                    HARRY

          Why? You're not nervous now, are you?

                    MARIN

          I'm always a little nervous.

                    HARRY

              (removing his hands)
          So put on your bathing suit. I brought
          some champagne, I'll put it on ice.




                                                         8.











                    MARIN

          Me like you, Harry Langer.
She bounces off him like a kid and disappears into the
bathroom.
Harry lies there alone for a second. Catches his breath. He
sits up, feet on the floor, shoulders hunched, clears his
throat, bangs on his chest. He waits a sec then stands with a
stiffness that for the first time suggests he is not a that
young man.







INT. LIVING ROOM

Now wearing only his Boxer Shorts, Harry crosses through the
Living ROOM, singing 'Livin' It Up' to himself. He reaches into
his bag and lifts out Two Bottles of Crystal. He sees himself in
the mirror, sucks in his gut.







INT. KITCHEN

Well stocked, the best of everything. Harry opens the door to the
fridge and just as HE DISAPPEARS BEHIND IT, the BACK DOOR OPENS
and TWO WOMEN ENTER from a beach walk, in the middle of a lively
conversation.
One of them is ERICA, Marin's Mother. The other is Erica's
Younger Sister, ZOE.
ERICA is in her mid-fifties and is a poster girl for growing old.
It's actually hard to imagine 55 looking any better. And not
because she looks 35, but because she makes 55 look graceful and
right. Erica is the "girl most likely" who went beyond
expectations but didn't realize until recently that being sure of
herself was a handicap. She doesn't try to be intimidating, she
just is.
Her sister, ZOE is in her forties. Zoe's the loose one. She
wears draw string pants and a T-shirt that says, "BOYS LIE".
The Women stop mid-sentence when they notice the REFRIGERATOR
IS WIDE OPEN. Then they SEE A PAIR OF BARE MEN'S LEGS poking

                     E

out from UNDER THE DOOR. They don' t move.

                     RICA

          Oh God. What is this?
Erica nods to Zoe, gesturing a nearby knife. Zoe grabs the knife.
Harry pokes his head out from behind the fridge, equally confused.

                    ERICA

              (in control)
          Okay, stay right where you are. We have a
          knife.




                                                         9.











                    HARRY

              (eyeing the knife)
          Do you... live here?

                    ERICA

          Okay, Mister, look, I'm gonna dial
          911 and you're not gonna move. Zoe,
          hand me the phone.
              (reaches out to Zoe
               without looking at her)

                    HARRY

          You don't understand. I'm a friend
          of your daughter's.
With that, Harry SHUTS the fridge door. The Women see he's
naked except for a Pair of Boxers. They both GASP. Zoe
FUMBLES the phone over to Erica who dials quickly..

                    ERICA

          Yeah? I don't think so. My daughter's in
          the city and you what, wandered in
          here,like high on Ecstasy..?.
              (looks at phone)
          Shit. I dialed 8-1-1.
              (redials)

                    HARRY

              (calmly starts to move)
          Honestly, if you just...

                    ERICA

          Back off. She was in the Israeli
          army. She can break you in half.
Zoe can't believe she just said that -- no truth in it
whatsoever.

                    ERICA

              (into phone)
          Yes. I have an intruder in my
          house. 29 Daniels Lane, Sagaponack.

                    HARRY

          I'm dating your daughter Marin. She
          invited me here for the weekend.
          She's in her room right now,
          changing.

                     ERICA

              (GASPS even louder, really
                   scared now)
          You're dating my daughter?




                                                        10.











                    HARRY

              (amused)
          Now who would've thought that would
          be worse news?
With that, Marin ENTERS, in a tiny bikini, sees Harry in his
shorts, Zoe holding the knife and Erica frozen, holding the
phone.

                      MARIN

          Oh, fuck.

                    ERICA

          Oh, God.
              (into phone)
          I'm sorry. False alarm. Yeah, no, I'm
          sure. No, he's not a burglar
              (with enormous difficulty)
          He's dating my daughter.

                    MARIN

          Mom, I had no idea you were coming out
          this weekend, you said you had to write.

                    ERICA

          I do. I thought I'd do it out here.

                    MARIN

          Oh, man, this is really....

                      ERICA

          Awkward.

                    MARIN

          Totally.. .but....
              (starts laughing)
          You gotta admit, sorta funny You thought
          he was a burglar? In his boxer shorts?

                    ERICA

          Yeah, well, the world's nuts, I
          don't know the man. . .

                    MARIN

              (still laughing)
          I'm sorry, it's not really funny.
          I'm an idiot. I should've told you
          I was bringing someone out.

                    E


                      RICA

          No, no, I should've told you we
          were coming. Well. Anyway, here we
          are.
               (waves to Harry)
          Hello. I'm the mother.




                                                        11.










All three Women turn to Harry who now dangles a long Lobster
shaped oven mitt over his "privates"...

                    HARRY

          Harry Langer. How are ya?

                     MARIN

          Yes. Sorry... Mom, this is my friend,
          Harry. Harry, my Mom, Erica... my Aunt,
          Zoe.
               (they all shake hands)
          Harry's sort of a new friend. I think I
          mentioned him in an e-mail. We just,
          totally spur of the moment thought we'd
          get out of the city for a few days.

                    ERICA AND ZOE

          Of course...Right...Great...

                    ERICA

              (can't look at him)
          Honey, does Harry have a robe?

                     HARRY

              (backing out)
          You know what? Actually, I think I should
          just take off. Let you gals enjoy your
          weekend...
Marin shoots her Mom a look. Help!

                    ERICA

          No, no, no. Don't be silly. Uh, look,
          here's what we'll do. Zoe and I will
          leave. We took a great walk on the beach,
          we'll go into town for lunch. You two
          stay. Harry, apologize about the near
          arrest.

                      HARRY

          No, you were impressive. Very strong,
          very... "macho".

                    ERICA

              (a little thrown)
          I don't think I was exactly "macho"

          ...


                    HARRY

          Trust me, if I ever catch a guy in
          his underwear in my refrigerator I
          hope I'm half the man you were, Mrs
          uh...




                                                        12.











                    ERICA

              (already hating him)
          Yeah. Okay. Whatever...
Marin watches. Dying.

                    HARRY

          All righty then...I'm definitely gonna
          hit the road.
              (salutes Erica and Zoe)
          Ladies...sensational meeting you.
              (then to Marin)
          Doll, call me.

                    ZOE

          Hold on. Hold on. Let's not get so
          dramatic here. What are we four
          teenagers? We're all sophisticated
          people. Why can't we all stay, for the
          weekend? Your mother's got work to do
          I've got papers to grade. You'll do your
          thing, whatever that is and if we want to
          hang together, we'll hang together. If we
          don't, we don't. There's no reason why
          any of us should give up this spectacular
          weekend.

                    MARIN

          Seriously. I can handle it.

                    ZOE

          I can totally handle it.

                    ERICA

              (on the spot)
          I mean, well, I can "handle" it...
The Women all look to Harry. He looks at Marin. She's hard to
resist.

                    HARRY

          It can only go up from here.

                                                   CUT TO:








HARRY AND MARIN

Walking past SHOPS on the MAIN DRAG IN EAST HAMPTON. They are
both licking ice cream cones. CAMERA STAYS BEHIND THEM.

                     Z


                     OE (V.O.)

          He's obviously a penis substitute.




                                                        13.














ERICA AND ZOE

Are paced 20 feet behind them, carrying groceries.

                    ZOE

          I mean a father substitute.

                    ERICA

          Except he's older than her father. I
          can't even look at them. What is she
          doing with a guy that age?

                    ZOE

          Marin was how old when you guys broke up?

                    ERICA

          Five years ago, so. ..twenty-three.

                    ZOE

          Okay, so she was old enough not to
          feel Dave was walking out on her.

                    ERICA

          Is that supposed to mean Dave walked out
          on me? Why do people assume when you
          break up after twenty years that the
          guy's the one who wanted out? Just
          because once we broke up he shtupped
          everything that moved...

                    ZOE

          Easy cowgirl. I didn't mean it that way.
          Just trying to figure out why such a
          smart girl is always with the wrong guy.







CLOSE ON A YOUNG FRENCH GIRL IN AN APRON


                    YOUNG FRENCH GIRL

          Mme. Barry, que je puis vous obtenir
          aujourd'hui?
The Girl stands BEHIND THE CHEESE COUNTER in:







THE BAREFOOT CONTESSA

A Gourmet Market in East Hampton. The clientele in here is as
rich looking as the food. Erica stands on the other side of
the Cheese Counter.

                    ERICA

          Bonjour je veux une partie de votre
          pate merveilleux et de votre
          meilleur fromage absolu de chevre.




                                                        14.










Harry and Marin shop near by. Harry listens to Erica out of
one ear.

                    HARRY

          That's impressive.

                    MARIN

          She started French lessons after she and
          my Dad split up. Part of her "Keep Busy,
          Don't Look Back" program. She's
          practically fluent now.

                    ERICA

              (turning back to Marin)
          Marin, au cas ou nous prende un desset ou
          devrions jefaire quelgue chose?

                    MARIN

              (with an impeccable
               accent)
          Laissons quelque chose d'achat. Et
          ce grand gateau de chocolat?

                    HARRY

          Hey, not bad.. .

                    MARIN

              (shrugs)
          Yeah...well. ..I am fluent. Be right
          back.
Marin crosses to the dessert counter. Erica turns back and
catches Harry checking out Marin's ass. He smiles as he licks
his ice cream. Erica rolls her eyes then spots another Older
Guy with a Leggy Girl twenty-five years his junior.

                    ERICA

          It's an epidemic.
Then Erica notices who's next to her at the cheese counter.
She sees her Sister, Zoe, reading a cheese label with her
glasses on and next to Zoe are two sad looking Old Women in
their Eighties with their arms linked. Almost woozy, Erica is
snapped out of it when she is handed her package.

                     Y


                     OUNG FRENCH GIRL

          Merci madame.
Erica heads down the aisle, passing Harry whose back is to
her. Just as she passes, he turns and almost bumps into her.

                    ERICA

              (backing off)
          Woops. Sorry.




                                                           15.











                      HARRY

          My fault.
They so very badly do not want to actually touch. Erica
hesitates. Harry gestures for her to go first then walks
alongside her.

                    ERICA

          So, Harry... What do you do?

                    HARRY

          I'm one of the owners of a record
          company among other things...

                    ERICA

          Oh, really? Which record company?

                    HARRY

          Drive by Records.

                    ERICA

              (appalled at the name)
          "Drive By" Records??? Is that a
          joke? What is that?

                    HARRY

          It's a Hip Hop label.

                    ERICA

          Hip Hop? Oh, rap? Oh, right. Well.
              (with disdain)
          Okay. That's... "interesting"...

                    HARRY

          Let me see if I get where you're
          headed here. . .

                    ERICA

          I'm sorry, but, look, you know I hate
          rap, I mean I do. It's sort of violent
          and crude for my taste, not to mention
          just a tad misogynistic.

                    HARRY

          Hey, a lot of people see rapping as
          poetry.

                    ERICA

          Yeah, but come on, how many words
          can you rhyme with 'Bitch'?
Erica places her groceries on the check out counter.

                    MARIN

              (joining Harry)
          How we doin?




                                                        16.











                    HARRY

          Should've left when she tried to arrest
          me.







INT. ERICA'S DINING ROOM - THAT NIGHT

Marin serves plates of pasta with lobster. Zoe pours wine and
Erica tosses a salad. Harry is the only one sitting.

                    MARIN

          So, Mom, how's the new play? You gettin'
          happy with it?
Marin places a plate in front of Harry then runs her finger
along "the nape of his neck. They smile at each other as she
continues on. Erica notices, tries not to respond.

                    ERICA

          Well, the thing with me is that I'm about
          90% hard word, 10% talent and so far the
          talent part hasn't exactly kicked in yet.

                    ZOE

          Yeah, right...

                    HARRY

          What's your play about?
Marin and Zoe stop what they are doing and turn to Erica.
She's hesitant to reveal this.

                    ERICA

          About? Well, I'm not exactly sure which
          is a bit of a problem, but so far it's
          about a divorced woman, a writer, she's
          this high strung, over-amped,
          controlling, know it all neurotic. . .
              (everyone stares at her)
          Who's incredibly cute and lovable.
              (more stares)
          It's a comedy.
              (takes a seat next to Zoe)

                    M

          So, how did you two meet?

                     ARIN

          At a Wine Auction at Sotheby's. Harry was
          the big buyer of the night.

                    HARRY

          I kept winking at Marin as she was
          conducting the auction and apparently
          every time I did that she misunderstood
          and I ended up buying cases of
          outrageously expensive wine.




                                                        17.










Zoe and Marin laugh.

                    ERICA

          Ever been married, Harry?

                    HARRY

          No. No, I haven't.

                    ERICA

          Wow. Now why do you think that is?

                    HARRY

          Some people just don't fit the mold. And
          so far...

                    ERICA

          Hey, if it ain't broke.

                       HARRY

          Exactly.
Harry leans back, places his arm around Marin's chair. Erica
takes note.

                    ZOE

          Wait a second, aren't you like a famous
          bachelor?

                    HARRY

          I wouldn't say I'm famous.

                    ZOE

          No, I think I read a piece on you
          in New York Magazine.

                    HARRY

          I guess people find it interesting
          that I've escaped the noose for so
          long.

                    ZOE

          Yeah, wasn't the name of the article,
          "The Escape Artist"?

                    ERICA

          Wait. I read that article. That was you?
          You were once engaged to somebody big.
          Who was it? Not Joan Collins.. .Wait.
          ..Carly Simon?

                    ZOE

          Yeah, it was somebody cool like that.
              (trying to remember)
          Not Martha Stewart....




                                                18.











                    MARIN

          You could just ..'ask him.

                    HARRY

          No, this is more fun. It's like I'm
          not here.

                    MARIN

          Harry was once engaged to Diane
          Sawyer. Okay?

                    ZOE

          Right. Diane Sawyer. I love her.

                    ERICA

              (stunned)
          I'm impressed.

                    HARRY

          Yeah, women your age love that
          about me.
Erica pauses on that one.

                    HARRY

              (trying to get thru this)
          You know what I mean.

                      ERICA

          Yes I do.

                     HARRY

          It's not a bad thing to say 'women
          your age'.

                    ERICA

          No...I'm sure it was a compliment.

                    HARRY

          It was. ..just the truth.

                    ZOE

              (stepping in)
          So when was this engagement?

                    HARRY

          Long time ago. She was just this
          adorable lanky girl from Kentucky
          with the greatest pair of legs I'd
          ever seen... Never understood her
          ending up with a job where she
          never showed them.

          ERICA

You're not serious? She's Diane
Sawyer, she goes into caves in
Afghanistan with a shmahtah on her
head. Who cares about her legs?

          HARRY

Just anyone who's ever had the
pleasure of... You know what? I
hate to eat and run but...

          ZOE

No, wait. This is actually a very
fascinating dynamic - what's going
on at this table...

          MARIN

Columbia. . .

          HARRY

Oh, so this is gonna hurt.

          ZOE

No, come on, listen, here's the rub
for women. Look at what we have
here with you and Erica. Harry,
you've been around the block a few
times, right? You're what? Around
60, never been married, which, we
all know, if you were a woman,
would be a curse, you'd be an old
maid, a spinster, blah, blah,
blah... Okay, so instead of pitying
you, they write articles about you,
celebrate your never marrying, it
makes you illusive and ungettable.
You're a real catch. Then, take my
gorgeous sister here...

          ERICA

Any chance of you stopping here?

          ZOE

Come on, this is interesting. I
mean, look at her, she's so
accomplished, the most successful
woman playwright since who? Lillian
Hellman? She's over fifty,
divorced and still sits in night
after night because the available
guys her age want

                     ZOE(cont'd)
           --forgive me honey for saying this,
           but they want girls that look like
           Marin so the whole over fifty
           dating scene is geared completely
           towards men leaving older women out
           and as a result that makes the
           older women more and more
           productive and more and more
           interesting, which, in turn, makes
           them even less desirable because as
           we all know -- men, especially
           older men, are threatened and
           deathly afraid of interesting and
           accomplished women. It's just so
           clear. Single older women, as a
           demographic, are as fucked a group
           as can ever exist.

INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

OVER, we
Erica is cleaning up the broken plates, Zoe leans down to
help.

                     ERICA

           What are you, possessed? How could
           you say those things?

                     ZOE

           It just seemed so obvious to me. The
           injustice of it. Thank God men die
           younger than us. It's the only break we
           get.

                     ERICA

           Then you know what? Write a dissertation
           on it, don't announce to the world that I
           stay in night after night after night and
           by the way, one night after night would
           have been enough. Did you ever realize, I
           stay "in" as part of my job. Why do you
           think I married the director of my plays?
           He was the only man I ever saw. Anyway, I
           like staying in and I like this time in
           my life. Why do I have to defend myself?
M          I was married for 20 years. I'm done.

           What the hell was that?




                                            21.











           ZOE

I'm sorry, I thought I was onto
something.

          ERICA

Honey, what are you doing with this
guy? He's old, he's chauvinistic...

            MARIN

He's fun.

          ERICA

He's fun? How is he fun? He's
like.. .wrong.

          MARIN

Wrong can be fun, Mom.

          ERICA

Not this wrong.

          MARIN

Can we not do this now? He's
actually incredibly smart and
fascinating and if you had talked
to him about something other than
his marital status you would've
found out how smart he is. He owns
like 10 different companies...

          ERICA

What does that mean he owns ten
different companies? He can't
commit, that's what that means. Not
that, God forbid, I want him to
commit.

          MARIN

Yeah, that I get. Anyway, he said he
thought you two were very spontaneous and
nice and then said he's leaving as soon
as the sun comes up.

          ERICA

What? His car doesn't have
headlights?

          MARIN

Good night.

           ERICA

Wait. I have no right to get this
nuts.
     (hugs her)
He's your friend. Not mine. I love
you.




                                                         22.

              (hugs her back)
          I love you more.
This is obviously a ritual between them. Erica kisses
Marin's cheek in a flutter of kisses, then Marin

EXITS.


                    ZOE

          No chance he said we were nice.

                    ERICA

          Please. None.
They HEAR MUSIC coming from Marin's bedroom.

                    ZOE

          What are they listening to?

                    ERICA

          I don't care...

"Let's get it on". .., Erica shoots her a look, turns
off the garbage disposal, doing the dishes with vigor.

          I know she'll never see him after
          this weekend. She can't commit
          either.
Then they hear Marin GIGGLING.

                    ZOE

          He does sound fun.
Marin YELPS.

                    ZOE

          Admit it, he's got something. You
          felt it, right?
Then they hear Marin SCREAM.

                    ERICA

          Oh, this is nuts...
Erica covers her ears with her hands. Then they hear
Marin SCREAM "MOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!"

                    ERICA

          Did she say, Mom?




                                                        23.














INT. MARIN'S ROOM - ANGLE - THE DOOR

Erica and Zoe bust into the room and find Harry .on the
floor, leaning against the bed, a clenched fist on his chest.
His shirt is open, he's sweating, his complexion is grey.
Marin stands back, freaked out, afraid to get near him.

                      MARIN

           We were fooling around and he said he
           felt funny Hthen he just collapsed.

                      ARRY

               (out of breath)
           It's nothing. I'm okay maybe it was
           the lobster...

                     ERICA

           Does your chest hurt?

                     HARRY

           Like an elephant's standing on it.

                     ERICA

               (to Marin)
           Call 911...tell them to send an
           ambulance. . .
Marin hesitates.

                     ERICA

           Marin! Now!







HARRY'S POV - THE ROOM

Spinning. When he shuts his eyes, it goes BLACK. Spinning.
BLACK. Spinning. BLACK. He sees Marin, soft in the
background, on the phone and Erica coming toward him. He
hears Zoe:

                     ZOE(O.S.)

           What are you doing?

                     ERICA

               (coming closer)
           Mouth to mouth...

ON HARRY

Even in this state he gets that Erica is about to place her.
mouth on his. His eyes WIDEN IN HORROR, he reels back. Erica
catches this.

                     ERICA

           You fucking guy...




                                                        24.










She does it anyway. Her-mouth on his, her breath into his
lungs, over and over. Harry's eyes roll back in hi-so head.
As. Erica pounds on his chest, we HEAR THE BLARE OF A

SIREN...








AND A LOUD CLANG

As the DOORS to SOUTHAMPTON HOSPITAL FLY OPEN. Paramedics
WHEEL Harry through the corridors and into the ER with
dizzying speed. Two Nurses jostle Harry OFF the gurney and

ONTO A BED.

DR. JULIAN MERCER arrives at Harry's side. Julian is in his
early-thirties and has finally just graduated out of the 'you
look too young to be a doctor' syndrome. Julian is a man
whose goodness makes him sexy. He wears his hair shaggier
than you'd expect but then again, this is a Johns Hopkins
graduate who chose to live near the beach and work nights.
The Nurses place oxygen in Harry's nose, .;hook him up to a
heart monitor and connect him to an IV.

                    JULIAN

          How we doing here?

                    PARAMEDIC #1

          He's had 30 minutes of chest pain,
          nausea, shortness of breath, blood
          pressure's 170 over 100, pulse 104,
          respirations 18...

                     JULIAN

          Let's get an EKG. Mr. Langer, I'm
          Dr. Mercer. Are you in any pain
          right now?
The Nurse wheels over an EKG machine, Julian helps hook it
up.

                    HARRY

          Feel some pressure in my
          chest...it's real tight.

                    JULIAN

          Can you show me where the pain is?
Harry clenches his fist over his sternum.

                    JULIAN

          What were you doing at the onset of
          the pain?

                    HARRY

          I was uh, kissing a beautiful...




                                                        25.











                    JULIAN

              (watching the monitor)
          Where you having intercourse?

                    HARRY

          -- Unfortunately, no.

                    JULIAN


          S

           ense of humor in tact...
              (checks EKG)
          Hang a nitroglycerine drip. Mr.
          Langer the EKG shows you have a
          blocked artery which is not
          allowing enough oxygen to get to
          the heart muscle.. .

                    HARRY

          I'm having a heart attack?

                    JULIAN

          We're gonna stop it. But I need to
          know what kind of medications you
          take?

                    HARRY

              (scared shitless)
          I take uh... uh. . . Lipitor. . .

                    JULIAN

              (reading the EKG tape)
          Uh-huh... .Any thing else?

                    HARRY

          -- and a white one for blood
          pressure. . .

                       JULIAN

          procardia?

                       HARRY

          Yeah.

                    JULIAN

          What about, Viagra?
Erica, Marin and Zoe ARRIVE in the DOORWAY of the ER. Harry
eyes them...stalls.

                    JULIAN

          Mr. Langer? Did you take any Viagra
          today? Mr. Langer?

                    HARRY

          No. No Viagra.




                                                        26.











                    JULIAN

          You're positive?

                    HARRY

          I don't take Viagra. Don't need
          Viagra.
The Women grab looks at each other, know they shouldn't be
there. They turn away.

                    JULIAN

          Great. Just needed to be sure
          because I put nitroglycerin into
          your-drip and if you had taken
          Viagra, the combo would make your
          heart leap right out of your
          body...







CLOSE - HARRY'S EYES - PANICKED

As he watches the NITROGLYCERIN make it's way DOWN THE TUBE
and APPROACH HIS ARM. Just as the amber liquid is about to
enter his bloodstream he YANKS the IV out of his arm. The
drip is knocked onto the ground. The Women shriek as the
Nurses scurry to clean up. Erica and Zoe rush out, Marin
hangs back. Harry catches the look on her face.

                    JULIAN

          Let's give him an aspirin and
          Metoprolol 5mg...

                    HARRY

          Sorry, had an audience...
              (clutching his chest)

                    JULIAN

          It's okay. ..it was a great save.
              (to Nurse)
          Let's start the thrombolytic protocol.
          "4000 units of heparin. Mr. Langer, if
          this works and I have every reason to
          believe it will, it's going to reverse
          what's going on so there will be little
          or no damage to your heart. You with me?
              (Harry nods. Julian places
               his hand on Harry's)
          Okay, here we go.

THE HALLWAY

Marin paces, smoking. Erica sits. Zoe leans against the wall.

                    MARIN

          Oh, man, what if he doesn't make
          it? I don't know who to contact.




                                                           27.











                    MARIN (CONT'D)

          I don't know his family. I've gone
          out to dinner with the guy three
          times. I hardly know him.

                    ERICA

          He's gonna make it. Don't worry.

                    M

          He's like a bulldog. He'll make it.

                     ARIN

          This is a nightmare. I go out with
          a guy who's so old, he takes
          Viagra.

                    ERICA

          Are you nuts? You go out with a guy
          who's so old he's having a heart
          attack!

                    ZOE

          All I can say is, thank God it didn't
          happen when he was inside you. That could
          be life altering.
Julian rounds the corner of the corridor. Marin rushes toward
him, her face begging for good news.

                    JULIAN

          Your Dad's gonna be okay.

                    MARIN

          Oh, he's not my Dad...

                     JULIAN

          I'm sorry.
              (then)
          Your Grandad's gonna be okay.

                    MARIN

              (throws her arms around
               him)
          Oh, thank you so much. But he's not my...
          oh we're not related. He's just a friend.

                    JULIAN

          Sorry.
His sweet apologetic smile is not lost on Marin. Zoe and
Erica join them.

                    JULIAN

          I'm Dr. Mercer. Mr. Langer did have a
          mild heart attack. I gave him something
          to break up the clot in his artery and it
          worked beautifully.




                                                        28.











                    JULIAN (CONT'D)

          His EKG returned to normal almost
          immediately which means I don't expect
          any permanent damage. He's very lucky.

                    ERICA

              (shoulders sagging)
          Thank you. . .

                    JULIAN

          No, whoever got him here so fast should
          be thanked. Another half hour and I don't
          know if this would've worked.
Marin pats her Mom on the back.

                     ERICA

          Oh, man...
              (realizing it all now)
          This was...intense.
Erica wipes away a tear. Nothing could surprise her more.

                    JULIAN

          We're out of the woods. I've given him
          something to sleep, it might make him a
          little loopy at first but then it should
          knock him out.
              (to Erica)
          You're Mrs. Langer?

                    ERICA

          No, no I'm just... No. I'm Erica Barry. .
          He was having dinner at our house. I just
          met him this afternoon.

                    JULIAN

          You're Erica Barry?

                    ERICA

          Yes.

                    JULIAN

          The playwright?

                    ERICA

          Yes...

                    JULIAN

          What a pleasure. I'm a huge fan.
          Huge fan.

                    ERICA

          Really? Oh, thanks... This is my
          daughter, Marin, my sister, Zoe...




                                                        29.










Julian says Hi to each then returns his attention fully and
devotedly to Erica. Takes her in.

                    JULIAN

          Wow.







CLOSE - A JAPANESE TEA POT

Julian pours steaming hot tea into 3 paper cups.







MARIN - CLOSE

Sitting in the hospital corridor as JULIAN'S HAND ENTERS HER
FRAME and hands her a cup of tea. She looks up at him with
more adorableness than most men could handle. She blows on

                     M

the steam.

                     ARIN

          Thanks.
Camera Pans to ZOE. Sitting next to Marin. She is also handed
a Cup of Tea. Even she softens as she looks up at Julian.

                    ZOE

          Thank you Doctor.
This is all beginning to feel a little like the Step Sisters
trying on the Glass Slipper. Until we get to Erica, not
paying any attention at all as she is handed her Tea.

                    ERICA

          Oh. . .Hey. . .Ew. . .Hot. Thanks.

                    JULIAN

              (eyes on Erica)
          You're welcome. May I join you?

                    ERICA

          Yeah. Sure. This is very nice of
          you.

                    JULIAN

          First year of medical school you
          learn what can keep you up all
          night without making you nuts.
          Green Tea beats everything plus
          it's a great antioxidant. Cheers.

                    MARIN

              (turning on the charm)
          So, urn, do you always work nights?




                                                  30.











                    JULIAN

          Usually two or-three a week, gives
          me a chance for a real life during
          the day. . .
              (immediately turns back to
               Erica)
          You know, I heard you had a place
          in the Hamptons. I really am a very
          big fan. I honestly think I've seen
          every play you've ever written.

                    ERICA

          I think some were written before
          your time. There are some Marin's
          never even seen.

                    JULIAN

          No, I'm pretty sure I've seen them
          all and I saw the last one twice.
Zoe nudges Erica as a Nurse enters from the ER.

                    NURSE

          Doctor, we've got a walk in, may
          need stitches. . .

                    JULIAN

              (rises)
          I'll check on MI. Langer...if he's
          asleep; you all might want to get
          some shut eye and come back in the
          morning. Great to meet you Erica.
          Ladies. . .
The Women wave and watch him exit.
The second he's gone:

                    ERICA

              (to Marin)
          Okay, now that's a perfect a guy
          for you. He's adorable.

                    MARIN

          Mother! I've never seen a man less
          interested in me.

                    ZOE

          Or more interested in you.

                    ERICA

          Me? He's thirty years old.

                    MARIN

          No, he's older than that.




                                                        31.











                    ZOE

          Who cares how old, he is. I mean,
          he's not my type, he's like a
          gorgeous wholesome doctor but, he's
          perfect for you and hot for you,
          which makes him really perfect.

                    ERICA

          Stop it. He likes my work. Not me.
              (they just stare at her)
          It's insane. I would never.
              (off Zoe's look)
          Shut. Up.
Just then, Harry stumbles into the corridor in his Hospital

                     Z

Gown, pretty out of it.

                     OE

          Yuh-oh.

                    MARIN

              (rises)
          Harry....
Confused, Harry turns around, a little lost, giving the Women
a FULL VIEW OF HIS BARE ASS. The Women muffle screams.

                    MARIN

          Harry! Over here!
He faces them.

                    HARRY

          Honey, I want to go home. Can you
          call Lowell to pick me up?

                    MARIN

              (confused)
          Lowell?
Harry wobbles. Is he going to fall? Marin freezes, looks to
her Mom for help. Erica rushes to Harry.

                    ERICA

          Harry, you have to get back in bed.

                    HARRY

          Woman. And I say that as a
          compliment... You saved my life.
              (kisses her hand)
          Soft.. .
              ( then)
          I don't remember your name but I
          thank you from the bottom of my...




                                                        32.










He falls on Erica, totally out of it, his head on her breast,
his mouth open.

                    ERICA

              (afraid to breathe)
          Ugh. Look at this, even
          unconscious, he's a lech.
The Nurses rush out and peel Harry off Erica.

                    NURSE

          Mr. Langer, you shouldn't be
          standing.

                    HARRY

          Got to take a whiz girls.

                    NURSE

          We'll take care of that for you,
          Mr. Langer.
Harry turns back to the Women, smiling. He likes that idea.
LOVES that idea.

                    HARRY

          Okay. You take care of it for me,
          sweetheart. I'd like to see that...
As he walks away, his bare ass shines like a full moon in a
desert sky.

                    MARIN

          This is the most insane night of my
          life.

                    ZOE

          Yeah, but just admit that was one
          great ass for a guy that age.







CLOSE - A LARGE VASE OF YELLOW ROSES - 36 HOURS LATER

A Nurse slides the Roses down the counter of her station.

                    NURSE

          Now what can I do you for?
She looks across at a neat as a pin Man in his early forties,
Prada suit, crisp white shirt, dark tie. He's a Gershwin tune
of a man. A throwback to a kinder world. This is. LOWELL,
Harry's Houseman/Chef/all around Man Friday.

                    LOWELL

          I'm here for Mr. Harry Langer.
Julian ENTERS the Nurse's station.




                                                        33.











                    NURSE

              (to Julian)
          Are we discharging Hurricane Harry?

                    JULIAN

          Yes we are. Hi, I'm Dr. Mercer.
          Come on, I'll take you to him.
Julian EXITS the Nurse's Station. Lowell, carrying the
flowers, follows. He nods to TWO TALL LEGGY MINI SKIRTED
ASSISTANT TYPES, KIM and LEXI who follow. Both pack cell

                     J

phones, note pads, carry balloons, flowers and shopping bags.

                     ULIAN

          And you are. . ?

                    LOWELL

          Lowell St. James'. Mr. Langer's
          houseman, chef... general valet..

                    JULIAN

          Well that sounds like a pretty,
          interesting job.

                    LOWELL

          Fifteen years. Never a dull moment.
They arrive at:







A PRIVATE ROOM

where Harry lies on the bed, dressed and ready to go. He
squints as he reads a pamphlet at arms's distance called,
"Heart Attack -- Bouncing Back".

                    JULIAN

          Okay, Harry, looks like we're going
          to have to let you go.
Harry sits up too fast, lies right back down. Lowell looks
like he might cry. The Girls hold back.

                    HARRY

          Take it easy kids, I just sat up
          too fast. Doc, tell them. Am I in
          good shape? How were my tests this
          morning?

                    JULIAN

          He's doing extremely well.

                    LOWELL

              (holding back tears)
          Can I hug him?




                                                           34.











                    JULIAN

          Absolutely.
Harry stands and indulges Lowell in a deep hug. Lowell's
shoulders shake as he sobs.

                    HARRY

          Okay, Okay. Let's not get goofy. We
          got no thin , but good news here.

                    LOWELL

          I must say, you do look good...
          considering. You have a little
          extra baggage under your eyes, but
          I know how to fix that.

                    HARRY

              (to Julian)
          See what good hands I'm in. Did you
          meet my gorgeous assistants?

                    JULIAN

          Not formally.

                     HARRY

          Girls... .my Doctor, Julian Mercer.
              (then)
          Honey, did you bring the CDs?
Kim hands Harry a shopping bag full of CDs.

                    HARRY

              (to Julian)
          These are for you...
              (to the Girls)
          The man loves Hip Hop.

                    JULIAN

              (checking out the bag)
          Maybe not this much but...

                    HARRY

          And did you bring the other thing?
Lexi hands Harry another bag. Harry reaches in and pulls out
a small leather box, hands it to Julian.

                    HARRY

          This is just to thank you for your
          brilliance the other night. I hope
          it suits you.

                    JULIAN

              (opening the box)
          Wow. This is.. .Jesus, this is the
          most gorgeous watch I've ever seen.




                                                        35.











                    HARRY

          - Oh, good. It's a Piaget.
              (to Girls)
          He likes it.

                    JULIAN

          No, I love it and this is incredibly
          generous of you but I can't accept it.

                    HARRY

          You save my life and you end up
          with some CDs?

                    JULIAN

          No, I end up seeing you walk out of
          here and I do get paid you know -

                    MARIN (O.S.)

          -- Knock, knock.

T

 hey all turn, see Marin at the door. She waves to Harry,
more reserved than normal.

                    JULIAN

          Harry, I'll see you on the way out.

                    LOWELL

              (whispers)
          We'll pull up the car.
Everyone EXITS leaving Marin and Harry alone. Harry sits on
the bed. Marin joins him. Harry places his hand on her thigh.
All she notices is his hospital bracelet.

                    HARRY

          So, I'm some great date, huh?

                    MARIN

          Yeah... Mr. Excitement.

                    HARRY

          Tell me somethin', we haven't actually
          had sex yet, have we?

                    MARIN

          No we haven't. You're correct on
          that one.

                    HARRY

          Something to live for.
Marin smiles, kisses Harry on the cheek.




                                                        36.











                    HARRY

          Down to the cheek.
              (that's big, he digests
               that one)
          Come on, let's get outta here.







EXT. SOUTHAMPTON HOSPITAL - DAY

Harry is wheeled out in a wheelchair, Marin and a Nurse on
either side. In the parking lot is a Town Car with Lowell and
the Girls standing next to it. Next to them is Erica, waiting
by her car. She's on her cell phone. Harry spots them and
tries to get out of the wheel chair before it stops.

                    NURSE

          Hold on Tarzan, we're still movin' ...
              (she stops)
          Okay, now slow-ly.
To prove her wrong, Harry rises quickly. Everyone stands by,
ready to help.

                    HARRY

          Look at these faces. Will you tell them
          I'm fine.
As soon as Harry spots Erica, he starts to wobble.

                    ERICA

          Whoa! Whoa! WHOA!
Everyone grabs for Harry as he FALLS OUT OF FRAME AND THE

SCREEN GOES BLACK.








CLOSE ON JULIAN

taking Harry's pulse as Harry lies on the ASPHALT OF THE
HOSPITAL PARKING LOT. Lowell, the Two Assistants and Marin
huddle around. Erica steps back a bit.

                    JULIAN

          Harry, I'm sorry, but I think we jumped the
          gun.. .can't let you travel quite yet.

                    HARRY

          I ain't goin' back in there.

                    JULIAN

          You don't have to but I can't put you in
          a car right now and I can't leave you in
          the parking lot. I'd like you to stay
          nearby for a few days and let me keep an
          eye on you 'til you get your strength
          back.




                                                        37.











                    HARRY

          Doc, I'm out in the middle of the
          Hamptons. Where do you want me to go?
Marin turns to Erica who very clearly mouths, "FORGET IT!"







EXT. ERICA'S HOUSE - LATER THAT DAY.

The Town Car sits in the driveway, Lexi leans on the hood,
talking on her cell. A Market Delivery Van pulls away as a
Drugstore Delivery Van pulls in. A Flower Delivery KID
holding a large bouquet, knocks at the front door.

I





 NT. THE GUEST BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Harry sits up in bed wearing silk pajamas, holding an unlit
cigar, and is on the phone.
Zoe enters, placing the new bouquet on the already flower
filled dresser. Lowell lifts a LUNCH TRAY off the bed as Kim
stands nearby on the cell phone. Marin packs her bag.

                    HARRY

              (into phone)
          Just promise me you won't make a decision until
          we talk. Thinking about it ain't promising me.
          Okay, man, I'm seein' you Friday...
              (hangs up, then to Lowell)
          Lowell, what was that?

                    LOWELL

              (looking down at the Tray)
          Your lunch.

                    HARRY

          Somebody tell you to starve me to death?
Kim hands Harry the cell phone.

                     KIM

          Russell.

                    HARRY

              (into phone)
          Rush? No, man, you're livin' the shit.
          I just got a clean bill of health.
Kim hands Harry a NOTE that says:







          YOU HAVE TWO DINNER DATES THIS WEEK,


          SHOULD I CANCEL AND SEND FLOWERS?





                                                        38.










Harry steals a look at Marin, then nods to Kim.







INT. KITCHEN

Erica puts away groceries, a little on edge. Her back is to a
Man in his fifties, who sits at the island, eating a
sandwich. He wears sweats and a baseball cap. His natural
expression is -- worried. This is DAVE.

                    DAVE

          This is the best turkey sandwich I
          ever had in my life. What kind of
          mustard is this?

                    ERICA

              (not turning around)
          I don't know.

                    DAVE

          All right, don't get pissy. It's
          not Dijon, right?

                    ERICA

          Don't get pissy. ..you say that 'cause
          this, of course, would never happen to
          you. .1 come out here for peace and quiet
          and suddenly I'm a character in a Kaufman
          and Hart play.
              (the phone RINGS)
          And the phone does not stop.
              (phone STOPS RINGING)
          And it's never for me!
Lowell ENTERS with the Bed Tray.

                    LOWELL

          Sorry to interrupt.

                    ERICA

          That's fine Lowell, I'll take that.

                    LOWELL

          No, please, allow me.

                    ERICA

          No, no, I'll take it. No problem.
Erica takes the bed tray as Lowell EXITS.

                    ERICA

          The man does not know my name and
          I'm doing his dishes.
Lexi ENTERS, all 5'10" of her. Dave suddenly looks alive. She
carries an empty water glass.




                                                          39.











                    LEX

          Hi Erica. Um...where should I put

                    E

          this?

                     RICA

          Right here. I'll take it.

                    LEXI

          And Harry has a headache. Do you
          have any Tylenol?

                    ERICA

          Tylenol yes. ..
              (reaches in cabinet)

                     LEXI

              (extends her hand to Dave)
          Hi. I'm Lexi, Harry's second
          assistant.

                    DAVE

          Hey...Dave Klein. How ya doin'?
Erica hands Lexi the Tylenol, she thanks her and EXITS.

                    ERICA

              (holding the water glass)
          Where should I put this? It's an
          empty water glass. What are the
          choices?

                    DAVE

              (rises)
          I'm gettin' outta your hair.

                       ERICA

          Thank you.

                    DAVE

          So you're not ready to show me any
          pages? I'm not putting pressure on
          you, I'm just asking.

                    ERICA

          I haven't written a word. I'm on
          page twelve and the first eleven
          pages stink.

                      DAVE

          So you have one good page.
               (then)
          How tall do you think that girl
          was?
Before Erica can respond, Marin ENTERS.




                                                        40.











                    MARIN

          Dad! I didn't know you were here.

                    DAVE

          I'm just on my way out, bubbee.

                    MARIN

          Well, I was just gonna drive into the
          city with Zoe but if you're driving back,
          I'd much rather go with you.

                    DAVE

          I have to meet someone before I go...

                    ERICA

              (to Marin)
          Wait wait wait wait. You're leaving, Zoe's
          leaving, the entourage is leaving. And I'm
          supposed to stay here with him alone?

                    MARIN

          The doctor said" he's 'sending over
          a Nurse in the morning...

                       ERICA

          The morning? That's nineteen hours from
          now...
                 (takes a deep breath)
          Okay, I can handle this. I'm just going
          to get into a zen' place, play music,
          cook, write, focus...

                    DAVE

          She never changes...

                    ERICA

              (setting him straight)
          Yes. Maybe that's a good thing.







EXT. ERICA'S HOUSE - SUNSET

No cars are out front. Quiet and peaceful. On the Soundtrack
we hear the French tune, I wish You Love sung in French.







INT. ERICA'S KITCHEN - THE SAME TIME - MUSIC OVER

Erica cooks, softly singing along in French.

                    HARRY (O.S.)

          Smells great in here.
Surprised, Erica turns to find Harry leaning in the doorway
in his pajamas, robe and slippers. No one's ever had more
gorgeous clothes to sleep in. His presence disarms her.




                                                        41.











                    ERICA

          Coq au Vin...
              (he looks confused)

                    H

          Chicken cooked in red wine...

                     ARRY

          French Food... French music...

                    ERICA

          Part of my play takes place in Paris so
          I'm hoping this helps me think. I'm
          hopin'...How you feeling?

                    HARRY

          Well, I walked all the way in here,
          only bumping into two chairs and an
          ottoman.

                    ERICA

          Everyone bumps into that ottoman.
Harry appreciates the thought. Before it has time to become
awkward, the Phone RINGS.

                    HARRY

          Hey, thanks for letting me...

                    ERICA

          Yeah, no...it's fine.
              (answering the phone)
          Hello. Yes, he is.
              (hands the phone to Harry)

                    HARRY

              (into phone)
          Hello. Hey sweets...
              (Erica hates this)
          Oh, you got the flowers? Are they
          pretty?
Erica can't stand this. She puts on her glasses and skims her
recipe.

                    HARRY

          Hey, can I call you in a little
          bit. What's your number doll?
              (spots a pad and pencil)
Harry squints, can't see what he's writing...backs his head
away from the pad. Erica hands him her glasses.

                    HARRY

              (slips them on, jots down
               the number)
          Okay... Call you in a little.




                                                          42.










Harry hangs up and hands the glasses back to Erica.

                    HARRY

          Same prescription...

                    ERICA

          Look, Harry, it's not like in any stretch
          of the imagination, I think you're all
          that right for my daughter but I don't
          really appreciate hearing you on the
          phone with other women. It's like I'm an
          accomplice to you cheating, it's...

                    HARRY

          Your daughter knows I see other women.

                    ERICA

          She does? I mean, fine, it's none
          of my business...but...
              (struggles to open a
               bottle of wine)

                    HARRY

          She knows I'm not monogamous...We've
          discussed it.

                    ERICA

          Great? And that's what? Why are you
          proud of that?

                    HARRY

          Not proud. Just honest. Your daughter
          said she likes that about me.
              (takes the wine and opens
               it with ease.)

                    ERICA

          My daughter is confused when it comes to men.

                    HARRY

          I don't blame her. We're confusing.
Harry hands her the open wine bottle.







EXT. BEACH PATIO








WIDE SHOT - ALMOST NIGHT

Erica and Harry sit not so close together at a long table,
under a purple sky. Another French Tune plays. If this wasn't
them, this would look romantic.

N

 othing is said. Just two people eating. Harry lifts the salt
shaker, about to add salt to his chicken.




                                                        43.











                    ERICA

          Should I just call the ambulance now?
Harry shoots her a look and places the salt shaker back on the
table.







EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT - OVER - LOUIS ARMSTRONG'S LA VIE EN ROSE

A starry sky gives the house a storybook setting. We HEAR THE

PHONE RING.








INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME - MUSIC CONTINUES

Erica works at a laptop at a cluttered table. The CLOCK tells us
it's a little after ONE A.M. Annoyed by the ringing phone, she
points her remote at the CD Player and stops' the song. Harry
answers the phone in his room. A moment of quiet. Erica points her
remote, starts the song again, starts typing again. Now the other
line RINGS. She looks over at the phone watching one RED LIGHT
"BLINK, while the other line is answered.

                    ERICA

          What am I doing?
She throws a piece of paper over the phone so she can't see it.
She clicks on her AOL ICON and is told: AOL CANNOT CONNECT. LINE
BUSY. She's pissed. Then, worse, she SMELLS something.







INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Harry is on the phone, smoking a cigar. His pajama top is
unbuttoned, his hair is allover the place. His bed is a mess,
laptop open, newspapers spilling onto the floor. Erica stands
in the doorway. He quickly hides his cigar.

                     HARRY

               (into phone)
          Can you hold a see, doll?
               (looks to Erica)
          Hey.

                     ERICA

          Okay, here's the thing. I really don't
          want to play the part of the uptight
          Nurse to your bad boy patient. If you
          want to have another heart attack, go
          ahead, it's your life but I have work to
          do and I don't have time to make another
          run to the hospital because you're
          filling your already clogged arteries
          with smoke but more importantly, I'd
          rather not have my house smell like a
          pool hall.




                                                        44.










Erica holds out a partially filled water glass for Harry to
deposit his cigar in.

                    HARRY

          I have a question for you.
She waits. She doesn't say anything.

                     ERICA

          What? Do I Hhave to say what?

                     ARRY

          Have you always been like this or
          do I bring this out in you?
She shakes the water glass, waiting for the deposit. He drops
the cigar in.

                    HARRY

          I don't think I've ever had this
          effect on a woman before.

                    ERICA

              (picking up the
               newspapers)
          And what effect do you think you're
          having on me?

                    HARRY

          I don't quite recognize it, that's how I
          know I've never had it before.
Erica rolls her eyes as she finishes cleaning up.

                    HARRY

          So you don't sleep?

                    ERICA

          I only need about four hours a night.

                    HARRY

          Me too. Never slept eight hours in my
          life.

                    ERICA

          Me either. I wish I could. ..but...
              (re: curtains)
          Want me to shut these, sun comes in
          pretty strong in the morning.

                    HARRY

          Sure. . . thanks. . .

                    ERICA

              (drawing the drapes)
          Who you talking to at this hour?




                                                        45.











                    HARRY

          A friend in L.A. It's only ten out there.

                    ERICA

          And that's not past her bedtime?

                    HARRY

          So you don't get more mellow as the hours
          pass?

                    ERICA

              (heading out)
          Good night, Harry.

                    HARRY

          Can I ask you one other thing?
              (Erica turns)
          What's with the turtlenecks? It's
          the middle of summer.

                    ERICA

          Now seriously, why do you care what I
          wear?

                    HARRY

          Just curious.

                    ERICA

          I like them. I've always liked them. I'm
          just a turtleneck kinda gal.

                    HARRY

          You ever get hot?

                    ERICA

          No.

                    HARRY

          Never?

                    ERICA

          Not lately.







INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Almost TWO. Erica is writing, her eyes go to the phone with
the typing paper over it. She LIFTS a corner of the paper,
takes a peek. The one lit line GOES OUT. Finally. "Erica
turns off her computer, sits for a second. No one has rattled
her cage like this in quite some time. And no, she doesn't
like it. She stands, starts to undress.

ANGLE - THE FLOOR





                                                        46.










As Erica's TURTLENECK lands on it. Then her BRA, then her
PANTS then her PANTIES.

ERICA - NAKED - TIGHT SHOT

She crosses through the room on her way to the Bathroom. She
passes by her partially open door, happens to look out INTO

THE HALLWAY AND SEES:


HARRY - PLANTED RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER

Seeing it all.

ERICA - SCREAMS

and DROPS OUT OF FRAME.

HARRY

flustered, spins around, loses his balance, crashes into the
wall, covers his eyes.

                    HARRY

          I'm sorry! Oh, God am I sorry.

                    ERICA (O.S.)

          What are you doing?!?

                    HARRY

          Trying to find the kitchen!

                    ERICA (O.S.)

          Back here???

                    HARRY

          I-I got confused..! It was dark. I didn't
          really see anything. Just your tits and a
          little of your-
Erica SLAMS HER DOOR. Photos on the wall shake.

                    HARRY

          This is gonna be murder.







INT. LIVING ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

A very wide MIDDLE AGED NURSE gruffly crosses thru the room
toward the Front Door. Just as she opens the door, Erica
ENTERS in hat, sunglasses, turtleneck, long skirt. Pretty
much no skin is showing whatsoever. She carries a few
packages.

                    NURSE

          Good bye Mrs. Barry.




                                                        47.











                    ERICA

          Good bye? You're leaving? That's
          not good.

                    NURSE

          Been fired.

                     ERICA

          Fired?   You just started.

                    HARRY

          Not fired darlin'. Just not needed.
Erica hardly looks at You Know Who who appears to be fresh
out of the shower, wet hair, silk robe, bare chest and legs.

                    ERICA

          What do you mean, not needed? Of
          course we need her. She's gonna
          take care of you and feed you and...

                    HARRY

          -- No, no, I'm actually feeling
          pretty perky today. Making quite a
          recovery. . .
              (opening the screen door)
          Sorry for the trouble Mrs.
          Gimble... Take care, dear.
Harry hands her a wad of bills like she's a Maitre'd. Mrs.
Gimble gives Erica a look of pity as she exits. Erica, now
alone with Harry, self-consciously adjusts her sunglasses.
Harry, on the other hand, slips his hand onto his bare chest,
pats it.

                    HARRY

          Listen, about last night.

                    ERICA

          Yeah. How 'bout we never talk about that?
              (hands him some pills)
          I was at the drugstore. Your
          prescriptions were ready. They said take
          these two with food and this one without.

                    HARRY

          Honestly, you were in silhouette.

                    ERICA

          I think that's talkin' about it.

                    HARRY

          I really didn't see all that much.




                                                        48.











                    ERICA

              (heading toward her room)
          Yip. There you go.

                    HARRY

          Okay. Won't mention it again but...

                    ERICA

              (almost out of the room)
          Goin' to work, Harry.

                    HARRY

              (yells)
          You saw my ass, you don't see me
          acting nuts, wearing hats and
          glasses and weird get ups...
The Sound of a DOOR SLAM. - Harry flinches.







INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM

Harry and Julian sit on the bed. Julian takes Harry's blood
pressure.

                    HARRY

          Yes or no. What's the deal, can I
          go?

                    JULIAN

          You still getting dizzy?

                    HARRY

          Not as much.

                    JULIAN

          Out of breath?

                    HARRY

          Only sometimes.

                    JULIAN

              (listens with stethoscope)
          How's Erica treating you?

                       HARRY

          Who?

                     JULIAN

              (nods toward Living Room)
          Erica. . .

                    HARRY

          Her? Oh, she's a major piece of
          work. The woman wears turtlenecks
          in the middle of the summer.




                                                      49.











                    HARRY (CONT'D)

          She's beyond uptight. Almost makes
          her fun to be around.

                    JULIAN

          Uptight? That's funny. I haven't
          noticed that.

                    HARRY

          Try livin' with her.
Julian takes Harry's pulse.

                    HARRY

              (with secret glee)
          I actually saw her naked last
          night.

                    JULIAN

          That doesn't sound so uptight.

                    HARRY

          It was an accident. She thought I
          was asleep, I thought her room was
          the kitchen.

                    JULIAN

          You know what Freud said - there
          are no accidents.

                    HARRY

          Trust me. This was an accident. Although,
          why would she be walking around naked
          when she knows I'm 20 feet away.

                    JULIAN

          Why would you think her bedroom was
          the kitchen?

                    HARRY

          It was dark, it was two in the
          morning.

                    JULIAN

          That could explain why she was walking
          around naked. Deep breath...

                    HARRY

          You know I've never seen a woman
          that age naked before.

                    JULIAN

          You're kidding?

                    HARRY

          Hey, we're not all doctors.




                                                        50.











                    JULIAN

          Well, I think she's very beautiful
          and she's a fantastic writer, you
          know.

                    HARRY

          No, I don't know...

                    JULIAN

          Erica Barry? She's pretty major.
              (writing a prescription)
          So, you date her daughter?

                     HARRY

          Okay, now she's a great chick. Must take
          after the father. Which reminds me...Doc,
          what (about Mr. Midnight here. . ?
                indicates his dick)
          When can I be up and running in
          that department?

                    JULIAN

          I think Mr. Midnight needs to stay
          put for another couple of weeks.

                    HARRY

          But it won't kill me when I do it, right?

                    JULIAN

          It's exercise. It'll be good for you. And
          just so you know, I'm told after a heart
          attack, if you can climb a flight of
          stairs, you can have sex.

                                                  CUT TO:








A LOW ANGLE OF A STAIRCASE

Which goes from the beach up to Erica's deck. Harry stands at
the bottom of the stairs in his robe, velvet slippers and
sunglasses.' He looks up to the top of the stairs as if it's
Mt. Everest. Bravely, he climbs the first few steps. Not bad.
After two more, he's out of breath. Determined, he holds onto
the railing and drags himself up to the next step. Happy with
himself, he holds on for dear life and drags himself up one
more...and then, he's so out of breath, he can barely move,
yet he reaches up the railing and tries to hike himself up
one more.







INT . KITCHEN - SAME TIME

The tea kettle WHISTLES as Erica and Julian stand on either
side of her island. Erica reaches for a tea bag.




                                                        51.











                    ERICA

          So, you're saying, he's not ready
          to travel at all? Not even by
          plane? Train?

                    JULIAN

          I don't think so...
              (sees her disappointment)
          It's been tough, huh?

                    ERICA

          Well, he fired the Nurse after an
          hour, now says he doesn't need one.
          He's a bit of a workout.. .yeah.

                    JULIAN

          How are you holding up?

                    ERICA

          Oh, fine. .I'm fine, I'm...

                    JULIAN

          One more fine and I won't believe you.
The Phone RINGS.

                    ERICA

          Oh, shoot, hold on...
              (into phone)
          Hello. Hey...Oh, hi...







ANGLE - JULIAN

Smitten. Just something about her. Watching her.







ANGLE - ERICA

Not noticing, pouring water for her tea.

                    ERICA

              (into phone)
          No, I'm finally getting to it...
Erica sees Julian sliding a slip of paper over to her. Looks
over at it. It's a piece of paper from his prescription pad.
On it is written...Have dinner with me tonight? Erica looks
up at him. Stunned. J

                     ULIAN

              (heading out)
          Pick you up around seven?

                    ERICA

          W-What about the patient?




                                                          52.











                    JULIAN

          Like he said, he doesn't need a
          nurse.
We begin to hear strains of another French song.







INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON - MUSIC OVER

Erica at her desk, typing. The Music plays from the CD
player. As much as she doesn't want it to be true, this
attention from Julian has fueled her.







THE LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME - MUSIC OVER

Harry, dressed for the first time, wearing khaki's and a
summer shirt, strolls through the Living Room a bit cautious.

                    HARRY

              (yells, warning-like)
          I'm Walking Around The house!
ERICA Laughs. Even she knows this is funny. Harry arrives at
her open doorway, timidly pokes his head in.

                    ERICA

          Listen, I've decided to get over the
          whole "you saw me naked" thing. So, we
          don't have to deal with it anymore. Okay?

                    HARRY

          Good, 'cause I've been hiding from
          you all day.

                    ERICA

          I know. You want to come in?

                    HARRY

          I don't want to break your rhythm
          or anything.

                    ERICA

          That would be wishful thinking.
Harry ENTERS cautiously and curiously.

                    HARRY

          Beautiful painting. So I'm gonna
          venture out there and go for a
          short walk...

                    ERICA

          You up to that?




                                                        53.











                    HARRY

          My doctor recommended it. I gotta
          build up to stairs and stuff like
          that. You wouldn't want to join me?

                    ERICA

          That means you don't want me to?

                    HARRY

          No, I was asking if you wanted to.

                    ERICA

          Oh, well, I would but...I don't
          usually like to break once I've
          started writing so I probably
          shouldn't, not that a little fresh
          air would hurt but...

                    HARRY

          It's just a walk Erica, not a
          marriage proposal.

                    ERICA

          You know my name.

                    HARRY

          Erica Jane Barry. I looked you up
          on the internet.







EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS LATER - LATE .IN THE DAY

Erica and Harry walk by the water's edge. They are the only
two people on the beach.

                    HARRY

          -- Did you know there are over eight
          thousand websites that mention you?

                    ERICA

          That can't be possible.

                    HARRY

          No, it's true. I know everything
          about you now. And not because of
          last night, but...

                    E


                     RICA

          Yeah, I understood. I actually
          looked you up too. You grew up in
          L.A., which I thought nobody did.




                                                         54.











                    ERICA (CONT'D)

          You were the road manager for a group I
          sorta never heard of, started your own
          record label at 29, sold it at 45, then
          started buying and selling boutique
          companies then invested in a small record
          company which you turned into the 2nd
          largest Hip Hop label in the world.

                    HARRY

          It's exhausting just hearing about it.

                    ERICA

          I know, but the truth is, it goes
          fast doesn't it?

                    HARRY

          Like the blink of an eye.
Erica bends down and picks up A FLAT WHITE STONE, then
another and another...

                    HARRY

          I noticed you have bowls of those
          all over your house.

                    ERICA

          I know, I'm crazy, I just think
          they're so beautiful...

                    HARRY

          But why do you only pick up the white
          ones?

                    ERICA

          I don't only pick up the white ones.

                    HARRY

          Oh, so you really are crazy.

                    ERICA

          I pick up only the white ones?
              (looks in her hand)
          Oh, God, what does that mean? I'm
          controlling, unadventurous, what?

                    HARRY

          So you're as hard on yourself as
          you are on everyone else.
Erica is stunned that he caught on to that. Harry bends down,
picks up a BROWN stone, places it in her palm among the white
stones.

                    HARRY

          Something to remember me by.




                                                        55.










Erica realizes she can't sum this guy up so easily or at all.

                    ERICA

          So can I ask you something Harry? What's
          with all the young girls? I mean, what's
          the story there, really?

                    HARRY

          I just like to travel light.

                    ERICA

          You just like to travel light? Oh,
          please, what the hell does that mean?

                    HARRY

          Now see a thirty year old gets that.

                    ERICA

          You mean falls for that.

                    HARRY

          I mean, accepts it.

                    ERICA

          If that's what you want... a non
          threatening woman, who won't get your
          number, you get to run the show...

                    HARRY

          I think our relationship is growing
          by the way. Have you noticed?
There he goes again. She can't believe he's cute like this.

                    HARRY

          I'm serious. Maybe we just needed to get
          out of the house. Now, you may notice,
          interestingly, we're walking back toward
          the house and its getting a little rocky
          again.

                    ERICA

          Of course it's getting a little
          rocky, we're talking about you.

                    HARRY

          See, I'll accept that slight
          hostility because I'm enjoying your
          company so much.

T

 hey're reached the bottom of the beach stairs. Harry looks
up, daunted.

                      ERICA

          You okay?




                                                           56.











                    HARRY

          Yeah, but I think I'11 stay down here and
          watch the sunset. You interested?
Erica checks her watch.

                    HARRY

          Big dinner date?

                    ERICA

          Well, yeah, as a matter of fact.
          With your doctor.

                    HARRY

          Ohhhhh, my doctor, 'cause he's not
          too young for you, huh?

                    ERICA

          No, he's totally too young for me.
          But we're just having dinner. It's
          not a date.

                    HARRY

          Does he know that?

                    ERICA

          Well, I'll tell him, but I doubt
          that he thinks of it that way.

                    HARRY

          I doubt that you doubt that. Anyway, you
          may like it. Think of it this way -- he's
          not threatening, won't get your number,
          you get to run the show. You might have a
          hell of a time.
Over, we HEAR, DING DONG.







THAT NIGHT - THE FRONT DOOR - SWINGS OPEN

And we find Julian. Looking just as any girl would hope.
Dream Date.

AND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR

is Harry, in his robe and PJ's.

                    JULIAN

          Hey, look who's answering the door.

                    HARRY

          And look who's at the door.

                    JULIAN

          Brought you something.




                                                        57.










Julian hands him a take-out food box.

                     JULIAN

          A heart healthy dinner from our
          cafeteria.

                       ERICA (O.S.)

          Hello...
Both guys turn at once. She looks beautiful, wearing a dress,
probably the sexiest one she owns. No turtleneck tonight.
Julian walks to her, kisses her on the cheek.

                    JULIAN

          You look beautiful.

                       ERICA

          Thank you.
Behind Julian's back Harry gives Erica the 'OK' sign.

                    ERICA

              (thrown)
          We ready..?

                    JULIAN

          Let me just see how Harry's doing.
          It'll take two seconds. Har, have a
          seat. .







ANGLE - HARRY

sitting, self-conscious in his new role - The Sick One.
Julian takes his wrist, feels his pulse. Harry looks straight
ahead.







WHAT HE SEES - ERICA'S LEGS

as she sits right in front of him. She crosses her legs and
her dress hikes up a little, exposing her thigh.
JULIAN furrows his brow.

                    HARRY

          What? That's not the face you want
          to see your doctor making.

                     JULIAN

          Your pulse is a little fast but
          maybe you're just excited about
          something.
Harry LOOKS AT ERICA'S LEGS again.




                                                         58.











                    HARRY

              (quickly)
          I don't think so. I'm not excited
          about anything.
Erica shifts, the hem of her skirt RISING even higher.

                    JULIAN

          There it goes again. Racing.

                    HARRY

          Doc... Impossible!
Erica rises, leaving Harry's eye-line.

                    JULIAN

          Oh, there we go, now I feel better.
          Back to normal.
Harry winces then rises, looks to Erica as she throws a
pashmina over her shoulders in SLOW MOTION. Harry rushes them

OUT THE DOOR.


                    HARRY

          Okay, all right, good, have fun, don't
          rush back for me and don't do anything I
          wouldn't do.

                    ERICA

          Well that wouldn't leave us too
          many options would it?

                    HARRY

          And do we wonder how she writes
          that snappy repartee.
              (whispers to Erica)
          Let him pick up the check. It'll
          make him feel older.
On Erica's shocked expression, the DOOR SLAMS.







INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT - A BEN WEBSTER CD PLAYS

Harry lies on the sofa. CAMERA MOVES UP Harry's body, past
the hospital take out carton on his stomach and finally up to

                     M

his face. As the CAMERA moves we HEAR:

                     ARIN (O.S.)

          Hi, it's Marin, I'm not in so leave
          a message and I'll call you back.

                    HARRY

          Hey, it's me...just sitting around
          looking at your baby pictures...
          Thinking about you...




                                                          59.










He hangs up, dials another number.

                    ANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

          Hi and HI, you've reached Brooke and
          Shannon. For Brooke push one, for -
Harry hangs up then slowly sits up, letting himself feel as
funky as he wants.

                    HARRY

          Everybody's out but old Har.. .Old, old
          old old Har...
Harry rises dizzily, crosses to the bookshelves. He rummages
around, finds ERICA'S SCRAPBOOK, pulls it out, randomly opens
it, finds a photo of Erica in the 70's, wearing a turtleneck.
Harry smiles.







INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Harry wanders in with the scrapbook tucked under his arm. He
notices a bowl filled with white beach stones. Harry's brown
stone sits at the top of the pile.

                    HARRY

              (complimented)
          Top of the heap...

CLOSE ON JULIAN

Staring at Erica. He can't get enough of her. They're in a
ROMANTIC SEASIDE RESTAURANT. And Erica's blushing for the
first time in twenty-five years.

                    ERICA

          -- So, when the land came up, I snatched it
          and the house was built in record time and...
              (blushing to death)
          It's like a thousand degrees in here.

                    JULIAN

          You know, they say doctors fall for
          people who need rescuing, that we have a
          need to take care of someone.

                    ERICA

          Really? I never heard that one.
              (starts fanning herself
               with the menu)
          Julian, how old are you, like...

                    JULIAN

          -- Thirty-three.




                                              60.











          ERICA

Thirty-three.-Okay, so, I'm twenty years
older than you. More than twenty years
older than you.

          JULIAN

You look fabulous.

            ERICA

Thank you   but you know, I'm not sure
where you   were headed with that thing you
were just   saying, but in terms of us, you
just want   to be friends, right?

          JULIAN

Honestly? No.

          ERICA

Well, then, what is it that you...
want to be?

          J


           ULIAN

I think I'd embarrass you if I told
you.

          ERICA

I was embarrassed just getting
dressed to see you.

          JULIAN

This may surprise you but some
women consider me quite the guy.
I've never been married. I'm a
doctor. You wouldn't believe what
catnip that is for some women.

          ERICA

Oh yes I would. But, you don't like
girls your own age?

          JULIAN

I do very much. But I've never met one
I've taken to quite like this and when
something happens to you that's never
happened to you before, don't you have to
at least find out what it is?

          ERICA

I suppose but, see, I don't date
all that much or all that well...

          JULIAN

Oh, come on, you must beat them
away with a stick.




                                                          61.











                    ERICA

          Now you're kidding, right? No, guys
          my age, the ones I've met...well,
          I'm not that regular a person and
          they really like regular.

                    JULIAN

          Men your age may be really stupid,
          you ever think of that?
              (takes her hand)

                    ERICA

          Yes I have. Many times.

                    JULIAN

              (looks from her hand to
               her eyes)
          There's something radically wrong with
          the idea that no one loves you.
Ow. Right to the middle of her shoulder, then her neck.
Julian kisses her palm, then her.

                    JULIAN

          I knew you'd smell good.

                    ERICA

          It's just...soap...

                    JULIAN

          How much is soap that smells like this?

                    ERICA

          I don't know. I got it at the market.

                    JULIAN

          Erica, you're incredibly sexy.

                    ERICA

          No, swear to God, I'm not...







MEANWHILE, HARRY IS SOUND ASLEEP ON ERICA'S BED

Her scrapbook open against his chest. We HEAR the SOUND OF
ACAR pulling up to the house. Harry wakes up. Oh shit.   He
leaps out of bed, this is the fastest he's moved in days. A
bit disoriented, he straightens the covers, looks around for
other evidence then hightails it out of there.







INT. LIVING ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

Erica enters, letting out a huge sigh. She's brought back to
reality when she hears the TV in Harry's room. She heads his
way, then changes her mind and stops.




                                                        62.











                    ERICA

              (yells)
          I'm back...

                    HARRY (O.S.)

          You have fun?

                    ERICA

          It was interesting. So... Good night.







INT. HARRY'S ROOM - SAME TIME

Harry's in bed, clearly disappointed that she didn't stop in.

                    HARRY

              (yells)
          'Night...







INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - LATER

Erica, in pj's and glasses, sits at her laptop, writing. She
hears the CHIME of someone INSTANT MESSENGERING HER. It a
message from HARRYL37. It says: What R U doing?

W

 e go BACK AND FORTH between their TWO ROOMS.
She answers: Writing. Hi. What R U doing?
He writes: Watching Joan Rivers sell jewelry.
Erica laughs when he adds: So was your date a date?
She types: I think so...
He types: I told ya. (then) You hungry?
Surprised, she types: I just had dinner.
He writes: Yeah, but women never eat on dates.

                    ERICA

              (to herself)
          How does he know everything!
She hesitates then types: Actually am a little hungry but,
I'm in my pjs.
He writes: Me too. Pajama party?
SHE stares at the screen biting her lip. HE does the same.




                                                        63.










Erica rises, LOOKS IN THE MIRROR, checks out her boobs in her
pajamas. They look so low. She opens a drawer, rifles through it,
takes out a bra, takes out a better bra.
IN HIS BATHROOM, Harry fixes his hair, tries to make more of it
than he has.
Erica now wearing a bra under he pajamas, checks out her boobs
again. Better. She adjusts the straps. Lifts them higher.







INT. LIVING ROOM

Erica and Harry ENTER FROM OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE ROOM, both in
their pajamas.

                    HARRY

          We are cute...

                    ERICA

          This is pretty unusual for me.   I'm not
          used to having sleepovers.

                       HARRY

          Me either.

                    ERICA

          Really? With your social life?

                    HARRY

          My, dear, you are confusing sex with sleeping.
          Sleeping is something I prefer to do alone.

                    ERICA

          Okay, good to know.
              (heading for the kitchen)
          So, what are you hungry for?

                    HARRY

              (joining her)
          What are my choices? I mean I know you
          think I'm not very discriminating but...
She looks through the fridge.

                    ERICA

          Oh, God, what's the difference what I
          think. I can't imagine what you think of
          me. Okay, so... Pasta, left over coq au
          vin, turkey sandwich or grilled cheese.

                       HARRY

          Pancakes.

                    ERICA

          Totally what I wanted. Blueberries?




                                                      64.











                    HARRY

          You ever miss being married? I bet you
          were great at it.

                    ERICA

          Sometimes I miss it. At night.. But not
          that much anymore. Was one of us just
          saying something interesting?

                    HARRY

          You said you can't imagine what I think
          of you.

                    ERICA

          Oh, right, but you don't have to answer
          that.

                    HARRY

          Okay.

                    ERICA

          I mean, if you had an opinion, I'd be
          curious but...'

                    HARRY

          will you tell me first why you only
          miss being married at night?

                    ERICA

              (cracking eggs)
          Oh, 'cause the phone doesn't ring as much
          at night and the "alone" thing happens at
          night and sleeping by myself took some
          getting used to. But I got the hang of
          it. You gotta sleep in the middle of the
          bed. It's absolutely not healthy to have
          a side when no one has the other side.
She starts mixing the batter.

                    HARRY

          Okay, now I'm convinced what I
          think of you is right.
              (Erica waits. . . )
          You are a tower of strength.

                    ERICA

              (shoulders sagging)
          Ughhhhhhhhhh... .

                    HARRY

          Try not to rate my answer.

                    ERICA

          I'm sorry. It's just...I'm sorry.




                                                        65.











                    HARRY

          You're like a thoroughbred in a world of
          mutts. No, you know what you are, you're
          like a great portrait over a fireplace.
          Words have been invented to describe
          women like you.

                    ERICA

              ( fearful)
          Such as?

                     HARRY

          Flinty   and...Impervious.

                    ERICA

          So you think I'm inhuman.

                    HARRY

          No. I think you're formidable.

                    ERICA

          But cold and distant. Like I'm
          frozen in some painting...

                    HARRY

          Not at all. I think you're strength
          defines you.
              (sees how sensitive she
               is)
          But it's thrilling when your defenses are
          down arid you're not isolated. That, I
          believe, is your winning combo. A killer
          combo actually.

                    ERICA

          ... So I can't decide if you hate me or if
          maybe you're the only person who ever got
          me.

                    HARRY

          I don't hate you.
The moment is broken when they HEAR the FRONT DOOR OPEN and

HIGH HEELS APPROACHING.


                    ERICA

          Hello?
Marin ARRIVES IN THE DOORWAY in a knockout of a dress holding
a bag from Zabars. She looks fresh, vibrant, sexy.

                    MARIN

          Room service!

                    ERICA

          What are you doing here at this hour?




                                                        66.










Erica and Harry have the air of kids caught making out by one
of their parents. Harry straightens out his pajamas, smooths
down his hair. Erica catches all this.

                    MARIN

              (enters, kisses Erica)

          I

            had this big photography auction
          tonight, then I went out with a
          bunch of people, I checked my
          messages and got this so sad
          message from Harry so bored out
          here. I thought I should come out
          and at least see how he was doing.
              (kisses Harry on the
               cheek)
          Thank you for the gorgeous flowers
          by the way. They were so huge...
Erica nods to herself. Oh, God, he sends them all flowers.
Harry notes Erica's reaction.

                    MARIN

          So how are you guys?
              (sets down the Zabar's
               bag)
          Oh, this is too sweet. You're making
          pancakes? Awwww. And you're both in your
          pj's. Now I feel I'm interrupting.

                    ERICA

          Don't be silly. You know I never
          sleep and this one doesn't sleep
          either. It's... .What's in the
          bag?

                    MARIN

              (reaches into the bag)
          A quart of matzoh ball soup for
          Harry. I know it's not the remedy
          for heart problems but it is low
          cholesterol.

                    ERICA

              (hating to correct her)
          But high sodium.

                    MARIN

          Oh, sorry. Stupid. For Mom, your
          favorite raisin-bread. And for
          me...
              (reaches into the bag)
          My favorite Vodka.
Marin's cell phone RINGS.




                                                          67.











                    MARIN

              (into phone)
          Hello? No I'm here, babe. Made record
          time. Everyone's still there?
Erica feeling suddenly frumpy, fixes her hair. Harry watches
her. She catches him and shrugs. Marin flips her phone shut
and tosses it in her purse.

                    ERICA

          So, Mar, now that you're here, why
          don't you finish the pancakes and
          I'll get back to work...

                    MARIN

          Mom! I just got here, hold on.
She pours a healthy Vodka into a glass, grabs some ice.

                    MARIN

          So your ex-husband stood me up
          today. We were supposed to have
          lunch at Barneys . He never showed
          up. Was he always like this?

                    ERICA

          Honey, I don't know...

                    MARIN

          This is what happens after a couple
          gets divorced, the kid inherits all
          the problems. Not that I'm a kid.
              (then to Harry, the flirt
               in her coming back)
          So how are you, how do you feel?
          When can you go home?
Just as harry is about to answer, Marin's cell RINGS. She
picks it up, looks at her caller ID, throws it back in her
bag.

                     ERICA

          I really am gonna do a little work.
          . . you two catch up. . . and just
          flip these Hin like two seconds.

                     ARRY

          You don't want pancakes anymore?

                    ERICA

          I, uh, I don't think I...I...
              (looks at Marin so)
          gorgeous, next to him
          No. I don't.




                                                        68.










Marin watches her mother EXIT then looks to Harry, his eyes
following her Mom out the door. She's sees a look on Harry's
face she never remotely saw when he looked at her. At first
she's shocked. He likes my mother??? Then a flash of
jealousy. He likes my mother!?! Then pure joy - realizing how
perfect it is.







INT. BRIDGEHAMPTON GENERAL STORE - DAY

Erica, back in a turtleneck, picks peaches out of a basket.
Marin ENTERS HER FRAME, baseball cap, sunglasses, picking
cherries.

                    MARIN

          I'm breaking up with Harry.

                    ERICA

          Why? What do you mean?

                    MARIN

          'Cause I met someone else.

                    ERICA

          In the two days you've been gone?

                    MARIN

          You know me, my life's crazy. I meet a
          thousand people everyday. Also, let's
          face it, the guy's insanely old for me.
          I'd be nuts to keep this going.

                    ERICA

          True, but you know he is....

                    MARIN

          -- I know. He's soulful when you
          don't expect it, right?

                    ERICA

          It's unnerving.

                    MARIN

          Now, Mom, if you could handle this,
          I was thinking... you and Harry...

                     ERICA

          I can't handle it. Wouldn't want to
          handle it.

                    MARIN

          But you're only saying that 'cause
          you think he and I have had sex.

                    ERICA

          Yes. Lower your voice. Haven't you?




                                                        69.











                    MARIN

              (whispering)
          Never even got close. Swear to God.
              (Erica digests this)
          Just puttin' that out there...'cause for
          two people who are convinced they got
          life beat, there's was somethin' cooking
          in the kitchen last night other than
          pancakes.







INT. ERICA'S KITCHEN

Erica looks out her KITCHEN WINDOW and SEES Marin and Harry
TALKING ON THE BEACH. She leans so far to see them, she's
about to lose her balance. The Phone RINGS, she reaches for
it and slips right Out Of Frame.

                    ERICA (O.S.)

              (into phone)
          Hello.







INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

Julian, in his scrubs, walks quickly down a hallway of the

                     J

ER, on his CELL PHONE.

                     ULIAN

          I've waited a reasonable amount of hours
          before calling you, even though you've
          been on my mind since I woke up at 5:15.
          I'm wondering when we could have dinner
          again? I have to work the next few nights
          and if we wait 'til next week, I know
          you'll chicken out so how's Friday? I
          know it's like a date night but I think
          that's good.

                    ERICA

          Who is this?
Julian stops short.

                    ERICA

          I'm kidding!

                    JULIAN

          Can you meet me at The Grill at
          eight?

                    ERICA

          Okay. Yes. That's seems fine.




I














                                                          70.











                    JULIAN

          I look forward to, seeing you too.
Erica smiles to herself.







ON JULIAN - AS HE LEANS AGAINST A WALL

turning off the phone and grabbing his heart

 NT. ERICA'S KITCHEN

Marin ENTERS through the kitchen door, looking almost a
little dazed.

                    MARIN

          Okay, he's all yours.

                    ERICA

          Stop that. How'd he take it?

                    MARIN

          He just took care of it for me; He
          was an ace. Elegant. Said our fate
          was to be friends. ...Oh my God.
              (realizes something)
          He was breaking up with me. He's a
          genius.

                    ERICA

          That's impossible, he wouldn't...

                    MARIN

          It doesn't matter, we're done and
          we both feel good about it.
              (hugs her)
          I gotta get back.
              (as she exits)
          Now Erica, try to think of this as
          the smartest thing you've ever done
          for yourself.
Marin EXITS and the PHONE RINGS.

                    ERICA

              (into the phone)
          Hello.

                    HARRY

          (from the beach)
          Thought you'd like to know your
          daughter broke up with me.
Harry and Erica talk while looking at each other through the
Kitchen Window.




                                                        71.











                     ERICA

          I heard.

                    HARRY

          Made up a story about meeting another
          guy. Guess I wasn't so cute with an IV in
          my arm.

                    ERICA

          No, I think she really did meet
          someone else.

                    HARRY

          Hey, it's alright. Her mother
          didn't like me anyway.

                    ERICA

              (smiles)
          How 'bout I bring you out some
          lunch and a couple of blood

                    H

          pressure pills?

                     ARRY

          You're a great woman, Erica.
              (Erica relaxes)
          Is this why my doctor is falling in
          love with you?

THE BEACH - MUSIC OVER

Erica and Harry sit on a blanket on a cloudy day having a
picnic lunch. Harry is telling Erica a story and she screams
with laughter.

BROWN STONES IN THE SAND - MUSIC CONTINUES

Erica picks them up as.she walks with Harry by the water's
edge. They talk non-stop.

A LITTLE LATER - LIGHTNING STREAKS THE SKY

Out of nowhere, a downpour. Erica and Harry gather their
picnic things. The blanket starts to fly and Harry grabs it
as Erica runs after a plate spinning away in the wind.

INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Erica and Harry, wet from the rain, quickly shut all the
doors and windows. Lightning crackles across the sky and THE

LIGHTS IN THE HOUSE GO OUT.


A MATCH IS STRUCK

and a CANDLE is lit. Then ANOTHER ONE, and ANOTHER ONE. Erica
turns and finds Harry just looking at her. Before either of
them has time to think, they kiss.




                                                        72.











                       ERICA

          I'm sorry.

                    HARRY

              (truly confused)
          For what?

                    ERICA

          I just kissed you.

                    HARRY

          No, honey, I kissed you.
Relieyed, Erica kisses him.

                    ERICA

          I know that one was me.

                    HARRY

          Try not to keep score.
He kisses her again and again.

                    HARRY

          Soft lips...

                    ERICA

          I'm so glad they still work.
I haven't used them for kissing in so long. They've been more
like for wearing lipstick and whistling and...
He kisses her quiet. Relieved, she finally fully kisses him
back. A big gorgeo~s kiss.

                    HARRY

          Well, well, now look who's got
something that works...
They both look down at Harry. Hello, Mr. Midnight.

                    ERICA

          And you didn't even take Via-

                     HARRY

              (puts his finger on her
               lips)
          Kiss me before you make it go away.

S

 he kisses him long and sweet.

ERICA'S BED

They're kissing on it. The rain pelts against the windows as
the sun goes down.




                                                        73.











                    HARRY

          This could be world class
          interesting.
              (Erica nods)
          Having any doubts?

                       ERICA

                 (as they kiss)
          Yes.

                       HARRY

          Me too.

                    ERICA

          But so far the kissing is
          spectacular.
              (He looks at her)
          I'm not grading you, just
          mentioning it. Brilliant.
He tries to kiss her neck but the turtleneck is in the way.
He pulls it down, but it's tight and it's, difficult to get
to her.

                    HARRY

          Can't get past your damn
          turtleneck. . .
He tries lifting the shirt from the bottom, it's awkward, he
doesn't want to be down there yet. He comes back up when
Erica reaches to her night table, slides opens the drawer,
takes out a SCISSORS and hands it to him.

                    ERICA

              (breathless)
          Cut it off... Please.
What a brilliant invitation. He takes the scissors and starts
cutting from the bottom, right past her belly, up her torso,
between her breasts. The turtleneck falls open from the
center. When he reaches her neck, he gently tears at it and
it easily rips apart and there she is. He takes her in.

                    HARRY

          You're beautiful.
She shakes her head, 'no' ...shuts her eyes.

                    HARRY

          Open your eyes so I know you can hear me.
              (she opens her eyes)
          Beautiful...
They kiss and she reaches down for his pants.




                                                        74.











                    HARRY

          What about birth control?

                       ERICA

          Menopause.

                    HARRY

              (thrilled)
          Who's the lucky boy...
He kisses between her breasts, her stomach, heads down and
OUT OF FRAME. Erica can't quite believe life held this twist
for her. Then:,

                    ERICA

          I think we should take your blood
          pressure.
His head POPS BACK INTO FRAME. What?????

                    ERICA

          It's irresponsible not to.

H


 ARRY -' A MINUTE LATER

sprawled out on the bed. Erica straddles him and whips the
blood pressure cuff on his arm and pumps it hard. Like a warm
Jewish Mother of a Dominatrix. He looks up at her, shaking
his head...

                    HARRY

          Nobody but you would. . .

                    ERICA

          Yeah...so you're lucky.
Erica grabs Harry's glasses, reads the results.

                    ERICA

              (ecstatic)
          One twenty over eighty!!! Baby!







THE BLOOD PRESSURE CUFF - IN SLOW MOTION

hurdles recklessly into the air.

EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER

The rain is coming down in torrents.

INSIDE

We are CLOSE ON ERICA'S FACE - UPSIDE DOWN, hanging off the
side of the bed. She's sweaty, flushed, overwhelmed...




                                                           75.














                    ERICA

          Oh my God, I do like sex.
CAMERA TWIRLS AROUND and we FIND HARRY, sprawled nearby,
catching his breath, satisfied, stunned, scared.

                    HARRY

          You certainly do.
Erica arrives next to him, also out of breath.

                    ERICA

          Wow. So this is what you're supposed to
          do on a rainy afternoon...
Harry smiles. He's trying to be his debonair self but
something's off. He's very aware of himself. They lie there
quietly for a second when Erica begins to tear up. Harry
slowly, nervously turns to her.

                    ERICA

          I really thought I was sorta closed for
          business. Just never expected this.

                     HARRY

              (nods)
          Nothin's ever surprised me more...
Flattered, Erica snuggles up close. Harry puts his arm around
her. Then, with no warning, his eyes fill with tears.

                    HARRY

          This is crazy. I can't remember the last
          time I cried. I think I'm overwhelmed.

                    ERICA

              (crying with him)
          Me too. That's the perfect word.

                    HARRY

          Baby, I had sex three days after a heart
          attack and I didn't die!
Erica pauses. Oh. That kind of overwhelmed.

                    HARRY

          That's gotta be some kind of record.
Good sport Erica gives him a double thumbs up.

                    ERICA

              (wiping her tears)
          Let's not brag about this to our
          doctor, okay?




                                                           76.











                    HARRY

          Honey I may not be many things but one -
          thing I am is a gentleman.
Harry holds her close.

                    HARRY

          Erica, Erica, Erica.
              (she turns to him)
          You know I'm not good at being
          monogamous, right?

                    ERICA

          Monogamous? Please, I hardly know
          you.
He looks at her wondering if she's for real. She smiles as
she wipes a small tear from the corner of her eye. Then he
kisses her.

LATER - THEY'RE HUDDLED UNDER THE COVERS


C

 ozy. Candles light the room. It's still raining.

                    HARRY

          -- So there I was at nineteen, in New
          York, by myself, and I'd never seen snow
          before and I didn't have enough money for
          the bus, so I had to walk. Had no idea
          how far it was and I'm talking blizzard
          and I'm in sneakers.

                    ERICA

          Awwwww,. . .

LATER - THEY'RE LYING ON A CHAISE

in Erica's room, making out. A Cell Phone RINGS. They both
look around for it. Erica reaches for it on her desk.

                    ERICA

              (disoriented)
          Hello? I mean...Hello.
              (turns phone upside down)
          Hello.







INTERCUT WITH MARIN IN A TAXI IN THE CITY - IT'S POURING


                    MARIN

          Mom, you guys okay out there?

                    ERICA

          We're fine. Why? What's going on?




                                                        77.











                    MARIN

          What do you mean, it's like a
          hurricane. The news said the winds
          are like a zillion miles an hour.

                    ERICA

          Oh, that. Oh, no, we're fine...




                    MARIN

          Are you having sex? Tell the truth.
          You are, aren't you.

                    ERICA

          Absolutely not. No. That is not
          going on now.

                    MARIN

          Oh my God, you already did it. Was
          it amazing?

                    ERICA

          I have to go.

                    MARIN

          Just tell me, was it amazing?

                    ERICA

          Yes and thank you for the wonderful
          opportunity.
Marin SCREAMMMMMMMMMMMS. Erica flips the phone shut, looks to
Harry, embarassed.

                    ERICA

              (to Harry)
          Am I interested in buying aluminum
          siding. . .

                    HARRY

          Really? Marin's selling aluminum siding?
Erica buries her face in his chest.

LATER

Harry and Erica SIT ON STOOLS AT THE KITCHEN ISLAND, drinking
wine and eating scrambled eggs right out of the pan. Candles
light the room.

                    HARRY

          --But why Paris?

                    ERICA

          I just always wanted to write a play that
          ended there.




                                                        78.











                    ERICA (CONT'D)

          People need romance like that. And if
          someone like me doesn't write it, where
          they gonna get it? Real life?

                    HARRY

              (slightly insulted)
          Excuse me. What do you call this? Eating
          eggs by candlelight in our robes after...
She kisses him, starts to say, "I'm sorry" when he pulls her
back, kisses her again, then looks at her hard, perplexed.

CLIMBING BACK UNDER THE COVERS


                    HARRY

          So where do you like to eat in
          Paris?    E

                     RICA

          Oh, I love this place called Le Balzar,
          it's just a little bistro on the Left
          Bank, best roast chicken in the universe.

                    HARRY

          You'd be fun to go to Paris with.

                     ERICA

          It's a great city to stay up all
          night in.
              (then)
          When's your birthday?

                      HARRY

          February.

                    ERICA

          Mine's in January. So, how 'bout if we
          still know each other by then we go to
          Paris for our birthdays.

                     HARRY

              (a beat, then)
          Maybe. . .

                    ERICA

          Oh. Sorry. You just...
              (sees the look on his
              face) .
          I have no idea how to do this...be
          intimate but not...The color is draining
          from your face. Okay, look, I'm gonna
          pee,take one of your blood pressure pills
          then when I get back, let's not talk
          anymore.




                                                          79.










She gets out of bed.

                    HARRY

          You're the funniest girl I ever had
          sex with.
She has no idea how to take that. Decides to accept it.

                    ERICA

          That's somethin'...

                       HARRY

          Honey... ?
She turns, sees he's getting out of bed, approaching her.

                    HARRY

          I think I'm gonna go back to my
          room...let you sleep.

                     ERICA

          Let me sleep? Oh, right...you usually
          send the girls home. . .but I am home...
          so...okay.

                    HARRY

          I'm an old dog, you' know.

                    ERICA

          Hey, it's perfectly. .. whatever.
          Good night. This was..This was a
          great night. For me...

                    HARRY

          Me too. At one point I even thought
          soul mates, you know...
Erica nods. She knows.

HARRY FLOPS ONTO HIS BED

stares straight up at the ceiling.

INT. ERICA'S ROOM - SAME TIME

Erica gets back in her bed. She lies there for a
second,securing her armor back in place. She routinely moves
to the middle of the bed,neatens out the covers and shuts her
eyes. Then a small KNOCK on her open door. She sees Harry in
the doorway.

                    HARRY

          I'd like to try sleeping with you.




I














                                                          80.










Erica hesitates, then moves to one side of the bed and as
Harry climbs in next to her we:

                                          FADE THRU TO:


EXT. HOUSE - THE FOLLOWING MORNING

The place is a mess, the aftermath of the storm.

HNT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - THE SAME TIME

 arry spoons with Erica on her side of 'the bed, his arms
snuggly around her. The ELECTRICITY POPS BAGK ON and the room
is suddenly lit up and one of Erica's French CDs comes on
full blast.
Harry opens his eyes. He's surprised to see he has his arm
around her. Erica awakens just as surprised. In the light of
day, a definite hint of embarrassment ...

                    HARRY

              (grabs his watch, blinks)
          Can you see this?

                    ERICA

          Not really but it looks like it
          says eleven.

                    HARRY

              (slips on his glasses)
          It is eleven...

                    ERICA

          It can't be, that would mean we
          slept eight hours.

                    HARRY

          Impossible.
They turn and finally look at each other. Both look wrinkled,
messy haired, a little wiped.

                    HARRY

          How ya doin' Ace?
              (she ,elts as he lies
               right back down)
          Whoa Nelly...little dizzy.

                    ERICA

          Okay, just stay still, here's the
          clicker. You know you have a
          doctor's appointmQnt in an hour.
              (getting out of bed)

              (MORE )





                                                        81.














                    ERICA (CONT'D)

          I'll make us some coffee, get you your
          pills, whip us up some french toast, I
          have ,the best maple syrup ever. '

                    HARRY

          Erica...
              (she turns)
          You are a woman to love.
Erica smiles, then walks away with the achey walk of a woman
who hasn't had sex in many a year but has more than made up
for it in the last 12 hours. She holds onto the wall as she
exits the room, a little bow-legged, like she's just gotten
off a horse. Alone in the hallway, she stops.

                    ERICA

          You are woman to love. What the
          hell does that mean?

AN EKG MACHINE

Spits out a long tape. TILT UP to Julian at the end of the
tape. Harry sits on an examining table in JULIAN'S OFFICE,
buttoning up his shirt.

                    JULIAN

          Okay, buddy, I'm sending you home. These
          past few days have done wonders for you.

                    HARRY

          Yeah, I've been working on that stair
          thing. I can do it by the way.

                    J


                     ULIAN

          Do what?

                    HARRY

              (quickly)
          Climb a flight of stairs. Several times
          actually.
Harry stands, tucks in his shirt, smiling proudly to himself.

                    JULIAN

          Way to go. How's Erica?

                    HARRY

              (caught)
          Erica?

                    JULIAN

          I know you must know her name by
          now.




                                                        82.














                    HARRY

          Yes, I do. Erica, as it turns out
          is an amazing woman. Does whatever
          she can to make me happy. Really.
          Turns out she's very giving.
Julian, suddenly riveted to these words.

                    HARRY

          Very giving.

                    JULIAN

              (looking away)
          Yeah, well that's wonderful. I
          think she's wonderful.
A real moment between them. Julian decides to take the high
road.

                    HARRY

          I think she's wonderful too.

                    JULIAN

              (gathering his things)
          Give her my best...

                    HARRY

          Julian. Thanks for everything.
Julian shakes Harry's hand. Harry's eyes TEAR UP.

                    JULIAN

          You're gonna be okay.

                    HARRY

              (touching his tears)
          What the...? This is the second
          time I've done this now. I get
          overcome or something. . .

                    JULIAN

          It's very common to become emotional
          after having an episode like you've had.
          Everything takes on a new meaning.

                    HARRY

              (wiping his tears)
          So it's not crazy for a man to do
          something entirely out of character
          after having a heart attack?

                    JULIAN

              (handing him Kleenex)
          Like crying?




                                                        83.











                    HARRY

          Yeah and totally changing their
          tastes. Like suddenly really liking
          something they never thought they
          could like...ever...and I'm talking
          really liking it. It's...unnerving.

                    JULIAN

          I think you can expect just about
          anything right now. People have done some
          wild things after having a heart
          attack...selling businesses, getting
          divorced, moving... Some people say it
          saved their lives.

                    HARRY

          But most people go back to being
          themselves, right? I'll go back to
          being me, won't I?

                    J


                        ULIAN

          We'll see.







ERICA - TYPING - HER PHONE RINGS

She wears a blouse with more buttons unbuttoned than ever in
her life. She picks up the phone.

HARRY DRIVES ERICA'S CAR, TOP DOWN.


                       HARRY

                 (on his cell)
          Hi.

                      ERICA

          Hey.    What'd he say?

                    HARRY

          He said you're wonderful.

                    ERICA

          No, really, what'd he say...How are you?

                    HARRY

          He said I'm good..that I can go.

                     . ERICA

              (obviously conflicted)
          Oh. So... Congratulations. That's really.
          . . great.

                    HARRY

          Yeah, he said... by tomorrow for absolute
          sure. You think you can deal with me for
          one more night?




                                                        84.














A CROWDED CLUB - SOUTHAMPTON - THAT NIGHT

Packed with Young People. In the middle of this twentysomething
sun burnt beach crowd, we find, Erica and Harry, the two coolest
people in the room, dancing with each other.

A LITTLE 'LATER - THE KARAOKE ROOM

Harry leads Erica through a crowd listening to a Girl singing
Britney Spears' Oops, I Did It Again. When she finishes the
crowd enthusiastically applauds.

                    HARRY

              (big breath)
          Okay, here goes...

                    ERICA

          Here goes what?

                    HARRY

          Here goes me singing to you...
              (pulling a DISC out of his
               pocket)
          Bought my own music.

                    ERICA

          You knew they had karaoke?

                    HARRY

          Baby, it's why we're here. .
Harry makes his way TO THE STAGE, hands them his disc. He's
handed a microphone. He looks right at Erica.

                    HARRY

          This is for you, Ace...
              (then, under his breath)
          wish me luck.
The Music begins and it is an instrumental version of one of
Erica's French Songs, "I Wish You Love".

                    HARRY

              (sings)
          I wish you bluebirds in the spring... To
          Give your heart a song to sing... And
          then a kiss, but more than this... I wish
H         you love...
 arry takes out a sheet of paper and his glasses.

                    HARRY

          Don't want to blow this part...
Now Harry sings the rest of the song IN FRENCH. . .




                                                           85.

                    HARRY

              (sings)
          Et en juillet une limonade...Pour
          vous refroidir dans quelque lefy
          glade...
And so on... Erica watches knowing something in her life has
just that second, forever changed. And as Harry continues
singing, we:

                                         CUT TO:


LOWELL - THE NEXT DAY

Packing the Trunk of the Town Car in front of Erica's house.

INT. HARRY'S ROOM - SAME TIME

Harry tosses his pills in a leather bag. .. Erica enters
doing the worst job she's ever done of being strong.

                    ERICA

              (holding some cigars)
          Here you go, you can have these back now.
              (Harry looks confused)
          I confiscated them your first night
          here...

                    HARRY

              (smells them)
          Thank you darlin' ...

                    ERICA

          Try not to smoke them...
              (hands him a small bag)
          And I packed you a sandwich, just
          in case your blood sugar got low.
          And some of that iced-tea you like,
          and a nonfat, low cholesterol
          cookie. And a peach.

                    HARRY

          what a doll...
              (notices)
          Got something else?
From behind her back Erica pulls out a Mason Jar filled with
all dark beach stones with ONE WHITE STONE in the center.

                    ERICA

          Something to remember me by.
Harry hugs her. Erica awkwardly throws her arms around him
and kisses him, then kisses him better. He's moved by her.




                                                          86.











                    HARRY

          There is that...

                    ERICA

          And hey, we'll always have Paris.

                    HARRY

          Honey, no words can ever express my
          gratitude for taking me in and taking care
          of me and...

                    ERICA

          Hey, your heart attack could be the best
          thing that ever happened to me.

                     HARRY

              (kisses her quickly, even
               faster throws out)
          I love ya.

                    ERICA

          I love you too...if that's what you said. I
          don't know if it ends in 'ya' if it's an
          official I love you but...
Harry expression looks something like he's in pain. Then. . .

                    HARRY

          You're not like anybody.

                    ERICA

          Neither are you.







INT. CAR - MOVING AWAY FROM THE HOUSE - DAY

Lowell drives, rattling on about all the people who have been
calling about him. Harry, in the backseat, looks back at the
house, until it is finally out of view.
Harry then looks inside the bag with the sandwich and finds an
Envelope from Erica, pulls it out, doesn't open it, places it back
in the bag then takes out his cell phone and dials.

INT. ERICA'S LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME - OVER, THE PHONE RINGS

The room is empty. Erica rushes in, picks up the phone.

                     E


                     RICA

          I knew you'd call.

MARIN - WALKING IN SOHO

on her cell phone, CRYING.




                                                          87.











                     MARIN

           Who? It's me.

INTERCUT


                     ERICA

           What's wrong?

                     MARIN

           I had breakfast with Dad this morning and
           we're talking and he starts looking all
           weir~ and then he tells me he met someone
           three weeks ago and it's "really
           something and then he
               (sobbing now)
           He tells me he's getting married. Why am
           I reacting this way? I'm almost thirty
           years old...
               (people stare at her)
           Yes, I'm crying, leave me alone.

                     ERICA

           Who's he marrying?

                     MARIN

           I don't know. Some chick he met three
           weeks ago. She's four years older than me
           and she's an Ear, Nose and Throat Doctor.
           Has he lost his mind? I have a huge
           auction tonight... Why do I have to be
           the one to deal with this? Can you please
           come in? I'm rea:~y upset, my shrink'~
           away for two weeks...I know you're
           working but. . .please. . ?

AN UPPER EAST SIDE STREET - A LITTLE LATER

One of those gorgeous tree lined streets from a Woody Allen
movie that makes New York seem quaint. Harry's Town Car
pulls up in front of a GORGEOUS   PRISTINE TOWNHOUSE. Harry
steps out in shades, holding an   unlit cigar. Lowell joins him
as the Front Door opens and out   pours his Two Leggy
Assistants and thumping Hip Hop   Music.
LOWELL Good to be back?
HARRY Let's find out.

EXT. ERICA'S HOUSE - LATER

Camera quickly TRACKS Erica down the front path and to her
car. She's on her cell.




                                                        88.











                    ERICA

          Hold on, I'm losing you. Okay,    so you'll
          let Harry know I'll be. in the    city
          tonight and he can reach me on    my
          cell...if he wants... Okay? Aw    shit.
          Hello?

EXT. SOTHEBY'S AUCTION HOUSE - THAT NIGHT

A Crowd files in for tonight's auction.

INT. BACKSTAGE DRESSING ROOM - SAME TIME

A tearful Marin is changing from jeans and a T-shirt to a
proper dress and heels. Erica leans on a table, listening.

                     MARIN

          -- Look, I get that he has a right to get
          remarried, but he doesn't even know her
          and she's like my age. You know what
          that's like? It's like beyond creepy. And
          I know he's not replacing me so why does
          it feel like he is? This is crazy, right?
          Crying like this...

              (

                lights a cigarette)

                    ERICA

          Honey, if he's replacing anyone, it's me.
          And all the statistics say divorced men
          almost always remarry. That's just the
          way they're built.

                    MARIN

              (slipping on her dress)
          Mom, you want to know the answer to
          the big mystery of my life? Why I'm
          always with the wrong guy? This is
          why. Because the wrong guy can't do
          this to you. You have some control
          with the wrong guy. This thing I'm
          feeling right now. This is my big
          fear...that some guy could get me
          unglued like this, like nothing's
          connected. And this is just my
          father! I'm just not strong enough
          to handle this kind of drama.

                    ERICA

          The drama in life is what makes you
          strong.

                    MARIN

          No, it's what makes you strong.
          You've never really understood
          this,but we're not all like you.




                                                      89.











                    MARIN (CONT'D)

          I'm sorry, if I were you and my ex
          husband, the man who I still allow to
          direct my plays.! was getting married to
          some 33 year old Ear, Nose and Throat
          Babe, I'd be bonkers. And look at you.
              (realizes)
          You've never looked better, by the way.
              (sinks)
          My anti-depressant is obviously not
          working. It should cover events like this
          shouldn't it?

                    ERICA

          Since when do you take an antidepressant?

                    MARIN

          Ugggh, mother, do you know anyone who
          doesn't?

                       ERICA

          Yes. Me.

                    MARIN

          I rest my case.
A KNOCK on the door.

                    VOICE FROM OUTSIDE

          Marin, we're all set.

                    MARIN

          Mom, can you do one other really
          big thing for me? Just say yes.

                    ERICA

              (taking two Turns)
          Anything bubee.

                    MARIN

          Will you come out to dinner tonight
          with me and Dad and the fiance?

                    ERICA

          Absolutely not. No.

                    MARIN

          Please. He wants me to meet her and I can
          not go alone. I already asked him if you
          could come and he said it was fine and
          she said it was fine. Look, you're gonna
          have to meet her too, so, we might as
          well meet her together. Come on, you know
          you can handle it.




                                                        90.










Erica pauses, thinks M
                     about it. She knows she can too.

                      ARIN

           Okay. That's it. See that look on
           your face. That's the gene I didn't
           get.

INT. SOTHEBY' S - MOMENTS LATER

Marin, now all pulled together, stands at the podium in front
of a packed house. If' you didn't know, you'd never guess.

                     MARIN

           Good evening and welcome to Sotheby's and
           this evening's sale of Impressionistic
           and Modern Art. Bidders should know that
           the auctioneer may open bidding on any
           lot below the reserve by placing a bid on
           behalf of the seller. Okay...Let's start
           with Lot I, the Bonnard drawing. And
           $5.000 starting with my bidders, $5000 is
           bid, 5500, 6000, 6500 is mine, 7000
           gentleman's bid, 7500 is here, 8000 on
           the phone. . .

ON ERICA

in the back of the room, watching with pride and worry. She
slips out her cell, checks her messages. Her phone lights up
and tells her she has "0" Voice Mail.

A CLOCK ON THE WALL - IT'S 8:30

We are in ERICA'S EMPTY KITCHEN in The Hamptons and her phone
is RINGING.

ANGLE - A CELL PHONE

as A Man's HAND turns it off. We are:

INT. HAMPTON'S RESTAURANT

Julian sits at a table, by himself, in a coat and tie,
tucking away his phone. The Waiter sympathetically approaches
the table.

                     JULIAN

           Guess I got stood up.

                     WAITER

           Would you like to order or...?




                                                        91.











                    JULIAN

          Why not, I put. on the tie and
          everything. And can you bring me
          another. . .
              (indicating his drink)
Julian takes a look at the menu, then looks away.

TWO DINNER PLATES ARE CARRIED THROUGH THE RESTAURANT

and as the CAMERA WIDENS we realize we are:

IN A CHIC CAFE IN MANHATTAN - LATER THAT NIGHT

Camera takes us to Erica, Marin, Dave and DAVE'S FIANCE, KRISTEN,
a combo of a hot tie and a young professional. Everyone has menus
and drinks. A Waiter delivers two new Martinis for Marin and
Erica. They both go right for them. Erica drinks too much too
fast.                D

                     AVE

              (to Erica)
          Thirsty?

                    ERICA

          I've had a big week Dave, forgot how
          these slip right down. I'm fine. So,
          Kristen, where'd you go to...
              (burps)
          --medical school? Excuse me.

                    KRISTEN

          University of Pennsylvania.

                    ERICA

          I went to school in Philadelphia
          too.

                    DAVE

          Bryn Mawr girl.

                     KRISTEN

          That's amazing. My Mom went to Bryn
          Mawr . . .

                    MARIN

          Wow. So not only are you marrying my father
          but our mothers went to the same college.
Marin takes out a pack of cigarettes.

                    MARIN

          Anyone mind?

                    KRISTEN

          Actually I do.




                                      92.











          MARIN

Okay, I'll just..have one.
    (lights up)
So, this isn't going badly so far
is it? I mean for a totally surreal
situation like this.

          DAVE

Shall we order?

          KRISTEN

Absolutely.

          DAVE

    (peruses menu)
Erica, do I like duck?

          ERICA

Yes. It's rabbit you hate.
    (to Kristen)
I'll give you a list of everything
he likes and dislikes.

          DAVE

Let's let her figure some things
out on her own.

          ERICA

I didn't mean those things, Dave.
She did go to medical school.

          MARIN

    (pointing to herself and
    Kristen)
Hey, not in front of the kids.

          ERICA

    (polishing off her
     Martini)
I will tell you this...Dave has one
truly great love in his life.

          KRISTEN

Really? What's that?

             ERICA

His balls.

          DAVE

Okay, I forgot to mention she can't
drink hard liquor.
    (to Marin)
Why did you order her a Martini?




                     E














                                                        93.











                    ERICA

          What? It's not true? The man can not
          watch TV or read without the hand down
          the pants-- Here's my advice after 21
          years I say who cares, they're his
          balls,let him enjoy 'em.

                    MARIN

              (chokes)
          I think I swallowed my olive, whole.
Erica looks up and sees something that takes her breath away.

A COUPLE ZIGZAGGING AROUND TABLES

and headed in her direction. A sexy Young Thing followed by
her date -- no other than Harry. Harry stops to shake
someone's hand, holds his date around the waist. Suddenly,
the SOUND DROPS OUT of the restaurant as Harry and his Date
walk right by Erica's table in SLOW MOTION, not noticing her.

M


 OVING IN ON ERICA

as the room comes alive again. Her eyes follow Harry as he is
seated only one table away, his back to Erica, his Date
facing her. Marin hasn't seen him. Erica tries her hardest to
act normal but apparently isn't.

                    MARIN

          Mom, you okay?

                    ERICA

          Yeah, fine.
Erica looks at her menu then her eyes go right back to Harry.
His Date is laughing at something Harry is saying. Harry
leans in to her, whispers something to her. She touches his
hand.

                     RICA

          You know what? Maybe I need a little
          air...
Erica rises; grabs her purse, almost bumps into a Waiter as
she passes Harry's table, knocks into someone's chair, a
glass breaks. Everyone turns to her, including Harry. She now
stands right at his table. He smiles up at her.

                     HARRY

          Hey.

                    ERICA

          Hello... Harry.
              (to his Date)
          Hello...




                                                          94.











EXT. RESTAURANT

Erica rushes out. She's a little high and her heart is
pounding. She heads down the street.

                    ERICA

          Oh, God, I'm so stupid...
She picks up her pace, starts running. Her cell phone RINGS.

                    ERICA

          Hello?
Intercut Harry and Erica on their cells, a block apart.

                    HARRY

              (walking quickly)
          Slow down. You want to kill me?
She considers it.

                    ERICA

          Harry, I gotta go...

                    HARRY

          Erica, she's just a friend.

                     ERICA

          Yeah, she looks like a buddy kind
          of a girl.
Erica reaches a corner, can't get across, turns the corner.
Harry ARRIVES NEXT TO HER.

                    HARRY

          Come on, it's just a dinner...

                    ERICA

          Look, Harry, here's the problem. I
          really like you.

                    HARRY

          I really like you.

                    ERICA

          Yeah, but I love you like you.
              (that stops him)
          I do. I love you.
Harry swoons and not in a good way.

                    HARRY

          I think maybe you should consider
          that you're in love with the idea
          of being in love.




                                             95.














          ERICA


D

 o you? Okay. Oh, God...
    (stomps her feet)
I'm like the dumb girl who doesn't get it.
    (tries not to cry in front
     of him)
I've never been the dumb girl
before. It ain't so great.

          HARRY

Let's just calm down. This was just
a a meal with a friend.

           ERICA

-- Did you know I called you seven
hours ago?

          HARRY

I was gonna call you. I've been jamming
all day, it's my first day back.

          ERICA

Uh-huh. . .

          HARRY

I had these plans before I met you. But I
do like seeing you. I do. I'm always
surprised by it.

          ERICA

What was I thinking?

          HARRY

Maybe you weren't thinking for once and
look what a good time we had. Let's not
ruin something great.

          ERICA

Harry, I won't be good at this.

           HARRY

At what?

          ERICA

Acting like I don't care.

          HARRY

I have never lied to you. I have always
told you some version of the truth.

          ERICA

    (freaking on that one)
The truth doesn't have versions.




                                            96.











          HARRY

Can you cut me a little slack? My
life's been turned upside down.

          ERICA

Yeah. Mine too.

          HARRY

Then let's each get our bearings.

          ERICA

I don't want my bearings. I've had my
bearings my whole fucking life. I felt
something with you that... Oh, you don't
want to-

          HARRY

Yes I do.
    (she won't open up)
Tell me.

          ERICA

I felt something with you, I didn't know
really existed. You know what that's like
after a twenty year marriage? To feel
something for another person that's so
off the charts, that -
    (Harry looks down)
Okay, not your problem. This is why
I'm not good in relationships. You
know writers are like teachers,
those who can - do, those who can't
- write romantic comedies where
THIS does not happen in the third
act...and it certainly does not
happen to a 55 year old woman. In
the play I'll be 36 so it won't be
as pathetic. I'm just too old to
feel crushed.I've written this
feeling but I never really got it.
    (realizes)
You know what this is?
    (pointing to herself)
This is heart broken. How's that
for impervious?

          HARRY

You're killin' me.

          ERICA

I just wish it had lasted more than a
week.

          HARRY

Me too.




                                                      97.











                    ERICA

          That's a horrible thing to say.
              (walks off, comes back)
          The life I had before I met you. I
          knew how to do that, could do that
          forever. Now look at me...what do I
          do with all this?

                    HARRY

          Can we talk tomorrow?

                    ERICA

          What for? I saw your friend you were
          having dinner with, if that's what you
          want, it's never going to work with me.
          Look at me. I'm a middle aged woman,
          don't let this brown hair fool you, I
          don't have a real brown hair on my head,
          I'm almost all grey...that would freak
          you out, wouldn't it? And I have. high
          cholesterol and my back hurts every
          morning and I'm post menopausal and I
          have osteoperosis and I'm sure arthritis
          is just around the corner and I know
          you've seen my vericose veins. Let's face
          it man, that's not quite the buzz you're
          lookin' for.
A TAXI pulls up.

                    ERICA

          And you know what? Everyday, I'm
          gettin' older. ..just like you.
Erica opens the back door of the Taxi.

                      HARRY

          Wait.
Erica turns.
This is his chance.

                    HARRY

          I just... the truth is... I don't
          know how to be a boyfriend.

                     ERICA

          That's what you have to say after all
          this? You don't know how to be a
          boyfriend.

                    HARRY

          That's not a small thing.
They're both out of words.




                                                           98.











                    ERICA

          Are we done?

                    HARRY

          I don't know.
She nods. He doesn't give. She ducks into the CAB and it
PULLS AWAY. Harry stands on the street, watching her go.

                    HARRY

              (winces)
          Ouch.
He grabs his heart.

                       HARRY

          Oh, God...







HARRY - ON A GURNEY

wheeled through the Emergency Room of Beth Israel Hospital.
This is not the Hamptons. This place is crawling with
patients. Harry's delivered to a Latina Doctor in her
thirties, DR. MARTINEZ. As he's taken off the gurney, he's
immediately hooked up to a heart monitor, given oxygen and an

IV.


                    NURSE

          Came in by cab, 15 minutes of chest
          pain, no nauseau, some shortness of
          breath, was hospitalized a week ago
          with a coronary thrombosis.

                    DR. MARTINEZ

          Hang a nitro drip.

                    HARRY

          You can't. I took Viagra.

                    DR. MARTIINEZ

          You have been through this before.
          Give him 5 mgs of Metoprolol. You
          h~ving chest pain right now?

                    H


                     ARRY

          No, and the pain I was having was
          sharp, not like before.

                    . DR. MARTINEZ

          That's good. Not like before is we
          like to hear.
              (reads EKG)
          Give him aspirin.




                                                        99.











                      DR. MARTINEZ (CONT'D)

          Based   on what I see so far, your
          heart   is not in distress but I'm
          gonna   do a rapid enzyme test to be
          sure.    What were you doing at the
          onset   of the pain?

                    HARRY

          Having a fight with someone. A woman. Can
          a woman give you chest pain?

                    DR. MARTINEZ

          Are you kidding? Love hurts, haven't you
          heard?

                    HARRY

          Yeah, but so far, I've only given pain, I
          never got any.

                    DR. MARTINEZ

              (confused at how literal
               he is)
          All right, well you're battin' a thousand
          here. Your enzymes look perfect, your
          EKG is normal and the pain doesn't sound
          like the kind of pain we worry about. I
          think what you experienced was normal
          chest pain associated with stress.

                      HARRY

          Stress?

                    DR. MARTINEZ

          And incase you haven't heard, that can
          give you a heart attack. Mr. Langer, I
          donlt know what you're up to gallivanting
          out and about at this hour, but if you
          were my Dad, I'd make sure you were home,
          in bed, recuperating.

INT. HARRY'S TOWNHOUSE - LATER

Harry slowly climbs up the gorgeous staircase of his
Townhouse. Exhausted, he stops half way up, sits on a step,
takes out his cell.

                    HARRY

          If you were my Dad...
He pulls his glasses out of his pocket, puts them on to dial.
Something feels odd, he takes off his glasses, looks at them,
they're not his -- they're Erica's. He puts them back on and
dials.




                                                         100.











                    ERICA'S VOICE

          Hi. It's Erica. I'm not here so
          leave a message.
He realizes he doesn't know what to say, hangs up, then looks
at her glasses.

                    HARRY

              (grabbing his chest)
          Ouch.

BLACK SCREEN




A LIGHT POPS ON and Erica ENTERS HER BEDROOM, crying. She
flops down on her bed, picks up her phone, grabs her glasses,
puts them on, doesn't realize they're Harry's. She dials.
Voice Mail tells her she has One Message. She sits up,
excited.             J

                     ULIAN'S VOICE

          Erica, Hi, it's Julian. It's about
          8:20, I'm in the restaurant...just
          Wondering if you're...
Erica hangs up, starts crying again. She takes off her
glasses to wipe her eyes when she realizes she's holding
Harry's glasses. Just the sight of them makes her burst into
tears, the kind of tears that have been thirty years in the
making.

ERICA'S COMPUTER KEYBOARD - NIGHT

A tear lands on it. Erica, back in a turtleneck and wearing
Harry's glasses, starts writing at a breakneck pace, all the
while, tears flood her eyes.

MORNING - WAVES BREAKING ON THE SHORE


ERICA

wakes up. As soon as her eyes open, she bursts into tears.
While in the SHOWER, the crying never stops. While she EATS
BREAKFAST, a downpour. Running ON THE BEACH, she's wailing.
Back at the "COMPUTER, she's sobbing as her hands fly over
the keys. An actual boo hoo can be heard.
At NIGHT, laptop in bed, Erica writes, eating a   bagel, wearing
Harry's glasses and a pair of wrinkled pajamas,   FRENCH MUSIC plays
in the BG. At this point, she doesn't eVen" pay   attention to her
tears, just wipes and types when out of nowhere   she receives an
INSTANT MESSAGE from HARRY.
He writes: Do I hear French Music?
Shocked, she sits up, tries to fix her hair.

                                                         101.











INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Harry sits up in bed, staring at his laptop, wearing Erica's
glasses, a pair of pajamas and a three day growth. A
thermometer is propped in his mouth.
He writes: R U there?
She answers: Yes. Hello.
He writes: How are ya?
She writes: Great... as, she wipes her tears on her sleeve.
 e writes:How's the writing going?
She answers: Pouring out of me now. Go figure.

E

He types: I miss y .. He stops, thinks before sending.
 rica waits on her side. Nothing, is coming over.
Then, on his side, he receives: Actually just running out.
Take care...
Harry deletes the I miss y... and instead writes: U 2.
Erica slides down in her bed, wiped.

INT. HARRY' S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Harry takes out his thermometer. Feels lost. Looks at the
clock. It's 10:00 p.m.

INT. LOWELL'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Lowell lies in bed in pj's, WATCHING TV, smoking. Harry
arrives at his doorway in his pajamas. Lowell puts out his
cigarette, fans the smoke.

                    HARRY

          Lowell, I'm goin' out.

                    LOWELL

              (confused)
          Okay. Don't forget to put some
          clothes on.

                    HARRY

          I mean, I should go out, shouldn't I?
          Since .when don't I go out? Just cause
          some Emergency Room Doctor tells me to
          stay in bed, doesn't mean I have to turn
          into a monk.




                                                       102.











                    LOWELL

          Is there something you'd like me to
          do for you, Mr. Langer?

                    HARRY

          Well, no, just...well, what are you
          doin'?

                    LOWELL

          Watching Lucy.

                    HARRY

          Would you hate making me something
          to eat?

CLOSE - LUCY AND ETHEL ON TV


REVERSE - HARRY AND LOWELL

lying on top of the covers in Lowell's room, both eating
bowls of pasta, watching TV.

                    HARRY

          Funny women are adorable, don't you
          think?

                    LOWELL

          I never really thought about it.

                    HARRY

          Neither had I, but think about it.
          Funny's a unique thing in a woman. It's
          fun to be around.

                    LOWELL

          There's some reason we've been
          watching these two for 5O years.

                    HARRY

          Exactly. It lasts. We're not
          sittin' here watchin' Mamie Van
          Doren reruns.

                    LOWELL

          No we're not. You feeling okay?

                    HARRY

          I don't think I've slept one night
          since I've been home. Every little
          ache and pain scares the shitout of
          me...can't get a handle on my
          emotional life, don't know what I
          want, don't know if what I felt was
          because I just had a heart attack
          or was real. Plus, I feel needy. I
          never used that word in my life.




                                                       103.











                    HARRY (CONT'D)

          Lowell, have you ever seen me like
          this? Be honest.

                    LOWELL

          Nothing even close.

                    HARRY

          That's right, buddy, I'm a mess.
          And I'm no good at it.
              (realizes something)
          Those are very nice pajamas, by the
          way. Did they used to be mine?

                    LOWELL

          Yes but you gave them to me, you
          said you never wore them.

                    HARRY

          I know. But why would I do that?
          They're so elegant. Nice piping...

                    LOWELL

          Mr. Langer, you're always giving
          away beautiful things.

                    HARRY

          Awwwww... How did I get like this?
              (eyes fluttering shut)
          I'm gonna shut my eyes for a few
          minutes. Keep Lucy on...
Harry nods off and Lowell TURNS OUT THE LIGHT.

EXT. BEACH - THE HAMPTONS - MORNING - MUSIC OVER

Erica and Zoe are taking a walk. Erica, still crying, picks
up a brown stone, explains its meaning to Zoe. Zoe holds the
stone, makes an `awwww' face.Erica nods, then Zoe tosses the
stone in the ocean, fed up with hearing about him already.
Then, Zoe stops Erica, points to something.

MARIN AND HER NEW BOYFRIEND

frolicking on the beach. He's a YOUNG HUNK in a tank top,
shorts, highlighted hair. Erica rolls her eyes.

EXT. BEACH STAIRS - DUSK

Marin rushes down the stairs. Erica sits near the bottom of
the stairs, watching the sunset.

                    MARIN

          Mom, we're going into town...
Erica turns, wiping tears.




                                      104.











          MARIN

Are you crying?
    (joining her)
I didn't know you did that.

          ERICA

Yeah, it's my new thing. I've
gotten abnormally great at it.

          MARIN

    (sitting on the step with
    her)
Is it Harry?

          ERICA

Seems I gotta learn how to do that
love 'em and leave 'em stuff.

          MARIN

Fucking men. You don't care when I
say fuck, do you?

          ERICA

Not really. Sometimes. Not right
now.

          MARIN

So now you get my theory about
love? You gotta self protect. It's
too dangerous.

          ERICA

Marin, that theory... how can I put
this so your feelings won't get
hurt. It's just so crazy, it makes
me want to SCREAMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!

          MARIN

And how would you put it if you
wanted to hurt my feelings?

          ERICA

Listen to me... you cannot hide
from love for the rest of your life
because maybe it won't work out and
maybe you'll become unglued. That's
not a way to live.

          MARIN

So you're telling me you're happy
right now? This is good what
happened to you?




                                                       105.











                    ERICA

          No. This was bad. But for the three days
          it was good, it was electrifying.
Marin's eyes fill up.

                    ERICA

          I think you must consider the possibility
          that we are more alike than you realize.
          I let someone in and I had the time of my
          life.

                    MARIN

              (tearful)
          I've never had the time of my life.

                    ERICA

          I know. And bubbee, I say this from
          the deepest part of my heart. . ...
          what the fuck are you waiting "for?

INT. HARRY'S HOUSE - NYC - NIGHT

A PARTY is in progress. It's loud. The place is crawling with
characters from the Hip Hop world. Harry winds his way down his
crowded STAIRCASE, Girls grabbing at him as he passes by. As hard
as he tries, he can't quite bring to life the guy he knew how to
be.

                    LOWELL

              (as Harry passes)

          H

           aving fun?

                       HARRY

          Not quite.
Harry makes his way down the stairs, through the crowded
entry and OUT THE FRONT DOOR. OUTSIDE, Harry steps into the
QUIET STREET, looks up at his house and the party inside.

EXT. ROADSIDE FARM STAND - EAST HAMPTON - DAY

Zoe is picking corn, when she notices Julian across the way.
He glances up, looks right past her, obviously doesn't
remember her, keeps on shopping. Zoe thinks for a see,
wondering how she can get his attention when he looks right
back at her, his face full of hope.

INT. ERICA'S DINING ROOM - LATER

Erica sets the table for two. Zoe pokes her head in the door.

                    ZOE

          I got you something great at the
          farm stand.




J














                                                       106.










Zoe fully opens the door revealing Julian holding a bouquet
of fresh cut flowers.

                    JULIAN

          These are for you to give me when
          you apologize.

INT. DINING ROOM - LATER - MUSIC OVER

Candlelit. Zoe, Erica and Julian share a bottle of wine and a
home cooked meal. The CAMERA does a 360 around the table,
their faces saying it all. The Women bask in Julian's warmth
as he entertains them with stories. Zoe looks from Julian to
Erica, relieved to see her sister smiling again.

INT. KITCHEN - LATER

Erica places coffee cups in the sink. Julian is next to her,
leaning against the counter, holding a glass of wine.

                    ERICA

          Julian, I hope you know I'm
          mortified by my behavior. I was
          going to get in touch with you,
          send you a note or something...

                    JULIAN

          A note? That's a little chilly.

                    ERICA

          I'm embarrassed. I just haven't
          been myself lately. What can I say?

                    JULIAN

          Just tell me you're sorry.

                    ERICA

          I am sorry.

                    JULIAN

          Then you could kiss me.

                       ERICA

          Kiss you?
 ulian nods.

                    ERICA

          You'll forgive me if I kiss' you?

                       JULIAN

          Think so.
Erica hesitates then gives him a peck of a kiss.




                                                         107.











                    JULIAN

          No one on earth would forgive you
          for that kiss
              (places his wine glass on
               the counter)
          May I?
Erica nods as Julian takes her in his arms and gives her a
kiss that doesn't quit.

                    JULIAN

              (still holding her,
              whispers)
          I forgive you.
Erica very distinctly begins to hear the BEATING of her own
heart.

                                          DISSOLVE TO:


ERICA'S COMPUTER SCREEN - ANOTHER NIGHT

On it is written: The lights on the Eiffel Tower dim to black
as the music continues to play.
Erica sits back, still wearing Harry's glasses. Finished at
last. She notices an empty Kleenex box on her desk. She
tosses it in a hook shot across the room and it lands right
in the trash can.

INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Julian sits on the sofa, shoes off, reading the first half of
the play. A fire burns in the fireplace. Erica approaches the
back of the sofa, holding the rest of the pages.

                    JULIAN

          It's the best thing you've ever written.

                    ERICA

          It is?

                    JULIAN

          It's wonderful. It's sweet. It's smart.
          It's funny.
Erica leans oyer the sofa, reading over his shoulder.

                    JULIAN

          How great is it that I'm not
          intimidated by your brilliance?
Erica gives him a small kiss of appreciation.




                                                       108.











                    JULIAN

          Must we go through this every time?
          Come here...
She leans into him and he kisses her fully and sweetly. She
holds onto the sofa for support.

                                                   CUT TO:


A PRETTY GIRL - WHO LOOKS A LOT LIKE MARIN

eating lunch in Orso's, talking non-stop.

                    PRETTY GIRL

          I'm totally excited about this audition.
          It's such a great part. It's supporting
          but she's a really funny character.
          There's this totally hilarious scene
          where she's dating this like chauvinist
          older guy and just as they're about to do
          it, the guy moans and she thinks he's
          just really into her, right? Except he's
          having a heart attack and she's like
          creeped out and her mother, who basically
          despises the guy, rushes in, gives him
          CPR and saves his life.







REVERSE ON HARRY

choking on his lunch.

INT. BROADWAY THEATER - DAY

Auditions are in progress. On stage, AN ACTRESS reads for the

                     A

part of "The Sister".

                     CTRESS

          Look, we're four sophisticated people.
          Why can't we all stay for the weekend?

ON ERICA'S PROFILE

in the audience. She sits in a row by herself, listening.
Harry ENTERS HER FRAME, sitting directly behind her.

                    HARRY

          I need to talk to you.
Erica freezes, horrified. Turns, sees him.

                    HARRY

          Got a minute?




                                                       109.











BACKSTAGE

Erica and Harry stand in front of a BACKDROP OF THE BEACH.

                      HARRY

            So your play's about us?

                      ERICA

            No, it's about me.

                      HARRY

            Am I in it?

                      ERICA

            A guy like you is in it but he's
            not you.

                      HARRY

            What happens to this guy who's
            ..not me?

                      ERICA

            Haven't totally decided. He can
            live or he can die.

                      HARRY

            What are you leaning towards?

                      ERICA

            Death.
                (Harry reacts)
            It's funnier.

                      HARRY

            He dies of a funny heart attack?

                      ERICA

            He's sort of a schmuck who screwed
            around with our heroine, so it
            won't be too sad.

                      HARRY

            Schmucks are people too you know. Death
            doesn't seem a little harsh?

                      ERICA

            I just went where the story took
            me. It's a work of fiction, Harry.
            Really...just stuff I made up.

                      STAGE MANAGER

                (approaching)
            Erica, we're ready to do the
            hospital, 'Do You Take Viagra
            scene... Should we wait for you?




                                                       110.










Erica nods, horrified.

                    HARRY

          So I'm going to be the laughing stock of
          Broadway.

                    ERICA

          Harry, he's not you. He's a version
          of the truth of you. So to speak.

                    STAGE MANAGER

          Sorry to interrupt again but Dave wants
          to know, when Henry says, "I love ya",
          you want that to be 'Ya', not 'You',
          right?

                    ERICA

          Right.
We now HEAR Louis Armstrong's La Vie En Rose play throughout
the theater. The BEACH backing is 'raised and an EIFFEL TOWER
BACKING is lowered behind them. They both try to ignore the
music, but it's impossible.

                     E


                     RICA

          Well, you look really nice. You
          feeling all right?
As they stand in front of the Eiffel Tower backing, FAKE SNOW
FALLS from above...

                    HARRY

          You know it isn't like I wanted to stop
          seeing you. We could've carried on a fun
          thing for awhile. Why is it you dames
          want all or nothing?

                    ERICA

          I don't know, we're just goofy when it
          comes to love... Look, Harry, if it's all
          right with you, I'd like to be friends

                    HARRY

          I'm not ready to be your friend. How's
          that?

                    ERICA

          Fine. I understand.

                    HARRY

          Anyway, do you actually buy that horse
          shit.. .that men and women can be friends
          once they've had sex?




                                            111.











          ERICA

I'm friends with my ex-husband, but then
again, we didn't just have sex.

          HARRY

We didn't just have sex either.

          ERICA

Then what was it? Love to know.

           HARRY

Can I e-mail it to you when I figure it
out?
     (laughs)
This is perfect. I have given the `Can't
We Be friends' speech for 40 years. I
think I invented the 'Can't We Be
Friends' speech. But you know what,now I
get why they never went for it. You dames
got one thing right. Sometimes sex does
change everything. Call me crazy, but I
just don't see us out on the town, being
pals, having dinner, 'cause I'd bet you
anything, at some point, one of us will
have very unfriend like thoughts about
the other then pass the bread becomes
anything but pass the bread. You get what
I'm saying?

          ERICA

You don't want to be friends.

          HARRY

Not "don't". Can't. Can't be friends.
Doesn't work that way.
    (tries to calm down)
Okay, I'm moving into another phase of
this thing. I'm mad at you.
    (realizes)
It almost feels good.

          ERICA

I think I'm mad at you too.

          HARRY

Excellent. 'Cause I don't like
thinking about you so much and
worrying about how you are and if I
ruined your life or...

          ERICA

-- You've worried about me?

          HARRY

Yes honey, the schmuck who deserves to
die, worries about you.




                                                       112.

                    HARRY(cont'd)
          Sometimes worrying about you feels like a
          full time job.

                    ERICA

          Well, doll, I'm doing fine. So you don't
          have to work that shift anymore.
Again, The Stage Manager...

                    STAGE MANAGER

          Erica, they want you to take a look at
          the costumes for the dancing Henry's.
          These gonna work for you?
Harry and Erica TURN and SEE a CHORUS LINE of BALDING 60 YEAR

OLD MEN IN HOSPITAL GOWNS AND SOCKS.


EXT. THEATER - DAY

Harry FLIES OUT the Stage Door, right into the street, is
almost hit by a motorcycle, doesn't seem to care.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

Harry walks briskly through the park, still pissed, his pace
starting to get to him. He spots a bench with a WOMAN JOGGER
at one end. He parks himself at the other end of the bench,
out of breath. Tries H reason with himself.
                     to

                     ARRY

          God is a woman, I know that now. No
          man would punish me like this.

                    WOMAN JOGGER

          You never change, do you?
Surprised, Harry turns, glances over at the Woman. She drinks
from a water bottle then offers him an easy warm smile. She's
adorable, mid-sixties, short grey hair.

                    HARRY

          Do you know me or are you just talking to
          me as "man" in general, the beast women
          love to hate.

                    WOMAN JOGGER

          No, no, I know you Harry.

                    HARRY

          Oh. Don't tell me. I dated your daughter.
              (the Woman laughs)
          Right? I broke her heart then she married
          some hard working Joe on the rebound, has
          three great kids. What is so funny?




                                                       113.











                    WOMAN JOGGER

          You dated me and you broke my heart but
          after you I met the right guy. I've been
          married thirty-seven years, have four
          kids, eight grandkids and a ninth on the
          way.
Harry now fully turns in her direction, totally clueless.

                    HARRY

          I dated you. .?
              (the Woman nods)
          Did we. ever...?

                    WOMAN JOGGER

          No...we did not.
He looks at her hard but still doesn't remember her.

                    HARRY

          Can you give me hint? A year? A
          decade?

                    WOMAN JOGGER

          The sixties.
              (Harry squints at her)
          You took me to Shea Stadium.

                     HARRY

          To a Mets game?    I must've really
          liked you.

                    WOMAN JOGGER

          You took me to see The Beatles.

                    HARRY

          Oh, God, I really liked you. You're
          Sandra. ..Cook. We did. We saw The
          Beatles together. How the hell have
          you been? What happened to you?

                    SANDRA

          Well, let's see, after we stopped
          going out, I went back to school,
          got my doctorate in marine biology,
          went around the world a few times,
          met the man of my dreams at Oxford,
          married him, we lived in London for
          25 years. I wrote and taught, we
          raised 3 sons and a daughter. I've
          just finished my ninth book and now
          I'm training for my first marathon.
          Now, I must confess, I actually
          remember the very last thing you
          ever said to me.




                                                       114.

                    SANDRA(cont'd)
          You walked me to my door, I was
          tearful and you looked at me with
          those puppy dog eyes and said,
          "Honey, I just don't know how to be
          a boyfriend." Now, tell me, what
          have you been up to since 1964?
OVER Harry's face, we HEAR the SOUND of a SIREN BLARING.

INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

Harry is wheeled through the ER with the gurney. Dr. Martinez
runs along with the gurney.

                    DR. MARTINEZ

          Mr. Langer... Back so soon.

                    HARRY

          This is it, I'm dyin', I've had 20
          minutes of severe chest pain,
          nausea, shortness of breath, blood
          pressure's gotta be 170 over 100.
              (sticks out his arm)
          Give me the nitrate, I didn't take
          viagra.
              (rips open his shirt)
          Plug me in to the EKG, I need an
          aspirin, I'm taking 2 beta
          blockers, blood thinner, Lipitor,
          Procardia and if I were you, I'd be
          pounding my chest. Ow!

                    MALE NURSE

          You're a doctor, huh?

                    HARRY

          Just a very sick man.

CLOSE - THE PAPER TAPE FROM HARRY'S EKG

Dr. Martinez reads it.

                     DR. MARTINEZ

          Mr. Langer, your diagnosis although
          fascinating, was entirely
          incorrect.

                    HARRY

          That's impossible.

                    DR. MARTINEZ

          Your realize a severe anxiety attack can
          masquerade as a heart attack.

                    HARRY

          So I'm nuts? Perfect! The one thing
          I'm not taking pills for.




                                                          115.











                    DR. MARTINEZ

          If you don't want ,to end up in here
          every week, I suggest you do whatever it
          takes to decompress. Try something with
          me, okay?
              (takes his pulse)
          Close your eyes...now give yourself a
          visual image of something that gives you
          a feeling of peace and serenity.

                    HARRY

          I don't know. A hammock...

                    DR. MATINEZ

          Okay, good...what else..?

                    HARRY

          Palm trees...clear blue water...
We hear the SOUND OF LAPPING WATER, SEA GULLS. . . .

                    DR. MARTINEZ

          Anybody there with you?

                    HARRY

          Yes. Beautiful women...in thongs...

                    DR. MARTINEZ

          (disgusted) Okay. What else do you
          see, feel, taste...

                    HARRY

          A margarita...a Cuban cigar.
          ..miles of soft beach.. .

                    DR. MARTINEZ

          Keep going...you're doing great...
And as Harry keeps listing things, Camera MOVES IN ON HIM as
the STEEL BAND gets LOUDER AND LOUDER.

                                         DISSOLVE TO:


THE WORDS. . .


                    SIX MONTHS LATER


FALLING SNOW FILLS THE FRAME

Boom down to see the THEATER MARQUEE of Erica's play on
Broadway. On the Marquee are raves from critics, "****", and
a banner that brags, "Sold Out!".

C




 AMERA CONTINUES DOWN to street level. Couples walk by,
bundled up against the cold. Harry ENTERS FRAME.




                                                       116.










He looks different. He has a beard and has lost some weight:
And in his eyes, a calm we haven't seen before. He pauses in
front of the theater -- loo~s at the PUBLICITY PHOTOS. He
SEES Henry in his boxer shorts at the refrigerator meeting
"Emily" and her Sister. He sees ANOTHER PHOTO of The Dancing
Henrys kicking up their legs like Rockettes. Then, finally, A
PHOTO of Henry and Emily in bed, both wearing glasses. Harry
OPENS THE DOOR TO THE THEATER, steps inside and listens,
hearing Louis Armstrong's La Vie En Rose, then, the audience
breaks out in LAUGHTER. Harry smiles to himself.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING CORRIDOR - EARLY EVENING

The elevator opens. Harry steps out, looks around for an
apartment number, finds it, rings the bell and clears his
throat. The door quickly OPENS and we see MARIN. She looks
relaxed and happy to see him.

                    MARIN

          I couldn't believe you were calling from
          downstairs.
              (hugs him)
          So great to see you.

                    HARRY

          You couldn't look better.

                    MARIN

          Thank you. Come on in.

                    HARRY

          No, no, I just wanted to stop by and say
          hi and tell you I'm sorry if I ever did
          anything to you that wasn't on the up and
          up or...

                    MARIN

          What do you mean? You were great to me.

                    HARRY

          I was?

                    MARIN

          Always.

                    HARRY

          That's refreshing. Good. Well, I don't
          know what you've done to yourself but you
          look absolutely radiant.

                    MARIN

          I'm three months pregnant, that might
          have something to do with it.




                                                       117.











                    HARRY,

          Really? Who's ..the, lucky guy?

                    MARIN

          My husband, hold on, he really wants to
          meet you.
              (calls)
          Danny...
A Solid Citizen of a Guy joins Marin, loosened tie,
glasses...

                    MARIN

          Harry Langer, my husband, Danny Yellin.

                    DANNY

              (shaking Harry's hand)
          I've heard so much about you...

                      HARRY

          I bet.. .

                     DANNY

          Yeah, with Hthe play and all...

                     ARRY

          I'm famous,huh?

                    MARIN

          Just to us. In every interview my
          Mom does, she always says she made
          you up.

                    HARRY

          So the guy in the play, he doesn't
          make it, does he?

                    DANNY

          He basically dies at the end of the
          second act, but it's very funny.
              (as if that's some
              consolation)

                    HARRY

          Was hopin' she'd give me a
          reprieve, but...

                    MARIN

          Yeah, well...

                    HARRY

          Yeah. Okay...Best of luck, kids...
Marin is stumped by this little visit. Harry heads toward the
elevator, pushes the button, then turns back.




                                                          118.











                    HARRY

          How is she?

                     MARIN

          She's. . .
              (Harry waits)
          Really good.     Up to her old
          tricks.
Learning Italian, remodeling her apartment in the city.

                    HARRY

          Now if I wanted to see her...how
          would that go over?

                    MARIN

              (encouragingly)
          Only one way to find out, except
          she's out of town right now.

                    HARRY

          Oh yeah? Where is she?

                    MARIN

          Paris. She left two days ago, for
          her birthday. But she'll be back
          next week...
The Elevator arrives. Harry salutes his goodbye and steps
INSIDE THE ELEVATOR. He turns, FACES CAMERA.

                       HARRY

          Paris...

ANOTHER ELEVATOR.OPENS

And a clean shaven, dapper looking Harry steps off, cashmere
coat, gorgeous scarf. CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM out of the elevator
and through a BEAUTIFUL LOBBY OF A HOTEL then right onto THE
STREET. CAMERA does a 360 and we catch glimpses of PARIS AT
NIGHT. CAMERA SETTLES ON HARRY just as the LIGHTS OF THE
EIFFEL TOWER POP ON, sending a flood of golden lights high
into the night sky directly behind him.

                       HARRY

          Showtirne.

INT. LEFT BANK BISTRO - NIGHT

Erica sits alone at a table in the back of the room, drinking
a glass of wine. She looks vibrant. She glances up from her
drink and sees what looks like Harry making his way around
the tables. She leans to the side for a better look, to make
sure it's him. It is him and he's corning right toward her.
Her stomach sinks, her mind races... and before she can come
up with a single thought that makes any sense -- there he is.




                                                       119.











                    HARRY

              (proud of himself)
          I knew you'd be here.

                      ERICA

          You did?

                    HARRY

          I've come a long way to see you,
          Erica.

                    ERICA

          You mean we're not bumping into
          each other..? You came here to see
          me?

                    HARRY

          Yes, I did.
              (she seems to shiver)
          I'm aware it was a bold move, one
          of those impulses that grabs you,'
          but...so far, we're okay; right?

                    ERICA

          Well, uh, I mean, I'm just...

                    HARRY

          I'll take that as a 'Yes'.
Harry takes off his coat and scarf, hangs them on a hook.

                     ERICA

          You want a glass of wine or
          something?

                    HARRY

          I was just gonna give you a kiss
          hello.

                      ERICA

          Oh, Okay.
Neither is sure where to go. Cheek? Lips? He lands on her
chin. .Not what he wanted, but he takes a seat across from
her. She looks at him - utterly speechless.

                    HARRY

          I remember you said if we still
          know each other we should go to
          Paris for our birthdays, well, we
          still know each other..".

                    ERICA

          That's true, but, Harry, I haven't
          heard from you in six months.




                                                         120.











                    HARRY

          I know but I've certainly been thinking
          about you. There's a lot I have to say.
          First thing is... I'm not mad at you
          anymore.

                    ERICA

          Good, 'cause I'm not mad at you
          anymore either.

                    HARRY

          That's a relief...since I did come all
          the way to France and everything. And...
          Happy Birthday.

                     ERICA

              (afraid of everything he
              could possibly say)
          Thank you.

                     HARRY

          And congratulations on your amazing
          success...

                    ERICA

          It's been quite a ride. Funny, I thought
          maybe I'd hear from you when it opened.
          Where've you been?

                    HARRY

          After I saw you in the theater that
          afternoon, I had another "episode...

                    ERICA

          Oh, I'm sorry.

                    HARRY

          I was actually okay, but I was sure I was
          dying and the doctor in the ER said I needed
          to decompress. So I did. I walked out of
          there and changed my life, sold most of my
          businesses, packed my bags and moved to an
          island in the Caribbean.

                    E


                     RICA

          That's where you've been all this
          time? In the Caribbean?

                    HARRY

          Actually...No.







EXT. CARIBBEAN BEACH - FLASHBACK

Harry lies on a chaise under a palm tree, drink in hand, Hawaiian
shirt, shades. A steel drum plays in the distance.




                                                          121.











                    ,


                    HARRY (V.O.

          I was there about ,six hours, when it
          occurred to me that wasting away on an
          island in the Caribbean wasn't going to
          remotely cure what was ailing me.
Harry sits straight up into CAMERA.

BLACK SCREEN

A LIGHT POPS ON and we realize we are in HARRY'S CLOSET.

                    HARRY (V.O.)

          So I decided to take another kind of
          pilgrimage...into my past.
Harry ENTERS THE CLOSET, reaches onto a top shelf ,and starts
pulling down dozens of what used be called, "Little Black Books".

                    HARRY (V.O.)

          My thought was -- if I retraced my steps
          and visited all the women I've dated...
He blows dust off of the books.

                                         BACK IN PARIS


                    HARRY

          -- maybe I could figure out how I
          got so screwed up.

FLASHBACK - HARRY'S PILGRIMAGE

Harry STANDS at one FRONT DOOR after the NEXT, EACH ONE

SLAMMING IN HIS FACE.


                    HARRY (V.O.)

          A lot of the women wouldn't see me.
Then, we see WOMEN of various ages SLAP HIM ACROSS THE FACE.

                    HARRY (V.O.)

          Or speak to me.
Harry reels backwards from one Hefty Mama.

                    HARRY (V.O.)

          But I was on a mission to save my
          soul.

                     ,

A Woman In Her Fifties, purposively walks down a SMALL TOWN
MAIN STREET carrying groceries.




                                                          122.










Harry, at her side, keeps talking at her, even though she
picks up her pace and ignores him.

                    HARRY (V.O.)

          My losing streak finally ended when
          I got one to open up to me.
In a HOSPITAL ROOM, an Older Woman on life support, scrawls
out a note and shows it to Harry who sits in a chair by
herside. A Priest stands in the background. The note says,
"As I remember it, you were wildly insensitive". Harry lowers
his head in shame. She places another note in front of him.
It says, "I forgive you." Relieved, he smiles. Then, one last
note: "Now, scram."

                    HARRY (V.O.)

          Hearing what they had to say was no
          picnic.
In an Upper West Side COFFEE SHOP, Harry pas coffee
with a Woman in her Mid Forties. She talks his ear off.
Harry can' t deal with it. He looks away ~ The woman
places her hand on his chin and pulls him right back to
her and keeps talking at him.

                     H


                     ARRY (V .O.)

          But I stuck it out and I listened.
          Then I listened harder.
Harry WALKS down THE STREET with a ANOTHER WOMAN in her
Thirties, who carries a cello.   She never shuts up.

                    HARRY (V. O. )

          And one of the things I realized
          was, I was actually giving closure
          to generations of women.
At the corner, the Woman hugs Harry goodbye.

                    HARRY (V. O. )

          Although I admit, some refused to
          give, no matter what I did. . .

CLOSE - DIANE SAWYER

On the set of GOOD MORNING AMERICA. She glances out the
STUDIO WINDOW and sees Harry ON THE STREET among the folks
holding signs. He HOLDS A SIGN that says, "DIANE, YOU WERE
RIGHT.   I WAS ENTIRELY WRONG.   I`M SORRY."   She looks him
straight in the eye and gives 'him the finger.




                                                       123.











HARRY - FULLY DRESSED - LYING ON HIS BED - TOP SHOT


                    HARRY (V. O. )

          When you hear the same story about
          yourself over and over, your life
          begins to make sense and the future
          becomes your only salvation.







INT. PARIS BISTRO - THE PRESENT


                    HARRY

          It took me six months to find them
          all. I visited 18 different states
          but I came the furthest to see you.
A HAND lands on his shoulder and he HEARS:

                    A MAN'S VOICE

          I don't believe it.
Harry looks up and sees handsome young Julian in a beret.
Harry looks to Erica, instantly deflated..

                       HARRY

          Me either.
Harry stands. The two Men hug, then Julian squeezes in next
to Erica. Harry slowly takes his seat across from them.

                    ERICA

          I should have told you he was coming, but
          I was so engrossed in your story.

                    JULIAN

          What story..?

                     HARRY

          Oh, maybe another time. ..So...
              (looks from Erica to
               Julian, it all dawns on
               him)
          I guess I should've seen your play, then
          I would've Jknown how this ended.

                     ULIAN

          Yeah, big twist, huh? So what are
          you doing over here, man?

                    HARRY

          Just a uh, vacation...never been to Paris
          in January...

                     JULIAN

          It's amazing to run into you. You look
          wonderful.




                                                          124.











                    ERICA

          You do.

                    HARRY

          Haven't been on a gurney in six months so
          that's somethin'...

                    JULIAN

          Well, I've just been to every store
          in the city, this woman is
          impossible to buy for... But I
          think I finally found the right
          gift.
He puts what can only be a RING BOX on the table between
Erica and Harry.

                    JULIAN

          Happy Birthday baby.
He kisses her. Harry watches, dying.

                    ERICA

              (reaching for it)
          I'll open it later...
Harry rises, reaches for his coat.

                    HARRY

          No, no, you know what, I'll let you
          two celebrate...

                    ERICA

          Harry, stay.

                    HARRY

          I can't really.

                    JULIAN

          Why? You have somewhere to go?

                                           DISSOLVE TO:


THE WAITER POURING THE END OF A WINE BOTTLE

Everyone at the table is laughing, mid-meal. Julian is doing
the talking as well as laughing. Harry laughs along, trying
to be an approving part of their romance but he's totally
faking it.

THREE GLASSES OF BRANDY ARE SERVED - A LITTLE LATER


                    JULIAN

          -- To the forces of destiny that
          brought us together tonight.




                                                       125.










Erica lights a cigarette.

                    JULIAN

          What are you doing, you don't
          smoke?

                    ERICA

          I'm in Paris, the second hand smoke
          will kill you anyway...

                    JULIAN

          She's very brilliant, but the woman
          can not hold her liquor.
Julian puts his arm around her, pulls her close.

                    ERICA

          I like that about me.

                    BOTH GUYS

          Me too.
The Guys exchange looks.

                    ERICA

          Now, if I were writing this, this
          is where I'd write, 'an awkward
          moment' .

                    HARRY

          Honey, if you were writing this,
          I'd be dead.
Erica laughs.

                    HARRY

          Never fails to amuse her.
The Waiter drops the check on the table. Harry takes it.

                    JULIAN

          No, Harry, please, let us...

                    HARRY

          No, no, I insist. I crashed your
          party.
              (to Erica)
          At least let me buy you dinner on
          your birthday...
              (squints at his watch
               shows it to Erica)
          What time does that say?

                    ERICA

              (squints)
          I have no idea...




                                                       126.











                    HARRY

              (feels around)
          Wait,' I have my. . .

                    ERICA

              (reaching into her purse)
          Me too...
They each take out EACH OTHER'S GLASSES and put them on.
Erica points to Harry wearing her glasses and laughs.

                    HARRY

          You think you look so handsome in
          mine?

                     ERICA

          You know how long I've been looking
          for those?

                      HARRY

          Yes I do.
Harry hands Erica her glasses. She hesitates. He snaps,
gesturing for his to be turned over. She hands them to him.
Julian watches all this, sobered by their chemistry.

                     H


                     ARRY

              (tucking away his glasses)
          Once again...closure.
              (reads his watch)
          So it's only 5 in the afternoon in
          New York. What do they do around
          here for fun?







INT. NOISY CLUB - NIGHT

Camera finds the three of them sitting at a small table. The
place is dark, loud, crowded and young. They're all drinking
champagne. The air is strained.

                    BOTH GUYS

              (at the same time)
          Want to dance?
Harry gestures for Julian to have the first dance. Julian
takes Erica's hand and leads her to the dance floor. Harry
watches them slip through the crowd. Erica turns back, Harry
waves. Julian takes Erica in his arms, it's clear she's
comfortable in his embrace. None of .this is lost on Harry
and as he watches, the smile on his face more than fades, it
evaporates and everything inside him begins to hurt.

ANGLE - THE DANCE FLOOR

Erica and Julian -- they're sexy together.




                                                       127.











ANGLE - THE TABLE

Harry is gone.

EXT. STREET - PARIS - NIGHT

Harry, with his collar turned up against the cold, walks past
the glass pyramid in front of The Louvre.

EXT. PONT NEUF - PARIS - MOMENTS LATER

Harry walks over the bridge, the beauty surrounding him just
making it all worse. He stops, looks out at the Seine. He
hears a classic French song in the distance, then sees a
small barge, playing the music, pass beneath him. Without
warning, a tear falls from his eye.

                    HARRY

              (laughs at himself)
          At the end of the day, I'm nothin'
          but a sap, a stupid old sap,
          standing on a bridge in Paris,
          crying my eyes out.
He stops, looks at the mighty city surrounding him. Beauty's
not supposed to hurt. Another tear.

                    HARRY

              (almost amused)
          Look who gets to be the girl.
He wipes his eyes on his coat sleeve as SNOW begins to fall.

                    HARRY

              (looking toward heaven)
          Anything else... .

                      ERICA'S VOICE

          Harry?
Harry turns and sees Erica standing by a Cab with its motor
running, snow falling on her hair and coat.

                    HARRY

          Where's Julian?

                    ERICA

          He went back to the hotel.

                      HARRY

          How come?




                                                       128.











                    ERICA

              (walking to him)
          He said when he saw me with you, he
          knew I was still in love with you.
          What do you have to say about that?

                    HARRY

          If it's true, my life just got
          made.

                    ERICA

          Why'd you come here, Harry?

                    HARRY

          Because I realized what I was feeling for
          you, have always felt for you, was
          something I didn't understand, like a
          language I didn't speak...
              (she listens...)
          It scared me so I did what I do. I snuck
          away. Turns out the heart attack was easy
          to get over. You were somethin' else.
              (she's starting to melt)
          And when I went to see all those women, I
          found out I was never really present for
          any of them. And something inside me at
          some point, had just...shut off. That's
          when I think my heart gave out and you
          saved me. I finally get what it's all
          about. I'm 63 years old and I am in love
          for the first time in my life. And that's
          what I came here to say.

                    ERICA

          Okay, this is the best birthday ever.

                     HARRY

          I know I'm no spring chicken, I figure I
          only got another 30-40 years in me. Tops.
          But how 'bout we figure out a way to make
          this work.

                    ERICA

          Okay.

                    HARRY

          Okay? Okay! I'll take it.
The Barge drifts back under the bridge, La Vie En Rose piping
out of it's tinny speakers.

                    HARRY

          Honey, they're playing our song.




                                                         129.










She comes close and he pulls her in, kissing her great. And
as they separate, he smiles, relieved.

           Langer, party of four.. .and a

The Maitre'D snaps to attention and leads Harry, Erica,
Marin, holding her Baby Girl, and her husband Danny through
the crowded restaurant. The Baby fusses and reaches out to
Harry who takes her in his arms and proudly parades her
through this swanky crowd to a round table in the center of
the room. Harry beams at the prize in his arms as he sits
with his family for a Sunday dinner.

                            SHOOTING DRAFT





    FADE IN:


1   INT. BEDROOM - MEDIUM CLOSE - MALE FORM - LATE AFTERNOON      1

    A shape fills the lower portion of the screen. It is a man's
    back..... a perfect back... good dark color, slim, muscular.
    LATIN MUSIC PLAYS... a song.... if you understood the words
    you would hear love confronted and considered in a very
    specific way...We are in a Mexico City suburb. The day is
    hot; small beads of sweat are seen on the man's back, the
    first indication that we are in slow motion..Perfect red
    fingernails come into view...and now a woman's hand goes
    beautifully to work...part sensual back scratch, part
    massage. The hand cups bits of the man's back, a strong thumb
    probes his spine, a long finger teases the very top of his
    ass in a cute finger-pirouette and then continues down --
    and, as the hand rises once more to the top of his back for
    another trip down his upper body...
    MAIN TITLES BEGIN: Full titles, minute after minute of titles
    with some key dissolves helping us to represent some 30
    minutes of time passage as the hand continues to scratch and
    rub, the man making sounds of pleasure. The hand is getting
    tired. Flirtatious no more, this is getting to be work...The
    unseen woman shakes the hand vigorously, the man says a
    single sound urging her to continue, the exhausted hand
    complies, then stops, then the unseen woman changes hands as
    TITLES CONTINUE.....The new hand, wearing a wedding ring,
    goes to work then it too stops to rest..the man says
    something in Spanish...important for us because it will
    establish that there will be no subtitles and yet we
    understand perfectly that he is asking her to continue. She
    replies in Spanish lightheartedly, with a small and pretty
    laugh, that her hands are tired. We understand. The man tells
    her to continue. She continues, the rub now desultory and
    resentful. She stops for another rest. The man wants more and
    grabs forcibly at her hand -- his own hand coming into view
    for the first time. She says, in Spanish, with no particular
    anger, "you said you would never push me around again. If you
    do, I will somehow break your arm so you can rub your own
    back as high as you want." (NOTE: All Spanish dialogue will
    be worked hard to provide something extra for the Spanish
    speaking..working in tidbits or extra exposition, jokes etc.)
    For now, the man's tone changes, placating her to continue.
    Even as she resumes the massage they begin to have a domestic
    argument in Spanish. This is no longer a massage we envy.
    This back rub, going as it does from sex and hope to discord
    and alienation, will be our only full direct knowledge of
    their marriage.

2   INT./EXT. BEDROOM / DUSTY ROAD - OTHER ANGLE                  2

    Showing us the room and beyond, through the window, a school
    bus stopping at the corner on a dusty road.
    We now see the full figure of the woman's back as she looks
    up with excitement and stops rubbing with the word,




                                                             2.







    "Cristina." When the man protests her stopping she indicates
    they should both run and meet their daughter. He waves her
    off. Stunned by his disinterest, she runs from the room.....

3   EXT. DUSTY ROAD - THE BUS                                     3

    As CRISTINA, six years old and adorable, waits patiently to
    step down. She sees her mother and grins and waves excitedly,
    digging into her little pack to pull out an English book
    which she displays with pride. Now she steps down from the
    bus and, as she walks TOWARD CAMERA, narration begins. The
    voice is of a girl eleven years older than the child we see.

                        NARRATOR

              To Princeton University's Director
              of Admissions: In considering me
              for a scholarship you have asked
              for, and have every reason to
              expect, an essay from me about
              myself. And, as a clever high
              school graduate, I of course
              realize the subtext of this essay
              about who I am and why I want to
              enter Princeton, is actually to
              make clear to you why you should
              have me. I have gotten tips, from
              friends who have preceded me to
              college, that being a Latina, with
              my grades, list of activities and
              relative poverty, I am as good as
              in if I simply do the dance and
              work in a word like
              "bipolarization" every so often.
              And while I love dances -- this
              dance of self is one I am afraid to
              master.
                  (young girl looks off and
                   lights up)
              I prefer to write about my mother.

4   INT. / EXT. HOUSE - SCHOOL GIRL'S POV - MOM                   4

    A drop-dead gorgeous Latin woman in her early 20's. As mother
    and daughter move inside, a car pulls up with an ominous man
    getting out. He nods in another direction calling our
    attention to a police car parked off the street. The woman
    does not notice - instead shepherding the child to her
    father. The woman makes a big fuss over the text books the
    child has..this is one supportive mom..again she is
    disbelieving that her husband shows no interest, especially
    when the child seems briefly hurt. The woman's husband looks
    from the window and sees the ominous man coming. The woman
    now does everything humanly possible to distract the child so
    she does not see what is transpiring.

                        NARRATOR

              For my mother, that afternoon
              eleven years ago was a watershed
              not because of my father's

              imprisonment but because it was my
              first day at school....

5   INT. KITCHEN / HUSBAND'S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON                5

    This room is directly across from the husband's room. The
    woman looks up to see her husband open the suitcase to show
    the man a huge store of Mont Blanc pens and high-end watches.
    The man gives her husband some money..all the time the woman
    is chattering to distract the girl. Looking off --the woman
    grows wide-eyed as she sees her husband count some money. The
    undercover cop begins shouting orders. The woman raises her
    voice to cover the argument in the next room which puzzles
    her daughter.

                        NARRATOR

              There was never any pretense that
              the gorgeous, vital, clever,
              temperamental animal that was my
              mother ever for a heartbeat
              considered having any life of her
              own. She ignored all her needs and
              was alive only for me. It was
              terrific.
                  (a long beat)
              At the time.

    ON MOM.

    As she watches her daughter chew a cookie. Her daughter
    begins to tell about her day, her young mother taking on a
    glow we have not yet seen. And all the while she eyes the
    action in the next room. Her husband makes a break for the
    window. The other man points a gun at the ceiling preparing
    to fire a warning shot. The woman moves ever so quickly to a
    shelf of her favorite dishes, all the while talking to her
    daughter, making much over the kid's new school books. It is
    an impressive charade.

    FULL SHOT - TAKING IN BOTH ROOMS.

    And just as the cop shoots at the ceiling, in perfect timing,
    she upsets the dishes, the resulting noise covering the
    shot.. The woman asks her daughter what she learned
    today..the daughter says she was taught a little English.
    Mother is impressed as she watches the cop move her husband
    toward the front door where other police await. Her daughter
    starts to follow her gaze and she distracts her..brandishing
    the Spanish/English book and asking her to say something.

    Standing proudly, smoothing her skirt.

    As she clears her throat and says directly into camera.

                           GIRL

                 Hi.
    The girl and woman are enormously excited over this word even
    though, outside, her life's mate is being loaded into the
    back of a police car.(Note: Mexican police DO NOT duck the
    perpetrator's head WHEN LOADING THEM IN THE BACK SEAT..they
    just allow the concussion.) It seems the mother will save her
    child the trauma of her father being carted off; but the
    police turn on their siren and the girl turns to see her
    father as the car pulls away. The child is stricken. A tear
    starts to form in her eye. Her mother acts quickly. We are
    about to see powerful emotion reversed by sheer force of
    will..the mother leans down, gives three quick kisses - power
    pecks - to the girl's cheeks and then an admonition in
    Spanish.

                           MOTHER

                 Una lágrima...sola una sola...Haz
                 la mejor possible.

                           NARRATOR

                 "One tear..only one...so make it a
                 good one." This was my mother's
                 instruction to me.

    ON CHILD.

    Baffled by the edict..

    ON MOTHER.

    Holding up one finger. That's it..one tear..she means it.

    ON CHILD..

    As she complies..one great tear forming and falling..Her
    mother's thumb wipes it away..But now her eyes well with more
    tears..her mother gestures she must have strength and
    resolve..and so she does..a toss of her pretty little
    head...the eyes clear.

7   INT. MOTHER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                     7

    As the mother, lying in bed with her daughter loses her own
    fight with tears..managing with difficulty to keep her
    convulsive sobs silent since her daughter and she are
    intertwined like pretzels.

    Her mother's daughter. Across the small hallway her mother

     As the girl works..her dress changing as the days change
     while different visitors listen hard to her mother across the
     hall.

                         NARRATOR

               My mother dealt with our
               considerable problems of survival
               by talking..Always she discovered
               her own best thoughts by sifting
               through her own words.
     The mother stops talking in mid-sentence, realizing she has
     just solved something and makes a note.

10   INT. MOTHER'S BEDROOM - THE TWO OF THEM IN BED - NIGHT       10


                         NARRATOR

               Each night my mother promised me a
               wonderful life.. Each night I
               looked for a new expressive way to
               tell my mother how much I loved
               her.
     The child is ardent..clutching at her heart...kissing her
     mother.. Holding her mother's face, talking directly into her
     eyes. The mother, enormously pleased, is nonetheless thrown
     by the extremes of it.

                         NARRATOR (CONT'D)

               I just played and did my lessons
               and every time I looked up my
               mother was in the process of saving
               us.

11   INT. / EXT. MONTAGE - VARIOUS SHOTS                          11

     Her mother selling keepsakes..counting money..Friends and
     relatives bringing food, clothing - toys.

                         NARRATOR

               Desperation in her hands was our
               weapon.

     ON MOTHER..

     We see her totally intimidating a priest.

                         NARRATOR (CONT'D)

               With this weapon she had her
               marriage annulled - usually
               impossible for the poor - and
               somehow convinced an associate of
               my father's to transport two
               Mexicans North in style.

12   INT. SMALL AIRPLANE - MAGIC HOUR                             12

     The mother and daughter seating themselves. The mother is
     enormously nervous with the prospect of flight. She sits,
     the daughter ignores an empty seat and goes on her lap,
     mother hugging daughter, daughter hugging the hug.

                    English synonyms)
               ..happy, merry, joyful, glad,
               contented, frisky.
     As they taxi.

                   (to mother)
               Are you her mother, sister..what?
     The mother says, "solo español"---"only Spanish." The
     daughter starts to chatter excitedly about the imminent
     flight. Her mother quiets her firmly in order to pray for
     their safety.. As the plane continues to taxi...We HEAR the
     mother's prayer in Spanish. She then nudges her
     daughter..who, with this gentlest of prods, repeats the same
     prayer.

               My mother's prayer for us, which
               she made me repeat exactly,
               represented a stunning look into
               our future. "Please God, let only
               the bad things change."

     He glances over..this is not lechery, it is art
     appreciation..an errant but decent man awed by the creature
     he is drawn to..

                            NARRATOR

                  My mother had redefined her own
                  passions. Blaming herself for the
                  father she gave me, she would never
                  again be lured by a man's rough
                  edges..She had decided that
                  goodness would be her catnip.

     ON MOTHER..

     As she feels him looking at her and turns. With some
     affection and regret, she shakes her head, "no."

     she finds so thrilling.

     lights.

     She raises her fingers like pistols. Shoots, blows in them
     and reholsters them.

19   EXT. NORTH VALLEY STREET - EARLY EVENING                     19

     As they disembark...the mother studying a slip of
     paper...fearing she has made the mistake of a lifetime. The
     child fascinated by all.

                          NARRATOR

                At the time, I was oblivious to my
                mother's anguish. She loved and
                lived to talk. Now, as if by a
                witch's spell, words were no longer
                her bridge but her barrier. In a
                very real sense she feared she had
                left herself behind.

     ON THE TWO FEMALES.

     The mother sees something. Joy returns.

     HER POV.

     A street full of stores with SIGNS IN SPANISH..She begins
     walking the street asking passers-by for directions in
     Spanish and is answered..her step lightens..she beams with
     relief. So far so very, very good.

     An iron gate in front..small courtyard ringed by a second
     floor horseshoe of apartments.

                We moved into a place managed by my
                mother's aunt. My mother worked two
                jobs in two local stores paying a
                total of 450 dollars a week...

     Cristina taking a snack from the refrigerator..smiling at the
     note her mother left...lighting a burner and melting cheese
     on a tortilla.

               But we were fine. We had it down.
               If only I could have stayed six.
     The CAMERA MOVES QUICKLY from the child to:

23   EXT. APT. COMPLEX - ELEVATED SHOT - SIX YEARS LATER.       23

     The courtyard is lit with colored lights and candles..a
     wedding reception is in progress -

     EXTREME CLOSE UP - THE BRIDE.

     Gorgeous round and full cheeks stretched into a deep,
     explosive smile.
     BACK TO SCENE... music plays and we focus on Cristina, now
     nearing 12 years of age..dancing with her mother and some
     other smaller children.. The mother eyes the muscular back of
     a Great Looking Man...who turns, and quickly oozes quality
     sex appeal. She is turned on..They talk in Spanish...him
     saying something hushed like, "I have been afraid to talk to
     you. I need oxygen when I look at you." She indicates the six
     children she is dancing with and offers to include him in
     some ring around the rosey dance...He indicates the magic of
     just the two of them...She quickly leads her little flock
     away..

     OTHER ANGLE..

     A reed-thin FOURTEEN YEAR OLD BOY is staring at them...at
     first the mother thinks this is adorable...the child eyeing
     her as if he were a man..she indicates he should join the
     rest of the children for a dance..

     MOVING WITH THE BOY..

     As he steps forward and it becomes clear it is Cristina he is
     interested in... Before the mom can do anything about it, he
     asks Cristina to dance and she readily accepts.

     ON CRISTINA..

     Satellite virginities falling with alarming speed..the first
     time held by a male, the first time held close, the first
     sexy (albeit touchingly awkward) gaze from half-closed male
     eyes which utterly confuses Cristina. He begins to grind his
     hips into his dancing partner.

     ON HER MOTHER.

     Not confused. It is exactly as if she sees her daughter about
     to be run down by a car..only this time the thing to do is
     scare the car.




                                                              10.







     She runs toward the boy -- he sees the force of nature coming
     his way and makes a break but she gets him and actually lifts
     him and throws him to the sidelines. Then pats him on the
     head maternally and goes back to Cristina.

     CRISTINA.

     Somewhat proud of her mom as the boy leaves the scene.

                           NARRATOR

                 That quickly it was clear she could
                 no longer work two jobs and leave
                 me to my own at night. The
                 following morning she did something
                 about it. A boy I never saw again
                 had changed our lives.

                           BRIDE

                     (to mom)
                 Este es Stone Canyon.

26   EXT. STONE CANYON - DAY                                      26

     MUSIC CHANGE..as they disembark and start walking, joining
     the busload of domestics into the canyon and up the
     hill....they walk past a perfect country club fairway. Grand
     trees from either side meet each other high over the road.

     ON OUR GAL..AS THEY WALK

     She sees the stuff...the dream that makes you migrate. She is
     not awed..she is jazzed. To her aunt she does the Latin
     version of OH.....MY...GOD!!!!!!!!...At regular intervals in
     the background, one black SUV after another has a mother
     taking kids home from school.

27   EXT. ATTRACTIVE HOME SECURITY GATE - DAY                     27

     Monica presses the security intercom. The gate swings open.

28   EXT. HOUSE - DAY.                                            28

     In the foreground an expanse of turned up dirt...and huge
     rolls of sod ready to be laid down. A catering truck stands
     in the driveway.

29   INT. / EXT. HOUSE - GREAT KITCHEN / POOL - DAY               29

     They enter..lots of glass French doors STAND OPEN to lawn,
     pool and pool house. They look off.




                                                           11.








THEIR POV.

DEBORAH NORWICH CLASKY, a cool beauty in her mid 30's, sits
dominating this three generation portrait of the Good Life.
She is wearing a straw hat and killer Hawaiian shirt..She is
a perfect dresser; meaning her clothes seem to say she
doesn't care, while every article is a true and gifted find.
She is drinking from a tumbler which is also of the "don't
hold your breath while you try to find something as terrific"
variety. She is flanked by her mother, EVELYN, 60, who is
drinking from a stemmed glass with two olives and her 14 year
old overweight daughter, BERNICE..who is reading, her
grandmother idly holding her hand..In the immediate area more
rolls of sod wait to be laid.

THE TWO LATINAS.

As they stand inside the kitchen not sure what to do next.
Then Deborah gestures that they should join her at the
pool..as they start out..

THEIR EXIT.

Boink..three stooges retro..those French doors were not open
after all. Monica hits first. The women at the pool react.
Deborah and Bernice running. Evelyn momentarily attempts to
join the rush.. she half rises and then thinks better of
it..too late in the day for sudden movements.

KITCHEN DOORWAY.


                       BERNICE

             Gee whiz in heaven...How are you?
             Please?

                       DEBORAH

                 (a bit hyper)
             Don't worry..I'm not mad...I was
             looking for decoration to put on
             the glass so people would stop
             walking into it and instead of
             taking what they had in stock,
             which was awful, I special ordered.
             I'll design something myself which
             I should have done in the fi...
Our heroine, seeing the blood flow from her aunt's nose,
gestures that Monica needs help not conversation.

                       DEBORAH (CONT'D)

             ..and what difference does that
             make when your nose is bleeding.
             Shut up, Deborah.

                       BERNICE

             Now you got it, Mom.




                                                             12.







     Deborah grabs at paper towels, gets an ice pack from the
     freezer and then grabs some cash from a bowl in the
     kitchen..She has, moment to moment, the enormous desire to
     feel loved that only the seriously hard to love can
     experience.

                         DEBORAH

               Here, take these.
                   (second thought)
               Was that strange to give you
               money..I just felt badly that..

                            MONICA

               It's okay.
     She pockets the cash.

30   EXT. HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY                                  30

     Moments later. As the group arrives at the outdoor table.
     Evelyn makes half-hearted incomplete gestures of shaking
     hands, nodding, indicating a seat...each simple act a test
     which she fails -- every gesture a bit too late and then
     some..simply too much for her to manage with the drinks under
     her belt. In the background workers roll out sod, the yard
     becoming more beautiful even as we look.

                         MONICA

               She is my niece. She and her
               daughter live in the apartment I
               manage. Yolanda, who worked for
               you, lived there before she went
               back home. That's how I heard about
               the job.

                         DEBORAH

               So who am I interviewing?

                            MONICA

               Her.

                         DEBORAH

                   (forcefully)
               You're gorgeous.
     On our gal..as she, not understanding the word, smiles and
     nods.

                         MONICA

                   (translating sotto)
               Vistosos.
     Our gal thrown. Not knowing how now to react.

                         EVELYN

               She doesn't mean it as a
               compliment. It's more of an
               accusation.




                                                        13.








                    DEBORAH

          This is my daughter Bernice and
          this is my mother, Evelyn Norwich..

                     BERNICE

              (rising)
          Excuse me...Glad you're okay.
              (then to other Latina)
          Good luck.
Our gal smiles back in appreciation.

                    DEBORAH

          No, stay..this involves you.

                    BERNICE

          I wouldn't want some kid around for
          my interview. You understand, Mom.

                    EVELYN

              (to Bernice)
          Strength of character..empathy..big
          heart..taste for futility - God I
          love you.
She eyes with disapproval her mother's empty glass.

                     DEBORAH


          MOTHER!

               (then to Bernice)
          Stop. It's just a conversation -
          not an interview. Please sit.
               (to visitors)
          Don't you want to get out of the
          sun?
She indicates a shaded seat. Deborah is protected by hat,
umbrella, sun glasses while her guest sits bareheaded
enjoying the rays and indicates she is fine. Underneath
Deborah's surface is a Russian roulette of deeply felt
emotions..at this moment she is earnest and vulnerable.

                    DEBORAH (TO OUR GAL) (CONT'D)

          You guys want some lemonade?
              (they demur)
          Let's just talk. I have two
          children. My husband works
          nights..he's a chef and has his own
          place.

                    MONICA

          Do you work?

                    DEBORAH

          I helped run a commercial design
          company until ten months ago when




                                                        14.








                    DEBORAH (CONT'D)

          it was downsized to zip. Okay. I
          have two children. I like the house
          to be like me in that I'm very
          loose and meticulous at the same
          time. It's all about first names
          and closeness here but I care about
          the place, you know. It's what they
          used to call homemaker..
The two visitors exchange a wide-eyed look. Which Deborah
sees and understands.

                     DEBORAH (CONT'D)

              (to Monica)
          I'm not leaving time for you to
          translate.
Monica says, in Spanish, "this woman is very strange. The
only thing I understand is she has two kids." Deborah leans
into Monica. Face to face, tender but unblinking..

                    DEBORAH (CONT'D)

          Too bad for you that it just never
          occurred to you to check on how
          much Spanish I know.

                    MONICA

              (a solid beat of
               humiliation then)
          I'm sorry what I say about
          you...don't hold it against her.

                    BERNICE

          Mom!!

                    DEBORAH

          I don't speak any Spanish. But I'm
          not an idiot - I talk for an hour
          and you say two words. What did you
          say?
Monica squirms - unusual for her.

                    DEBORAH (CONT'D)

          Never mind. You got your nose
          bopped. I got my feelings hurt.
          Onward.
As Monica paraphrases what has happened, her translation is
DIALED DOWN for the:

                    NARRATOR

              (as Deborah continues
               talking)
          I will major in linguistics and
          make sociology my sub-
          concentration. Because it has been
          my experience that the barriers of

          language are more than we dare
          admit. That, as much as we
          translate, finally we will never
          understand each other. My mother's
          name, for example, beautiful in
          Spanish, becomes leaden and awful
          when pronounced by a non-Latin.

                    DEBORAH (IN THE CLEAR)

          What's your name? Llamo? One of my
          five Spanish words..

                    OUR GAL

          Flor Moreno.
She pronounces Flor in the Latin way...lots of RRRR's with a
curling of the tongue sound at the end.

                      DEBORAH

          Flor.
She pronounces it flat like the "floor" we walk
on...throughout the following each of the women sticks to
their pronunciation as indicated by the extra "r's.

                    FLOR

              (correcting)
          Florrrrr.

                      DEBORAH

          Flor.

                    FLOR

              (correcting)
          Florrrrr.

                      DEBORAH

          Flor.

                    FLOR

              (correcting)
          Florrrrr.

                      DEBORAH

          Flor.

                    FLOR

              (trying)
          Florrrrr.

                    DEBORAH

          Flor..what I walk on?

                      MONICA AND EVELYN

          Florrrrr.




                                                        16.








                      FLOR

          Florrrrr.

                    BERNICE

          It means flower, right?

                    MONICA

          Yes. Flower. Florrrrr.

                      EVELYN

          Florrrrr.

                      FLOR

          Florrrrr.
Deborah is beginning to feel criticized...she takes a
beat..eyes everyone with some hostility.

                    DEBORAH

              (directly to Flor)
          Is there some school of the ear I'm
          flunking out of right now?
Flor says to Monica, in Spanish, a tip to pronounce her name.
Monica warns Flor to leave it rest..since Deborah is becoming
clearly and strangely pissed..

                    DEBORAH (CONT'D)

          What did she say?

CLOSE ON FLOR...

She feels the tension but, so far in her life, her own
irrepressible personality has served her - so she moves
forward with surprising and quiet confidence and assurance.
She tells her aunt to repeat her words so that now, for the
first time, she is, through Monica, talking directly to
Deborah.

                    MONICA

              (translating)
          She says..If you curl your tongue
          and let it be loose you will have
          it..that it's hard for Americans..
          She says it's great that you try so
          hard. Many people wouldn't bother.

                    DEBORAH

              (an emotional
               pronouncement/her
               greatest accolade)
          She gets me....
She smiles at Flor, who returns the smile.




                                                         17.








                    DEBORAH (CONT'D)

          You want some lemonade? Take some
          lemonade.
She pours some for Flor and Monica. Then she closes her eyes
and pauses in utter dedication to a final effort:

                      DEBORAH (CONT'D)

          Florrrrr.
It is perfect..Flor grins at Deborah's victory...claps her
hands together.

                    FLOR

              (a Spanish word)
          Sublime.
Deborah feels relief..free for a moment from the dark
corridors of self-criticism..She is lighter, prettier,
innocent..Wholly and completely attractive.

                    DEBORAH

          Whew, dense but stubborn, right?
          Thanks.
              (an important declaration)
          What you just did with me is just
          what kids need..patience and
          encouragement. Alright, money...
Bernice rises like a shot to take off..

                    BERNICE

          Goodbye, really..
              (to Flor)
          Look forward to seeing you.
As she leaves.

                    DEBORAH

              (absently to Bernie)
          Love you...
              (then with not a
               monoseconds break)
          ... the job is six days a week,
          seven to seven..the kids and all
          housekeeping, how much a week would
          you like?
Monica translates..Flor, embarrassed a bit by the directness,
ducks the question..saying in Spanish -- "whatever you say.."

                    DEBORAH (CONT'D)

          No.. This is an important
          question..if you ask for too little
          it means you don't value




                                                                18.










                  yourself..too much and you're
                  taking advantage.
                      (after Monica translates)
                  So?
     Flor is dumbstruck by the challenge of this pop quiz but not
     without some native wit and style to maneuver around it.

                            FLOR

                      (extremely heavy accent)
                  One thousand dollars.
     Deborah falls for it until Flor laughs..others join...Deborah
     now a big smile, snort of a laugh, putting her hand to her
     face and shaking her head.

     OTHER ANGLE..

     As Monica uses Deborah's reaction time to, in mid-laugh,
     flash four fingers to Flor..

     ON EVELYN.

     Catching the gesture and secretly indicating to Monica they
     should go for six.

                            MONICA

                      (firmly)
                  Six hundred dollars.
     Flor shoots her a look of fear...a tense beat.

                            DEBORAH

                  Welcome to the family..
     Deborah kisses her..sort of on the mouth. In the midst of
     Flor's delight she is thrown by Deborah's kiss...it is the
     first of many borders to be violated.

31   EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - DAY.                                     31

     As Flor and Monica exit and can finally show their full joy.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:


32   EXT. STONE CANYON - EVENING.                                 32

     JOHN CLASKY driving a smallish SUV. He is an upbeat,
     talented, successful man with an ego as balanced as a high-
     end watch; who loves his wife, kids and job. In other words,
     watch out, John.

33   EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - EVENING.                                 33

     As John pulls into the driveway next to a catering truck and
     exits his SUV carrying a large wrapped tray..




                                                             19.








34   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - EVENING.                                 34

     As John moves quickly through the downstairs, he puts the
     tray on a counter where food servers are working.

                         JOHN

               I brought some dessert.
     As he moves on, we see in the background the workers unwrap
     and react to a fantastic concoction. A caterer (who we may
     notice looks at him like royalty) falls in beside him and
     whispers to him.

                         CATERER

               She came down to check on the party
               and realized the gardeners hadn't
               finished rolling the sod.

     JOHN'S POV - DEBORAH AND TWO FEMALE CATERERS.

     Deborah is wearing a party dress. They are rolling out the
     last huge cylinder of sod, completing the now beautifully
     manicured backyard. It is hard manual labor involving
     physical strength. The female caterers are complaining that
     it's too heavy but Deborah is undeterred.

                         DEBORAH

                   (to catering women)
               We can do it. Come on.
     She falls over the roll..getting filthy..but it gives and
     they gain momentum...one of the catering women falling down,
     one losing pace.. Deborah,however, gains the upper hand. Yet,
     even while succeeding, she remonstrates herself.

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                   (great exertion)
               Why... do... I... care.. so..
               much.. about.... CRAP?
     And now she wins.. the cylinder of grass rolls all the way
     out and she jumps on the seam in victory. She is dirty,
     spent and triumphant..the components for a solid sexual
     experience..and, in truth, as the exhausted caterers half-
     heartedly applaud the bizarre victory, she has gotten off.
     She looks with mother's pride at the lawn. Then sees John.

                          DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               Can you believe they left without
               finishing?
     As she looks at her handiwork - John looks at her..A
     grin..half laugh.. He loves the dame.




                                                       20.








                    DEBORAH (BREATHLESS) (CONT'D)

          Looks great, huh?.... You're not
          looking.

                    JOHN

          I was getting a kick looking at you
          look at it.
Not the answer she wanted..

                    DEBORAH

          I better get dressed again in case
          anybody's just a half hour late.
She hits a switch at the door and the backyard area is now
fully illuminated -- set up for a dinner party for 20 or
so....all details thought about and done to a "T". This is
the outdoor lighting nobody nails..the twinkling of a half
acre..the path to the pool like a runway to heaven. As she
looks at it all she has a wistful moment.

                     DEBORAH (CONT'D)

              (a replenishing sigh)
          Okay..We're okay here.
              (then)
          Why can't everything be like sod?
          There's no wait, no dung, nothing
          you have to do right and yet it's
          perfect. It covers up all your
          dirt and makes things immediately
          pretty..then, the miracle, if you
          just give it time, it roots and you
          can't tell it from the real thing.
              (a look to her husband)
          No reaction. Nothing to say.

                    JOHN

          Huh? Oh sure..I, uh..Well, no, I
          don't have anything particular to
          say.

                    DEBORAH

          Oh, John why don't you just take
          out a knife and kill me all
          together.
Somewhat crushed, she prepares to exit.

                    JOHN

          How'd you get there..Hey, wait a
          minute..Deb..stop..come on.
              (she turns)
          I'd like to figure this one out.
          What would have been the great
          thing for me to say after you said
          the sod sentence?..Really.




                                                             21.








                         DEBORAH

               That's actually a good question.

                         JOHN

               There you go. I surprise sometimes.

                         DEBORAH

               I would have liked, if after I
               compared the sod to life, if you
               had said, "Exactly!"
     She turns to leave.

                         JOHN

               Yeah. But to say that and mean it
               I'd have to think the same way you
               do.

                          DEBORAH

                    (some sense of mischief)
               It's worth a try...I had something
               else to tell you...it'll come to
               me..

36   INT. OLIVE GARDEN TYPE RESTAURANT - NIGHT                 36

     Standing in a nicely decorated middle class restaurant,
     Cristina, totally bilingual, speaks to the American hostess
     with a pronounced and charming accent as her mother, standing
     beside her, bounces with energy and joy.

                         CRISTINA

               Could we have a table for two,
               please?
     Flor says something to her in Spanish..the daughter waves it
     off and when the mother persists, she translates.

                         CRISTINA (CONT'D)

               We're celebrating.

                         HOSTESS

               Smoking or non-smoking?
     Before her daughter can translate.

                           FLOR

               Dancing!
     The hostess laughs..They are seated at the two ends of a
     banquette and each automatically picks up her place setting
     and "scootches" closely together. Cristina picks up a menu
     and points to the prices.

                         CRISTINA

               Wow, expensive..




                                                             22.







     Flor scoffs -- says she's making six hundred dollars a
     week..then looks at the prices and does a take. The hostess
     returns --- Cristina points to the menu.

                         CRISTINA (CONT'D)

               This is just for the starter?
     Flor, encouraging her daughter's spirit of adventure, places
     her hand over the prices in the menu.

                         HOSTESS

               Uh-huh..And those men would like to
               buy you a drink.
     The daughter translates...the hostess points out the early
     30's, well dressed, quite nice looking businessmen. Flor
     addresses the men who are several tables away. Cristina
     moves uncomfortably but responds to her mother's nudge to
     translate.

                         CRISTINA

                   (to men)
               This is very embarrassing but--
               "what's wrong with you? I'm with
               my daughter for God's sake!"
     Then hostess, Flor and finally Cristina laugh. Cristina
     relishes getting back to ordering from the menu...in a moment
     that is a bit noteworthy..

                         CRISTINA (CONT'D)

               And I would like to begin with the
               Jumbo Shrimp.

37   EXT. STONE CANYON - DAY - 6:30 A.M.                          37

     Flor smiling..enjoying the canyon..as she walks the mile plus
     from the bus stop to work..one of a straggly line of
     domestics. Deborah jogs into view.

                         DEBORAH

               Hi, Flor..See you up there.
     Deborah runs past..She is clearly upset..She is also more
     than a stay-in-shape jogger. She is an athletic woman fueled
     by an ever flickering pilot light of anxiety. This makes her
     seriously quick. She is highly aware of passing
     everybody..She needs to pass everybody..Her voice trails
     behind her as she announces to all as she approaches.."left,
     please," "left," "left."

38   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - DAY                           38

     John enters his son's room..GEORGIE, age 9.




                                                             23.








                         JOHN

               Okay...think SERIOUSLY about
               getting up. You don't have to get
               up yet but are you thinking
               seriously about it?

                         GEORGIE

               Yes.

                         JOHN

               Okay.

39   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY.                           39

     Bernice is making French Toast, doing something novel with
     the filling and the last cooking process. Some great idea
     which will have us making a mental note to try it at home.

40   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - UPSTAIRS DAY - DAY                       40

     John opens Georgie's door again.

                         GEORGIE

               Now?

                         JOHN

               Yes..actual up..
     Georgie gets up..

                         GEORGIE

               Morning, Dad.

                         JOHN

               Yeah, good morning.

                         GEORGIE

               You as mad at me as Mom 'cause of
               what happened?
     John pauses..aware his answer will have repercussions but
     integrity wins.

                         JOHN

               No, Georgie, I'm not.

                         GEORGIE

               Are you mad at me?

                         JOHN

               Uh...okay, no..

41   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - KITCHEN DOORWAY - DAY                    41

     As Flor enters from outside.

                         BERNICE

               Morning, good to see you.




                                                        24.








                       FLOR

             Morning. Good too.
She notices the French Toast.

                          BERNICE

             Try some.
She demurs. Bernice holds out one slice on a spatula,
indicating Flor should just tear a piece off which she
does...One taste and she marvels -- her mouth dropping open
at this kid's ability to make something mundane
special..Bernice laughs.

                          BERNICE (CONT'D)

             Thanks.
Her mother enters on her way upstairs. She is thoughtful,
tense and sweaty - her run having failed to exorcise her
current demon. She greets Flor and then shakes her head,
making a vain attempt to communicate her troubled mood to
Flor in some sort of sisterhood based on life being a fucker.

                          DEBORAH

             Tough day.
Bernice prepares a plate for her mom while, in the b.g., a
GOLDEN RETRIEVER named CHUM approaches Flor from behind with
a ball in its mouth. Flor is checking out the kitchen...
what's in each drawer, etc .....Deborah is impressed by the
self-starter display and indicates same to Bernice.

                       BERNICE

             I had an idea for a breakthrough in
             French toast so I made breakfast. I
             don't want to be teased about it..
             No sarcasm. No tough love. Just try
             it and if by any chance you have a
             positive reaction...

                       DEBORAH

             Right..mean ol' me. I can't play
             right now. I have to do something
             about your brother.

                       BERNICE

             I had an idea for a recipe. When
             has that happened? I got up early
             to do this. At least taste it, for
             God's sakes!
She does..

                       DEBORAH

             Oh, it's good...oh God, it's rich --
             Oh God, it's good.




                                                              25.








                         DEBORAH

                   (sudden alarm)
               By the way, you could do without
               this.
     The approval rug pulled out from under her, Bernice looks at
     her mother. But Deborah is unaware of having hurt her
     daughter because her attention has been diverted so that
     Deborah AND THE CAMERA LOSE FOCUS ON BERNICE as the teenager,
     distraught, moves from the room.

                         DEBORAH (TO FLOR) (CONT'D)

               NO..NO! FLOR!....Never do fetch.
     Chum is nudging Flor with the ball and Flor was about to
     accommodate him by taking it before Deborah's warning shout
     stopped her in mid-sentence.

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               I mean it, NEVER!
     ON Flor's stunned reaction to the outburst.

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               I'm not mad. I'm thinking of you.
               This is me being nice..
     Then using her hands to demonstrate.

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               Just no taking ball from dog.
                   (broadly)
               Trust me on that one.
     CLOSE UP ON Chum going nuts with Deborah's hand passing in
     front of his face ignoring how urgently he offers the ball.

                          DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               You and me. We are fine. Just a
               tip.
                    (she gives her waist a
                     little squeeze)
               Girlfriends.
                    (Flor is totally confused)
               Could you make some coffee? Cafe?

                         FLOR

               Yes.
     Deborah directs her to the most complicated cappuccino
     machine Italian overpriced artists ever devised.

42   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - MASTER BATHROOM - DAY        42

     Deb in the shower...you have never seen so many shampoos,
     conditioners and bath balms...never seen so huge a
     sponge..such fluffy towels.




                                                             26.







     Skylight over the shower allows a beam of God's warmth. There
     is a fireplace in the bathroom. The only significance of
     this being that these people have a fireplace in their
     bathroom. The woman who made it all happen is putting in a
     contact lens..She is upset. We see that she has one blue eye
     and one brown.

                         JOHN

               This isn't an argument, honey.

                         DEBORAH

               Yes. Yes it is. So stop being so
               maniacally calm.

                          JOHN

                   (emphatically)
               No..it's not. Because I understand
               your side.

                         DEBORAH

               I can't be wrong about that too.
               This is a fight. We're having a
               fight. Yo, I feel anger.
     Deborah turns from the sink revealing one brown eye and one
     blue. She blinks, realizes one lens is not in and turns back
     to the sink.

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               Can I have a moment?
     John exits into the..

43   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY                  43

     As John awaits his wife...a beat and she enters with two blue
     eyes. Even though she is attempting reason and self-control
     her voice is filled with tension and goes from loud to
     borderline yelling.

                         DEBORAH

               Okay..Let's get someplace here.

44   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                         44

     As Flor works methodically - orienting herself..she is able
     to hear their totally foreign words and though their volume
     registers on her a bit - basically she remains blithe.
     Loading a dishwasher, memorizing where everything is..

45   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY                  45


     BACK TO SCENE:


                         DEBORAH

               You, mister, are crazy making..I
               can't take this calm thing you've




                                                        27.








                    DEBORAH

          started doing. It's like this is
          your way of letting me know there's
          something deeply wrong with me
          because I'm not calm.

                    JOHN

              (calmly)
          Let's not go all over the
          place..Can't we...

                    DEBORAH

              (shouted burst)
          If you're going to talk to me
          please have the decency to raise
          your voice.

                     JOHN

              (a beat then sudden
               urgency and change of
               tone)
          Let's make a break for it.

                    DEBORAH

          What are you talking about?
He signals her with his eyes and head and then takes a large
but tentative step away from the spot where he was
standing...then additional faster steps. He gestures with
enormous energy for her to follow him to his new spot in the
room. She eyes him suspiciously.

                    JOHN

          Just for a second.
She walks to him...he puts an arm around her shoulder. And
gestures back to where they were standing. He talks in an
almost hushed, conspiratorial voice.

                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          We don't have to be those people.
          Nobody's watching. They've been
          masquerading as us for a while
          here..I'll distract them - you make
          a break for it and I'll meet you
          outside.

                    DEBORAH

          You're ridiculing me because I care
          about this.

                    JOHN

              (firmly)
          No. I'm not. I mean this..let's get
          away from those two in case they're
          as miserable as they look..




                                                           28.








                    JOHN

              (urging..like a Southern
               coach)
          Come on, baby.
He is looking at her with wit and conviction..trying to
squirt lighter fluid at the flame of their love. Deborah
looks up at him..intimacy of a different sort.

                    DEBORAH

          Let me ask you a question..let me
          change the subject..Forget for a
          moment that you won't support me
          with Georgie..

                    JOHN

              (reasonably)
          Well, I don't think...
She makes a noise of frustration to stop him..It   works. John
is rendered still and intimidated by her conduct   but he is
"man" enough for his jaw to set...to pause for a   beat as he
looks her straight in the eye..And walks back to   the spot
they occupied previously.

                      JOHN (CONT'D)

          Go ahead.

                    DEBORAH

          Here's the question. It's been on
          my mind more and more. Do you do
          that calm thing for the purpose of
          infuriating me?

                    JOHN

              (genuinely puzzled)
          What? Why would ...
              (on her exasperated look)
          Why would anyone do something to
          someone they love for the purpose
          of messing them up?

                    DEBORAH

              (unconvinced/distant)
          Okay.
He hates that look of isolation on her face..He needs to make
her feel better.

                    JOHN

          Deb, since high school we've been
          able to read each other...take
          advantage of it..The answer to the
          question is,"absolutely not." Now
          take a look and tell me if you
          believe me.




                                                              29.







     She looks at him..with a finger motion he directs her gaze to
     his eyes..
     CLOSE on JOHN'S EYES.
     Open, smiling, trusting. Trying to get a laugh out of her.

     CLOSE ON DEBORAH'S EYES.

     Studying, questioning, probing, doubting, exhausted...

                         DEBORAH

               I don't.. believe you. I think you
               just want me to feel badly about
               myself..Sorry, honey.

46   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                            46

     John enters - not seeing Flor - goes to the Sparkletts water
     container and fills a cup...He is shaken..

                         JOHN

                   (to himself)
               Great God in heaven save me.
     Boy meets girl.

                         FLOR

               Hi.
     He turns with a start to see Flor smiling at him. Gorgeous
     squared. His first word is inadvertent.

                         JOHN

               Whoa...whoa...I didn't know Deborah
               had found someone... You work here?
               You're going to help with the house
               and kids?

                         FLOR

               Solo español.

                         JOHN

               You work here and you don't speak
               any English at all?
     The sound of feet on the stairs..Deborah and Georgie enter.

                          DEBORAH

               All she has to do is dial 9-1-1 and
               press two for Spanish.
                   (even before she enters)
               Flor...John.
                   (to John enunciating the
                    name)
               This is Flor.




                                                             30.








                         JOHN

                   (pronouncing it perfectly)
               Hi, Flor.
     Deborah reacts, grabs some coffee and pushes Georgie along.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)

                   (to Deborah)
               Look, I'll take Georgie to school.

                         DEBORAH

               No. I'm doing it..show Flor the
               ropes.
     Flor is trying to figure out what's expected of her then
     Deborah gestures impatiently for her to fall into step and
     come with her.

47   EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY                           47

     The biggest, baddest, BLACKEST SUV..there is some subtle
     custom work so the vehicle impacts us in ways we cannot quite
     fathom. Deborah is wiping away a tear as she gets in and
     shares a woman to woman moment with Flor.

                         DEBORAH

               Fuckin' hombres, huh?
     She sniffles. Flor nods uncertainly. A small voice from the
     back seat..Georgie..

                         GEORGIE

               I just didn't want to sing last
               night.

                          DEBORAH'S VOICE

                   (hurt)
               Yeah. Well you said you would..You
               said you wanted to. I asked you
               five times. Then when I have the
               whole party paying attention you
               refused.
     As she puts the car in gear...Georgie sings insanely well.
     But he's just two lines into an old blues standard:

                         DEBORAH

               It doesn't do any good now,
               Georgie.
     She presses a button on her dash and a glass partition comes
     up between front and back seat thereby cutting him off in mid-
     song. Flor is utterly baffled by the notion of putting a
     divider between parent and child. But Deborah is calling for
     her to pay attention to the car's navigation screen.. a
     Spanish voice says, "route guidance system starting."




                                                             31.








                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               I've programmed it for Spanish..
               Look, it will take you anywhere and
               then back home. If you figured out
               how to make coffee on that thing
               it's all downhill.
     The MALE SPANISH VOICE talks about imminent left turns. Flor
     is thrown by the amount of oddness..All the while Georgie is
     singing his little heart out in the back seat. Flor,amused by
     the boy, suppresses a smile...maybe the first time in her
     life she's had to suppress joy. But Deborah never misses
     anything.

                         DEBORAH (TO FLOR) (CONT'D)

               This is stop gap..You, kiddo,
               you're going to have to learn
               English.

48   INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON                  48

     John cooking...the theory that nobody's sexier than when they
     are seen doing what they do best applies here.. In the
     BACKGROUND John's number two, PETER, the Sous Chef, being
     bossy and anal as he organizes his cooking and GWEN, who
     spends most nights trying not to show her enormous affection
     for John. At the moment, John's work is a strange mixture of
     art and cloddishness.....the hands blur with expertise...but
     he keeps dropping items.....each time a Latin kitchen worker,
     ALEX, 20, dives on the spillage..At one point they bump.

                          JOHN

               Sorry...

                         PETER

                   (sharply to Alex)
               Not the best place to stand, fella.

                         JOHN

                   (to Alex)
               No. It's me. You're the new
               helper, huh..

                         ALEX

               I didn't mean to...

                         JOHN

               No..no..it's okay. It's me being
               bugged.
     Two people head for John almost simultaneously. PEG, an arty
     looking woman in her late 50's..wild, scraggly gray hair,
     enters lugging an ice chest and the maitre d'.

                         PEG

               You are going to be so happy..
     The Maitre D' enters.




                                                        32.








                    MAITRE D'

          I have something very important to
          tell you.
John makes a no-brainer of a decision pointing to the woman
who promised happiness. She hefts her ice chest up on the
counter.

                    PEG

          Perfect cod this is John -- John,
          perfect cod..Best one I've seen all
          season and he was swimming twenty
          minutes ago.
The fish is that special, a sentence that kicks out for a
writer, the right brush stroke for an artist. You get it..

                    JOHN

          Knockout.
              (to Alex)
          You want to learn something? You
          want to pack it away?
The kid nods.. he picks up the fish.

                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          Cradle it...Put it in the cooler
          but not on its side.. In the same
          position it swims.
              (important added thought)
          And check the ice pack..make sure
          it can drain away..if it can't the
          chlorine can hurt the flesh. Do all
          that and nobody can put a fish in
          the fridge better than you...and
          that's a solid start.. First day
          and you already did something
          perfect.

                    KID

              (smiling)
          Yes, I understand.

                    MAITRE D'

          Please. Now?

                    JOHN

          Oh, sorry..I forgot.
He whispers in John's ear..

                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          Damn.. "ohhhh damn."

                    PETER

          What, buddy, what?




                                                        33.








                     JOHN

           Victor spotted a food critic..

                     PETER

           From?

                     VICTOR

           The New York Times..I'll bet they
           sent her out just for us.
               (hands John a slip)
           Here's what she ordered.

                     PETER

           Look, if you're nervous take a
           walk..

                     JOHN

           I don't need a walk.

                     GWEN

           I'll walk with you..I know a
           breathing thing.

                      JOHN

           What do you think I'm worried
           about... how I'll cook? That's not
           the problem..
               (looks at slip/then to
                Alex)
           The lady wants fish. Get the fish.
He starts to prepare for cooking.

                     JOHN (CONT'D)

           I worked in a kitchen once in New
           York that got four stars. It was
           like a line formed for the chance
           to become an asshole. People's
           accents changed. The heart went out
           of the place. You understand.

                     PETER

           No.

                      GWEN

               (w/barely understated
                passion)
           I agree with everything you've
           said. I admire you for your
           feelings. I hope to adopt them as
           my own....

ON JOHN.

As he works..Let's be clear here...this is that sequence that
either kicks out or doesn't..no food channel..no simple knife
stuff..something casually brilliant..meticulous...smart and
gifted as he prepares the critic's meal.




                                                             34.







     He is talking quickly..almost to himself.

                         JOHN

               I don't know what to root for.. the
               thought of one star makes me
               nauseous..but with four there's no
               place to go but, "Oh my God, they
               took away a star."
                   (musing)
               Three..three and a half. That's
               what you want..No. Wrong! Three and
               a half you feel disappointed that
               you just missed out on four. You
               know what you want? Three and a
               quarter..
                   (a eureka moment)
               That would be perfect!!
                   (getting off on it)
               It would mean you're good..but
               you're not good enough to feel
               disappointed that you just missed
               out on excellent..but nothing truly
               bad happened, you still got your
               three and a quarter stars. Which
               encourages you to try and
               improve..And you still get enough
               respect so that you can get good
               people to work with you..Business
               is good but not crazy. You're right
               there underneath the radar where
               you get to mind your own business.
               That's a solid life.
     He tastes a sliver of the food dish he is preparing.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)

                   (with professional honesty
                    and some regret)
               Aw, man..this is amazing. No three
               and a quarter here.

49   INT. CLASKY KITCHEN - DAY.                                49

     Evelyn, having a glass of white wine and a sandwich, is
     talking to Bernice in the kitchen also including Flor though
     she is only catching a word here or there..

                         EVELYN

               Well, I'm in the vitamin section
               and this little hip hop
               girl..what's her name..Grammys -
               adorable -- big voice..subtle
               phrasing...oh, she's famous..the
               kids know her...oh - little blue
               shoes..darn me.
     Flor looks concerned over Evelyn's displeasure with herself,
     a fact picked up by the older woman...It is actually a small




                                                        35.







but resonant good-natured, affectionate moment between the
lush and the Latina.

                    EVELYN (CONT'D)

          God Bless the language barrier, it
          keeps you from being bored with me.
Spoken to directly like this, Flor is confused..

                    EVELYN (CONT'D)

          Anyway, she said, "aren't you
          Evelyn Wright?" First of all, that
          she recognized me from the old
          covers and then she .... Oh, please
          her name..it makes the story so
          much better...She said,
              (genuinely stirred)
          "Whenever I think everything is.."
              (aside)
          Pardon my French..pardon her French
              (back to quote)
          "a mother hmmmhmmm...I put on one
          of your records.."

                    BERNICE

          Awwww. How sweet....
Evelyn looks transparently vulnerable for a second. Flor
reacts. Bernie squeezes her grandmother's hand..Flor smiles.

                    EVELYN

          Just such a lovely thing to come
          from the blue....
Deborah enters, carrying a load of packages. With lightning
speed, her eye picks out...the glass her mother is drinking
from.

                    DEBORAH

          Oh, Mother...It's not even noon.

                    EVELYN

              (defensively)
          It's almost two o'clock.

                    DEBORAH

          God, where is this day going...Flor
          could you come with me?

                    BERNICE

          Grandma, tell Mom what happened.

                      EVELYN

                (very deliberately)
          No.




                                                             36.







     Deborah leads the way out...but Flor stops before following
     her out to give Evelyn a gesture of support and appreciation.

50   INT. BERNIE'S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON                          50

     John is in Bernie's room - helping her with her homework.
     They lay at right angles to each other..He is testing her.

                         JOHN

               This is going to work.

                         BERNICE

               I don't know anything.

                         JOHN

               Free your mind...the president
               whose policies many consider
               responsible for the Great
               Depression...

                         BERNICE

               I don't know...

                         JOHN

               Name a vacuum cleaner..

                         BERNICE

               Okay. Yes..thanks.

                         JOHN

               And this vacuum whooshed all this
               money out of everyone's pockets.

                         BERNICE

               Got it. I no longer know nothing.

                         JOHN

               And Hoover was followed in office
               by..

                         BERNICE

               I'm just drawing blanks. I'm
               embarrassed. It's my own fault I
               spent my time on math, which I'm
               lucky if I don't flunk anyway and..

                         JOHN

               The guy we are looking for is not a
               ruse..

                         BERNICE

               What's ruse mean?

                         JOHN

               Phony. So this president was not a
               ruse..He was the real thing.




                                                             37.








                         JOHN

                   (she looks at him blankly)
               Ruse??

                         BERNICE

                   (enjoying her father's
                    absurdity)
               Rusevelt..If I'd ever heard of the
               word before - that would lock it
               in..It's so stupid it might work
               anyway...
     Deborah enters followed by Flor. They are carrying several
     boxes of clothes...

                         DEBORAH

               Surprise new clothes..
     Bernie gasps..As she looks at a sweater..

                         BERNICE

               What'd I do right?

                         DEBORAH

               Warehouse sale..
     Bernice tries on the sweater over her T-shirt..and mirth
     ends..The sweater is tight...Bernice picks up a blouse and
     then skirt and checks the size.

     ON FLOR AND JOHN.

     As they are COUPLED BY THE CAMERA ANGLE as each catches on
     and is dumbfounded.

     ON BERNICE..

     Whose style, wit and grace should not have to be used to
     deflect such trauma. But so be it, as, though mightily stung:

                         BERNICE

               Thanks, mom..I'm glad you didn't
               get here a little earlier or else I
               wouldn't be able to tell you that
               your gift is a ruse. Please, excuse
               me..
     She exits to her bathroom.

51   INT. STAIRWELL - EARLY EVENING                               51

     Flor one step behind John and Deborah who are moving quickly
     down the stairs...John pissed..Deborah feeling the futility
     of anyone understanding her point even as she makes it.




                                                              38.








                         DEBORAH

               She's right between the two
               sizes..I thought about it..what am
               I supposed to do encourage
               her...what is it? - DENIAL? Or
               motivate her to get herself in
               shape.
     Flor tries to slide by..Something surreptitious in her
     behavior..Deborah suddenly turns to Flor.

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               Flor..
     She holds out her hand in a "we women understand" gesture.
     Flor does not waver..just meets her eyes.

                         FLOR

               Me puedo ir?..go..can go?

                         DEBORAH

                   (a bit nonplussed)
               Sure. Go.

                         JOHN

               I'll drive you to the bus stop.
     And that fast they are gone.

52   EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY                           52

     As John gets in his seat..then sees Flor approaching the door
     and hops out to open her door...apologizing as he goes.

                         JOHN

               Sorry. I'm cracking.
     As he moves back to his side of the vehicle.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)

                   (a shout)
               Shiiiiiiit!
     Flor hears this from inside and nods in agreement.

53   INT. JOHN'S CAR - EARLY EVENING..                            53

     As they drive down the canyon. He is wildly frustrated. Even
     if Flor were not there, he would be talking to himself
     anyway, in the manner of bag ladies and all of us.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)

               I am running out of excuses for the
               lady of the house.
     Flor doesn't understand his words...yet fully agrees. But
     then John takes rein of his emotions.




                                                        39.








                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          But you know, you gotta watch out
          for the times you think you're
          absolutely right..But, man, Bernice
          has finals tomorrow. She didn't
          need this one..And just that look
          on her face when she got the gifts--
              (now his voice cracks; he
               grows wet-eyed)
          --like for a second she thought all
          her problems with her mother had
          been solved...
Flor is flabbergasted..she peeks to see if he is actually
crying. At first her heart is touched by John but then there
is distinct disapproval (a real roll of the eyes) that the
macho meter can read that low. He looks at her and she faces
front quickly.

                    NARRATOR

          My mother did not understand her
          male boss. His heart was good and
          he was rare in not flirting with
          her. But they were starkly
          different. Privacy and dignity were
          the same word to my mother.
          Naturally, when she found herself
          sitting next to a man who cried
          over his child's hurt she had no
          idea how to process the event.
Meanwhile, he has stopped for traffic near the end of the
canyon. Flor takes the opportunity to bolt.

                     FLOR

          Gracias.
She opens the door and starts to get out though the car is
still rolling a bit...

                    JOHN

          What are you doing? Let me take you
          all the way.
Reluctantly she re-enters the car..It rolls another ten feet
to her bus stop and she gets out again.

                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          How weird was this ride? Sorry.

                    FLOR

          No es nada.
He doesn't quite know what that means...indicates same in a
little helpless gesture..




                                                               40.








54   EXT. BUS STOP - EARLY EVENING..                             54

     As Flor is dropped off...the goodbye awkward.

                         NARRATOR

               The job was taxing her. She had no
               template for confusion let alone
               frustration.
     While waiting for the bus, Flor suddenly turns and runs a few
     yards...and then back..and waves off the looks from her
     colleagues - many of whom are overweight..many of them
     adorable. All puzzled for the moment as they watch Flor
     unsuccessfully try to shake off her day.

55   INT. FLOR'S APT. - EVENING                                  55

     As Flor enters -- kisses her daughter..distraught and
     distracted. She walks immediately to the refrigerator and
     takes out a chocolate cake and a bottle of milk...she cuts a
     huge slice of cake and puts it in front of her startled
     daughter..in Spanish riding her on being too thin..the
     daughter gestures at her mother's own slim figure.

                         NARRATOR

               It was so unusual for my mother to
               ask my help that I realized
               immediately she was losing her
               battle to be uninvolved with the
               Claskys.
     Flor asks her daughter how to say something in English.

                            CRISTINA

               Try it on.
     Flor asks again in Spanish...trying to find a precise
     phrase.. The nuance important to her.

                         CRISTINA (CONT'D)

               Please try it on?
     Flor knows the word "please"..it's not what she wants...what
     she wants is a way to say, "try it on" in a manner which is
     not a request..or order, but is, rather, friendly and caring.
     Her daughter works on the problem.

                         CRISTINA (CONT'D)

               Just try it on?

                         FLOR

                   (thickly accented)
               Just try it on.

                         CRISTINA

                   (small accent)
               Just try it on.




                                                             41.








                         FLOR

                   (improvement each time)
               Just try it on...just try it on..
     She's got it.

                         NARRATOR

               Our culture embraces fullness in a
               woman. You, the women of the
               admissions committee, as
               intelligent as you are, have no
               idea how casual and complete such
               acceptance is back home, in the
               land of the size 16 bikini.

56   EXT. BUS STOP - NORTH VALLEY - PRE-DAWN                   56

     Flor is the only one waiting. An empty bus stops and she gets
     on.

57   EXT. STREET - NEAR BUS STOP - HIGH SHOT - FIRST LIGHT     57

     As we see Deborah cross Sunset Blvd., overtake and pass two
     UCLA men running at a good clip as Flor's bus stops.

     CLOSE ON FLOR..

     As she strides purposefully up the street.

                         NARRATOR

               This is one of the cultural
               differences between us which I wish
               to explore academically at
               Princeton. American women, I
               believe, actually feel the same as
               Hispanic women about weight.

58   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - EXTREME EARLY MORNING                 58

     The house asleep. Flor walks carefully up the steps.

                         NARRATOR

               ....a desire for the comfort of
               fullness.

59   INT. BERNIE'S ROOM - FIRST LIGHT                          59

     Bernie asleep on the bed...Kleenex abounds...the solid sleep
     earned by a few hours of sobbing. She looks touchingly pretty
     and decidedly round. Flor looks for, finds and carries out
     the new clothes Deborah had given her daughter.

                          NARRATOR

               And, when that desire is suppressed
               for style and deprivation allowed
               to rule...




                                                               42.








60   EXT. STREET - STEEP INCLINE                                  60


     ANGLE ON DEBORAH & KILLER HILL:

     Two young athletic men and one woman considerably ahead of
     her on the steep incline.

                         DEBORAH

               Left..left..

     ON RUNNERS.

     They turn and look confused at Deborah who is so far behind
     them she has no need to pass..They turn away. Deborah
     struggles to turn it on and does so...huffing to just behind
     them where she utters one more strained:

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               Left.
     And then passes.

                         NARRATOR

               ...dieting, exercising American
               women become afraid of everything
               associated with being curvaceous,
               such as wantonness, lustfulness,
               sex, food, motherhood..all that is
               good in life.

61   INT. CLASKY MAID'S ROOM - EARLY MORNING.                     61

     Flor at work on a sewing machine..opening seams, moving
     buttons, even steaming where the buttons have been
     changed..etc.

62   INT. BERNIE'S ROOM - MORNING                                 62

     Flor is in the room...having put the altered clothes back in
     place..Bernie's alarm clock rings..She wakes and sees Flor.

                         BERNICE

               Hey..buenas dias, Flor..
     Flor holds up the new clothes and indicates that they are
     beautiful.

                         BERNICE (CONT'D)

                   (ruefully)
               Yes..Well, taste she has..
     Bernie starts her morning routine..her back to us when:

                         FLOR

                   (damn good English)
               Just try it on.




                                                         43.







Bernie, though her back is to us, does a "take" then turns
grinning.

                    BERNICE

          Hey!!!! When did you learn to...

                    FLOR

              (cutting her off)
          Just try it on..

                    BERNICE

          Too tight..it doesn't fit.
Flor clearly doesn't understand..

                    FLOR

          Just try it on..Hey?!
Flor extends a blouse and skirt.

                    FLOR (CONT'D)

          Just..

                    BERNICE

          Okay. I'll show you..
She steps behind a closet door to try the clothes on,
muttering pessimistically before she does so. CAMERA STAYS ON

FLOR..


                    BERNICE (O.C.) (CONT'D)

          Lovely way to start the day.
          World's most trim Mexican learns
          her first sentence and uses it to
          watch me grrrrunt my way into...
And then....silence...Bernie, open mouthed, steps out wearing
the clothes which fit like a glove. Flor beams..then laughs
at Bernie's reaction as she keeps checking the waist and
looks into the mirror.

INTO MIRROR.

To see Bernie in the foreground as Flor looks on..nods
approval and leaves.

ON BERNIE..

The fit of the clothes is as mystifying as it is nice..she
picks up another shirt..checks the size tag and then studies
it a bit.

CLOSE UP SHIRT..

As Bernie's fingers find the barely visible holes where the
buttons have previously been.




                                                             44.








63   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                            63

     Flor at work..Chum, ball in mouth, comes to her and nudges
     her.

                         FLOR

                   (to dog)
               Lo siento. No.
     Chum, momentarily depressed, walks away..Bernie enters. She
     is a bit overwhelmed -- her voice breaking a bit even with
     one word.

                         BERNICE

               Hey..
     Flor turns..Bernie moves to embrace her.

64   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - DAY - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER              64

     As John comes down the stairs..He looks apprehensive..From
     the den comes the sound of singing..it stops him from going
     out the front door as he turns to check it out.

65   INT. DEN - DAY..                                             65

     John finds Evelyn and Georgie in their night clothes. They
     are singing an old song...something like "LUSH LIFE" -
     something preposterous for a nine year-old boy..but you can't
     knock the quality of the voices..world class. They see him
     and stop.

                         EVELYN

               Every time he has a nightmare, I
               teach him one of my old songs. That
               way the nightmares have a purpose.

                         GEORGIE

               But I don't have to sing it for
               anyone.

                         JOHN

               Right. You're clear on that..

                         GEORGIE

               How many did you sell of this song?

                          EVELYN

                   (embarrassed in front of
                    John)
               He likes to know that stuff.

                         JOHN

                   (to Georgie)
               She was huge.




                                                                45.








                          EVELYN

                Seventy-six thousand..which is
                great for a jazz album.
      They resume harmonizing. As John leaves, the song lyric
      making some comment on:

66    EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - DAY                                      66

      As John, growing tense, walks toward the front gate..Chum
      proffers a ball and accepts defeat as he bends down to pick
      up the New York Times. John's body chemistry launches a
      surprise attack...anxiety and dread...He takes his newspaper
      to a wire bench in the front driveway..He finds the
      section..opens to the page..and just like that his life
      changes forevermore.

67    INT. CLASKY HOUSE - DAY.                                     67

      John enters..Georgie is going up the stairs..Flor putting out
      breakfast food.

                            EVELYN

                You okay?

                           JOHN

                    (strangely)
                I am okay.
                    (to Flor)
                Deborah around?

                            FLOR

                She run.
      John nods and heads upstairs.

                                                                 67A


67A   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - BERNIE'S ROOM - DAY

      He looks in Bernie's room. She is loading her backpack for
      school..

                          JOHN

                Hey, honey.

                          BERNICE

                What's wrong?

                          JOHN

                No..nothing...just that..
      Georgie enters the scene..

                          GEORGIE

                A kid offered me a trade..Let me
                show you.

                            JOHN

                Yeah..




                                                               46.







     He starts to follow him to his room.

                         BERNICE

               Dad!!! He can wait.

                         JOHN

               No..It's okay..

                          BERNICE

               Let him wait..Yours is obviously
               important.

                         GEORGIE

               You don't even know how important
               the trade is..

                         JOHN

               Let me just do Georgie.... Here.
     He hands her the newspaper...

68   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - GEORGIE'S ROOM                          68

     We MOVE with John and Georgie to Georgie's room where he goes
     to his collectibles..He holds up a card..

                         GEORGIE

               He says he'll give me any three
               silvers for him.

                         JOHN

               I don't know...This is the one you
               started with..You really want to
               give up your first card?
     Note: this is an involved discussion on both their
     parts..NOTHING in John thinks it is trivial.

                         GEORGIE

               I know..that's why I needed you.

                         JOHN

               ..this is your favorite..

                         GEORGIE

               I think he'd go higher.

                         JOHN

               But it's not numbers..it's.....
     They are interrupted by a never quite heard before sound of
     exultation..

69   INT. KITCHEN - DAY                                          69

     Flor and Evelyn jolted..they exit to follow the sound..




                                                             47.








70   INT. BERNIE'S ROOM - DAY                                  70

     As they enter holding the paper. She has been smacked in the
     heart by gleeful and prideful emotions...It is disorienting
     for her to experience the rush of pleasure.

                         JOHN

               For God's sake..why did you...

                         BERNICE

               WHY?!!? CRAZY FATHER, WHY?!? Why
               aren't YOU screaming?..

                         JOHN

               I'm getting there..just the stunned
               thing has to get dealt with...

                         BERNICE

                   (reading from newspaper)
               John Clasky, who at 25 made his
               mark on the New York restaurant
               scene when JAMMED lived up to and
               survived its silly name, has re-
               emerged as a young and confident
               veteran taking chances with his
               combinations in so subtle a
               manner.."

                         GEORGIE

               If he gave me six...

                         JOHN

                   (catching her excitement)
               Wait a minute, your sister's
               talking.
     Evelyn indicates to Flor that the good news is about
     John..and so she studies him a bit..

                         BERNICE

               "...beginning with the succession
               of appetizers, each one with its
               own stunning and fully realized
               agenda, is constantly yet casually
               daring."
                   (emotional and earnest
                    aside)
               Ah, Dad...this is so great...
                   (to others)
               Now here's the thing...
     She tears up...Evelyn rubs Bernie's back..looks at Flor and
     taps her heart...Flor indicates she should leave and does.
     Bernice continues reading with a lovely sense of mission and
     moment. John is taken with his daughter's delivery.




                                                             48.








                         BERNICE (CONT'D)

               "Eating at this perfect smaller,
               passionate restaurant inspires
               one's own abandonment of caution.
               To wit: John Clasky is the best
               chef in the United States."

                         JOHN

                   (genuinely enthusiastic)
               Look how great you read it.

                         BERNICE

                   (massive irony)
               Perfect, Dad.
     Evelyn and Bernice hug him..

                         EVELYN

               John..John...Oh, my God you even
               look different to me....

                         JOHN

               What are you talking about?

                         BERNICE

               I wonder what mom will do?

71   INT. BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON                               71

     Deborah is ripping John's clothes off..buttons fly..shreds of
     cloth..John is laughing - happy.

                         JOHN

               What is this?

                         DEBORAH

               I don't know.
     She rips at her own clothes and then exclaims in passion.

                           DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               Oooohhch!

72   EXT. NORTH VALLEY - DAY.                                    72

     Flor walks to the news stand - as if to buy something --
     changes her mind and LEAVES THE FRAME only to RETURN A HALF-
     BEAT LATER where she reads to the dealer from a note.

                         FLOR

                   (heavily accented)
               New York Times..

73   INT. FLOR'S APT. - NIGHT...                                 73

     Cristina, standing, translating the review into Spanish for
     her mother...as she comes to the last sentence.




                                                                49.








                          CRISTINA

                Wow..."John Clasky es el mejor chef
                en Los Estados Unidos..

                          FLOR

                    (easily)
                Ah, bravo...

74   INT. CLASKY MASTER BEDROOM - DAY.                            74

     The Claskys are engaged in sex. John's brief sounds are
     exuberant..they shift position so that Deborah is on top
     BRINGING DEBORAH INTO A CLOSE SINGLE. Suddenly her smile
     fades - she hits the skids.

                          DEBORAH

                Oh, damn it --- what am I going to
                do? Everything seems so surely
                pointless...

     ON JOHN.

     This IS WEIRD. And then the small, distinctive sound of Deb's
     climax...then, in a relatively small voice.

                          DEBORAH'S VOICE

                Okay here...okay there...good,
                good, good.
     She falls off him...an arm across her eyes, lying on her back
     down the bed from him...

     ON JOHN.

     Puzzling over what just happened..a few false starts forming
     his thought...then finally..hesitantly...

                            JOHN

                Hey, Deb?

                           DEBORAH

                    (from the vortex of
                      depression)
                Yeah?
     He scoots to her side.

                          JOHN

                You know, I guess I got used to you
                getting a little blue after
                intercourse...But DURING..??

                          DEBORAH

                Something else I do wrong.
     She grabs something and starts walking toward the bedroom.




                                                             50.








                         JOHN

               You've gotta stop walking away.

                         DEBORAH

                   (turning)
               If I stay, I will say awful things
               to you that I might not even
               mean..You pick.

                            JOHN

               See ya.
     She exits to the bathroom.

75   INT. JOHN'S CAR - DAY.                                    75

     Very upset as he drives. Then comes to the red light at the
     end of the street and sees Flor walking with others. An
     awkward beat as he waits for the light to change and they
     acknowledge each other..the light remains red..she confers
     with another woman.

                         FLOR

                   (to woman)
               Yo leÌ la crÌtica buena.
     The woman tells Flor how to say it in English.

                         FLOR (CONT'D)

                   (parroting woman)
               I read your good review.
     He nods..still the light doesn't change.

                            FLOR (CONT'D)

               It's nice.
     The light changes.

                         JOHN

               Not so far...How you doing?
     The light has changed - cars are beeping..she is about to let
     him go off but realizes he will wait for her answer.

                            FLOR

               I do fine.
     He nods and drives off.

76   INT. RESTAURANT - DAY                                     76

     As he enters....the phone is going off the hook..As he passes
     the maitre d's desk. Their conversation is strangely hushed
     and very, very quick.




                                                     51.








                         VICTOR

               Should I stop answering? We're
               booked for two months solid.

                         JOHN

               No, no, no, no, no....I want to
               keep some walk-in business..I want
               this to stay neighborhood.

                         VICTOR

               Impossible. There would be
               riots..You should hear the
               desperation in their voices..Best
               day of my life.

                         JOHN

               We'll serve a full menu at the bar
               then.

                         VICTOR

               Then where do I put the people
               waiting for a table? It won't work.

                         JOHN

               Do this for me.

                         VICTOR

               There's no way.

                         JOHN

               Do this for me or I'll set my hair
               on fire and start punching myself
               in the face.

                         VICTOR

               Huh?

                         JOHN

               Yeah..you're right...that was an
               unusual way for me to make myself
               understood..But you'll do the bar
               thing?

                         VICTOR

               Yes, of course, John..

77   INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN - DAY                     77


                         PETER

               I need to talk to you.

                         JOHN

               Ah, man..Okay.
     They walk into the cooling room.




                                                             52.








78   INT. RESTAURANT - COOLING ROOM - DAY                      78

     Again there is a kind of strange rapidity to the conversation
     sparked by John..

                         JOHN

               What's up? What's wrong?

                         PETER

               I've gotten a fantastic offer for
               my own place..Everybody wants to
               back me since the paper came out.

                         JOHN

               What's your reaction?

                         PETER

               Honestly? Because I've had this
               very unusual reaction.

                         JOHN

               Yeah.

                         PETER

               I've had a hard on almost all day
               and it won't go away. Like I'm
               riding on the back seat of a bus
               with bad shocks and every other
               passenger is a gorgeous woman with
               a yellow sports top whose leaning
               over. It's like every dream I ever
               had and some even I didn't have the
               balls to dream..

                         JOHN

               So you're considering taking it?...
                   (he looks at him)
               Okay, here's the thing. I can't
               lose you and still keep the hours
               I'm keeping. I can't do my life
               unless I can hold onto you.
                   (sudden thought)
               I think I just gave you an
               incredible bargaining position.

79   INT. CLASKY BEDROOM - NIGHT                               79

     As John and Deborah lay next to each other.

                         DEBORAH

               So you gave away twenty percent of
               the restaurant without talking to
               me about it.

                         JOHN

               Yeah. If I didn't do it - I'd have
               been coming home just to sleep.




                                                             53.








                         DEBORAH

                   (trying to make livid more
                    attractive)
               Remember the other day when you
               asked me the perfect response to
               something I said?...I'm asking you
               now..what would you like my
               response to be to your giving away
               twenty percent of the business
               without asking me?

                         JOHN

                   (with great enthusiasm)
               "You're ma man!"

                         DEBORAH

               Okay! So that would be???

                         JOHN

               My dream response from you, yes.

                         DEBORAH

                   (measured)
               I'm not quite there..Actually, I
               just had this flash that the reason
               women in the old days used to faint
               was to avoid doing acts of violence
               against men.
                   (a beat then)
               And I was all worried about
               figuring out the timing just to
               talk to you about renting a place
               for the summer.

                         JOHN

               Well, I think you got your timing.

80   EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - DAY                                     80

     A man is parked at the gate in an open convertible..He is
     great looking...We HEAR Deborah's excited voice over the gate
     speaker...

                         DEBORAH

               Be right out...

81   EXT. CLASKY DRIVEWAY - DAY..                                81

     As Deborah calls behind her as she opens the door...

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               Mom, you want to come?..the
               realtor's here..Okay, see you
               later.
     She clicks the gate open and walks to the man..perfect 40
     year old great looking surfer sort..Deborah does the very
     slightest of "takes" at his looks..As she gets in..




                                                                54.








                            DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               Hi.

                         REALTOR

               I'm Mike..there's one great rental
               that just came on..so we're
               starting at the top..
     As they pull away...

82   EXT. CONVERTIBLE - DAY..                                     82

     Deborah's hair whips across her face...it's bothersome.

                         DEBORAH

               I'll never be one of those girls
               whose hair blows perfectly in a
               convertible.

                         REALTOR

               Move your seat forward..
     Puzzled, she uses the electric lever and the seat budges
     forward..

                         REALTOR (CONT'D)

               A little more..just..good.
     The Realtor uses his switches and raises his window a
     bit..her window a bit less and monkeys the position of the
     half windows in back...Deborah turns around checking out the
     odd tweaking and then faces forward. Her hair blows perfectly
     and beautifully behind her...

                         DEBORAH

               Oh, you must be trouble.
     On his small laugh...

83   EXT. CLASKY RENTED BEACH HOUSE - DAY.                        83

     As they move toward the house...seeing the beach beyond.

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               Gorgeous, huh..Pretty, fabulous,
               beautiful. What word is the same in
               Spanish?

                            FLOR

               Fabuloso.

                         DEBORAH

                   (taking it as a
                    compliment)
               Thanks.




                                                               55.








84   INT. CLASKY RENTED BEACH HOUSE - DAY.                       84

     As Deborah, Flor and Evelyn enter. They carry boxes of stuff.

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               I don't care if it's a rental..this
               place is getting a fixing.
     She leads Flor to a small bedroom.

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                   (to Flor with gestures)
               This will be yours..
     Flor doesn't understand..certainly doesn't want to.

                         EVELYN

               Did you ask her if she could live
               in?

                         DEBORAH

               Come on...there's no buses from her
               to here. There's no question.
               Double come on...
     Deborah uses her hand as if weighing something momentous like
     the law vs. the bible then with heavy sarcasm.

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               The Barrio - Carbon Beach..The
               Barrio - Carbon Beach. What to do?
                   (to Flor)
               Don't worry. I'm putting nicer
               stuff in here too.
     When Flor gives no indication of anything - just standing,
     somewhat stupefied..Deborah takes her by the hand and leads
     her out.

85   EXT. CLASKY - BEACH RENTAL - DAY                            85

     As they move through a little courtyard area toward the
     street.

                         DEBORAH

               You must learn English. Why won't
               she learn English? I'm going to
               have to learn, "you must learn
               English," in Spanish.

                         EVELYN

               I think Flor is perfect and we
               should do all we can to keep her
               from changing.

                         DEBORAH

               Gee, you took the words right out
               of my mouthay.




                                                             56.








86   EXT. PCH - DAY                                               86

     As she leads Flor along the highway side of Carbon Beach -
     passing houses until she sees a Hispanic man washing
     someone's car in a driveway. Evelyn is many steps back.

                          DEBORAH

                Oh, good. Do you speak English?

                             HISPANIC MAN

                Yes, I do.

                          DEBORAH

                Would you translate for me?
     He looks at Flor..my God.

                          HISPANIC MAN

                Sure...forever.
     He speaks to her in Spanish..a lavish, poetic compliment.
     Flor, in full control, says, in Spanish.."Would you please
     just find out what she wants." Evelyn joins them.

                          DEBORAH

                Wait till I say something before
                you start in..
                    (he looks at her)
                I rented a house here for the
                summer and now she must sleep at
                the house because of the bus
                schedule.
     He translates along with Deborah's speech.

     ON FLOR.

     Stricken. She turns to Deborah.

                          FLOR

                No.. Sorry.

                             DEBORAH

                What? Why?
     Flor talks briefly in Spanish.

                          HISPANIC MAN

                She can't because of her daughter.

                          DEBORAH

                You have a daughter? You have a
                whole daughter you haven't
                mentioned..How old?

                             FLOR

                Twelve.




                                                        57.








                     DEBORAH

              (to Evelyn)
          It's a little crazy that I don't
          know that.
The man translates.

                    DEBORAH (CONT'D)

              (to man)
          Don't translate asides.
The man says in Spanish to Flor.."You work for her?"--Flor
answers, "just tell her that I can't live here." Deborah
doesn't like that the man has initiated more conversation.

                      DEBORAH (CONT'D)

          Hey!

                    HISPANIC MAN

          She can't live here. Her daughter.

                    DEBORAH

          Okay..
              (beat then big decision)
          Her daughter can also live with us
          for the summer..
The man tells Flor..she answers directly to Deborah..

                     FLOR

              (big decision)
          No, sorry.

                      DEBORAH

          Why?
The man asks Flor who speaks in Spanish..

                    HISPANIC MAN

          I don't know. She just doesn't want
          to.

                    DEBORAH

          Will you please just tell me what
          she said.

                    HISPANIC MAN

          She said, "I just don't want to."

                    EVELYN

          If she didn't tell us about her
          child she has to have a deep sense
          of privacy. We can figure out how
          she can still live at home. Hell, I
          don't mind driving her at night.




                                                             58.








                         DEBORAH

               Let's spare the world you on the
               roads.
                   (to Flor)
               Well, what do we do?
     The Hispanic man translates the last sentence. Deborah and
     Flor stare at each other..Deborah's next words are somber and
     have enough body language to transcend the need for
     translation...the jig is up.

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                   (big decision)
               I'm sorry, my friend, this is what
               I need. It's just for the summer. I
               don't want to lose you. But ....
     Flor indicates there is no need to translate. A beat.

                         FLOR

                   (enormous decision)
               Yo vivo aquÌ.

                         HISPANIC MAN

               She'll live here.
     The man says something in Spanish to Flor as she starts to
     walk away and she is thrown enough by the statement to
     actually stumble as she looks back at him...then, before
     Deborah can admonish him.

                         HISPANIC MAN (CONT'D)

               I said, "God protect you from that
               boss."

87   EXT. FLOR'S APT. COMPLEX - DAY                               87

     As Cristina, trying to suppress her grin, skips quickly down
     the stairs moving towards a truck from John's restaurant.
     Flor follows tight lipped - resolved. They each carry many
     clothes on wire hangers. A group of girls on the balcony
     literally cheer Cristina on.

                         BALCONY GIRLS

                   (accented)

               MAL-----I------BU!

     Cristina grins hugely back at them.

88   INT. MALIBU TUNNEL - DAY                                     88

     The two women in the truck and then..

89   INT. TRUCK - DAY.                                            89

     As the truck leaves the tunnel and all is cliffs, sand, and
     waves..Cristina taking it in, unaware that her mother's eyes
     never leave her.




                                                             59.







     She gasps frequently..MAJOR GIANT ORGANIC GASPS OF WONDER AND
     PLEASURE..This is awe as an active physical exercise. The
     MOVING SHOT dramatizes the crossroads of the mother-daughter
     relationship as the TWO SHOT finds Flor becoming first
     blurred then lost as we focus on Cristina exclaiming over
     each new sight.

                         NARRATOR

                   (over this incidental
                    dialogue)
               The first time one sees natural
               beauty which is owned by others
               confounds the senses.. I had never
               imagined the word "money" could be
               associated with anything but the
               anxiety of not having enough. I
               didn't know God had a toy store for
               the rich.

90   EXT. CLASKY BEACH HOUSE - STREET SIDE - DAY                 90

     The truck in the driveway..the women walking through a front
     door into a court yard.

91   EXT. CLASKY BEACH HOUSE - BEACH SIDE - DAY                  91

     Georgie, in a swim suit, talking to CHUM in the manner of
     people trying to excite dogs.

                         GEORGIE

               Who wants to go swimming?..Yes, who
               wants to go swimming?
     The dog goes crazy with excitement -- then, droll for a nine
     year old, Georgie turns to his grandmother (who is sunning
     herself and reading) and addresses her in precisely the same
     way. Evelyn has a drink in hand..

                         GEORGIE (CONT'D)

                   (to grandmother)
               Who wants to go swimming?..Huh..

                         EVELYN

               Not now..But I promise I'll go in
               the summer after next.
     John enters the scene..

                         JOHN

               You want to go swimming?

                         GEORGIE

               Oh yeah, you're off.

                         JOHN

               What do you think, wet suits?




                                                              60.








                         GEORGIE

               Wet suits are for wimps..

                         JOHN

               Yeah, you're right..let me get
               mine..
     Georgie laughs..

                         GEORGIE

                   (to Dad)
               You're good.

92   INT./EXT. HALLWAY / PATIO - DAY                              92

     Behind Flor and Cristina as they move toward the Claskys and
     their destiny....Flor behind her daughter.

     REVERSE - CLOSE ON CRISTINA.

     As her eyes pop on seeing the Clasky beach house.

     VERY CLOSE ON DEBORAH

     As her eyes pop on seeing the stunning twelve year-old enter
     her home, haloed by the sun. Again, Flor less distinct in
     the background.
     Bernice, just outside the open patio door, is putting on a
     shirt over her bathing suit as she looks at Cristina and
     emits a small, prescient moan.

                         DEBORAH

                   (to Flor)
               Look at this child..Flor, you could
               make a fortune at surrogate
               pregnancy....
     Flor looks to her daughter for some understanding of what
     Deborah said..

                         FLOR

               Que?
     Cristina is as nonplussed by the remark as her mother.

                         JOHN

               Hi. I'm John..It's good to see you.
                   (to Flor indicating
                    Cristina)
               Great..

                         DEBORAH

                   (to Cristina)
               Hi. This is my daughter,
               Bernice..I'm Deborah..And out
               there...are Georgie and.




                                                        61.







As she turns to gesture toward her mother and son, Evelyn has
almost reached them ..

                    EVELYN

          I'm so glad to meet you. I'm a fan
          of your mother's.

                    CRISTINA

          I'm Cristina.
As all acknowledge each other Deborah tugs at Bernie's top
which is half tucked in.

                    BERNICE

              (kidding around but right
               on)
          No comparisons, please, no
          comparisons.
Evelyn shoves her granddaughter for the self-
deprecation..Flor says something to her daughter in Spanish.

                    CRISTINA

          My mother says it's best if we get
          out of the way and put our things
          away.

                    JOHN

          Have you ever been to the beach
          here?

                    CRISTINA

          I've never been anyplace but Mexico
          and Texas.....before today.
John goes to a big toy box and opens it up..it is filled with
beach paddles, Frisbees and boogie boards.

                    JOHN

          Here's the most important place in
          the house..grab this stuff whenever
          you want.

                    CRISTINA

              (delighted)
          Thank you..thank you so much.

                    DEBORAH

          Very little accent?

                       FLOR

                 (suspiciously)
          Que?

                    CRISTINA

              (to Flor)
          Sin acento.




                                                                62.







     Her mom, not crazy about the lack of accent to begin with,
     nods.

                           CRISTINA (CONT'D)

                     (to Deborah)
                 Thank you..there's an A.P. total
                 fluency class where they work you
                 pretty hard at sounding American.
     Flor doesn't want her daughter to have an extended
     conversation with Deborah of which she doesn't understand a
     word.

                              FLOR

                 Cristina..

                           DEBORAH

                 Right. Settle in..

                           CRISTINA

                 Thank you. I am thrilled to be
                 here.

93   INT. MAID'S ROOM - AFTERNOON                                 93

     Deborah has re-decorated the room with casual
     brilliance...Flor is tense..distraught...her daughter
     giddy...excited over the sheets, the tv, the pile of
     towels..a chaise..She goes to work on her mother to go
     swimming....wanting her to appreciate the fun element of
     being here...the spirit of the kid such that Flor relents....

94   EXT. BEACH - EVENING                                         94

     Flor and Cristina, two sea nymphs, lit by the floodlights
     from the beach homes.

     OTHER ANGLE.

     John and Georgie in the waves..body surfing...they get to
     shore...John sees the two females..dashing in the water in
     their bathing suits..He remains hidden in a very shallow wave
     as they run in...then once they are in he starts taking off
     his wet suit hurriedly...

     ON JOHN..

     As he suffers the cold -- Georgie enjoying every moment.

95   EXT. CLASKY BEACH RENTAL - DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT                95

     Wave lights still shining..On a dune sits Cristina, looking
     out.

                            DEBORAH

                      (in a loud whisper)
                  Hey, Cristina...hey...hey..What are
                  you doing up?
     Cristina looks around -- then up..

                            CRISTINA

                  Oh, hi..so beautiful..I was just
                  excited.

                            DEBORAH

                  I know..Would you believe I had to
                  talk my husband into this?
                      (no reply/then more
                       pointedly)
                  Would you believe I had to talk my
                  husband into it?...do you hear me?

                            CRISTINA

                  Yes...I just ..
                      (awash..a shy laugh)
                  I didn't know what to say?

                            DEBORAH

                      (still calling down)
                  Do you want to come with me? -- I'm
                  going to the flea market.

                            CRISTINA

                  I don't know what that...

                            DEBORAH

                  It's the Rose Bowl... miles, actual
                  miles, of great things for sale for
                  God's sake...We can have brunch in
                  Pasadena.

                            CRISTINA

                  I don't want to wake my mother so
                  early.

                            DEBORAH

                  I'll leave her a note...I'll

     As Flor wakes..looks around.

                              FLOR

                  Cristina?
     She goes to Cristina's bed...atop the bed is a note. She
     picks it up.

     INSERT..THE NOTE

     Dear Flor,




                                                             64.







     I decided to steal your daughter for a bit.

     LOVE,


     DEBORAH

     With great energy born of bottled fury, Flor begins to go
     through her daughter's things...finding her backpack and
     extracting a Spanish/English dictionary.

     INSERT DICTIONARY.

     As her finger points to:
     "Steal...robar"
     And then she flips some pages feverishly..Her finger
     indicating:
     "daughter .... hija"

98   EXT. PCH - EARLY AFTERNOON.                                 98


                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               Stop thanking me. I love having the
               company.

                         CRISTINA

               It was an adventure which I'll
               remember.

                         DEBORAH

               Your English is genius. Do you
               dream in Spanish or English?

                         CRISTINA

               Just recently I've had a dream in
               English.

                         DEBORAH

               What was it?

                         CRISTINA

               I am so sorry. I -- uh..I'd ..I uh,
               can't tell ..This is so
               uncomfortable.

                         DEBORAH

               You could have just said you didn't
               remember.

                         CRISTINA

               I, uh, guess so..but I do.

                         DEBORAH

               Look who's sensational.




                                                              65.








99    EXT. CLASKY RENTED BEACH HOUSE - DAY.                        99

      Evelyn is sitting on the patio making sangria..Flor enters.
      She is pissed.

                          EVELYN

                What's wrong?
      She shows her the letter. Evelyn reads it and hands it
      back..She is about to offer something..Flor waves it off and
      enters the house..John comes in from the beach with his
      kids..boogie boards...Evelyn hands him the letter..

                          EVELYN (CONT'D)

                She's wild-eyed over this..
      John moves after Flor as Bernie reads the letter..

                           BERNICE

                Aw, shit..
                    (then quickly)
                Sorry about the word, Georgie.

                             GEORGIE

                It's okay.

                          BERNICE

                You want to know what happened?

                          GEORGIE

                No thank you.

100   INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY                                   100

      John enters..

                          JOHN

                Hey, Flor..
      She turns..

                          JOHN (CONT'D)

                I'm sorry..very sorry..
      He indicates his watch -- then holds his fingers together.

                          JOHN (CONT'D)

                They should be back soon..
      Flor starts to cry. She sits in a chair..He sits not far from
      her.

                          JOHN (CONT'D)

                Hey, Flor..
      Embarrassed, she says, in Spanish, to please leave her
      alone..she turns from him..He walks to the wet bar and gets a
      bottle of water...pours some..Her crying soft in the

background...He walks to her, sits near her and offers her
the glass of water which she takes.

                      JOHN (CONT'D)

            Deborah made a mistake. I
            understand how you feel...Do you
            understand me at all, generally? Is
            simpático the word?
He pats her on the back..She looks at him..

CLOSE ON FLOR..

Is he coming on?..

HER POV..

His kind eyes.

FULL SHOT..

This is real eye contact..two vaguely humiliated people
finding real company for an instant. Without thought, she
duplicates his gesture and pats his back.

                      FLOR

            Simpático, yes.
And when he seeks to add another pat, he misses, because she
is out of her chair..(This is as intimate as John has been
with another woman since he was married..) He calls out to
stop her.

                      JOHN

            Un momento, huh?
She stops and turns to him.

                      JOHN (CONT'D)

            I'm really sorry this is happening.
            I just want you to know that. I am
            real sorry.
He taps his heart as an indication of sincerity -- then a
flash of worry that he has inadvertently come on to her.

                      JOHN (CONT'D)

            I didn't mean..
He makes a gesture of ardent love..

                        JOHN (CONT'D)

            I meant..
Makes a person to person innocent gesture..She finds herself
smiling.




                                                              67.








                          JOHN (CONT'D)

                Well, the good thing about being an
                idiot is that every once in a while
                you cheer people up..Got to get to
                work.

      CAMERA STAYS WITH FLOR

      As he exits...thinks about John's demeanor, smiles again,
      shakes it off as her mind fills with concern for Cristina.

101   EXT. CLASKY RENTED BEACH HOUSE - SUNSET.                    101

      Deborah's SUV loaded at the curb..She and Cristina begin to
      carry things in...(NOTE: Cristina's hair has been restyled.)

102   INT. CLASKY RENTED BEACH HOUSE - DAY                        102

      Evelyn, Bernie and Flor are gathered in the living room. All
      staring at her.

                          DEBORAH

                What? Something bad happen?

      ON CRISTINA..

      Enormously anxious on reading her mother's mood.

                          DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                Cristina, tell your mother I just
                played around with your hair..she
                can put it back..no hurt feelings.

                          CRISTINA

                Not right now.
      Flor puts an arm around her shoulder, leading her off and
      speaking to her forcefully in Spanish.

                           DEBORAH

                What? --

                          EVELYN

                You can't just take someone
                else's.....

                          DEBORAH

                Nuh-uh, Mom..don't go there..or
                I'll go there and you know where
                "there" is.
      Evelyn stops on a dime. She leaves. Deborah crosses to
      Bernice, who is highly concerned about Flor, and puts an arm
      around her. A pleasant surprise..




                                                                 68.








                            DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                  Can you believe what Flor is making
                  this into..Shoot me if I ever get
                  that hard to deal with.
      Bernice, unseen by Mom, does a long, muted, mock scream.

103   INT. FLOR'S ROOM - EVENING                                  103

      MUSIC IN: Action, purpose, energy.. Flor is dictating in
      Spanish as Cristina writes it down in English on a pad.
      Cristina enormously uncomfortable.

      INSERT - THE PAD.

      The pad, in effect, lends subtitles to Flor's words. Cristina
      winces with the words she records even while punctuating
      perfectly.

                            PAD WRITING

                  You cannot take my child without my
                  permission..And, if you had asked
                  me I would not have given
                  permission. Is this why you did not
                  ask? Because you knew this. You
                  have no rights over my private
                  life.

      ON FLOR..

      Reaching a decisive conclusion.

                            PAD

                  If you have any disagreement with
                  this, I no longer wish to work
                  here.

      ON CRISTINA'S LOOK

      This is awful news.

      ON FLOR.

      For a decisive nod of affirmation. She adjusts her daughter's
      hair to the way it was, takes the note and exits.

104   INT. CLASKY RENTED BEACH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY          104

      Flor enters in something of a fury and holds the letter out
      to Deborah, who hates being cornered in this manner. She
      actually places her hands behind her so as to avoid the note.

                            DEBORAH

                  What's this?
      Flor shakes the letter at her.

      OTHER ANGLE..





                                                                69.







      Showing Cristina hidden but looking on... like a stage
      prompter in the wings.

                           FLOR

                For you.

                           DEBORAH

                From?
      Flor with enormous emphasis stabs her finger at her own
      chest.

                          DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                You are not yourself...This was
                written in anger. You sleep on it
                and then if you still want me to
                have it -- fine..I don't think you
                will once calm and rational thought
                returns. Just sleep on it.
      Deborah exits to a bathroom and closes the door...leaving
      Flor in the hall with the letter..Cristina reveals herself
      and explains the situation to her mother. The last word we
      hear before scene's end is "mañana."

105   INT. CLASKY RENTED BEACH HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING         105

      Deborah surreptitiously finishing putting on her running
      clothes and is making for the door when the alarm clock goes
      off and John awakens.

                          JOHN

                She didn't even want us to know she
                had a daughter - then, on the first
                day, you take the kid without
                asking. I think that's...

                          DEBORAH

                    (starting to lose it)
                What!?! Insensitive? Elitist?
                Irresponsible? Perverse? Dizzy?

                          JOHN

                    (slow and emphatic)
                Dumb.
      She looks at him...He has been atypical...Her immediate
      emotional cocktail is panic, fury and deep, deep hurt. Her
      words are slow...her voice ragged...

                          DEBORAH

                When is anyone in this damn house
                or this damn life going to consider
                my feelings? I just tried to make
                a lovely kid feel welcome. There's
                no reason to rake it over...I let
                it go..and gave Flor the room to
                let it go. Which I'm sure she has!
                It's over!! So get on board.




                                                              70.







      She opens the door and almost runs into Flor who is standing
      immediately in her way holding the letter.

                           FLOR

                I slept.

106   INT. CLASKY BEACH RENTAL - DEN - DAY                     106

      Deborah stands over Cristina, who is writing in Spanish a
      note Deborah is dictating. As John passes through the room.

                          DEBORAH

                I am deeply and sincerely sorry to
                have upset you. Especially in
                light of the deep connection, as
                women, I believe us to have.

                          EVELYN

                    (sotto to John)
                And to think I was worried about
                Flor living here with her kid?

107   EXT. CLASKY BEACH RENTAL - PATIO                         107

      John is talking to all three kids in an effort to lift the
      overall atmosphere. IN THE BACKGROUND we see Deborah handing
      Flor her letter..Cristina taking sidelong glances...relieved
      to see them shake hands (Flor engaging), hug (Flor
      reluctant).

                          JOHN

                So here's the idea..I want to make
                a serving platter for serving fish
                using sea glass like this..
      He holds out some sea glass.

                          JOHN (CONT'D)

                I used to hunt for this stuff every
                free minute when I apprenticed in
                Italy. This is bits of broken glass
                that the ocean sand blasts over the
                years..great looking, huh? So you
                guys go hunting and I'll pay 50
                cents for any piece, a dollar for
                anything as big as this and five
                dollars for any color that isn't
                brown, clear or green.

                          GEORGIE

                Do we have to do this?

                          BERNICE

                    (to Georgie)
                Oh, come on...
      Georgie and Bernice start off..




                                                                 71.








                          JOHN

                Come on, Cristina - go get em.
      Her eyes widen and off she runs, intoxicated with being
      included and having the chance to make money.

108   EXT. BEACH - DAY - VARIOUS SHOTS                            108

      The kids combing through pebbles.
      Georgie becoming bored and stopping..
      Bernie stopping.

109   EXT. BEACH - SAME SCENE - SUNSET..                          109

      Lots of people on their decks..hot-tubbing, sunning,
      partying..rich people forming New Yorker cartoons in the
      background as Cristina continues to doggedly collect her sea
      glass. At one point, she comes upon a teenage couple making
      out near a mass of pebbles, and politely asks them to roll
      over so she can search the area.

110   INT. FLOR'S ROOM - PRE-DAWN                                 110

      Cristina arising..

111   EXT. BEACH - PRE-DAWN..                                     111

      Cristina collecting sea glass.

112   EXT. BEACH - SAME SCENE - NIGHT.                            112

      Illuminated by the surf lights of the beach homes, Cristina
      plugs away.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


113   EXT. CLASKY'S RENTED BEACH HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON.          113

      John exits his door and steps to his car..as he is about to
      get in..

                             CRISTINA'S VOICE

                Excuse me.
      He looks up and steps around to where she is...there is a
      battered wood table along the side of the house.

                          JOHN

                Hi..what's doing?
      She overturns a large bucket and a small mountain of sea
      glass spills on the table.

                             JOHN (CONT'D)

                I'm broke.




                                                     72.








                    CRISTINA

              (feeling horrible)
          No..you don't have to pay..I'm
          sorry. Don't worry, please.

                    JOHN

          No. I'm kidding..Instead of a
          platter -- I'll just build a sea
          glass building and serve fish
          inside... Great, Cristina..Why
          don't you count it and..

                    CRISTINA

          I have... Many times..I didn't
          sleep. I counted.

                    JOHN

          So what's the damage...total?
Her eyes locked on his.

                    CRISTINA

              (dead serious)
          It depends on whether you consider
          these four a color other than
          green, brown or clear..
She takes them from her pocket.

                    JOHN

          Well, this one is borderline.

                     CRISTINA

          I agree.

                    JOHN

          Oh my God, you found a blue..Nobody
          finds a blue..You know how a blue
          happens? I mean, before the ocean
          blasts it for 30-40 years. Somebody
          had to throw away an old Milk of
          Magnesia bottle. You know what Milk
          of Magnesia is?

                    CRISTINA

          Unfortunately.
He smiles broadly. The kid's a trip. He likes her.

                    JOHN

          So how much for the whole deal?

                    CRISTINA

              (unable to look at him)
          Eleven hundred and one dollar.
He reacts..then..




                                                                73.








                          JOHN

                Okay. We'll finish dealing with it
                when I get home from work.
      She gasps..

114   INT. FLOR'S ROOM - ONE A.M.                                114

      Flor asleep -- Cristina awake, alert..footsteps. She hears
      John enter. She moves slowly so as not to awaken Flor.

115   INT. HALLWAY - ONE A.M.                                    115

      As she enters from the back room and sees that John is
      walking into the kitchen. Her eye goes to the hall table on
      which there sits a fat envelope with her name on it.

116   INT. CLASKY BEDROOM - ONE A.M.                             116

      John enters the bedroom to find a note from Deb that she will
      be late. He is disappointed.

117   INT. FLOR'S ROOM - NIGHT - ON CRISTINA                     117

      Not aware of being observed..opens the envelope and takes out
      a thick wad of cash..almost swoons..as she goes about hiding
      it..she is jolted by her mother's whispered incredulity...

                             FLOR

                Cristina..
      She turns...the wad of money in her hand..

118   INT. POCKET KITCHEN - LATE NIGHT                           118

      The best chef in America has just fixed himself a snack as a
      salve to his spirits. It's a little like Dagwood Bumstead as
      a culinary genius..This is a snack we will remember and
      copy...John is approaching a perfect moment...and this is a
      guy who appreciates simple pleasures to the fullest...

119   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM                            119

      He carries the brilliant snack to the living room and is just
      about to take his first bite when he hears emotional Spanish
      voices approaching. He looks up.

      ANGLE ON FLOR AND CRISTINA

      As they enter. Cristina translating her mother's words.

                          CRISTINA

                My mother wishes me to represent
                exactly what she says, nothing
                else.




                                                         74.







And so, for the remainder of the scene, Flor will speak in
Spanish and Cristina will not only translate but render her
mother's emotion, sometimes including body language. It is
not only a translation but a reenactment.

                    CRISTINA AS FLOR

          May I talk to you?

                    JOHN

          You mean your mother....
Cristina nods...not comfortable breaking the rule of only
speaking for her mother...She faces him, her back to Flor.

                    JOHN (CONT'D)

              (looking at Flor)
          Sure you can talk to me..
Cristina begins translating as her mother speaks in Spanish..

                    CRISTINA AS FLOR

          I don't have to sleep first?

                    JOHN

          What's wrong?
Flor waves the money..Cristina waves an empty hand as she
speaks for her mother.

                    CRISTINA AS FLOR

          Did you give this money to my
          daughter?

                    JOHN

          I made this little deal..with all
          the kids to...

                    CRISTINA AS FLOR

              (interrupting)
          Please..
Flor advances on him past her daughter so Cristina now
translates from the background.

                    CRISTINA AS FLOR (CONT'D)

          You don't tell or ask the mother
          when you give a child a fortune for
          looking on the beach for
          stones..what is the word for this..

                       JOHN

          Sea glass?
On hearing the translation of "sea glass" an exasperated Flor
turns so that her back is to John as Cristina admonishes him.




                                                           75.








                      CRISTINA AS FLOR

            No..not a name for the stones..a
            name for the act..what you did..

ON FLOR..

As she spits out the word to her daughter.

                        FLOR

            EngreÌdo.

ON JOHN..

As his eyes shift to Cristina fearing the word he will hear.

                      JOHN

            Oh, no..engreÌdo's going to be
            rough.

ON CRISTINA..

Reluctantly taking the emotional stance of her mother to
deliver the word.

                      CRISTINA

                (briefly being herself)
            It's hard to translate.
She takes half a beat..finds the word and now spits it out.

                        CRISTINA AS FLOR

            Smug.
John gets up and takes a conciliatory step toward Flor so
that now Cristina is in the middle looking up at them as she
translates for John

                      JOHN

            I had no idea it would amount to
            that kind of money..I thought ---
            sort of tops fifty dollars.

                      CRISTINA AS FLOR

            Fifty dollars is a lot of money..

                      JOHN

            Okay. Right.
He has no idea where to take it from here -- the two females
look as he searches for the right thing to say..

                       JOHN (CONT'D)

                (sighing to himself)
            Ah, shit..
That fast Cristina translates.. Before Flor can react. John
talks directly to Flor..quiet,compassionate, a bit beaten.




                                                           76.








                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          I'm sorry....I get why you are
          upset. It might not look it but I
          am good at getting things. Doing
          something about it is something
          else..I was going to talk to you
          before I actually gave her the
          money..but maybe I should have
          checked before I started the whole
          thing.
              (he smiles/they don't)
          I know what it's like when you feel
          your kid is being messed with..I
          get the message. It won't happen
          again. It's late..I'm sure we'd all
          like...
Flor lets it out...her daughter hard pressed to keep up.

                    CRISTINA AS FLOR

          To what..sleep? If this was small
          enough to be helped by some little
          apology, I would be a fool to bring
          it up..I need to say more no matter
          what the result. I need to be
          impolite. You leave someone else's
          child alone. It's simple, no? It
          is too easy for children to feel
          contradictions..It encourages
          questioning their parents..and that
          makes them less safe. Your wife
          takes her for rides and changes her
          hair..You give her money. Here..
              (this next sentence
               Cristina translates with
               alarm and adds her own
               question mark.)
          Take back the money????????????
Flor hands John the envelope under her daughter's wrenching
gaze. They begin to exit..but Flor turns inadvertently
bumping into her daughter. Her voice softens.

                    CRISTINA AS FLOR (CONT'D)

          I did not mean to be angry to you -
          only emotional..
They turn to leave. John speaks with sudden volume and
muscle.

                    JOHN

          What about hypocritical?
Cristina turns back..confused..her mother asks her for a
translation and she complies.. Flor then wearing the same
confused expression.




                                                        77.








                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          Yeah, you heard me. It's not like
          you didn't do the same thing...

                      FLOR

                (hard on the translation)
          No!

                    JOHN

          Oh, yes. So go lecture
          yourself..you won't need a
          translator for that one...I mean
          what am I lately... A recycling
          bin?..just anyone dump in your
          garbage and hope I make something
          useful out of it...
Flor is confused and getting pissed but he is moving now and
pointing a finger at her.

                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          Yes, you did the same thing...you
          think I didn't know about altering
          those outfits for Bernie..She tells
          me her stuff....So, am I missing
          something? Is there a real
          difference between that and what
          you are complaining about?
Cristina waits for a comeback from her mother to
translate..but doesn't get one..Instead her mother is a bit
mortified and considerably humbled..the pie smack into the
face.

                    FLOR

          Sin diferencia. Yo interferÌ.

                    CRISTINA AS FLOR

          No difference. I interfered.

                    JOHN

          Okay......I'm still not sure I did
          the right thing keeping it to
          myself. It felt disloyal to
          Deborah..but my daughter really
          needed someone to be kind to her
          right then..so..so.

                    CRISTINA AS FLOR

          I am very embarrassed. You are very
          right. Hypocrisy..yes.




                                                        78.








                    JOHN

              (something strikes him, he
               softens, disoriented)
          I'll tell you, it's pretty wild to
          say something and have the other
          person just concede the point. I'm
          dazed here.

                    CRISTINA AS FLOR

          I will leave whenever it is good
          for you and...

                    JOHN

          No..no..come on, man..

                    CRISTINA AS FLOR

          But how can I work for you after we
          talk like this?

                    JOHN

          You can't quit even if you want to
          and you know why.

                    FLOR

          No..

                    JOHN

          Yes, you do..
Flor is worried as John looks right at her..Is he coming on?

                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          Because then Cristina will blame
          herself for costing you the
          job...and that guilt...I don't know
          if you know about guilt..
Cristina doesn't have to check with her mother on this one.

                     CRISTINA

          Culpa, guilt, sÌ. We know. We are
          Catholics.

                    FLOR

              (after her daughter's
               translation)
          Culpa, si..Por Dios, Si.

                    CRISTINA

              (on her own)
          We know.

                    FLOR

              (big nod)
          We know.
John gestures that there is nothing to be done. Flor nods.




                                                              79.








                          JOHN

                So, welcome back.
      She smiles..gets up..extends her hand..they shake.

                          FLOR

                Good night, Mr. Clasky..

                          CRISTINA

                Good night As they exit..their
                backs to John, daughter following
                mother...Flor speaks to her
                daughter.

                          FLOR

                    (an aside)
                No te puedo tener haciendo esto por
                mi. Ahora tengo que aprender
                inglÈs.

                          CRISTINA AS FLOR

                    (over her shoulder to John
                     as they move)
                I can't have you doing this for me.
                I must learn English now.

                          FLOR

                No, dije eso por ti - no por John.
      That translates to "No, I meant that for you, not John." But
      Cristina does not translate the line. Nor..

                          JOHN

                You have a wonderful mother.

                          FLOR

                Que?

                          CRISTINA

                Nada.

120   INT. FLOR'S ROOM - NIGHT                                 120

      A Spanish commercial for learning English in a hurry is on
      television..Flor on the phone ordering it..

                          NARRATOR

                Learning English would cost five
                hundred and ninety nine dollars
                down and 15 monthly payments of one
                hundred and ten dollars...which
                represents 48 percent
                interest..Mexicans marketing
                Mexicans. But not a penny was
                wasted.




                                                                80.








121   EXT. MAIL BOX - DAY                                        121

      As Flor takes a package from the box.

                          NARRATOR

                My mother showed an extraordinary
                facility for learning the language.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


122   INT. BEACH HOUSE - LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY                      122

      Flor listening to the tapes as she does laundry.

                          NARRATOR

                ..as well as a totally committed,
                obsessive work ethic, which blocked
                out all else..She was her
                daughter's mother.
      As Flor silently mouths some English while listening to a
      tape,Chum nudges her with a ball and, without thinking, she
      takes it from his mouth and tosses it..Realizing, with alarm,
      a beat too late that she has broken the rule.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


123   EXT. BEACH - LATE AT NIGHT                                 123

      Flor sitting on the sand...listening to her
      tapes..continually forced by Chum's obsessive persistence to
      throw him the ball.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


124   EXT. BEACH HOUSE - LATE NIGHT                              124

      As John arrives...He bumps the walls on entering.

125   INT. BEACH HOUSE - LATE NIGHT                              125

      As John enters the house, clearly drunk.   There is the sound
      of skittering paws as CHUM approaches.

                          JOHN

                    (cheering)
                Hey, boy, I can use some up
                company.
      But Chum feverishly digs his snout against a nearby piece of
      furniture and retrieves a tennis ball and rockets away. John
      follows, weaving a bit.

126   INT. BEACH HOUSE - DEN - LATE NIGHT                        126

      As John enters the room to find CHUM proffering the ball to
      Flor who is watching one of video language tapes. She tosses
      the ball without a look or a thought..then starts when she
      sees John standing there. He cheers, seeing her predicament.




                                                        81.




When she speaks English, at this point, her words are
halting.

                    JOHN

          You gotta do something about
          Chum..Your arm's going to go.
She waves it off and hurries to get her tape and get out of
his way. Chum complicates the task, proffering the ball. Flor
wearily throws it.

                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          Don't you sleep anymore?

                    FLOR

          No..You get more if you keep at it.

                    JOHN

          You're doing fantastic.

                    FLOR

          Now I am like a three year-old.
          Your wife go out.

                    JOHN

          She say where?

                    FLOR

          No.
              (on his reaction)
          Sorry.

                    JOHN

          Listen..I just forgot she was going
          out..don't be a smart ass.
              (jolted by his own remark)
          Uh-oh..well, you and I communicate
          mostly in apologies anyway..I'm
          sorry. I should be whipped. I
          should be stoned- it's been a while
          - I meant to say, I think, don't be
          smart, don't be kind, don't be
          sensitive, don't be beautiful. I
          meant to say, "hi, Flor, good night
          Flor..that show you're watching is
          going to be a hit."
He staggers out. Flor watches his lonely back for a beat and
then urgently gestures Chum to join him. Chum is reluctant,
but relenting, runs and accompanies his appreciative master.
Flor, now alone, finds herself staring at a framed picture of
John in the den. He is younger and smiling. She studies the
picture and then blinks when she realizes her own emotion and
purposefully goes back to her lessons.




                                                              82.








127   EXT. P.C.H. - LA SALSA FAST FOOD PLACE - DAY.            127

      Cristina and Bernice waiting in line at the Mexican fast food
      place on P.C.H. with the towering signature Mexican male
      figure on its roof. Deborah is parked curbside in the SUV.

                          BERNICE

                How'd you get your mother to let
                you go with my mother?

                          CRISTINA

                Well, your mother just said she
                could use my help on a few errands
                while you're in class...
      Bernice nods. Then unconsciously moans.

                          CRISTINA (CONT'D)

                What?

                          BERNICE

                No. Just that I hate summer school.

                          CRISTINA

                Why do you go then?

                          BERNICE

                    (looks at her)
                I'm not sure I can explain to you
                the concept of not doing well in a
                class..in this case math...and the
                system kind of insists on the
                illusion that you've learned math --
                so they make you go to summer
                school..It helps them avoid facing
                that they have failed in their
                mission.

                          CRISTINA

                What do you mean they failed?

                          BERNICE

                Joking.

                          CRISTINA

                Oh. I see. Forgive me, I don't have
                a real sense of humor.

                          BERNICE

                    (looking skyward)
                Thank you, God.
                    (on Cristina's reaction)
                Joking...

                          CRISTINA

                The joke is?




                                                                83.







      As they get in the car..Bernice doing a little stutter step
      offering Cristina the front seat..Cristina demurs.

128   INT. SUV - DAY.                                            128

      As they get in..Deborah privy to the conversation now.

                          BERNICE

                That you're better at everything
                than I am...and I was thanking God
                for there being this one thing
                where I might have my nose in
                front.
      Deborah can't think of what single thing Bernice could
      possibly feel superior about. She is genuinely puzzled.

                          DEBORAH

                And that thing is???
      Bernice deeply resents the question..She turns to her mother.

                          BERNICE

                Sexual experience..
      Cristina laughs.

                          BERNICE (CONT'D)

                    (ruefully to self)
                That one even she knows is funny.
      Cristina gives Bernice an appreciative push from behind.
      Deborah, for some reason, feels she deserves credit for their
      connection.

                          DEBORAH

                Look at you girls.

129   INT. BEACH BEDROOM - DAY                                   129

      Deb working an outfit..her mother eyeing her..

                          DEBORAH

                Cristina's already read, on her
                own, everything on Bernice's summer
                reading list..And she's two grades
                behind..Imagine if she went to
                Bernice's school..And they'd kill
                to give her a scholarship.

                          EVELYN

                Talk to Flor...

                          DEBORAH

                    (sarcastic)
                Yeah..she's so open to new things.




                                                              84.








130   EXT. GORGEOUS PRIVATE SCHOOL -DAY.                          130

      Deborah and Cristina standing in a grass bordered parking
      lot...Deborah, feigning upset, tearing into her bag but her
      focus is elsewhere as she periodically looks off. She is
      clearly stalling.

                          DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                Can't find my keys..
      Another woman, ARLENE FOLSOM, calls to her..

                             ARLENE

                Deborah...

                          DEBORAH

                    (acting surprised)
                Hi, Arlene..
                    (to Cristina)
                Come on.
      They walk to greet Arlene.

                          DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                Hi. This is Cristina..the girl I'm
                always raving about..This is Arlene
                Folsom..the school director.

                             ARLENE

                Hi..

                          CRISTINA

                    (Barbara Boxer couldn't do
                     it better)
                Hello..a pleasure to meet you, Ms.
                Folsom. I couldn't believe how
                beautiful the grounds were as we
                drove in. I just think the balance
                of the buildings to open ground is
                so wonderful and must have been
                very difficult to achieve.
      Deborah smiles with pride at the elegant first impression
      Cristina is making..all are grinning...the two adults
      suspiciously so...sharing their delight.

                          ARLENE

                Would you like a little tour?

      MOVING CAMERA..

      First showing Cristina in foreground and her POV of this Drop
      Dead Gorgeous Rich Kids School in the background and then we
      MOVE CLOSER ON CRISTINA. We see lust in her reaction.

                          NARRATOR

                The experience was literally mind
                boggling. My mind did boggle. My
                cranial cells stunned. Even if I
                had enough sense of wonder to
                imagine such a school existed; my
                sense of fairness made it
                unthinkable that any school could
                offer this much more than my own..

131   INT. BEACH LIVING ROOM - DAY                             131

      This is the last day of the summer rental - many packed
      cartons on the floor. Deborah, Flor and Cristina engaged in a
      momentous conversation..(NOTE: Throughout the following, and
      quite beside the point, we see Flor periodically make the
      motion of throwing the ball. But we do not cut to Chum,
      rather we just hear his claws skittering after the ball as we
      maintain focus on the momentous conversation.)

                          DEBORAH

                Nuh-uh, Flor you are not pinning
                this one on me. I've got to finish
                packing up.

                          FLOR

                    (no longer sure of herself
                     or anything)
                I just don't....Out of space this
                school wants her to go for free?

                          DEBORAH

                We ran into the school head. They
                want diversity...Cristina knocked
                her out...I had nothing to do with
                it. By the way, the scholarship is
                worth twenty thousand dollars. And
                early registration is tomorrow.

                          FLOR

                It is too far from our home.

                          DEBORAH

                You could move in with us in town.

                          FLOR

                Never, thank you...

                          DEBORAH

                Okay, then don't..By the way..the
                phrase is "NO, thank you."

132   INT. FLOR'S ROOM - NIGHT                                 132

      Flor has her earphones on listening to her English tapes..but
      she is enormously upset as she watches her daughter
      passionately pray in English..soon taking off the ear phones.




                                                              86.








                          CRISTINA

                Please, dear God..Enter my mother's
                heart and make her understand what
                this school would mean.

                          FLOR

                Alright. I look.

                          CRISTINA

                Amen.

133   EXT. L.A. PUBLIC SCHOOL - FLOR AT CRISTINA'S SCHOOL - DAY 133

      Summer session - L.A. public school..ninety percent Hispanic.
      Through Flor's POV, the place is seen not as crowded and worn
      but as vibrant with community.

134   EXT. PRIVATE SCHOOL - FLOR AT BERNICE'S SCHOOL - DAY     134

      Highly anxious and out of place, she sees the upper-scale
      students..five percent Latino...No brochure can do it
      justice. Overwhelmed by the implications, Flor's eyes tear.

135   INT. FLOR'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT                            135

      Cristina sleeps. Flor sits on her bed - no thought of sleep.

136   INT. BEACH HOUSE - LATE NIGHT                            136

      John enters, home from work ... as he passes Flor's door it
      opens and she steps out. Before she can continue on, she sees
      Evelyn at the foot of the stairs, carrying a glass of port.

                          EVELYN

                Hi, Flor, want some port?

                          FLOR

                No, thank you, Evelyn.

                          EVELYN

                    (going up stairs)
                Thanks for never judging me..Love
                you. Love everybody. That's what's
                killing me.. Sleep well.

      EVELYN'S POV.

      She sees Flor approach John. Evelyn looks thoughtful.

137   INT. DEN - LATE NIGHT                                    137

      John is about to pour himself a stiff drink. Flor startles
      him.

                          FLOR

                May I talk with you?




                                                              87.








                           JOHN

                Me?
                    (she nods)
                Deborah will be home soon. I just
                talked to her.

                          FLOR

                I need real talk..Is it okay?
      John does not answer immediately. The brief pause is noted.

                           FLOR (CONT'D)

                No?

                           JOHN

                Sure.

                          FLOR

                Outside? Private?

                          JOHN

                Sure.....
                    (as they exit to beach
                     with a nervous laugh)
                You have me a little worried...
      He glances back, hoping to have his fears assuaged, they are
      not.

138   EXT. BEACH - NIGHT                                       138

      He sits..she stands, gorgeous..The wind gusts periodically
      blowing her dress against her body. He tries not to notice.

                          FLOR

                You know about Cristina and your
                great school?

                          JOHN

                Oh, it's happened. Is it driving
                you nuts?

                          FLOR

                Yes, nuts. I have no idea what to
                do. Such an important thing.

                           JOHN

                Yeah.

                          FLOR

                It's a good school?

                          JOHN

                Tops. It's tops.

                          FLOR

                So you like it?




                                                        88.








                    JOHN

          No. I hate the damn school. But
          that's because they keep sending my
          daughter home anxiety-ridden,
          mostly over geometry..I mean you
          "get" Bernice..In a decent world
          her school should let her know how
          great she is, right?

                    FLOR

          Very right.

                    JOHN

          So, don't ask me..I'm worried about
          my own kid there.

                    FLOR

          You don't have to worry about
          Bernice. Nothing is going to change
          that heart.
He looks at her..Out of nowhere overwhelmed by someone
echoing and affirming his deepest most private thoughts about
his daughter..It is odd..being this deeply touched before he
knows what hit him..He makes little adjustments until the
moment passes..

                     JOHN

          Um.....yeah..thanks...
              (then)
          It's great to hear someone else say
          that out loud..Hard to explain.

                    FLOR

          I "get" it.

                    JOHN

              (a beat..then deeply, with
               core feelings, a lament)
          Ah, man..

                    FLOR

              (caring)
          It will be okay.

                    JOHN

          No, I was thinking about you..

                    FLOR

              (instantly alarmed)
          Your, "Ah, man" was for me? You
          think I am in trouble with
          Cristina?

                    JOHN

          It's just tough to be sane.

                                                        89.

                    JOHN (cont'd)
          To know you're not just making
          something out of nothing. That when
          you think you're at some
          crossroads - you are.

                    FLOR

              (she takes this in/nods)
          ....I never know a man who can put
          himself in my place like you do.
          How do you become that man?

                    JOHN

          I don't know...You introduce two
          Jews in the desert and wait five
          thousand years. Then, bingo,
          somebody else who can see trouble
          coming but can't do anything about
          it.

                    FLOR

          I don't understand.

                    JOHN

          That's okay.

                       FLOR

          I want to.

                    JOHN

          Nothing. I don't know what I'm
          talking about..
A sustained gust of wind which celebrates her shape in a way
which cannot be ignored.

                     JOHN (CONT'D)

          Will you sit down.. Get out of the
          damn wind.
She sits. It helps.

                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          So you going to send her?

                    FLOR

          I don't know. But it does not feel
          good. I think if she goes there it
          will be one of two things..either
          she will be odd...or she will make
          herself the same as them.

                    JOHN

              (in wonderment)
          That is EXACTLY the way I felt
          about Bernice going there..Exactly.

                                                               90.

                          JOHN (cont'd)
                I wasn't able to think it that
                clearly...But that's how I felt. So
                between odd and the same...you
                gotta root for odd, don't you?

                          FLOR

                Yes, you gotta.
      Camera begins to pull back...early in the move John's words
      stop the movement.

                          JOHN

                This was a crummy summer.
      Flor nods ruefully..then suddenly off a glance at him.

                          FLOR

                Not all crummy.
      Suddenly there is a bit of danger..she rises quickly,
      changing mode.

                          FLOR (CONT'D)

                Thank you, good night. I go sleep.

                          JOHN

                Good night..Hey?
      She turns..

                          JOHN (CONT'D)

                You speaking English...It's, uh..

                          FLOR

                What?

                          JOHN

                Nothing. Just.... Nice meeting you.
      She gulps and exits...as the CAMERA PULLS BACK..ending the
      summer at the rented house...as we transition to....

139   EXT. BIG BLUE BUS IN MOTION - MORNING.                    139

      Through the unusual center window we see Flor and Cristina.
      Flor, at this moment, is assimilating against every fiber in
      her body. Cristina is excited, certain her life is taking an
      incandescent turn. Quite a contrast.

140   EXT. STONE CANYON AND SUNSET - MORNING                    140

      As the bus stops...Bernice is across the street, along with
      some other kids and Deborah, who is wearing her running
      clothes..Flor and Cristina exit the bus...




                                                        91.








                    BERNICE

              (calling)
          You just made it...I was getting
          worried..
Deborah has a backpack loaded with books which she hands to
Cristina..

                     DEBORAH

          I picked up your books yesterday..
              (by way of explanation to
               Flor)
          This is one of Bernie's
          old..ancient backpacks.
Cristina taking it...

                    CRISTINA

          Oh, thank you..
As she shoulders it and almost falls over..

                    CRISTINA (CONT'D)

              (impressed with the heft)
          This is a great school.

                    DEBORAH

              (to Cristina)
          I got you a little first-day-at-a-
          new-school present...
A school bus appears and heads toward them putting a certain
deadline pressure on the transaction.

                    DEBORAH (CONT'D)

          It's from me and....Bernice.
              (to Flor)
          Okay? It is a big day.
Flor's uncertain reaction is taken as a yes.

                    BERNICE

              (dry)
          What did we get her?
Deborah hands Cristina a locket..then, noting Flor's
expression.

                     DEBORAH

               (to Cristina)
          It's from ALL of us. Your mother
          too.

                    FLOR

              (to Cristina)
          It's not from me...




                                                                 92.







      Deborah does a good-natured "TAKE" accepting Flor's reaction
      as if it where an eccentricity..As Cristina and Bernice board
      the bus, Cristina generally says goodbye to both women,
      thereby depriving Flor of her own moment of passage with her
      daughter.

                          DEBORAH

                Have a great year, girls..
                    (for Flor)
                This is so great. It fills your
                heart, doesn't it?
      Deborah turns and sees Flor has already started doggedly up
      the hill..

141   EXT. STREET - HILL - ANGLE ON FLOR...                       141

      Walking up the hill, blinking in disbelief at her own
      fury..Deborah in the background feeling a bit abandoned..Flor
      keeps walking toward the camera..

                          NARRATOR

                There is a terrible crisis which
                comes when your own personality is
                not equal to the challenge you
                face. When being who you are no
                longer works.
      Deborah has started to jog. As she approaches Flor, she calls
      for a clear path well in advance.

                          DEBORAH

                Left...left.
      Flor does not alter course though she does start to walk
      faster...

                          DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                Left...left...
      Deborah is close behind now.

                          DEBORAH (CONT'D)


                LEFT!

      Suddenly, Flor breaks into a run..She is lithe and quick.

      ON DEBORAH...

      A blink of confusion...then something resembling innate
      satisfaction as she quickens her gait and...the Race is on.

      ANGLE AS DEBORAH DRAWS ABREAST OF FLOR.

      Strangely, she is interpreting this as closeness. She is
      genuinely warm.




                                                              93.








                            DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                      (to Flor)
                  Why am I not surprised you're
                  competitive?
      Deborah looks up the street at a delivery truck.

                            DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                  Oh, they're delivering my table.
      Flor stays on task ..forces her stride. She just needs to win
      so very much..that's all..to her current surprise, that's
      everything...

                            DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                  You are fast.. Better pace yourself
                  though..
      Flor, even more upset and provoked by the words now lets it
      all out...

      ON DEBORAH..

      Realizing she may not be a certain winner...she is concerned
      as she goes after the rabbit.

      OTHER ANGLE.

      Showing the delivery truck as finish line in the distance...

      VARIOUS SHOTS..

      Flor fueled by desperation. Deborah, relentlessly gaining,
      exhilarated.

      THE FINISH..

      Decidedly anti-climactic..Deborah draws even -- passes her--
      arrives at the house with a large margin of victory.

                            DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                      (calling back)
                  I love you for trying.

142   EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - DAY                                  142

      She exits into her home.

      ON FLOR..

      Bent over, hands on knees, sweaty, gasping for breath. Flor
      finally straightens up and, there being no other course,
      continues her walk up the hill, to work.

      As John moves past Evelyn on his way to work. She looks at
      him a little wild-eyed as they both stand in the doorway.
      Straining a bit for breath.

                          JOHN

                You feel okay?

                          EVELYN

                No. I've given up drinking.
                    (he looks at her/she sadly
                     nods affirmation)
                I had to do it John..I need every
                brain cell to watch out for all of
                us..given the current climate.
                Anyway. John, I think you're great
                and I'm going to act accordingly.

                           JOHN

                    (totally confused)
                Good deal.

                          EVELYN

                Let's hope.

      Flor cooking alongside Monica --- a table is set for ten..A
      banner proclaiming BIENVENIDA, MAMÁ.

                          NARRATOR

                My great Aunt Monica had finally
                managed to get her mother to Los
                Angeles and my mother was making a
                party.

                I was with my friends who had
                helped me understand real optimism.
      As they pull in the driveway. Cristina and her friends exit
      the car and squeal loudly at each other with the excitement
      of having it all. Bernice exits last. She is not squealing.

      friends watching a movie in the family room. A clock
      prominently reads nine p.m.

                       (into phone)
                   Flor? Deb..Look, sorry to call you
                   so late, but they're still studying
                   and I'm going out but I promised to
                   get her back so if you want me to
                   cut off the school work,
                   fine...whatever you want me to do.
                   Well, okay..you think about it..
                       (she holds on to give Flor
                        time)
                   And hey, if you're tired, or want
                   to play, let her sleep here and
                   I'll get her back there tomorrow.
                   You still want to think about it?
                   Okay..
      She hangs up...and exchanges a mischievous look with
      Cristina.

                   Though it is possible to judge
                   harshly my conduct toward my mother
                   in my first year at school; almost
                   all professional literature excuses
                   my behavior as developmental, since
                   I was entering an age where
                   rebellion and narcissism were to be
                   expected. And I was being mentored.
      Monica and her newly arrived mother are there along with the
      bride from an earlier scene and some of the girls who saw
      Cristina off to Malibu..Women cooking in the kitchen..She
      tells the girls, in Spanish, that Cristina may not make it.
      They are disappointed...Flor thinks - then says something to
      Monica who nods in agreement. Flor exits.

      As Evelyn stands there...a little in the shadows..

      HER POV...

      Deborah somewhat dolled up moving through the interior of the
      house..




                                                                96.

      As Deborah leaves the house in a hurry.

                          EVELYN

                    (calling out)
                Wait!
      Deborah turns, startled.

                          EVELYN (CONT'D)

                I need to talk to you privately,
                honey.

                          DEBORAH

                "Honey?"-- Can't now, Mom...I'm
                late..I was looking all over for
                you...keep an eye on the kids. You
                know my secret cell number.

                          EVELYN

                Just give me a moment to talk
                here..

                          DEBORAH

                What is it? Are you buzzed?

                          EVELYN

                No. I gave up drinking weeks ago.
                    (on Deborah's reaction)
                Yes. Nobody noticed -- which shows
                I probably conducted myself pretty
                well as a drunk. But duty called
                and I'm sober so may I say just one
                thing.

                          DEBORAH

                One thing..go ahead...

                          EVELYN

                Thanks..Deborah, you're going to
                lose your husband and you'll never
                find someone as good. There will
                only be men who you know are cheap
                and shallow and have no real warmth
                in their souls. You may have gotten
                by on those surfaces once but now
                you've been spoiled by a good man
                and you can no longer glide on such
                thin ice. If you do not act
                quickly you will soon cement an
                awful fate for yourself. A life,
                with no hope of repair, which has
                already begun to turn desperate and
                dumb. That's it. Drive safely.
      She grabs a deep breath and then turns and walks to the
      house.




                                                                 97.

                  If we're out of coffee, it's over
                  for me.
      Suddenly a sharp horn is heard..Evelyn jumps..then turns to
      see her daughter calling to her from the driver's seat of the

      SUV..


                            DEBORAH

                  You've done it again, Mom, made me
                  hate myself..One of the things I
                  can count on..

                            EVELYN

                  Honey, lately your low self-esteem
                  is just good common sense.
      Deborah considers that last thought for a long beat before
      she drives off..

      Flor walking from the beginning of the hill........She looks
      off to see John's vehicle approaching..She brightens..

      ON JOHN..

      Who doesn't see her..We can see his car's digital clock
      reading 11:30.

      ON FLOR..

      As he drives past her.

151   INT. CLASKY HOME - NIGHT...                                 151

      As John enters..Evelyn, in an adjoining room, moves to
      intercept him.

                            EVELYN (CONT'D)

                  John, better wait a minute.
      But John hears Deb's crying from upstairs..

                            JOHN

                      (concerned)
                  What the hell's wrong?

                            EVELYN

                  Nothing. In all futility, can I
                  urge you not to go up there.
      But he is already moving quickly up the stairs..As he turns
      at the top of the stairs WE SEE THE DOOR CLOSE TO BERNICE'S

      ROOM.

152   INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT...                           152

      John enters the room on the double...passes Deborah without
      knowing it..(she is partially obscured by the drape or some
      such). As he passes....camera HOLDS ON DEBORAH..she is a
      mess...goopy tear stains..seeing him and his concern brings
      her grief to a higher ground...a sinner humbled by
      goodness..a trembling lip of childlike vulnerability...

                             JOHN

                   Deb..Deb?..where are you?
      He is about to leave the room...she is about to let him but
      an instinct leads her astray once more.

                                DEBORAH

                   Here I am.

                             JOHN

                   Baby, what?

                             DEBORAH

                   "Baby?" Stay there, John...Sit
                   down..I suddenly get what I have to
                   do...I just have to get the guts.

                             JOHN

                   Is it absolutely necessary to make
                   it this...this scary..can you just
                   say it?

                             DEBORAH

                   Not so easy.

                              JOHN

                       (tender/ready for the big
                         healing)
                   Yeah..come on..it's me. We can
                   talk.

                             DEBORAH

                   Do I ever hope so...I've been
                   seeing another man for the last
                   eleven weeks and it was nothing and
                   I ended it tonight..At first it was
                   just keeping an eye on the real
                   estate market..Then it was...what?
                   Me being insecure and looking for
                   some ridiculous vali...

      ON JOHN...

A shock victim..he holds up a hand to stop her..

                    JOHN

          Go -- hold on...hold on...I'm
          missing what you're saying..You
          can't just keep talking and expect
          me to follow it when you start the
          way you did.......

                    DEBORAH

          Just what did you hear?

                    JOHN

          Well there was the crack in the
          planet. That was noisy...
She looks at him...a solid beat...

                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          There's an actual noise in my
          head.....no kidding..
Briefly he does the noise...

                    DEBORAH

              (slowly)
          I met him about...
John holds up a hand to stop her...he needs to gather himself
to hear this..She waits...and waits...as he waits he grows
flushed and stunned with dread. Finally a word..

                    JOHN

          You..
She takes that as a cue to start..

                    DEBORAH

          I met him..
He puts up his hand..

                    JOHN

          If you talk that fast...I'll never
          hear you..there's a lot going
          through my mind....Have you said
          yet whether you slept with him?

                    DEBORAH

          So far I've just been talking about
          a flirtation because the really
          important thing for you to know...

                    JOHN

          Have you said yet whether you've
          had sex with someone else? Because
          I really am missing most of your
          words. So help me out here..

                    DEBORAH

          I've been trying to explain that
          for the first ten weeks there was
          almost nothing to ...

                     JOHN

              (sincerely checking but
               wild)
          You still haven't said, right?

                    DEBORAH

          Is this your way of...

                    JOHN

          This is my way of...this is my way
          of asking you whether..
He stops... staggering on the threshold of a diminished
future.

                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          Oh man, once I ask it...give me a
          second.
              (several beats then some
               conversational good
               manners for keeping her
               waiting)
          I'm just trying to figure out
          whether there's any way to avoid
          knowing..no, damn
              (quickly closing this
               argument with himself)
          There's not...
              (to her)
          Okay, you're on..real short answer,
          huh? Have you had sex with
          another..

                    DEBORAH

          I know you're very angry?

                    JOHN

              (considering/then
               repressed answer)
          Ahhhh...I'm getting there, yes.

                    DEBORAH

              (softly)
          John?
              (on his look)
          I think if you let me tell you the
          full everything of this we'd be in
          a position to deal with it
          better..because eleven weeks ago
          when...

                          JOHN

                You don't believe that I miss your
                words..I get three or four
                tops...and then just see your mouth
                moving with nothing coming out and
                then I spin out and there's this
                noise...But there's no way to miss
                a "yes" or "no."

                          DEBORAH

                    (blurts)
                Yes..

                    (core simple/eight years
                     old)
                Really?

                          DEBORAH

                    (this gets her)
                I made up my mind that I would
                answer every question you had..I'll
                answer anything and everything and
                more.

                          JOHN

                    (perplexed)
                What other questions could there
                be?

                          DEBORAH

                Are you really that much nicer than
                me?

                          JOHN

                Well, you don't set the bar real
                high.
      He get up and starts to exit..

                          DEBORAH

                No. Please, please, please..I
                think if you listen to exactly what
                happened and then do whatever you
                need to...we'll..just let me tell
                you everything..
      The doorbell rings...it's quite late...Deborah wondering
      what's up..she looks out the window.

                          DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                Oh, it's just Flor.

153   EXT. STONE CANYON NIGHT..                                  153

      As Flor enters the Clasky House...




                                                             102.








154   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - LATE NIGHT                             154

      Flor sees Evelyn in the living room.

                          EVELYN

                What are you doing here?

                          FLOR

                I want Cristina. I want to talk to
                Mrs. Clasky. I want to quit.

                          EVELYN

                I don't think you can do any of it
                right this minute..

                          FLOR

                Oh, yes..Where's Cristina?

155   INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                                155

      Deborah can barely look at him...

                          DEBORAH

                ...then, when I was driving back
                tonight after I ended the whole
                yuck thing..I was feeling human.
                I'm done with what's his name..a
                relief... ..and now it can be like
                it never happened and then I
                thought that the only hope was that
                I own that it did happen and that I
                take my medicine here..because if
                I'm walking around with what I did
                and you don't know what I
                did..there is a real limit to how
                close we can be..you're with me and
                I'm this person who has this bad
                secret and we aren't really on the
                same page ever again..so the reason
                I took this chance in telling -- is
                because I want us to be good..I
                want us to be close. I want to
                feel like you're not nuts to be in
                love with me..So what I think is we
                should talk till we pass out ..
                Talk till we're so sick of each
                other that there's nothing left to
                do but take the first step out of
                hell..So please let's not leave
                this room until you've heard and
                said everything..please say, okay..
      She awaits his answer..He has heard barely a few words..

                          JOHN

                What?




                                                             103.








                            DEBORAH

                  John..

                            JOHN

                  I've got to get out of
                  here..because you keep talking.
                      (as she starts to follow
                       him)
                  Stay put!
      She does. Just before he exits.

                            DEBORAH

                  You've got to say something.

                            JOHN

                  You are a terrible wife.
      He exits.

156   INT. MAID'S ROOM - NIGHT...                              156

      Evelyn stands in the doorway with Flor..they are looking at
      Cristina and her two friends sleeping together.

                            EVELYN

                  I don't think you want to wake her
                  when you're this upset and the
                  other kids are right there and...
      Flor makes a noise of frustration and retreats from the room.

157   INT. ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT                               157

      As they arrive at the interior entrance, John comes down the
      stairs just as Flor opens the front door.

                            JOHN

                  Where you going?

                            FLOR

                  I'm leaving....I have finally..

                            JOHN

                  Me too..I'll drive you.

                            FLOR

                  No.

                            JOHN

                  Yes..come on...it's past midnight
                  here.

                            FLOR

                  If you truly don't know why I say
                  "no" let me at last say the reason.
                  At least that will be a relief.
                  Have you no idea that I....




                                                             104.







      Before she can there is the sound of scratching toes on the
      floor and a ball comes into lower frame with a dog's
      snout..Flor loses her thought and tosses the ball.

      OTHER ANGLE.

      As Chum, now the only happy creature in the house, fetches it
      and returns.

                           JOHN

                 Look I have to get out of here
                 right now..

                           FLOR

                 Go..
      John exits to driveway...Flor makes one last toss..these
      tosses have not made a dent in her anger and frustration.

                           FLOR (CONT'D)

                 Goodbye, Chum.
      Another toss and Flor follows John out the door.

      ON CHUM.

      No longer happy. He has lost his only easy mark. He stares at
      the closed door..the ball drops from his mouth to the floor.

158   EXT. CLASKY DRIVEWAY - NIGHT...                             158

      John is at the car but Flor heads for the gate.

                           JOHN

                     (as decisive as we've seen
                      him)
                 I'm taking you.

                           FLOR

                     (with anger)
                 Why?!?

                           JOHN

                 Because if I don't -- I'll worry
                 about you and I can't handle that
                 right now, okay?
      Flor emits a crooning sound.

                           FLOR

                 Ahhhhh.
                     (stunned and worried)
                 I never made that sound over a man
                 before..




                                                              105.







      Flor shudders at her own sappiness as John opens the
      passenger door for her...very much into his own torture he
      nonetheless grabs her arm and guides her up and in..she
      catches and appreciates his automatic gracious manners while
      he is clearly fucked up...She is impatient with his
      solicitousness almost slapping his hands away as he makes
      sure her skirt doesn't get crushed in the door..The
      frustration roiling in her.

                           FLOR (CONT'D)

                 Please!?! Mandilón.

      OTHER ANGLE..

      Deborah watching them...

      HER POV.

      Her cuckolded husband closing the door behind her gorgeous,
      soon-to-be ex-housekeeper.

      CLOSE ON DEBORAH..

      She trembles under the force of imminent justice.

159   INT. JOHN'S CAR - LATE NIGHT                                159

      Two pissed-off people..jaws set...breathing labored..As the
      car starts and Flor looks back, she lets out a guttural and
      explosive shout...

                           FLOR

                     (a quick and mighty vent)
                 Arrchhhhhyeeeeiii!
      For John, the first clear thing he has heard in a while..

                           JOHN

                 Yes! Exactly! Well put! Teach me
                 that word sometime. I can really
                 use it.
      She nods..there is almost a moment of relaxation..then the
      anger fires an immediate need..She leans across the seat to
      deliver an urgent message to him. The words come out
      exponentially too forcefully.

                           FLOR

                 I quit this job!
      His spontaneous and forceful reaction surprises her..

                           JOHN

                 I quit this job!!!!!
      As he turns onto Sunset.




                                                      106.








                    FLOR

          That's the bus stop.

                    JOHN

          I'll take you home.

                    FLOR

          No. Drop me at a bus.

                    JOHN

          Oh, shut up and stop telling me
          what to do.

                    FLOR

          Okay...then let's do something
          besides driving me home where my
          daughter isn't.

                    JOHN

          Okay..we'll do something.

                    FLOR

          And I'm supposed to figure out what
          because I'm a housekeeper and you
          don't have to think.

                    JOHN

          Oh, don't do the class thing,
          man..You don't know where I come
          from.

                    FLOR

          Alright, I know. But I can't be
          responsible no more for making sure
          nothing happens. That's another
          terrible job I quit.

                    JOHN

          What are you talking about? I take
          responsibility for anything within
          a block. You have nothing to worry
          about. That's my job.

                    FLOR

          Excellent. So you're going to
          figure out what we do, right?

                    JOHN

          Yes. Okay. Big man figure out!

                    FLOR

          Stop there.
She points to a mall..He looks at her and pulls in.




                                                              107.








160   EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - LATE NIGHT.                       160

      As she leaves the car and goes into a drug store. John, sober
      faced, looks at Flor making an attractive and zestful beeline
      toward an Hispanic market. This could be where it hits him
      that he's on a date...If so..it's too late to duck..

161   INT. MEXICAN MARKET - LATE NIGHT.                         161

      As Flor enters the market..She calls to the young shop girl
      as Marine medics for morphine.

                          FLOR (CONT'D)

                Maquillaje!

                                                        CUT TO:

      The shop girl directs her to the make-up counter where she
      starts shopping..lip gloss, blush, eye stuff..She starts
      applying it at the check out counter.

162   EXT. OUTDOOR MALL - LATE NIGHT                            162

      As she runs back to the car.

163   INT. JOHN'S VEHICLE -                                     163

      As she enters, there is a fury to her which he almost
      matches.

                          FLOR

                This is me when I'm not working..
                You have never seen me!

                          JOHN

                Well, you look familiar.

                            FLOR

                So,
                    (parodying him)
                "man," where we heading?

                          JOHN

                I don't think I can handle public..

                          FLOR

                Yes, no...lots of people right now
                is..

                            JOHN

                I know.

                          FLOR

                You were going to figure this out!

                            JOHN

                My place!




                                                                108.








164   INT. JOHN'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT...                           164

      As they enter the main restaurant...

                            FLOR

                  I've never seen your place. Very
                  perfect.
      He heads for the kitchen.

                            JOHN

                  I'm going to cook, Beautiful.
                      (on a dime correction)
                  I'm going to cook beautifully.

                            FLOR

                  Hey..please..
      He turns.

                            FLOR (CONT'D)

                  We both were not normal because we
                  are angry and we act like we are
                  angry with each other and we are
                  not..I am not. I am glad to be with
                  you. It feels comfortable to be
                  with you. If I just left the job
                  and never spoke with you it would
                  have been sin. You understand?

                            JOHN

                  Ummmmmmmmm...Yes.
      He stands next to her and, for want of a better physical
      expression, pats her on her back..She eyes him, almost
      critical about the lame extent of his aggression....He can't
      quite look at her...He pats her again..

      REAR ANGLE..THE PAT ON THE BACK.

      The pat is becoming a rub..he cups her back..slides his
      hand..she responds just a bit..

                            JOHN (CONT'D)

                  I think I'm inventing a horrible
                  new way of making out..

                            FLOR

                  Not so horrible.....
      His hand keeps going..he now hugs her to him even though they
      both still face front.. like a loving couple on a walk to the
      market. His hand squeezes her shoulder.

                            JOHN

                  My hand is the only sane part of my
                  body..every other part wants to
                  jump off a cliff.




                                                             109.








                           FLOR

                     (digging this/almost
                      growing a sense of humor)
                If the other hand could cheer up,
                you could lift me up and carry me
                off.
      He laughs. He takes his hand from around her. It is a bit
      awkward.

                          JOHN

                I don't know how to handle that
                one. I think I already broke my
                record for smooth.

                          FLOR

                I don't understand.

                          JOHN

                It's me. I'm not making sense. But
                I can get you fed.
      He goes to the kitchen. She begins to explore a little. She
      goes to a cabinet and opens it to find a CD player. She digs
      in her purse and takes out a CD.

165   INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN - NIGHT                             165

      As John starts cooking up a storm...there is some velocity to
      his cooking...he still seethes. Then reacts as Spanish Music
      starts to play. He clears his throat as if he must make a
      speech. Then does so again..some vocal spasm paying tribute
      to the increasingly intoxicating tension he feels.

166   INT. RESTAURANT - DINING AREA - NIGHT...                    166

      Flor is lighting the candle at each of the twenty tables.

167   INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN - NIGHT...                          167

      He is cooking..He is talking to himself.

                           JOHN

                Nothing to be nervous about. You
                are not on a date...
                    (calls out)
                Hey, Flor?

                             FLOR'S VOICE (O.S.)

                Yes, John.

                          JOHN

                What are you doing?
      She enters the room...dancing a bit..




                                                       110.








                    FLOR

          Just lighting candles and picking
          music.
              (notices his cooking)
          Oooh.
She gets up on one of the counters and sits there, her feet
dangling...sings along a bit in Spanish. He is uncomfortable
anew. The nervousness mounting.

                    JOHN

          You want a drink?
She considers the question totally..He is busy cooking..not
realizing how weighty she considers his question...finally
aware she has not answered and looks at her..

                     JOHN (CONT'D)

          Huh?
She regards him levelly..then makes her decision.

                     FLOR

          No.
He gets out a bottle of vodka.

                    FLOR (CONT'D)

          I, uh...don't think you should
          either.

                    JOHN

          Then excuse me, because if I had
          the equipment I'd inject the vodka.
He starts to pour.

                    FLOR

          Wait!
              (he stops)
          I think it is so important that we
          are each clear-headed.
He looks at her..a beat...he puts the vodka away. Flor
beams..we have not seen her smile like this for quite some
time.

                    FLOR (CONT'D)

          It is very good that you did not
          ask, "why?"

                    JOHN

              (quietly)
          Keep things real, right?

                    FLOR

              (impressed)
          I wouldn't have put it so well.




                                                                111.








168   INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN - HALF HOUR LATER - NIGHT           168

      They sit at a small table in the kitchen..finishing the
      greatest late-night meal in the history of Western man.

                          FLOR

                I will remember every
                taste..forever.

                          JOHN

                Tell you the truth..I wanted a shot
                at cooking for you.
                    (shy/his heart)
                I'm very glad you liked it.

                          FLOR

                It's something watching you.
      He looks up at her...she has not been seen like this for a
      very long time, if ever.. lit up by a man.

                          JOHN

                Well, if it's anything at your end
                imagine over here...scratch
                that..the last thing you want to
                hear is somebody going off on your
                looks.

                          FLOR

                Don't be crazy. Tell me every
                detail.

                          JOHN

                Okay, Flor, yes I will...They
                should name a gender after
                you..Looking at you doesn't do
                it..Staring is the only thing that
                makes sense..and trying not to
                blink so you don't miss anything.
      She squeals with laughter..He laughs a little himself and in
      so doing loses his courage..He looks down at his
      hands..shyness again belting him a good one..Still looking
      down.

                          JOHN (CONT'D)

                Look..forgive me..I'm.....It's just
                that you are drop-dead, crazy-
                gorgeous..so much so that I am
                really considering looking at you
                again before we finish up here.

                          FLOR

                Soon, please.
      And now he looks at her.

      CLOSE ON FLOR..





                                                               112.







      Utterly open...utterly optimistic...the half second before
      being swept away.

                             FLOR (CONT'D)

                   Right now....immediately..we have
                   to dance or kiss.
      He stands. She stands..He kids just a bit, clowning at
      weighing the two options and then:

      HIS POV..

      Her face..

                             JOHN

                   No contest.
      They kiss.

                             FLOR

                   You sure you're not Mexican.

                             JOHN

                       (smiling/he likes this)
                   What do you mean?

                             FLOR

                   I meant you talk like a Spanish
                   song.

                             JOHN

                   You kiss like a Spanish fly..
                       (on her confusion)
                   Joking around. I don't know what
                   I'm talking about...

                             FLOR

                   Yes you do.
      She breaks and heads for the dining room. John has a moment
      to consider.. He does not have his wits about him..a
      condition every bit as fearsome as liberating.

169   INT. RESTAURANT - DINING ROOM.                             169

      As Flor rummages for another CD, enjoying every minute. She
      places the disk in the player and exits.

170   INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN.                                   170

      As she returns...

                             FLOR (CONT'D)

                   This song...You see what a good
                   thing to tell you how you talk like
                   a Mexican song.




                                                          113.







She begins to translate the lyrics.

                     FLOR (CONT'D)

          When I kiss you, entire oceans rush
          through my veins..
              (he is wildly
                uncomfortable)
          Gardens of flowers blossom in my
          body.
He starts to make a comic gesture of awkwardness to get past
the event..she shakes her head at him..driving the words --
pointing emphatically..she will not have her poetry laughed
at..

                    FLOR (CONT'D)

          And you wander along my fertile
          soil, picking its ripe fruit..A
          nightingale undresses on my
          tongue..And under its wings..
He laughs. She stops cold. Looks down..though just seconds
long, this still constitutes the first depression of her
life.

                    JOHN

          I'm sorry. I don't know what I just
          took out of you but tell me how to
          get it back in there..I'm sorry.
          Flor..I'm sorry.

CLOSE ON HER..

The downcast eyes rise to see him..

                    FLOR

          Then respect this.
He looks at her...they kiss..It is a kiss without an author.
God at the controls. They break. There is a beat then..

                    JOHN

          Here's something I never asked
          anyone..Did nightingales undress on
          your tongue?
Flor looks at him with enormous warmth. Her arms looped
around his neck..aware of the music.

                    FLOR

          Did they on yours?

                    JOHN

              (a long beat of
               reflection/then sincere
               and surprised)
          Yeah...




                                                                114.








171   EXT. RESTAURANT - SOME TIME LATER                           171

      Moving camera...the small house turned restaurant..little
      flickers of light...

                          NARRATOR

                My mother never told me the details
                of her visit to the restaurant.
                But she often referred to it as the
                greatest conversation of her life.

172   INT. RESTAURANT - VERY LATE NIGHT...                        172

      They are lying post coitally in each other's arms on a sofa
      just inside the dining room..They are covered by a table
      cloth. They hold hands above the cover...each private but
      still somehow in contact.

                          FLOR

                Oh, Johnny, why is everything so
                damn confusing?

                          JOHN

                Culpa.
      Flor's pleasure zone is rocked. She smiles at his first
      Spanish word. She is wrestling with large feelings of
      pleasure and large ominous thoughts.

                          FLOR

                    (a beat)
                Is your mind racing?

                          JOHN

                I would say my mind has
                evaporated...but that there are
                remnants still standing waiting to
                fall. It feels pretty good.

                          FLOR

                Like happy?

                          JOHN

                Like happy.

                          FLOR

                You think that will last?

                          JOHN

                It's already gone.

                          FLOR

                I understand what you mean.

                          JOHN

                I don't understand what I mean.




                                                       115.








                    FLOR

          That it's getting late. That
          responsibilities have entered your
          brain. Don't hide that from me.
          And really, one large reason we are
          here is because you respect me as a
          mother and I respect you as a
          father..
He is looking at her...she is disconcerted.

                    JOHN

          You're a great and wild mother.

                    FLOR

          You are a beautiful father.
She looks at him..they kiss...tenderness..heat...intimacy.

                    FLOR (CONT'D)

          When Cristina was young, I would
          say I want to take any man who
          wants me to the park and I will
          tell whether I want him from the
          way he is with Cristina. I wish
          you had been in the park then.
              (a beat)
          Any reaction?
John considering and then the answer comes to him.

                       JOHN

          Exactly!..

                    FLOR

          You know, I always think about when
          you...Oh, there's no point. I talk
          too much...
              (a bit of emotion)
          ...because I don't know if we ever
          talk again.

                    JOHN

          Hey, hey..How do you get there?
          Wait.

                    FLOR

          Yes you do. Be honest.

                    JOHN

          I'm being honest.
              (indicates their bodies)
          Look at us - I think I call it
          honesty.




                                                             116.








                          FLOR

                What are we going to do -- go home,
                let our hearts go back in our
                bodies, see each other a few more
                times. Make a tragedy out of us..
      She kisses him again...starts to cry....looks at him..emits a
      small cooing sound.

                          FLOR (CONT'D)

                Ahhhhhhh.
                    (sudden energy)
                There are some mistakes you cannot
                risk when you have kids...Please,
                are you ready to go?

                            JOHN

                     (urgently)
                No. I'm not. No.
                     (then)
                Stay put for a second. Stay here.
                Once our feet touch that floor, I'm
                going to get too many brain cells
                back. So don't be in such a hurry.
                That floor, Flor, is going to eat
                us alive.
                     (she settles back/he is
                      energized)
                So you think it was a mistake up to
                now.
                     (she nods "yes")
                That's rough.
      She nods again..trying to gut things out...but as her foot
      touches the floor, she must say one last thing to him.

                          FLOR

                The mistake....I love it.

173   INT. CLASKY HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT.          173

      Deborah's face is bleached from crying...the tear ducts of
      her now brown eyes are parched dry..Evelyn sits eyeing her as
      she looks through the window at the pre-dawn emptiness of
      Stone Canyon. In her current shape she would give pause to a
      staff worker at Promises..a shock victim walking through the
      rubble after the bomb has dropped. Deborah's voice is
      scratchy when she speaks.

                          DEBORAH

                Tell me again why I can't call him
                on the cell.

                          EVELYN

                Besides that he turned it off?

                          DEBORAH

                Yes.




                                                       117.








                    EVELYN

          Forty messages start to look needy.

                    DEBORAH

          Mother, you're enjoying this.

                    EVELYN

          No..Definitely not in the way you
          think.

                    DEBORAH

              (staggered)
          You are enjoying it?!?

                    EVELYN

              (rising/honest)
          I am enjoying actually being of use
          to my daughter. I am enjoying the
          fact that I really know how to
          advise you and the miracle that you
          are so deeply disoriented that you
          are gobbling up everything I say.
Deborah nods in agreement -- then looks at her mother in a
somewhat new way..as if Evelyn were an actual person instead
of an upsetting extension of herself.

                    DEBORAH

              (vulnerable)
          There's one thing I'd like to say
          to you about you and me.

                    EVELYN

          You don't have to.

                       DEBORAH

          I want to.

                       EVELYN

          Okay.

                    DEBORAH

              (quite vulnerable and
               appealing)
          You were an alcoholic and wildly
          promiscuous woman during my
          formative years so that I am in
          this fix because of you. It is your
          fault. I just needed..
              (gestures heart to heart)
          ..that moment for us.

                    EVELYN

          You have a solid point, dear. But
          right now the lessons of my life
          are coming in handy for you.




                                                        118.








                    DEBORAH

          There's a car coming....
Evelyn moves to her.

                    DEBORAH (CONT'D)

          It's him...he's got to tell me
          everything..
Evelyn shakes her head "no."

                       DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                 (wild-eyed)
          Yes!

                    EVELYN

          Do you know that right now you are
          your own worst enemy..that you
          can't trust one thought in your
          brain?

                       DEBORAH

          Duh.

                    EVELYN

          Then trust me and only allow
          yourself to say one thing to
          him..One thing..."I'm so glad
          you're back."

                       DEBORAH

          Huh?

                       EVELYN

          Yes.

                    DEBORAH

              (babbling)
          But I've got to know whether he
          touched her - where he touched her -
          how he touched her - if they broke
          a sweat --- what they said - who
          made the first move - how they left
          it -- if anyone loves anyone or has
          an intention of making contact in
          the future - what she wore - how he
          felt afterwards - whether anyone
          mentioned me..
              (a wail)
          ..whether they held hands when they
          left..
The distinct sound of a door opening and closing from
downstairs.




                                                             119.








                          EVELYN

                Just those words I said. If you
                want a prayer of coming out of
                this.

                          DEBORAH

                I know you're right..But..

                            EVELYN

                But what?

                          DEBORAH

                    (a small voice)
                I forgot the sentence you said I
                should say.

                          EVELYN

                "I'm so glad you're back."

                          DEBORAH

                Okay..do I have to wait here?

                          EVELYN

                No..he may not come up here..go to
                him.

                          DEBORAH

                Why wouldn't he come up here?

                            EVELYN

                Just go.

                          DEBORAH

                Do I need a little makeup?

                          EVELYN

                You need a hose but you don't have
                the time. It's fine that you look
                like that. It's genuine..You can
                use genuine.

                          DEBORAH

                Thank you, mom.
      She takes a breath exits...

174   INT. STAIRWELL                                           174

      She pauses at the top of the stairs..a breath..then unable to
      help herself runs down them at breakneck speed.

175   INT. DOWNSTAIRS..                                        175

      John turning a light on when Deborah bursts into the room.




                                                               120.








                          DEBORAH

                I'm so glad to see you
                    (correcting self)
                ..that you're back.
      John looks up at her - not knowing what to say...he is
      thrown. His demeanor has changed...deeper..serious..

                          JOHN

                It's late, Deborah.
      The wrong words start to form..she stops herself..

                          DEBORAH

                Well, I just wanted to say.. what I
                said..
      She is on the stairway..he turns to go in the opposite
      direction.

                          DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                    (way too loud)
                Uhhhh..
      He turns back to her...she stops herself from straying into
      untried words but gestures whether he is coming upstairs to
      bed.

                          JOHN

                    (a beat then)
                I can't sleep upstairs with you..
                Just can't for now.
      This rocks her..panicked she grabs at her life preserver.

                          DEBORAH

                I'm just so glad you're back.
      Deborah's suddenly classy demeanor provides just the barest
      of footings for them...He looks at her directly for the first
      time since she told him.

                          JOHN

                Yeah..okay.
      She nods..then goes back up the stairs..

176   INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                                 176

      Evelyn, who has been standing close to the doorway, stands
      clear to let her enter. As Deborah flies in wildly vulnerable
      - her breath racing.

                          DEBORAH

                I am literally choking on unsaid
                words..seriously. If this were a
                restaurant ten people would have
                their knuckles in my sternum.




                                                             121.








                          EVELYN

                The fact that you didn't just make
                things worse should fill you with
                hope..
      In her current state, she has to process that one..and does.
      Her breath slows.

177   INT. MAID'S ROOM - NIGHT...                              177

      The first time we've seen this room since Flor was working
      the sewing machine...John enters. He is down, longing and
      finality make for a brutal cocktail..He rubs his head and
      sits near the sewing machine..He glances over and sees Flor's
      Spanish/English dictionary..There is a knock on the door.

                          JOHN

                Deb, I'm done tonight. I don't
                think we can jam anything else in.

                          BERNICE'S VOICE

                It's me, Dad.
      He springs from the bed and opens the door.

                          JOHN

                What's up, honey?

                          BERNICE

                Just thought I'd check that you
                were back and okay and all.

                          JOHN

                    (feigning innocence)
                Because?

                          BERNICE

                Mom was crying for six hours
                straight and Grandma was in with
                her all that time mostly saying,
                "he'll be back..he'll be back."
                I've got to get back to Georgie.

                          JOHN

                I just hate that you had that kind
                of a night.

                          BERNICE

                It's good for me to worry about
                something that really matters
                instead of the stupid stuff that's
                usually on my mind...

                          JOHN

                Like?




                                                               122.








                              BERNICE

                       (a big grin)
                   Surviving.

                             JOHN

                   You're fantastic, Bernie...I love
                   you.

                             BERNICE

                   It's a slant...
                       (pause then)
                   Hey..I know there's a lot you went
                   through but I knew all along that
                   Grandma was right about you coming
                   back..I mean totally knew it so I
                   wasn't that worried. But still I...
                       (some emotion out of
                        hiding)
                   I really appreciate it, Dad.
                   Thanks....Stop staring at me..what?
                   You don't know what to say?

                             JOHN

                   Right. I don't know what to say.

                             BERNICE

                   Just what you taught me..You're
                   welcome.

                             JOHN

                   You're welcome.
      They kiss.

178   EXT. STONE CANYON -     MORNING.                           178

      Flor purposefully walking up the hill..

179   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - DAY.                                   179

      As Flor enters...walks through a few empty rooms..then once
      in the kitchen she sees the children and Evelyn are swimming
      in the pool...she opens the glass door Monica bumped into on
      interview day.

180   EXT. CLASKY POOL - DAY.                                    180

      Evelyn, Bernice and Georgie are in the pool..Cristina,
      wearing a bathing suit, is on a chaise reading...

                             CRISTINA

                   Hey, mom...Is it okay if we don't
                   leave right away?
      The others call greetings..save Evelyn who studies the
      situation and gets out of the pool..Flor is awkward..no idea
      how to handle this...so she goes direct.




                                                       123.








                     FLOR

          No...
              (as Cristina begins to
                protest)
          No..and we must say "goodbye." I
          don't work here anymore.
She then talks Spanish to Cristina..admonishing her not to
embarrass them..something about Flor being prepared to go
nuts all over her daughter if she hurts their dignity...but
it is said with total calm.

                    GEORGIE

          Do I have to get out?

                    FLOR

          No, Georgie..Stay. I think you are
          a wonderful boy..be good..like you
          are. There are no monsters.

                    GEORGIE

          Thanks..thanks. Okay.
Bernice climbs out of the pool. Meanwhile, a flabbergasted
Cristina is staring at her mom who gives quiet two and three
word proddings in Spanish.

                    BERNICE

              (severely to Georgie)
          I can't believe you didn't get out.

                       GEORGIE

          Flor said.

                    BERNICE

              (to Flor)
          I don't want to get you wet.

                    FLOR

          Get me wet.

                    BERNICE

              (rushing to hug her)
          Thanks.
Bernice hugs her. Evelyn hugs Cristina..

                    EVELYN

          You...are...a...trip.

                    FLOR

              (to Bernice)
          You're a beauty. Amazing girl.




                                                                124.







      Despite herself, Bernice starts to cry..moans to herself over
      the display...Now, in the background, we hear a subliminal
      human voice. Incrementally it will grow louder and be
      recognizable as Deborah calling Flor from the master bedroom
      window..Bit by bit, the others will become aware of this as
      Flor ignores it...Bernice goes to embrace Cristina.

                          BERNICE

                My last chance to have some of you
                rub off on me..
                    (Cristina doesn't
                     understand)
                I'm sorry you're so sad but this
                could have been so much worse.

                             CRISTINA

                       (from her depths)
                How?
      And now Deborah calling "Flor" is getting hard to ignore but
      Flor manages..

                          EVELYN

                    (to Cristina)
                Why don't you run upstairs and say
                goodbye to Deborah?
      Flor flashes a look of thanks.

                          FLOR

                I'll be in front.
      Upset, Cristina runs off. She kisses Bernice..and walks
      toward the house. As she passes under the bedroom..

                          DEBORAH

                Please come see me.
      And then a crying Cristina appears on the deck. Flor glances
      up and keeps moving underneath the deck where she faintly
      hears the beginning of their exchange

                          DEBORAH'S VOICE

                It's okay, honey..we'll see each
                other at school..I'm going to keep
                an eye on you..I will.
      Flor enters the house...

181   INT. KITCHEN - DAY.                                         181

      She stands waiting..walks to the hallway and cranes her head
      to see into rooms, wondering if John is there. Finally, as
      she passes the stairwell, she sees Cristina on an upper
      landing and says, in Spanish, that Cristina should get her
      things and meet her out front. Cristina, agitated, moves off
      to comply...then Deborah appears in the same spot.




                                                             125.








                          DEBORAH

                Please stick your head in here for
                a minute.
      Flor nods and starts up the stairs...

182   INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY                                   182

      Deborah holds open the door while Flor walks inside..then
      closes it.

                          DEBORAH

                What's with avoiding me, am I this
                horrible person?
      As Flor just looks at her.

                          DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                I know. It's a ridiculous question
                but sometimes I'm ridi...

                          FLOR

                No. It's a good question. A fine
                question. Complicated.
                    (beat then)
                I was just thinking to answer.

                           DEBORAH

                Oh stop.   Come on. Weren't we
                close?

                            FLOR

                      (like a shot)
                No.

                          DEBORAH

                    (truly hurt)
                Well, I'm very, very disappointed
                to hear that. It makes me feel like
                a fool.

                          FLOR

                    (compassion forces a
                     crumb)
                We weren't close..but we were
                connected...in a bad way.

                          DEBORAH

                    (strangely soothed)
                You know something, I think we're
                saying the same thing...Look as
                long as we're doing closure..What
                did you and my husband, John, do
                last night?
      Flor pauses for less of a beat than we would have imagined.

                          FLOR

                I can only tell you what I did.




                                                               126.








                          DEBORAH

                That will be sufficient.

                          FLOR

                    (these are tender
                     feelings)
                I became sure of what an incredibly
                lucky woman you are and I must make
                myself not envy you which is hard.
                No, it's not hard. It's impossible.
                Now please..I am exhausted.

                          DEBORAH

                Same here - believe me.
      Deborah would hug..but it's only an eighth of a gesture
      because Flor has turned to exit, calling for her daughter to
      hurry as she goes.

                          FLOR

                Cristina, apúrate.

183   EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - DAY                                    183

      As she exits the house and moves to the gate where she
      punches in the exit code...

      ANGLE ON GATE

      As it swings open to reveal John...

184   EXT. STREET - DAY.                                         184

      As she moves alongside him and the gate closes behind her.

                          JOHN

                I was hanging out here waiting.
                Can't give you guys a lift?
      Flor shakes her head "no." She looks away for a beat so the
      next thing she does is a considered action. She leans forward
      and kisses him on the lips. John looks at her.

                          JOHN (CONT'D)

                This is killer.
                    (on her confusion)
                Incredibly hard.

                          FLOR

                Yes, Cari..
      The gate opens and a sniffling Cristina is holding an armful
      of loot.

                          JOHN

                    (reading Flor)
                Let her have it..party favors.




                                                              127.







      She nods..bites back some emotion and turns from him.

                             FLOR

                Cristina..

                          CRISTINA

                Goodbye, Mr. Clasky..I am very
                sorry we will not see each other as
                frequently.
      She offers her hand, which John shakes while patting her on
      the back.

                             FLOR

                Yes.
      They turn and begin walking down the street.

      SHOT - STONE CANYON

      The women walking toward camera, John briefly in the
      background...As they begin their walk Flor begins talking in
      Spanish.

                          NARRATOR

                The first minute we were alone, my
                mother told me that I would no
                longer go to the private school.

                          CRISTINA

                No. No..You can't. I won't be able
                to forgive you..It will be the end.
                I won't let you.
      And then Cristina moves her hysterics to Spanish as she stops
      walking and her mother takes her hand and pulls her along
      with enormous dedication. CAMERA BEGINS A PULL BACK.
      Cristina dropping presents..picking them up..one of them left
      by the wayside..People noticing..Cristina's conduct violating
      tacit zoning laws.

      CLOSER SHOT..

      So we can see their faces in the struggle.

185   EXT. BUS STOP..                                            185

      As they wait...Flor talks sharply to Cristina to control
      herself.

                          NARRATOR

                My mother changed our lives once
                more. This time because she saw in
                me, to her great alarm, a character
                flaw of some size. She has taught
                me to be a watch dog of my
                character, to control my ambition.
                I am not quite there.




                                                              128.







      One last yelp from Cristina as the bus arrives.

186   INT. BUS - DAY.                                           186

      Almost empty - it's Saturday. Mother and daughter sit
      together by the giant window in the center of the bus.
      Cristina eyes her mother who is bearing her own heartbreak
      with stoic dignity. The girl is becoming less inconsolable
      and more in need of mothering.

                           NARRATOR (CONT'D)

                For that reason should you choose
                to grant me your scholarship my
                mother, at my request, will be
                relocating to the New York
                Metropolitan Area so that she can
                stay close during my time at
                Princeton.
      Cristina moves closer to Flor, who senses it immediately and
      wraps her in her arms.. kisses her head.

                          NARRATOR (CONT'D)

                I hope my essay has done her
                justice. I love her with all my
                heart.

                                                        FADE OUT.

          DISSOLVE RAPIDLY TO:

          1 INT. GEORGETOWN MEDICAL CENTER - RIGHT (SEPTEMBER) 1

          Electric' doors zip open. ALEC NEWBERRY, a handsome
          possessor of The Right Stuff, his beautiful roommate
          LESLIE HUNTER, KEVIN DOLENZ, self-styled, chain-
          smoking, sardonic, and KIRBO KREAGER, short, hyper,
          dressed like a waiter -- dash worriedly into the busy
          emergency room. They are all twenty-two, or barely
          twenty-two. Only four months out of college, they are
          in their freshman year of life.
          Alec, Leslie, Kevin and Kirbo dash past a cubicle, where
          a totally naked, three-hundred-pound man paces in a daze.
          Past this, they find a black nurse talking with two COPS.

                         ALEC
          Wendy Beamish and Billy Hicks?
          They were in a car accident?

                         ELECTRIC DOORS
          zip open again, introducing JULIANNA VAN PATTER (JULES),
          another freshman in life, but her sleek style gives her
          a certain sexual sophistication. She is accompanied by
          her dark, interesting DATE as she joins her friends and
          the Cops.

                         JULES
          They're dead, aren't they?
          Everyone ignores her as Alec hands his card to the Cops.

                         ALEC
          Officers, I'm Alec Newberry with
          Congressman Langston's office.
          Leslie whispers to Jules, while Alec and the Cops talk.

                         LESLIE
          I think they're okay.

                         JULES
          Thank God.

                         (BEAT)
          Are you aware there's a three-
          hundred-pound man walking around
          naked?

          WENDY BEAMISH, a sweet-faced, insecure preppy, emerges
          from a first-aid room with a bandaged forehead.

                         HER FRIENDS
          Wendy. Oh, my God. Are you
          all right???

                         WENDY
          I'm fine. It's the car my father
          gave me for graduation that's
          totalled.

                         ALEC

                         (TO KEVIN)
          Find Billy. See if you can sober
          him up.
          Kevin always does what Alec tells him to. Meanwhile,
          Wendy pulls out her Visa card and speaks to the nurse.

                         WENDY
          How much do I owe you?

                         JULES
          He almost killed you. Destroyed
          your car, and you're paying...?

                         LESLIE
          Jules, please.
          As Leslie comforts her, Wendy is looking over Jules' Date
          who hovers in the distance.

                         WENDY
          Is that your date?
          The naked man wanders past them.

                         JULES
          No, that's my date!
          As usual, Jules has managed to make Wendy laugh, Just as
          the Cops approach her.

                         COP # 1
          You pressing charges?

                         WENDY
          No.

                         KI RBO

          You're a little late, Counselor.
          He's in the van giving blood right
          now.
          The Cops start toward the electric doors as Kirbo and
          Alec follow. Leslie helps Wendy with the bill. CAMERA
          FINDS Jules whispering dramatically to her Date.

                         JULES
          I'll have to be with her all night.
          They don't know if she's going to
          make it.

                         DATE
          She looks fine.

                         JULES
          Shock. She could black out at any
          second... I'll call you...
          Jules joins Leslie and Wendy.

                         LESLIE
          He's cute.

                         JULES
          Too young... and don't you both
          start on your father complex
          theory.

          2 EXT. MEDICAL CENTER 2

          Alec and Kirbo follow the Cops toward a mobile van.

                         KIRBO
          We're dealing with a first offender
          here, and since Ms. Beamish doesn't
          want to press charges, whaddya say
          we just let this one slide,
          Officers?
          They reach the back of the mobile van, where we see BILLY
          HICKS, a handsome daredevil, playing his saxophone,
          wearing handcuffs, for two good-looking nurses and Kevin,
          who is trying to give him black coffee.

                         COP $1
          Okay, you're under arrest.
          Alec looks to Kevin for information about Billy's
          condition.

                         KEVIN
          I wouldn't strike a match near his
          blood.

                         BILLY

                         (TO COPS)
          Hey, watch my sax...

                         (TO NURSES)
          . You girls believe in premarital
          sax?
          They laugh as Alec barks at him.

                         ALEC
          Billy -- four months after
          graduation and you're still
          acting like every night's a
          fraternity party. Aren't you
          even concerned about Wendy?

                         BILLY

                         (TRUE PANIC)
          Wendy? Jesus, how bad is it?

                         KEVIN
          Severe. She might have finally
          exceeded the limit on her father's
          Visa.
          Billy smiles with relief as the Cops lead him toward
          their car.

                         ALEC
          Will you both get serious. He's
          being arrested for drunk driving.

                         BILLY
          Drunk maybe. But I don't know if
          you could call that driving.
          Wendy, Leslie and Jules come from the hospital, just in
          time to see Billy being put into the cop car. Wendy
          rushes to Billy and they embrace.

                         BILLY
          Sorry, babe... sorry.

                         WEHDY
          We'll be right behind you!

          would.

          Dale Biberman. I can't believe
          it. Do you still like Woody Allen
          movies?
          There is a big COMMOTION at the other and of the hail.

          Young professionals, graduate students, and precocious
          undergrads populate the P.J. Clarke-like bar/restaurant.
          Kirbo quickly goes back to work waiting tables. Alec gets
          rid of a group of rowdy undergrads sitting at two tables
          pushed together. He admonishes WALLY, the burly owner.

          four years.
          Alec, Leslie, Jules, Wendy, Kevin and Billy (still with
          sax around his neck) take their usual chairs as Kirbo
          drops off a large pitcher of beer.

                         BILLY
          Hey, I need a real drink.
          Kirbo is long gone. Kevin pours.

          Waiters are like cops. Never

          Kevin and Alec begin bouncing quarters from the edge of a

          So this crummy welfare hospital
          called and remember I told you

          But what about your father?

                         JULES
          Unreachable somewhere in South
          Africa with his new wife, who it
          turns out is only three years older
          than me. And if I don't reach him,
          guess who's going to end up paying
          for that old witch's funeral. Is
          there some insane irony to this or

          You haven't been here since you
          helped me move in...

          Oh, did you move in, too? I only.
          remember 800 pair of shoes.

          Kirbo, wearing a jacket, anxiously waits behind a tree,
          watching a car pull into the parking lot. Dale Biberman
          emerges. Kirbo keeps out of sight, and frantically
          dashes toward a side entrance to the building.

          Kirbo dashes down the hall. Approaching a corner,-he
          immediately achieves nonchalance as he "accidentally"
          runs into Dale at the entrance.

          itself. Right near Lockheed.
          Open some wine.

                         KEVIN
          Looks like it could be put
          together with Leggo blocks. You
          design this?

          I did all the mechanicals for one
          of our senior architects and I think
          he's going to promote me to the
          design staff.
          Kevin is fighting with a ridiculous wine opener.

                         KEVIN
          Maybe you could design a corkscrew
          that actually works. Everything in
          this apartment comes from Scandinavia.
          They don't even have wine in
          Scandinavia.
          Naturally Leslie opens it in a flash.

                         KEVIN
          Do you think my attachment to Alec
          is unnatural?

                         LESLIE
          No, I think mine is. We've only
          just started to live together and
          he's already pushing for 'the
          wedding.'

                         KEVIN
          Well, since you fell in love with
          a Democrat and now he's a

          night of their lives and not go
          insane?

                         KEVIN
          They are insane. Wives, husbands,
          children, love, marriage,
          relationship. It's all insane.

                         LESLIE
          That's what I'm afraid of. Did I
          tell you that my perfect sister
          and her perfect husband are getting
          a perfect divorce-?

          you must have been in love with
          somebody, sometime...

                         KEVIN
          Once, in junior high. I played
          guitar in a group and fellin love
          with our singer who did 'We've Only
          Just Begun' as sweet as Karen
          Carpenter. I got high on cheap
          champagne and pledged my love.
          Next day she ran off with the bass
          player named Rocky and I traded my
          guitar in for a battered Underwood
          typewriter.

          substance.

           bigger -- like marriage -- or one
          day you could make a mistake and

          As Jules connects with her number, Alec starts to head
          out of the hotel in disgust. A beautiful older woman is
          getting her key from the desk and crosses in front of him
          toward the elevators. She and Alec check each other out.
          He smiles. She smiles. As her elevator, arrives, she
          changes her mind and, giving Alec an inviting smile,
          steps into the dimly-lit bar. Alec is torn between
          morality and temptation. Temptation wins as he follows
          the sexy lady.

          She is up the stairs and out of sight. Billy feels
          terrible. He eyes the money on the table and decides
          not to take it. As he opens the front door, white light
          from the moon glares INTO the CAMERA, as Billy moves into

          becomes a ghostlike shape that eventually disappears and

          I have most of the credits from
          when I was going through my

          need is Organic Chemistry which I
          just enrolled in for January.

                         JULES
          So, I went to see my boss and I
          thought he'd say something
          presidential like, 'How can I be
          in banking when I can't even
          balance my own checkbook.' But
          instead, he took me to dinner --
          several times.

                         LESLIE
          I was wondering why you haven't
          been sleeping over. Jules, I
          don't think you should start
          bopping your boss.

                         JULES
          Too late, Leslie. You should see

          Oh, shit.
          All their eyes move across the room, where a very sexy

          Kirbo agonizes, paces and finally rings the bell.

          DALE (V.0.)
          Yes...?
          Kirbo cannot bring himself to speak.

          DALE (V.0.)
          Hello.
          Kirbo is dying to speak, but can't. He quickly charges

          a sudden flash gets her attention.

          An idea for a short story, about
          um, people in Manhattan who, uh,
          who are constantly creating these
          real, uh, unnecessary neurotic
          problems for themselves 'cause it
          keeps them from dealing with, uh,

          You can't keep ringing doorbells
          and running away, calling her and
          hanging up. What are you afraid
          of?

                         KIRBO
          Rejection. Total and devastating.
          As long as she hasn't rejected me,
          there's hope.

                         KEVIN
          I have lived with a secret obsession
          many years myself. However, I
          realize the other person has no
          interest in me -- so I pursue my
          career which is going even more
          unsuccessfully.

                         KIRBO
          Who are you in love with?

                         KEVIN
          I don't have to share everything
          with you...

                         (GRABBING LAUNDRY)
          My underwear is enough. Kirbo, if
          you must pursue this narcissistic
          mortification, that you have decided
          to call love, then you must ask her
          out on a proper date. Like a young
          god. Like Alec, our leader, would.

                         KI RBO
          Alec has balls. He sees things
          with his balls. A ball's-eye view
          so to speak.

          You'll go fluff and fold, someday. 
          Whereas I will still be writing
          obits. I can't even come up with
          a decent piece for the paper to
          show my editor.

                         KIRBO
          I can't help you with your writer's
          block -- until I see that look in
          Dale Biberman's eyes. The look
          that says she knows I'm the one
          for her.

                         KEVIN
          Kirbo, what about all the other
          women you were going out with?

                         KIRBO
          They weren't women. They were
          practice.

                         KEVIN
          You'll never catch me making a
          fool ofmyself over a beautiful
          woman. I know what they're really
          made of. Watch this.

          because we're both worried about
          you.

                         WENDY
          No, Jules, that was the scam that
          Leslie and I worked out because we
          were worried about you.

          bop him for a few years -- get his
          job when he gets caught with his
          hand in the vault. I become a
          legend -- do a black mink ad, but
          get caught in a sex scandal.
          Retire in massive disgrace -- but
          write a huge bestseller and become
          the star of my own talk show.

                         WENDY
          Silly of us to be concerned.

          some fabulous alternatives for my

                         WENDY
          That's another thing. You seem
          obsessed with this woman's dying.
          It's creepy.

                         JULES
          Well, it turned out that cremation
          is almost as expensive as the non-

          I'm going to be a doctor.

                         DALE
          That's not what's going on.
          They pull up in front of her building and get out of the
          car.

                         KIRBO
          Why did you tell me you had to
          work tonight? Why did you lie?

                         DALE
          I didn't want to hurt your
          feelings.

                         KIRBO
          I'm obsessed with you, Dale. I
          have been for four years.

                         DALE
          But you don't even know me.

                         KIRBO
          I know. But I'm obsessed by my
          fantasy of you.
          Dale realizes this man needs some help.

          94 INT. DALE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (MINUTES LATER) 94

           Kirbo is actually entering Dale's apartment. A shrine.

                         DALE
          I'm very average... full of
          flaws...
          She gestures toward her sloppy bedroom.

                         DALE
          I'm a slob.., can't even make a
          bed straight... You ready for
          more...

          She then goes into the tiny kitchen and picks up a large
          garbage bag.

          Here. Watch. Dale Biberman takes
          out her own garbage.
          She opens the apartment door as her roommate, JUDITH,
          arrives home with a bad cold.

                         DALE
          Here's my roommate, Judith. She
          hates me.

                         JUDITH
          I hate her.
          Judith disappears into the bedroom as Dale puts out the
          garbage. Kirbo sits for a moment alone, stunned. Dale
          returns.

                         DALE
          And here's the worst of all...
          When I first decided to be a
          doctor, I thought it was because
          I wanted to serve people. But
          now, well, I'm beginning to get
          this funny feeling that what
          medicine's really all about is
          money... You want some coffee?

                         MIRBO
          It's money, isn't it? That's what
          you're trying to tell me. It's
          'cause I don't have any money!
          Thank you for being so honest.
          He gets up and leaves.

                         DALE

          95 EXT. GEORGETOWN CAMPUS - DAY 95

          CLOSE ON Billy as he walks across the campus and even-
          tually stops.

          96 HIS POV - HIS OLD FRATERNITY HOUSE 96
          A few young men stop their activities when they see
          Billy. Others join. TROY, an undergrad big shot,
          arrives.

                         TROY
          The man. The myth. The legend.
          The one and only Billy the Kid!
          The guys all cheer as they surround Billy.

          97 EXT. CAMPUS - DAY (LATER) 97

          Billy plays football with the younger students. He
          seems happy and home at last. As the others run toward
          the opposite side of the grounds, Billy looks to Troy.

                         TROY
          Like old times, Billy-Boy.

                         BILLY
           You know I've been thinkin', Troy
          6 9 I'd like to get some kind of
          job maybe on campus... you know
          work with the students or the
          fraternity. Maybe coaching or
          something.

                         TROY
          We could use somebody like you
          around, Billy.

                         BILLY

                         (ENCOURAGED)
          Really?

                         TROY
          Yeah. We need somebody to get us
          some good drugs.
          Billy realizes there is no place for him here either.
          He looks up to see Felicia and the baby. He gives the
          football to Troy and slowly walks across the field.

                         BILLY
          Hi, babe...
          There is a long pause.

                         FELICIA

          guy I was goin' with before I met

                         FELICIA
          He came to see me, Billy, and he
          still wants to marry me. And held
          take good care of Melody and I
          could probably get an annulment.

                         BILLY

          I know it's been rough on you.
          But I'll get the right job soon.
          I'll change... I swear it. No

          Kim Sung Ho paces the elegant room.

          KIM SUNG HO
          I work out of my house. You must
          be available twenty-four hours a
          day. Complete discretion and
          loyalty. Five hundred dollars a
          week.
          We now see he is talking to Kirbo.

                         KIRBO
          I'm your man, Mr. Ho.

          KIM SUNG HO
          Your scholastic record is very
          impressive, why would you be
          willing to leave law school for
          essentially a gofer's position?

                         KIRBO
          I don't feel it has any relevancy
          in the world I want to go into.

          KIM SUNG HO
          Which world is that?

                         KIRBO
          The 'real' world. Besides, did
          you know that there are more
          students in law school than there
          are practicing lawyers?

          99 EXT. GEORGETOWN MEDICAL CENTER - DUSK 99

          Winter is on the way. Dale gets out of her car. As she
          starts for the hospital, a limousine pulls up. Kirbo is
          sitting in the back.

                         KIRBO
          I was hand-picked as special
          attache to Kim Sung Ho. You know,
          the famous Korean entrepreneur?
          He quickly holds up a newspaper with Kim on the cover.

                         DALE
          What about medical school?

                         KIRBO
          I have to grab my huge financial
          opportunities while-I can. It's
          all about money, isn't it, Dale?

                         DALE
          Well, good luck.

                         KIRBO
          I'm giving a little party Saturday
          night at Kim's house.
          (handing her card)
          I'd really like to see you there.

                         DALE
          Well, thank you, Kirby. I'll try...
          She smiles sweetly and runs off as Kirbo sits back and
          talks to the female Chauffeur.

                         KI RBO
          She'll be there. You see her
          face when she saw this car?

          Mr. Ho catches you having a party
          in his house Saturday night.
          You'll be out on the street.

                         KIRBO
          He won't be back until Sunday...
          remember, there's an extra hundred
          bucks for you and Kenny to shut up.

          today why everyone's father

          SHOTS of party beginning: Alec, Leslie, Wendy and Howie
          arrive. Other guests arrive, including some regulars
          from St. Elmo's, undergrads and old schoolmates. Billy
          enters and seeing some old frat brothers goes nuts.
          Wendy watches him painfully.

                         KEVIN
          holds court for the undergrads.

                         KEVIN
          The best advice I can give you
          undergrads is to fail. Failure is
          a virtue in today's society. Human
          error is a badge of honor. If
          you're the alcoholic child of a
          celebrity, you can blame them and
          earn a year on the best-seller
          list. If you're a celebrity, your
          mistake will earn you a People
          magazine cover. It's post-
          Watergate morality. Take
          responsibility for your mistakes
          and make a quick buck while you're
          at it.

          Their eyes meet, Wendy quickly looks away and moves down
          the back steps. In a few seconds Billy comes out onto

          personal possessions and extricates a photograph of a
          very ordinary family.

                         KEVIN
          You remember my family.

                         LESLIE
          So I've wandered into a real
          woman trap here, haven't I?

                         KEVIN
          Except you're the first woman
          I've ever been able to get up
          here. And I've blown all my
          props already... So how about
          some brandy?
          Kevin searches for clean glasses in the debris that
          passes for a kitchen, Leslie finds photos and political
          cartoons in his straw box. Eventually, she finds a
          photo of herself, and then another -- followed by dozens
          more. Kevin has an entire homage to her in his secret
          stash. He comes back with the brandy to find her looking
          at the photos.

                         LESLIE
          Am I part of your props?

                         KEVIN

                         (PAINFULLY; SWEETLY)
          No... you're the real thing.
          He quickly starts pouring the brandy as Leslie looks at
          Kevin, almost for the first time.

          117 EXT. WEST VIRGINIA FREEWAY SIGN - NIGHT 117

           It is starting to snow.

          118 INT. WENDY'S CAR - NIGHT 118

           Kirbo drives frantically. As snowflakes begin to hit
           the windshield, he grabs for the windshield wiper. Not
           knowing how it works, he forces it the wrong way. The
          handle comes off in his hand.

                         LESLIE
          Alec was the first. There were
          other guys, in high school, boys
          -- but he was the first love of my
          life. I always wondered if Alec
          and I hadn't ended up in the same
          dorm -- well, I guess I would have
          just found someone else. And so
          would he.

                         KEVIN
          Alec had the luck of geography.
          Whatever we say about Alec we'll
          regret tomorrow.

                         LESLIE
          What do you think about our
          relationship. as an outsider?

                         KEVIN
          Oooo -- dangerous question.

                         (BIG SLUG)
          Sometimes I think I just hang
          around with you and Alec 'cause.
          well, since he introduced me to
          you...

                         LESLIE
          Kevin.

                         KEVIN
          And I think the reason I'm not
          interested in other women... is
          'cause I...

                         LESLIE
          (tears of joy)
          Kevin. All this time right in
          front of us. How could I have
          been so blind?

                         KEVIN
          Leslie, we won't even remember
          this tomorrow.

                         S
          It is tomorrow.
          There is a mad moment of hesitation and then Kevin and
          Leslie smash into each other's arms.

                         KEVIN
          I love you... I've always loved
          you.
          They kiss madly, passionately. They fall to the floor
          in a frenzy. Leslie pulls Kevin's hair.

                         KEVIN
          Aaaaah. Ouch...
          (as she stops)
          No. I love it. I love it!!!
          Leslie grabs onto the large throw rug as they roll around
          the floor. Somehow as they roll and turn, the rug gets
          wrapped around them. Leslie tears at his shirt, as he
          yanks her sweater off. Kevin fights madly with the back
          of Leslie's bra. He is going berserk trying to find the
          clasp.

                         LESLIE
          No... it's in front.
          With a flick of her hand she undoes her bra and opens up
          the wonders of paradise to her old buddy. They kiss
          madly again as they roll in the rug.

          126. SHOTS OF CLOTHES ALL OVER THE ROOM 126
          Leslie and Kevin fuck on the floor, on the coffin, in
          the shower. All over the apartment.

          127 EXT. SHOW-COVERED PENNSYLVANIA TURNPIKE - NIGHT 127

          The worst turnpike in the world. Kirbo swerves on the
          slushy lanes. Fortunately he is the only car on the
          road.

          KIRBO (V.0.)
          Dear Mr. Iacoccoa... Recently, in
          a life and death situation, I
          had the bad luck to use one of
          your so-called luxury cars...
          Finally, he sees a large sign reading: "SEVEN SPRINGS."

          0 Jules' Jeep (with vinyl doors for the winter) cruises
          down the middle of the cold, quiet street.

          120 INT. JEEP - HIGHT 120

          Jules, in a fur coat, is driving Billy home. They both
          are moving kind of slow, having had too much of
          everything.

                         JULES
          Which one is yours? I always
          forget.

                         BILLY
          So do I. You wanna go someplace?
          He points to a house. Jules stops the Jeep.

                         JULES
          Do I. I've had a shit day.

                         BILLY
          I've had a shit year.

                         JULES
          Where do you want to go?

                         BILLY
          The bars are all closed. How 'bout
          your place?

                         JULES
          We're going to my place. Good.
          She STARTS up the JEEP.

                         BILLY
          Jules, you've really grown up into
          a fine-looking woman.

                         JULES
          I don't feel very fine-looking.

                         BILLY
          I've been meaning to ask you
          something all night. What do you
          have on under that skirt?

                         JULES
          You should know.

           Come on -- Gimme some of those
          beautiful lips.
          Jules needs some attention. The hot couple kiss. He
          immediately goes for the gold.

                         JULES
          Billy... enough!

                         BILLY
          Who says?

                         JULES
          I say.

                         BILLY
          Yeah, well, I bet you really won't
          have so much to say with me in
          your mouth.
          He kisses her wildly as she pushes him away aggressively.

                         JULES
          I'm serious, Billy. No!!!
          He grabs the keys from the ignition as the CAR DIES.

                         JULES
          Billy!
          Holding her off with one hand, he shoves the keys into
          his underwear and then sits back grinning.

                         BILLY
          Come and get 'em.

                         JULES
          You shit!!!
          She attacks him, biting his hands, his neck and his
          chest. Billy shrieks with laughter and pain.

          121 EXT. JEEP - NIGHT 121

          He tumbles out of the Jeep, onto the street, laughing and
          shouting. Jules tumbles right after him, belting, pinch-
          ing, biting. As she goes to kick him, Billy slides
          between her legs and looks up under her skirt.

                         BILLY
          Ultimate...

          â¢ She sits down an his chest, undoes his pants and gets her
          keys. Felt up with all, she heads back to the Jeep.

                         JULES
          I really needed you tonight.

                         BILLY
          Nell, just get back in the Jeep
          and assume the missionary
          position.

                         JULES
          You break my heart. You break
          everybody's heart.
          She drives off in the Jeep. Billy fumbles with his pants
          and then turns toward his house. Felicia, holding their
          baby, stands watching from the porch. Obviously having
          seen most of this, she silently goes back into the house,.
          locks the door and turns out the light. Alone, drunk and
          bewildered, Billy starts moving away from the house real-
          izing he has no place to go.

                         40
          Kirbo is still driving frantically, but, without the
          windshield wipers, snow is building rapidly on the wind-
          shield.

          123 EXT. CAR - MIGHT 123

          Kirbo, with one hand on the wheel, hangs out of the car
          using his left hand to wipe off the snow. It's cold.

                         KIRBO
          Shit... Goddammitt...

          124 IHT. CAR - MIGHT 124
          He searches the dashboard frantically.

                         KIRBO
          Heater. Where's the defroster???
          He rams and jams every button and knob in sight as he
          weaves dangerously on the freeway. Eventually one of the
          levers comes off in his hand.

                         KIRBO
          Dear Mr. Iacoccoa... I recently
          had the misfortune of using one
          of your, so-called, new luxury
          cars in an emergency situation.
          So much for American enterprise!

          â¢ Kirbo tries to stop the car in front of a cabin, but
          it slides further than he had planned and almost hits
          it. Getting out and trudging through the snow, in his
          party clothes. he bangs on the door.

          MAX (V.O.)
          Who is it?

          Kirby Kreager! And who the hell
          are you?
          The door swings open and there stands GUY, a handsome
          thirty-year-old wrapped in a blanket. Dale comes from
          the bedroom, fastening a man's robe and staring at Kirbo
          in disbelief.

                         DALE
          Kirby? What are you doing here?
          His entire world has collapsed. He can't swear, shout
          or cry -- he can only dash toward the car frantically.
          Falling in the snow once or twice, he eventually jumps
          into the car and tries to peel out, but it just spins
          in the snow. Meanwhile Guy has put on heavy boots and
          comes running out to the car where Kirbo stands on the
          gas to no avail.

                         DALE
          Kirby, stop. Come inside.
          He ignores her maniacally as he keeps desperately trying
          to get out of there.

                         GUY
          You've got no skid chains or snow
          tires. You've got no traction.
          Kirbo ignores them.

                         DALE
          Kirby, please!

                         GUY
          You-'re not gonna get out of here
          tonight. You better come back
          inside.

          He wants to stay in the car.

                         DALE
          He'll freeze!!!
          She begins pulling on her boots as Guy tries to reason
          with Kirby.

                         GUY
          People have died out here.

                         KIRBO
          Leave me alone. I'm not your
          responsibility!
          Dale has joined them.

                         DALE
          By driving up here, you've made
          us responsible for you. Now
          come inside.

          129 INT. CABIN - NIGHT (MINUTES LATER) 129

          Kirbo sits in front of the fire wrapped in a blanket.
          Guy goes back into the bedroom as Dale finishes making
          a bed for him on the sofa.

                         DALE
          Your clothes should be dry in a
          few hours.

                         KIRBO
          He's a doctor, isn't he?

                         DALE
          Here are some pajamas.

                         KIRBO
          You expect me to wear his pajamas?

                         DALE
          We'll talk in the morning.
          She joins Guy, in the bedroom and closes the door. Kirbo
          is left with the pajamas and his desperate anguish.

          The room is destroyed as Leslie and Kevin lie on the
          floor blissfully in each other's arms. They hear the
          front DOOR OPEN.

                         KEVIN
          Kirbo?

          ALEC (O.S.)
          No, it's Alec.
          Kevin and Leslie look at each other frantically.

          night about school... How sex
          was always a barometer,'especially,
          at the fraternity. The more women
          you got, the more of a man you
          were... or thought you were... I
          thought I was.

          Leslie enters carrying several empty cardboard boxes.
          She shakes off her many emotions and tries to efficiently
          gather her things. Beginning with record albums, she
          accidentally knocks an ashtray to the floor.

                         LESLIE
          Shit.
          As she picks up the broken pieces, the door opens from
          the bedroom. Alec appears, looking horrible, in his
          bathrobe.

                         LESLIE
          I especially took off work because
          I thought you wouldn't be here.

          Leslie's stuff is still in boxes. Kevin fixes a fire
          as Leslie re-reads his article, sipping champagne.

          school, I'm going to work part-
          time for a law firm. Did you know
          there are as many people in law
          school as there are practicing
          lawyers?

                         KEVIN
          Sounds familiar.

                         KIRBO
          How'd she put the rubber on with
          her mouth?

          156 INT. LARGE GLAMOROUS INTERNATIONAL BANKING OFFICES - DAY 156

          A well-dressed female executive secretary looks disturbed
          as she enters a formidable office. She returns with a
          distinguished GENTLEMAN in a grey suit. He approaches
          Leslie who is waiting anxiously.

                         GENTLEMAN
          Yes, may I help you?

                         LESLIE
          I want to see Forrester Davidson
          Jr.

                         GENTLEMAN
          I am Forrester Davidson Jr.
          Leslie is shocked and even more confused.

                         LESLIE
          Well, there must be some mistake.
          I've come to see Julianna van
          Patten and they told me she
          doesn't work here anymore.

          157 INT. SENATOR HODGES' HEADQUARTERS - AFTERNOON (NOVEMBER) 157

          Busy. Active. Alec is on a phone and talking to co-
          workers at the same time. He looks up to see Leslie,
          very shaken, waiting across the room. He is immediately
          angered, but eventually gets off the phone and joins
          her.

                         ALEC
          Did you forget one of your albums?

                         LESLIE
          I'm sorry to bother you here.
          It's Jules. After she left for
          work this morning, the finance
          company came and took away all
          her furniture, her Jeep, everything
          they could get their hands on...
          I couldn't reach her so I finally
          went over to her office. Alec --
          she was fired three weeks ago!
          All this time, she's been
          pretending to go to work every day
          , and pretending to be still
          having this affair with her boss.
          And she's been doing a lot of coke
          .. Well, anyway, I confronted her
          at the apartment, and at first she
          denied everything, but then she
          went crazy -- and now she's locked
          herself in the apartment and she
          won't let me back in... I'm really
          worried about her.
          Alec hesitates angrily.

                         LESLIE
          Alec, please. I need your help.

          Alec knocks on the door with Leslie.

                         ALEC
          Jules, open the door.
          Leslie puts her key in the door.

          159 INT. JULES' APARTMENT - CLOSE ON DOOR - DAY (LATE) 159

           Dead locks and a heavy bolt prevent it from opening.

           She's in there.

          â¢ Jules, come on. Just open the
          door.

          160 INT. JULES' APARTMENT 160

          The main room is empty and dark, except for Jules, who
          sits on the floor dressed only in a thin T-shirt and
          bikini pants. Thin, tired, no makeup, this is a differ-
          ent Jules than we have seen before. Freezing winds shoot
          through the open window.

          161 INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY 161


                         ALEC
          Jules, remember my junior year
          when I went cold turkey on
          cigarettes? You sat up with me
          all night in the commons room
          feeding me emergency carrots...?
          No answer.

                         LESLIE
          Jules, if you don't let us in, we're
          going to have to call the police.
          There is a beat and then Jules speaks from the depths of
          hell.

          JULES (O.S.)
          I'll throw myself out the window
          before they get through the door.

                         LESLIE
          Not my greatest ploy.

                         ALEC
          Jules, remember the time I flunked
          art history and I was trying to
          drink myself to death...
          Kevin and Kirbo come dashing up the stairs breathlessly.

                         KIRBO
          How is she?

                         LESLIE
          She just threatened to throw
          herself out the window.
          Kevin and Alec have a moment of awkwardness.

                         LESLIE
          The fire escape!

          Alec, Kevin and Kirbo climb up the fire escape. They
          arrive at the second floor to find burglar proof grill-
          work locked in place, but the windows are still wide open.

          Through the iron bars they see Jules.

                          ALEC
           Jules, what are you doing? You'll
           freeze...
           He stops.

                          KEVI N
           To death. Exactly!
           The three young men start tearing at the bars frantically.

          165 INT. HALLWAY 165

          Leslie pounds on the door.

                         LESLIE
          Jules, you're really scaring me
          now.

          166 EXT. JULES' FIRE ESCAPE - LATE AFTERNOON 166

          Alec, Kevin and Kirbo cannot budge the bars.

                         KEVIN
          The whole country is.falling apart,
          but these five bars are made
          perfectly.

                         ALEC
          We need something that cuts
          through metal.

                         KEVIN
          Or an experienced thief.

                         KIRBO
          I'll find Billy.
          Kirbo dashes down the fire escape.

                         KEVIN
          I was kidding.

          Billy's working at the big Chevron
          station on Michigan. He must have
          a hacksaw or something...
          Kirbo takes off on his bike as Alec looks at Kevin.

                         ALEC
          Billy is working in a gas
          station???

                         KEVIN
          He needed the money.
          Suddenly, Alec and Kevin become aware that they are
          alone.

                         ALEC
          I saw your article.

                         KEVIN
          Yeah, well, yesterday's editorial
          achievement is today's garbage
          wrapper, right...?
          Kevin tries to laugh charmingly. Alec tries to laugh
          along with him, but suddenly rage returns.

                         ALEC
          You little shit!!!
          He grabs Kevin. Kevin tries to fight back, but Alec is
          so overpowering he pushes Kevin up to the railing of the
          fire escape, and then pushes him over. Kevin hangs
          upside down as Alec holds him by his legs. Dozens of
          scraps of paper fall from his pocket.
          Leaning out the apartment hallway window, Leslie sees
          them.

                         LESLIE
          Alec, no!!!

          Leslie runs screaming through the hall and down the
          stairs, passing Ron Dellassandro who is just coming home
          from work.

                         RON
          What's happening???

           Kevin, still hanging upside down, tries to hang on to
           Alec. Papers continue to fly.

                          KEVIN
           My notes!

                          ALEC
          You won't need any more notes on
          the meaning of life.

          (upside-down,

                         STRAINING)
          I'm kinda betting on you not doing
          it, Al... think of your political
          career.
          Leslie runs into the alley underneath them.

                         LESLIE
          Alec, stop Iit!
          She frantically starts climbing the fire escape.

          I feel I've done a lot for you,
          too, Al... so pull me up and we'll
          call it even.

                         ALEC
          What you did for me was take the
          woman I was going to marry.
          The woman he was going to marry arrives frantically onto
          their landing. She struggles with Alec.

                         LESLIE
          Alec, stop it right now!
          Below them, Billy and Kirbo pull up in a Chevron tow
          truck. Billy, wearing Chevron coveralls, jumps out with
          an acetylene torch in hand, shouting.

                         BILLY
          Looks pretty ultimate up there...

          You think this is helping Jules?
          With Kevin's life still in his hands, he suddenly
          remembers Jules.

          Are you all right?
          Kirbo tries to get the dolly up the fire escape with
          Billy.

                         KIRBO
          Hey! Help.
          Kevin goes down the fire escape to help him, leaving Alec
          and Leslie alone. Leslie kneels by the window with her
          hands on the iron bars and speaks to Jules.

                         LESLIE
          Oh, my God. Jules, please, it's
          so cold.

          Very noble how you ran up here to
          save your lover.

          Hang on, Jules. We all love you.
          She has been holding onto the bars with her bare-hands,
          but the bitter cold makes her wince as she removes her
          hands. Alec is overwhelmed with feelings as he takes her
          hands and holds them to his mouth, breathing warm breath
          onto them. Much emotion passes between them.

                         LESLIE
          Your breath, your breath is so
          sweet.

          ALEC.
          Leslie, I'm sorry. I'm so
          profoundly sorry.
          Kirbo and Kevin arrive. Billy races down the alley.

          Blowtorch, anyone?

                         ALEC
          Give it to me.

          Do not hand him a blowtorch!
          Kevin takes the torch and goes for the bars. SPARKS and
          fire fly. Suddenly there is a PHENOMENAL POUNDING from
          inside the apartment at Jules' front door. It stops
          everyone on the fire escape.

          I was thinkin' of hanging around
          tryin'to be one of those in-the-
          neighborhood dads... but it would
          just confuse everybody... especially
          me. New York'll suit me fine. if

          This is great.

                         WENDY
          I'll tell you what's great. Last
          night I woke up in the middle of
          the night and made myself a peanut
          butter and jelly sandwich... and
          you know it was my kitchen, and
          my refrigerator and My apartment
          . and it was the best peanut
          butter and jelly sandwich I've
          ever had in my life.
          They chuckle together and then they become more serious.

                         WENDY
          So you're goin', huh...?
          She picks up his sax and blows a few comic notes.

                         BILLY
          So, are you still a virgin?

                         WENDY
          Why is my sexual status so
          important to you?

                         BILLY
          Have I abused our relationship too
          much? Or could I be so bold... as
          to ask you for a going-away present...?

          tenderness and love that can only exist from the years
          they have shared together.

          181 EXT. BUS TERMINAL - NIGHT 181

          A large bus pulls out as Leslie stands at a coffee
          vending machine. Alec approaches.

                         ALEC
          Need someone to blow on your hands?
          She smiles, but shows him her gloves. As she searches
          for change in her pockets, Alec stops her and puts his
          own coins in the machine. He presses buttons as he
          talks.

                         ALEC
          Did you know that I.always wanted
          to make you coffee? I tried once
          -- when you were in the shower --
          but it didn't turn out right, so I
          threw it out and cleaned everything
          up so you wouldn't know. I don't
          like doing things I'm not good at
          -- like making coffee and saying
          I'm sorry...
          He looks at her sincerely as he hands her the plastic cup
          from the machine.

                         ALEC
          Leslie, I'm sorry.
          They exchange a tender glance, and then Leslie takes a
          sip from the steaming cup.

                         LESLIE
          Alec, this is soup.

                         ALEC
          What?

                         LESLIE
          This is soup.
          Alec's nervousness turns to embarrassment as they both
          start to laugh. Old feelings surge.

                         LESLIE
          I love you.
          They look at each other for a moment.

                         LESLIE
          We need time.

                         ALEC

          shakes hands with the guys at the same time. Wendy waits
          until last and then they embrace emotionally.

          No, you won't.
          He wants to say more to all of them, but the bus is wait-
          ing and he hops on it. The door closes and the bus backs
          out of the terminal. Billy stands near the driver and
          waves out at them.

                         HIS FRIENDS
          watch him pull away.

                         BUS
          As it pulls backward, we can see Billy with his friend's
          reflections on the bus's windshield SUPERIMPOSED OVER his.

               EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               The wail of a siren grows out of the distance and very faintly 
               through the fog we see the headlights and flashing blue rack 
               lights of a police car coming toward us. It drops into a 
               dip, reappears almost immediately, hurtling down the center 
               of the deserted highway. It gets closer and closer until the 
               lights and siren fill our senses then zooms past us.

               INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT

               A frightened SECURITY GUARD is tensed forward off the back 
               seat, his hands clutched into the fabric between the two 
               regular POLICE OFFICERS in front.

                                     GUARD
                              (an edge of fear in 
                              his voice)
                         It's coming up... Slow down...
                              (he points out between 
                              them)
                         There, right there...

               Through the windshield we can see the headlights pick up a 
               billboard announcing a 'new' housing development.

               EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               The squad car skids off the asphalt in front of the sign and 
               starts up a rutted dirt road. The sign tells us we are headed 
               for 'Pinewood Estates,' a housing development financed by 
               the Farmers Bank of Wisconsin.

               INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT

               The Security Guard is becoming more agitated. He wipes a 
               cold sweat off his brow. The blue flashers reflect off the 
               fog onto the faces of the men. Suddenly the Security Guard 
               lunges forward and slaps off the rack lights and siren.

                                     OFFICER
                              (startled)
                         Benny, God, take it easy...

                                     BENNY (GUARD)
                         I don't want to scare them away.

               The two Police Officers exchange an indulgent look.

               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT

               Using only its parking lights, the police car creeps up the 
               dirt road between skeletons of unfinished houses.

               INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT

               The windows are rolled down. Periodically one of the men 
               leans out for a better look at the terrain around them.

                                     SECOND OFFICER
                         Smells smoke...

                                     BENNY
                         I told you.

               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT

               The police car comes around a curve on the hillside and stops. 
               Above them on the next hill, a necklace of embers from a 
               grass fire and a burning tree flicker through the fog. The 
               men get out of the car.

                                     BENNY
                              (loud whisper)
                         There!! Up on the hill!!

               The officer steps forward for a better look. Benny hangs on 
               his shoulder.

                                     BENNY
                         Right in line with that burning tree.

                                     OFFICER
                         I don't see anything.

                                     BENNY
                         It's there. The fog's thicker now, 
                         but it's there. What do you think 
                         started those fires?

               The officer strains to see through the fog.

                                     OFFICER
                         Benny, there's nothing there.

                                     BENNY
                         There is. They came out of the belly 
                         of the ship and then went to the 
                         first terrace and flew down into the 
                         houses.

                                     OFFICER
                         Flew?! Oh, come on Benny...

               The second officer is peering intently at something down 
               among the houses.

                                     OFFICER
                         You hear that, Mike? Now he's telling 
                         us...

                                     MIKE (SECOND OFFICER)
                         What's that?

               Benny and the officer look to where Mike is pointing. What 
               appears to be the beam of a powerful headlight bobs among 
               the houses below them. Further into the track another beam 
               of light moves slightly from right to left but seems otherwise 
               stationary.

                                     BENNY
                         What did I tell you?

                                     OFFICER
                         Probably kids.

               One of the lights rises over a house and settles on the other 
               side.

                                     MIKE
                              (not convinced)
                         Probably...

               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT

               A light shines directly into our eyes. As it swings away 
               from us we realize that it was the searchlight on the police 
               car which is idling along the dirt road with its running 
               lights off. The fire on the hill gives the fog down here a 
               red tint.

               INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT

               The police officers are beginning to feel anxious. Benny's 
               nervous fidgeting in the back seat doesn't help them any.

                                     BENNY
                         Don't you think you should call a 
                         backup?

                                     OFFICER
                         No, we can handle this.

               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT

               The police car passes a road perpendicular to the one it is 
               on. A couple of houses down that road a faint glow spills 
               over the sides of an industrial dumpster. As we watch we 
               hear an eerie high pitched whistle, a shaft of light slowly 
               rises out of the metal box and seems to fly off between the 
               houses.

               INT. FINISHED HOUSE - NIGHT

               As a humanoid silhouette passes in front of the picture 
               window, a shaft of light floats by in the fog outside. The 
               silhouette continues around to look at the kitchen. It raises 
               a hand to eye level. There is a sharp "SNAP" and a hard-edged 
               cone of light shoots out of the darkness to capture the inside 
               of the kitchen and pulls back a three-dimensional image of 
               stove, sink, cupboards, electrical fixtures and walls to the 
               silhouette.

               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT

               The police car is parked in the middle of the dirt road. 
               Benny and the officers are intent on a light that reaches 
               them only in strobes as it moves through the houses in the 
               direction of the fire on the hill. The police searchlight 
               swings onto the house.

                                     OFFICER
                              (over outside speakers)
                         This is the police. Identify 
                         yourselves.

               It is deathly silent.

               Carrying a shotgun the officer motions Benny and Mike to fan 
               out on either side of him and, guns drawn, they cut across 
               the tract to where they last saw the bobbing light.

               The fog quickly isolates them, heightening their fear. Each 
               man becomes acutely aware of the loudness of his breathing 
               and the crunch of his footsteps on the ground. They drift in 
               and out of visual contact with each other.

               Benny freezes as he hears a burst of the high pitched whistle 
               sweep by on his left. He turns slowly to see, through the 
               ribs of an unfinished house, a shaft of the white light 
               pointing at a cement mixer.

                                     BENNY
                              (to the officers, his 
                              voice cracking)
                         There's one over here...

               The brilliant light swings toward him. Benny, his hands 
               trembling, raises the gun.

                                     BENNY
                         Stop!! Police!!

               The light fixes on Benny and terrified he shakes off a couple 
               shots. The light goes out immediately.

                                     MIKE
                              (in Benny's direction)
                         What happened?

                                     BENNY
                         I think I shot one.

                                     MIKE
                         Jesus, Benny. What are you doing?

               INT. FINISHED HOUSE (BEDROOM) - NIGHT

               We are looking at the back of the humanoid figure. It crosses 
               to a high window and looks out. The reddish tinge of the fog 
               outlines him.

               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT

               The men strain to see something through the silent fog.

                                     OFFICER
                         You see anything, Mike?

               Before Mike can answer, a strange percussive clicking sound 
               is heard. He pumps a shell in the chamber of his shotgun and 
               swallowing his fear moves toward the voices. They stop.

                                     OFFICER
                         This is the police. Identify 
                         yourselves.

               Benny, his flashlight throwing a feeble beam in front of 
               him, inches around the house looking for what he shot at. He 
               gets to where it should be but it's not there. His light 
               searches the area. There is nothing but a stack of lumber. 
               Shaking visibly he shuffles to it and peers around its corner. 
               Nothing. Benny relaxes and allows himself to breathe again.

                                     BENNY
                              (shouts to the officers)
                         You wanna give me some help over 
                         here.

                                     MIKE
                         Okay...

               Benny continues around the house. He flashes his light into 
               a doorway. There is nothing but framing. When he moves on, a 
               figure steps out of the darkness to fill the space, then 
               raises its arms. With a sharp snap cylindrical devices swing 
               off its wrist into its hands.

               At the corner of the house Benny hears the snap and stops. 
               The high pitched whistle starts behind him. He stumbles around 
               to face a brilliant white light flying directly at him. Benny 
               screams in terror and fires at it. The light swerves and a 
               laser streak from one of the hand rockets sears Benny's chest 
               and knocks him to the ground in pain. Holding his shoulder 
               he watches the light rise and fall erratically between the 
               houses.

               The officers watch in awe as the beam wobbles through the 
               air, then crashes to the earth.

                                     OFFICER
                         Mike, call for back-up.
                              (shouting)
                         Benny, you all right?

                                     BENNY
                         I don't think so...
                              (clutching his shoulder)

                                     OFFICER
                              (waving the beam of 
                              his flashlight, shouts)
                         Benny, this is me. I'm going to take 
                         a look.

               Benny's beam flashes back.

                                     BENNY
                         Don't leave me. I'm coming.

               The two men begin to trot toward the light. It swings wildly 
               around and, accompanied by the high-pitched whistle, starts 
               to stagger back up the hill. Benny and the officer break 
               into a run. They are on their way up the hill when the light 
               in front of them crashes to the earth. It rolls over and 
               lays still, the beam shooting straight up into the air. Benny 
               and the officer slow their pursuit, terrified of what they 
               might find. Suddenly a high-pitched whistle is bearing down 
               on them from behind. Before they can turn a light rockets 
               over their heads. With a rumble the hill begins to vibrate. 
               As they follow its flight, they see lights beginning to ripple 
               to life across the skin of a saucer-shaped spacecraft resting 
               at the edge of the forest on top of the hill. With a rumble 
               the hill begins to vibrate. Frightened, the officers stop.

               INT. FINISHED HOUSE - NIGHT

               The humanoid figure walks rapidly down the hall into the 
               kitchen. An indistinct image plays on the inside of its 
               faceplate and we hear the faint sounds of a percussive 
               language. Through the window over the sink we can see the 
               lights of the spaceship.

               The rockets flip into the humanoid's gloved hands and it is 
               airborne out the open back door.

               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT

               From the road Benny and the officer watch as the humanoid 
               figure that just blasted over them flies between the trees 
               and into the white light emitting from the underbelly of the 
               spacecraft. The noise from the ship's power plant is deafening 
               as it begins to rise above the trees.

               With Mike at the wheel the police car, its rack lights 
               flashing, fishtails up the dirt road and slides sideways to 
               a bone-jarring stop next to Benny and the officer. As they 
               jump out of the way they find themselves facing into the 
               super white beam of the figure that was in the house. They 
               are between it and the ship. At the angle that it is coming 
               up the hill, the light looks like it is heading directly for 
               them. This is too much for the officer and in terror he raises 
               his shotgun and fires wildly at it. The figure veers off and 
               disappears into the fog.

               With an awesome roar the spacecraft reaches escape velocity 
               and hurtles into the night sky. The concussion waves knock 
               Benny and the officers off their feet.

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

               The escaped figure's light comes out of the fog at tree 
               height. We hear the high-pitched whistle of its rockets. A 
               burst of percussive language comes from behind the faceplate.

               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT

               The fires on the hillside have been renewed. Shaking, Benny 
               and the officer rise to their feet and start toward the light 
               shafting straight up from the figure lying on the hillside. 
               The only sound is police chatter coming out of the radio in 
               the open squad car.

               EXT. LOGGING ROAD - NIGHT

               An 18-wheeler with a load of logs lumbers past us.

               INT. TRUCK - NIGHT

               It feels cozy with the wipers slapping the rain off the 
               windshield. The DRIVER is trying to steal a cigarette out of 
               his snoring PARTNER'S pocket without waking him up. He gets 
               one and reaches for the lighter.

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

               The escaped figure banks around a blind corner.

               INT. TRUCK - NIGHT

               The driver gets a glimpse of something in his headlights and 
               slams on the brakes, but it is too late. The figure hits the 
               spoiler above the cab. We hear the smack of impact. One of 
               its boots scars the windshield.

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

               The figure bounces off the jack-knifing truck and like a 
               wounded bird tumbles through the air into the trees. With 
               the light spinning crazily, it plunges through the boughs 
               and smashes face first into the mud at the bottom of an 
               embankment. The strip lights on the sides of its helmet go 
               out.

               EXT. TRUCK - NIGHT

               The driver and his partner, standing in the shafts of the 
               high beams, are peering into the woods.

                                     PARTNER
                         What the hell was it anyway?

                                     DRIVER
                         Damned if I know.

               EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

               The figure thrashes over on its back and tries to close a 
               shoulder-to-hip tear in its life-support suit. By the faint 
               identification light that flickers on and off inside its 
               helmet, we see a MAN FROM THE STARS. His skin is translucent 
               coral. He is gasping as our atmosphere mixes with his and 
               threatens to suffocate him.

               Under his translucent skin a maze of veins and arteries extend 
               from a white mass that sits in the upper half of his head. 
               He is hairless. Underneath a graceful fore-head, transparent 
               eyelids droop over black pupilless eyes. The thin lips that 
               delineate his mouth are chalk-white.

               He tries to clutch the edges of the tear together but is too 
               weak. His hands drop limply from the suit, allowing the rent 
               to gape open and reveal the translucent body underneath.

                                     PARTNER (V.O.)
                         Come on. I'm getting wet.

                                     DRIVER (V.O.)
                         It musta been a bird.

                                     PARTNER (V.O.)
                         How about if I drive now?

               Behind the faceplate a piece of white light breaks off from 
               the shining mass in the STAR MAN'S head and moves down his 
               neck. Through the hole in the suit we see it arrive at the 
               top of his single lung. The white light spreads throughout 
               the organ like a phosphorescent tide. The STAR MAN lapses 
               into unconsciousness as we hear the truck pull away.

               INT. HELICOPTER (COCKPIT) - DAWNBREAK

               A light rain is falling.

               We are looking through the windscreen at the gray landscape 
               passing under the helicopter. MARC SHERMIN, a grizzled man 
               in his mid-fifties with an honest stubborn face, shifts his 
               attention from the right side to the left side of the craft. 
               Below him he can see the road leading into the housing tract 
               is blocked by police cars. The helicopter leans into a banking 
               turn and the spacecraft's blackened landing site comes into 
               view. Below it an orange nylon tent has been erected over 
               the dead extraterrestrial. It glows from the inside. An Air 
               Force helicopter is parked on the other side of the burn.

               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - DAWNBREAK

               A man in a white contamination suit is helping Benny and the 
               two officers into the Air Force helicopter. The three men 
               are glassy-eyed and wrapped in blankets. Benny has a bandage 
               across his chest. They look up at Shermin's descending 
               helicopter. They are still looking at it when they disappear 
               inside.

               Shermin's unmarked S65 settles on the clearing. The nose 
               door is open and Shermin, carrying the hood of his 
               contamination suit, comes down the ladder. A tall homespun 
               man, also in a hoodless contamination suit, steps forward to 
               greet him.

                                     MAN
                              (around a cigarette)
                         Major Aaron Bell...

                                     SHERMIN
                         Marc Shermin, National Security 
                         Agency.

               Shermin takes a moment to look over at the tent, the green 
               hillside and the forest beyond. It is pastoral in the soft 
               light of dawn.

                                     SHERMIN
                         This has always been my favorite 
                         time of day.

                                     MAJOR BELL (MAN)
                         Very beautiful country up here...

                                     SHERMIN
                         Any signs of biological contamination, 
                         excessive radiation, anything like 
                         that?

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         Not on the landscape. We're trying 
                         to get a tube under the faceplate 
                         for a reading on possible deadly 
                         lifeforms but it's hard going.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Can you see under the faceplate?

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         No.

               Bell's hands shake as he lights a new cigarette off the one 
               in his mouth.

                                     SHERMIN
                         There's a good chance you could be 
                         wrong about this thing then...

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         Wait'll you see it.

               He throws away the cigarette and begins to put on his 
               contamination hood. Shermin follows as they start for the 
               tent.

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         We had a flight of F16's play tag 
                         with the spaceship over Michigan for 
                         an hour. Then it shot straight up 
                         and disappeared.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Was there visual contact?

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         No, sir. Radar.

                                     SHERMIN
                         It could have been anything.

               EXT. BLACKENED LANDING SITE - DAWNBREAK

               Hooded, Bell and Shermin make their way past three suited 
               scientists examining the landscape with geiger counters and 
               other sensing instruments. With the coming of dawn and Bell's 
               handlight we can clearly see the pod indentations and the 
               huge black glass cup of earth that was fused by the energy 
               blasting out of the spaceship's power plant.

                         After I called in, I had a chance to 
                         sit down with the three locals. They 
                         swear there's another one that didn't 
                         make the ship... It might be alive.

                         I've been investigating sightings 
                         for seventeen years, Mr. Shermin. 
                         This one's real. We have a dead extra-
                         terrestrial in that tent and another 
                         one in the area that might be alive. 
                         We've been visited. It's finally 
                         happened and the sooner Washington 
                         accepts that and starts figuring out 
                         how we're going to deal with these 
                         beings, the better off we're going 
                         to be.

               EXT. FOOT OF EMBANKMENT - DAWNBREAK

               It is still raining.

               The STAR MAN stirs and awakens with a start. He parts the 
               tear in his suit and looks at his lung through his translucent 
               body. It has changed in color from brown to a rich yellow 
               ocher. He takes several deep breaths of our atmosphere and 
               his lung expands and contracts easily. He conducts a quick 
               inventory of his damaged spacesuit, then struggles to his 
               knees and stands up.

               INT. BIOQUARANTINE TENT (HOUSING TRACT) - DAWNBREAK

               The sound of a powerful slow-speed drill greets Bell and 
               Shermin as they enter. The extraterrestrial is still on its 
               back with its helmet lights shining straight up. A hose that 
               extends from a portable gas chromatograph has been suction-
               sealed to a corner of the faceplate. A SCIENTIST is making 
               adjustments at the chromatograph while his COMPANION is 
               monitoring the progress of the drill into the faceplate. 
               Both are wearing contamination suits.

               A foam-lined coffin-shaped metal box is on the ground next 
               to one of the walls. Bell and Shermin approach the body. 
               Shermin's first look is at the faceplate, but all he can see 
               is his own reflection. His eyes travel down the body.

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         Look at the hands.

               The gloved hands of the figure have only three fingers and a 
               thumb.

               Shermin takes Bell's flashlight. He angles it at the 
               faceplate. As he leans in to follow the beam, the pitch of 
               the drill rises. He shifts the light. The drill breaks through 
               and the faceplate explodes out of the helmet. The men throw 
               themselves back in panic. When they turn back to look, 
               distorted impressions of the face inside the helmet reflect 
               on the glass of their contamination hoods. (Pause)

                                     SHERMIN
                         Oh, Jesus.

                                     MAJOR BELL
                              (moving toward the 
                              body)
                         We better get it into the box. Come 
                         on...

               The other men approach the body but before they can bend to 
               it a burst of percussive language, followed by a low buzz, 
               comes from inside the extraterrestrial's helmet. The men 
               freeze. There is another burst of percussive language and a 
               projection beam shoots out of the helmet throwing the image 
               of the escaped STAR MAN onto one of the scientists. He jumps 
               aside and the beam falls out of focus and indistinct on the 
               tent wall behind him.

                         The other one is alive!

               EXT. FOOT OF EMBANKMENT - DAWNBREAK

               The STAR MAN is standing. We hear the sounds of his percussive 
               language coming from behind his mirrored faceplate.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (subtitle)
                         Mapmaker Wind. Do you hear me?

               His answer is nothing but the low buzz. He taps a series of 
               buttons on his chest panel and speaks again.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Mapmaker Wind. Do you hear me?

               Again the buzz.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Mapmaker Wind. Do you hear me?

               The buzz continues. He is very still for a moment. Then he 
               presses the palms of his hands together, prayer fashion, and 
               concentrates. When he pulls them apart, a blue force field 
               pulses between them. He stops at shoulder width. A solarized 
               aerial view of the United States forms on the force field. A 
               green dot appears in the area of western Wisconsin, a red 
               dot in the area of Death Valley, California. He drops his 
               hands to his lap and sits very still. The solarized compass 
               remains floating in the air in front of him. After a long 
               moment he reaches up and squeezes it into a ball that 
               disappears when his palms come together.

               INT. HELICOPTER - DAWNBREAK

               Shermin steps through the open bay door into a communications 
               room. The radar and radio consoles each have a TECHNICIAN. A 
               third technician, LYMAN, sits in front of a square of six 
               medium-sized television screens.

                                     LYMAN
                         Is it for real?

                         Get Fox.

               Lyman taps a code into the computer keyboard. There's a shower 
               of static on one of the TV screens. When it clears up GEORGE 
               FOX, mid-forties, hair slicked straight back, round wire-
               rimmed glasses, is peering intently into the camera.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (before Fox can speak)
                         It's real, George.

                                     FOX
                         There's no mistake? You're absolutely

                                     SHERMIN
                         I saw it with my own eyes. We've 
                         killed an extraterrestrial and...

                                     FOX
                         Is there any possibility that it's a

                         None. And there's another one in the 
                         area that's alive. I don't know if 
                         it's the only one. I don't know if 
                         it was left here by accident or it's

                              (answering the 
                              accusation)
                         Neither did I.

               Major Bell enters the helicopter.

                         That this whole thing was a mistake. 
                         Is anyone trying to contact the ship?

                         looking for the one on the ground.

                         We'll need a lot of help, George. 
                         You could hide an army up here.

                         I'm going to the White House right 
                         now. I'll try and get you everything 
                         you need.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Wait, wait... What are my orders if 
                         we find this thing?

               Fox sits silently for a second.

                                     FOX
                         Contain it and get back to me.

                                     SHERMIN
                         What do you mean by 'contain?'

               Fox knows Shermin is looking for a definite order.

                                     FOX
                         Just what I said.

               The television screen is reduced to static. Shermin stares 
               at it blankly then Lyman turns it off.

               EXT. HOUSING TRACT - MORNING

               The lift off of Shermin's helicopter reveals contamination -- 
               suited scientists slipping the dead extraterrestrial's coffin 
               into the Air Force helicopter.

               EXT. WOODS - DAY

               The STAR MAN, still in his life-support suit, looks surreal 
               in the twilight world under the canopy of firs. The morning 
               rain has gone. A hum of traffic pulls him across the hill to 
               a stand of alders that border the forest. Through the leaves 
               he can see a highway entering the sprawl of Eau Claire, 
               Wisconsin. The cars and trucks zipping along the asphalt are 
               of particular interest to him.

               When he has absorbed them he walks through the trees to get 
               a better look at the town. On the wind he can hear shouts 
               from students boarding a line of yellow buses in front of a 
               grade school off to his right. Suburban houses have begun to 
               snuggle up to the base of the hill he is on.

               Keeping to the tree line well above them he continues his 
               search for an avenue of escape. His head swivels to watch a 
               Volvo station wagon come down the street. It swings into the 
               driveway of the house directly below him and stops next to a 
               Mustang Hatchback. The back door opens and JENNY HAYDN, a 
               pretty girl in her mid-twenties, gets out carrying a crudely 
               lettered be-ribboned sign 'Welcome Back, Mrs. Haydn.' Female 
               voices drift up to the STAR MAN from inside the car.

                              out of the driveway)
                         Remember you're required to have a 
                         lesson planned tomorrow.

               Jenny laughs and waves. With the Volvo moving away up the 
               street Jenny picks her newspaper off her walk and goes into 
               the house.

               EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY

               The STAR MAN presses on through the trees. He hears a light 
               plane overhead. He stops and watches until the branches cut 
               off his view. A path between two logs leads him to the tip 
               of a promontory. From behind the cedars growing there, he 
               sits and looks down on the center of Eau Claire.

               Arm in arm, a YOUNG COUPLE meander through the trees. The 
               boy has a blanket over his shoulder and the girl's hair is 
               disheveled. Without seeing him, they walk past the STAR MAN 
               crouched in a thicket of small pines. After they've gone by, 
               he straightens up and watches them walk down toward the 
               highway.

               EXT. HILLSIDE - LATE AFTERNOON

               The sun is setting over suburban Eau Claire. The colors are 
               reflected in the STAR MAN's faceplate as he watches Jenny 
               push a hand mower over her back yard.

               He takes a dusty gray marble out of a leg pocket and while 
               Jenny finishes the lawn he rolls it between his gloves. It 
               turns a glowing gold as it grows in size. When it reaches 
               the dimensions of a baseball, he brings it close to his 
               faceplate and speaks into it.

                         is not fatal, second message ball by 
                         next darkness.

               He opens his hands and the ball rises quickly into the sky. 
               Jenny is dumping the grass clippings into a garbage can at 
               the side of the house when the sudden motion of the message 
               ball catches her eye and she watches it quizzically until it 
               disappears.

               EXT. WISCONSIN SKIES - LATE AFTERNOON

               We are on the belly of Shermin's helicopter looking at the 
               tree tops rushing underneath.

               INT. HELICOPTER - LATE AFTERNOON

               Shermin is standing back of Lyman and Bell who are seated in 
               front of the square of television screens watching various 
               shots of the wooded landscape flowing by under them. Shermin 
               scrubs his hands over his face then bends over to stretch 
               his back.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a 
                         little league game tomorrow.

                                     LYMAN
                         I wouldn't worry about it... There 
                         might not be any little league 
                         tomorrow.

               Pause.

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         I'm telling you they're probably 
                         friendly.

                                     LYMAN
                         Then why did they try and sneak in 
                         the back door? Tell me that. Why 
                         didn't they contact us first and 
                         say...

                                     RADAR TECHNICIAN
                              (loud)
                         UFO coming out of the grass.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Lock in.

                                     RADAR TECHNICIAN
                         Got it.

               Lyman and the technicians tap out orders to their tracking 
               units and the views of the forest on three of the television 
               screens change to images from their microwave scanners, 
               neutron back scatters and doppler radar. On a fourth screen 
               the forward-looking infrared module begins creating a picture 
               of the UFO. The men relax as they recognize the configurations 
               of a light sea plane.

                                     LYMAN
                         This is crazy. What were we going to 
                         do if that had been the ship? We 
                         have two thirty calibre machine guns, 
                         three M16's and some handguns.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Give it a rest, Lyman.

                                     MAJOR BELL
                              (after a pause)
                         I've never once heard of anybody 
                         being hurt by an extraterrestrial...

               Shermin goes hand over hand along the overhead straps to the 
               radio operator. He begins to flip through a stack of telex 
               messages.

                                     LYMAN
                         That's because the ones that were 
                         hurt, died. They couldn't talk to 
                         you.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (to technician, after 
                              a look at Lyman)
                         Any reports about monsters, people 
                         in Halloween masks, anything like 
                         that?

                                     TECHNICIAN
                         No, but there sure were a lot of 
                         people who saw lights in the sky 
                         last night. Reports are still coming 
                         in.

                                     MAJOR BELL
                              (under above)
                         I've heard of blood being drawn, 
                         sometimes they were taken for a ride 
                         in the ship, a lot of times they 
                         said they had sex... But nobody was 
                         ever hurt...

                                     LYMAN
                         But you decided those weren't real. 
                         This one is.

               There is a buzz and a red dot appears in the center of one 
               of the screens.

                                     LYMAN
                              (over his shoulder to 
                              Shermin)
                         Fox.

               He taps a three digit code and Fox comes into view.

                         I've got something for you.

               A photograph of a very thin slab of yellow plastic pops up 
               on a second screen next to Fox. Above lines of glowing colored 
               dots are symbols of a hydrogen atom, pulsars, a nude man and 
               a woman and Earth's position in our solar system.

                                     FOX
                         Recognize this?

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent 
                         into space on the Pioneer probes.

                                     FOX
                         Houston found it in the 
                         extraterrestrial's suit.

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         They must have picked it up in space.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Then it's not an accident that they 
                         found us.

                                     FOX
                         We don't think that's necessarily 
                         bad. At least it's a point of contact.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Not necessarily bad! If they knew we 
                         were here why didn't they let us 
                         know they were coming?

                         We'll get those answers when you 
                         find the one you're looking for.

                                     SHERMIN
                         That's not going to happen, George, 
                         unless you get us the help you 
                         promised us.

                         We've been back and forth on this 
                         all day and keeping in mind the panic 
                         that would occur if this got to the 
                         general public, it's been decided 
                         not to expand the search at this 
                         time.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Don't let them do it this way, George. 
                         It's too important. We can't find 
                         this thing alone.

                                     FOX
                         You have to. We're trying to contact 
                         the ship. If we do, I'll let you 
                         know immediately. Good luck.

               The television screen is reduced to static. Lyman shuts it 
               off.

                         We always were.

               EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

               We are looking through the living room window at Jenny 
               watching television while she irons the clothes she plans to 
               wear to work tomorrow. The STAR MAN stands just outside the 
               light-fall in the back yard watching her.

               A commercial interrupts the old movie with a jolly fat MAN 
               in a jumpsuit touting his used cars. The two words 'We 
               have...' are repeated constantly during the pitch. 'We have 
               automatics... We have sticks... We have colors... We have 
               financing...' ...

               We move in close on the STAR MAN'S faceplate.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (practicing the human 
                              sound)
                         Wehave...
                              (more precise)
                         Wehave...
                              (well-formed)
                         Wehave...

               Jenny finishes the skirt, unplugs the iron, picks up the 
               clothes, shuts off the television, the light and heads 
               upstairs. Half way up she stops.

                                     JENNY
                              (faint through the 
                              glass)
                         Damn!

               She turns around and looks down indecisively, then hurries 
               upstairs. A light goes on in the bedroom. The STAR MAN backs 
               away to look up at it. He can't see anything. He is on his 
               way to try and get in the side door when Jenny comes clumping 
               down the stairs in an old sweatshirt and pulling on a pair 
               of jeans. She disappears into the kitchen. Without warning 
               the door ahead of him is swung open and Jenny rushes out. 
               The STAR MAN barely has time to step into the shadows. Jenny 
               grabs the handle of one of the garbage cans lined against 
               the house and drags it down to the street. When she comes 
               back for the second one we see that the STAR MAN is no longer 
               in the shadows.

               INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

               Jenny comes in and locks the door. She passes through the 
               kitchen and is on her way to the stairs when the STAR MAN 
               steps out of the darkness in the living room. A scream catches 
               in Jenny's throat.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (precise)
                         Wehave...

               Jenny bolts for the front door. At the end of the hallway 
               her foot catches in a phone cord pulling the phone off an 
               end table. The receiver is jarred out of its cradle. Jenny 
               regains her balance and gets to the door ahead of the STAR 
               MAN. She jerks it open, but the guard chain stops it three 
               inches from the jamb. Frantically, she tries again but the 
               chain holds.

               The STAR MAN slams the door shut and reaches out to grab 
               her. She flails back at him. One of her hands strikes the 
               panel on his chest and the identification light comes on 
               inside his helmet. At the sight of the STAR MAN, Jenny begins 
               to scream. He presses her back against the wall and puts a 
               mittened hand over her mouth.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Wehave...

               Jenny ceases her struggle and begins to cry. The STAR MAN 
               takes his hand away from her mouth.

                                     JENNY
                         Please don't hurt me... please... 
                         please.

               Holding her with his eyes he grasps one of Jenny's hands and 
               lifts it up to look at it.

               He raises a piece of skin off her wrist, rolls it between 
               his thumb and forefinger.

               Jenny lets out a blood-curdling scream and strikes out at 
               him. Flashes of light erupt off his exposed chest where she 
               hits. The ferocity of her attack knocks him aside and she 
               sprints up the stairs.

               The STAR MAN recovers and starts after her.

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Jenny gets there two steps ahead of the STAR MAN. She slams 
               the door in his face and locks it. With him POUNDING ON THE 
               OUTSIDE, Jenny throws open the closet and begins rummaging 
               madly through the side pockets of her jackets and coats.

               The POUNDING STOPS. It takes her a moment to hear the silence. 
               When she does, she whirls toward the door expecting the worst, 
               but it remains closed. She waits. All she can hear is the 
               sound of the rain. She intensifies her search.

                                     JENNY
                              (hysteria creeping 
                              into her voice)
                         It's got to be here... it's got to 
                         be here...

               She finds it in the pocket of a down jacket. The Army issue 
               .45 looks big in her hand. She releases the safety and, with 
               a wary eye on the door, reaches for the phone on the night 
               table next to the bed.

               Long before the receiver gets to her ear, she can hear the 
               "BLEET" caused by the PHONE BEING OFF THE HOOK for so long 
               in the living room. She hangs up and walks around the bed to 
               sit on the corner facing the door. In the distance, we can 
               HEAR the THUMP OF AN APPROACHING HELICOPTER. After a moment's 
               indecision, Jenny gets up and releases the lock. Again she 
               waits.

               Nothing happens. With the gun ready, she turns the knob and 
               opens the door a crack. The hallway is empty. She kicks off 
               her shoes and lets herself out of the bedroom.

               INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Jenny creeps toward the stairs in her stockinged feet. She 
               looks in the bathroom. The STAR MAN isn't there. She decides 
               to go downstairs.

               INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

               The STAR MAN isn't in the living room. Jenny sidles along 
               the wall for the front door. At the archway to the den a 
               hissing sound stops her. She peers around the molding. The 
               spill from the stairwell light provides the only illumination.

               The STAR MAN is sitting on the edge of a chair with his back 
               to her. He is naked. A dot of light is HISSING around his 
               head. The shadows in the room make it difficult for Jenny to 
               tell exactly what is going on.

               Pointing the .45 at the STAR MAN, she steps into the room 
               for a better look. The floor creaks and the STAR MAN turns 
               to her. Jenny shudders at what she sees. The STAR MAN is 
               holding an 8x10 color photograph of Jenny and a man in his 
               mid-twenties standing on a beach in their bathing suits.

               The dot of light is copying the man's features onto the STAR 
               MAN'S translucent head. The top two-thirds of the face is 
               already done. Everything is perfect, even the eyes. Jenny 
               begins to tremble and lowers the gun.

                                     JENNY
                              (in a small voice)
                         No... please don't...

               She sags against the armchair, racked by sobs that are drowned 
               out by the FLAP OF THE APPROACHING HELICOPTER. The STAR MAN, 
               with the dot of light stopped on his left cheek, gets up and 
               takes the gun from her.

               He drops it on the couch and raises his eyes to the sound of 
               the helicopter NOW DIRECTLY OVER THE HOUSE. THROUGH THE 
               WINDOWS, we can SEE the searchlight scouring the hillside 
               next to the back yard.

               The STAR MAN returns to the picture and resumes his 
               transformation. He completes the chin, then continues downward 
               weaving skin and filling in the human characteristics over 
               the entire body.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. CLEAN ROOM (HOUSTON) - NIGHT

               We come down an electrical cord that ends in a micro-phone, 
               then down further to DR. BERGEN, a tall thin balding man in 
               his late fifties dressed in the medical equivalent of a 
               contamination suit.

                                     DR. BERGEN
                         The creature was hit three times...

               Using a laser light indicator Dr. Bergen shows us where.

                                     DR. BERGEN
                         ...the arm, the abdomen and the upper 
                         chest, the one in the chest being 
                         the cause of death. It shattered, 
                         for want of a better term, the 
                         creature's backbone. It's not really, 
                         because it's not jointed. It's simply 
                         a hollow shaft of very pliable 
                         silicate material, as is its entire 
                         endoskeleton. The creature seems to 
                         have tremendous regenerative powers. 
                         Although it must have died within 
                         minutes of receiving the fatal wound, 
                         the arm and abdomen wounds are almost 
                         totally healed and the bullet here...
                              (indicates with the 
                              light)
                         has begun to dissolve...

               INT. SMALL RECTANGULAR ROOM - NIGHT

               Fox, another CIVILIAN and two MEN in uniform are watching 
               the autopsy on a bank of screens which show Dr. Bergen, the 
               room and various close-ups of the dead extraterrestrial lying 
               on a white glass table lit from underneath.

                                     DR. BERGEN
                         It has veins but no blood. We think, 
                         and this is just speculation, that 
                         some form of energy flows from the 
                         brain, which is much more 
                         sophisticated than ours, throughout 
                         the rest of the body... We don't 
                         think there is any danger of bacterial 
                         contamination. Our biochemistries 
                         are too different...

               INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

               Shermin and his crew are glued to the monitors, watching the 
               autopsy from Houston.

                                     DR. BERGEN (V.O.)
                         The flesh is gelatinous, the skin is 
                         very porous and very moist. This is 
                         another guess, but it probably comes 
                         from a planet that receives only 
                         reflected light, perhaps from a ring 
                         of moons. Its atmospheric pressure 
                         is slightly less than ours and it 
                         contains a great deal more water...

                                     FOX (V.O.)
                         Dr. Bergen, George Fox here in 
                         Washington. Can you give us an idea 
                         of why they're here?

                                     DR. BERGEN (V.O.)
                         They're so advanced... I... eh... 
                         can't imagine what they would want 
                         from us. I know they could be 
                         dangerous. But they could also be 
                         the greatest thing that ever happened 
                         to mankind...

               Shermin and his crew share mixed reactions.

               INT. JENNY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAWNBREAK

               Jenny, sitting on the floor with her arms wrapped around her 
               knees, is reflected in a mirror fastened to the back of the 
               closet door. The STAR MAN edges around the door to look at 
               himself in the glass. In baggy tan cords, a windbreaker and 
               a plaid shirt, buttoned all the way to the neck and a button 
               in the wrong hole halfway down the front, he looks like an 
               innocent abroad. He notices the shirt is askew across his 
               chest and, with his new hands, awkwardly resets the buttons. 
               He looks himself over. His movements resemble a human's but 
               are noticeably more precise.

               The clothes seem right so he leans into the mirror to inspect 
               his face. He squeezes the skin on his cheeks, examines his 
               eyes, turns his head as far as he can to inspect the sides 
               of his face, folds his ears forward to check the skin behind 
               them and he even gives a good two-fisted tug to his hair to 
               see if it is on securely.

               He turns from the mirror and goes over to where the .45 and 
               a leg pouch from his life-support suit are lying on the bed 
               next to a snapshot of the man whose identity he has taken. 
               In the picture the man is dressed exactly as the STAR MAN is 
               now. The STAR MAN picks up the gun and the pouch and, speaking 
               to Jenny in his own language, steps to the door and motions 
               for her to follow. Jenny consciously ignores him. The STAR 
               MAN comes over, reaches down and grabs her arm to pull her 
               to her feet. Jenny squirms back, but he holds her tight. She 
               looks at the hand, almost touches it, then up at the familiar 
               yet disturbingly unfamiliar face above her.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Please...

                                     JENNY
                         Don't... don't do this... please...

               The STAR MAN gets her to her feet and hustles her out of the 
               room. On the dresser is Jenny's wedding picture. The man the 
               STAR MAN has become is her husband.

               INT. HOUSE - DAWNBREAK

               The STAR MAN pulls Jenny down the stairs.

                                     JENNY
                              (struggles to free 
                              herself)
                         You're hurting me. Stop.

               The STAR MAN guides her into the entryway and reaches for 
               the front door. Realizing his intentions, Jenny increases 
               her struggle and manages to pull away.

                                     JENNY
                         Oh, God, no! I'm not leaving this 
                         house with you. You're going to hurt 
                         me, I know...

               The STAR MAN looks intently at her, then opens the front 
               door. He taps his chest, points to Jenny and motions to the 
               dawn outside.

                                     JENNY
                              (through tears)
                         I can't. I'd like to help. You look 
                         like Scott, but I know you're not. I 
                         don't know what you are. You gotta 
                         understand, I'm afraid of you...

               As Jenny backs into the living room, the STAR MAN closes the 
               door. He raises the gun, examines it quickly, then with his 
               finger around the trigger, points it at Jenny.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Please.

                                     JENNY
                         Why are you doing this to me? I'll 
                         give you whatever...

               The STAR MAN swings the muzzle sights across Jenny's body 
               and FIRES. A FLOOR VASE EXPLODES. Jenny turns to look at the 
               remains, then back to the STAR MAN.

               EXT. JENNY'S HOUSE - DAWNBREAK

               The Mustang is backing out of the driveway with Jenny behind 
               the wheel and the STAR MAN perched nervously on the passenger 
               seat.

               INT. MUSTANG - DAWNBREAK

               Wary of what will happen next, the STAR MAN watches Jenny 
               move the gear selector to the drive position.

               The car jerks forward and he grabs the dashboard to keep 
               from toppling back in the seat.

               During the ride up the block, his head swivels from side to 
               side trying to take in as much of the darkened urban landscape 
               as he can. When the car stops at a 'stop' sign, he looks at 
               Jenny questioningly.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Please...

                                     JENNY
                         Which way do you want to go?

               She motions ahead and he turns to look at an inter-section 
               with streets running in three directions off of it. His eyes 
               question Jenny again.

                                     JENNY
                         You can go that way...
                              (points left)
                         That way...
                              (straight ahead)
                         That way...

               She points right. After another look at Jenny, the STAR MAN 
               presses the palms of his hands together, concentrates briefly, 
               then slowly draws them apart. The force field appears between 
               them. On it the solarized view of the United States rotates 
               until the red destination dot is on his right. He drops his 
               hands and points to the right.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (measured)
                         That way.

               The satel compass continues to hover over the dashboard.

                                     JENNY
                              (staring incredulously 
                              at the compass)
                         God, what are you?

               She starts her right turn without looking left and fails to 
               see a little MG approaching from that direction. The WAIL OF 
               THE AIR HORN startles Jenny and reflexively she slams on the 
               brakes.

               The Mustang stalls and the MG squeals around them. Jenny 
               checks the STAR MAN. He has pressed himself against the 
               passenger door. The gun lies on the seat next to him. They 
               both look at it. The STAR MAN recovers and picks it up.

                                     JENNY
                              (starting the engine)
                         I'm sorry...

               This time when Jenny puts the car into drive, the STAR MAN 
               is ready for the acceleration. The car completes the turn 
               and the compass rotates to its new heading. Looking at it 
               from this angle, Jenny suddenly recognizes it for what it 
               is: an aerial view of the United States.

                                     JENNY
                         That green dot, that's us, isn't 
                         it... and the red's where you want 
                         to go?... You don't understand me, 
                         do you?

               The STAR MAN looks at her uncomprehendingly.

                                     JENNY
                              (to herself)
                         I gotta get out of here.

               EXT. STREET - DAWNBREAK

               The Mustang cruises through the industrial section of Eau 
               Claire.

               INT. MUSTANG - DAWNBREAK

               The STAR MAN is watching Jenny drive. A set of headlights 
               rushes TOWARD US in the other lane. Jenny twists around to 
               follow the car as it goes by and we SEE the desperation on 
               her face.

               When she returns her attention to the road, she sneaks a 
               glance at the STAR MAN to see if her action has given away 
               her state of mind. His expression hasn't changed. Jenny takes 
               a deep breath and lets it out slowly. Uttering a phrase in 
               his own language, the STAR MAN touches the steering wheel.

                                     JENNY
                              (startled)
                         What?

                                     STAR MAN
                              (thinking the steering 
                              wheel is called 
                              'what," he repeats)
                         What.

               With the same phrase in his language, he points to the 'gear 
               shift.'

                                     JENNY
                              (realizing her mistake)
                         Ah... no...

                                     STAR MAN
                              (repeats)
                         Ah no.

               He points to the dashboard. Jenny senses there is going to 
               be a great deal of misunderstanding if she uses more words. 
               She shakes her head 'no' and touches the steering wheel.

                                     JENNY

                              (correcting her)
                         What.

               Jenny shakes her head 'no.'

                         Dashboard.

               Jenny sees a police car creeping across the intersection 
               ahead of her and interrupts the lesson to stare at it. The 
               STAR MAN looks to where she is looking.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (alarmed)
                         What?!

                                     JENNY
                         Eh... police.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (remembering)
                         Police...

               He raises the gun off his lap. Jenny tries to distract him.

                                     JENNY
                              (raps on the steering 
                              wheel)
                         What?...

               With his eyes on the police car the STAR MAN ignores her.

                                     JENNY
                         Steering wheel...
                              (she points to the 
                              gear shift)
                         What?

               The STAR MAN is intent on the police car. Jenny gives up 
               trying to distract him. The patrol car passes out of their 
               view. The STAR MAN lowers the gun and looks at Jenny.

                                     STAR MAN

                              (this frightens Jenny 
                              even more)
                         Good.

               EXT. INTERSECTION - DAWN

               We COME DOWN FROM a red light TO FIND the Mustang stopped 
               behind the limit line.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         Which way?

                                     STAR MAN (V.O.)
                         That way.

               The light changes and the car proceeds straight across the 
               intersection.

                                     STAR MAN (V.O.)
                         Good.

               INT. MUSTANG - DAWN

               While the STAR MAN picks through the contents of the glove 
               compartment, Jenny looks for a way to escape. An all-night 
               laundromat is a possibility, but it's deserted. The STAR MAN 
               finds the switch on a flash-light and flicks it on and off.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What?

                                     JENNY
                              (distant)
                         Flashlight.

               He puts the flashlight in his lap along with the owner's 
               manual and gas slips and takes a stack of Discount Coupons 
               out of the glove compartment.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What?

                                     JENNY
                         Coupons.

               Jenny sees a set of headlights turn into the oncoming lane. 
               She slides her eyes toward the STAR MAN. He is busy looking 
               through the Coupons. Jenny measures the distance between the 
               Mustang and the oncoming lights. The STAR MAN holds up one 
               of the Coupons and points to a picture of the product.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What?

                                     JENNY
                              (curt)
                         Pancakes.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Pancakes.

               He points to the cluster of letters that spells SAVE 35¢.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What?

               Jenny doesn't answer. The distance between the two vehicles 
               is narrowing rapidly.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What?

               Jenny sets her jaw and wrenches the steering wheel violently 
               to the left.

               EXT. STREET - DAWN

               The Mustang skids sideways across the center line. The 
               oncoming van jams on its brakes and swerves to its left. 
               Locked in a skid, it drifts toward the Mustang.

               INT. MUSTANG - DAWN

               The STAR MAN sucks himself back in terror as the van descends 
               on him. It swings past his window and clips the rear fender 
               of the Mustang. Both vehicles shudder to a stop. Jenny claws 
               at her door. It swings open. She is halfway out before the 
               STAR MAN manages to grab the tail of her sweatshirt. Jenny 
               begins to scream at the top of her lungs and keeps it up 
               while he tries to wrestle her down on the seat.

               EXT. STREET - DAWN

               A tall, raw-boned MAN in his late twenties storms around the 
               front of his van.

                                     MAN
                         You stupid son of a bitch!!

               He kicks the Mustang.

                                     JENNY
                              (screaming)
                         Help me!!

                                     MAN
                         You could have killed us both!!

                                     JENNY
                              (battling to maintain 
                              her grip on the door 
                              frame)
                         He's kidnapping me!!!

               The Man bends down to look at the struggle.

                                     MAN
                         Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...

                                     JENNY
                         Call the police!!

                                     MAN
                              (not sure he wants to 
                              get involved)
                         Hey buddy... let her go...

               The STAR MAN increases his efforts and Jenny loses her grip 
               on one of the door frames.

                                     JENNY
                         Help me!!!

                                     MAN
                              (grabbing her other 
                              arm)
                         Hey, she doesn't want to go with 
                         you. Come on.

               The STAR MAN frees his right hand and blindly searches the 
               floor for the gun. He comes up with it and, shoving the barrel 
               in the Man's face, barks a harsh command in his language. 
               The Man freezes and Jenny stops struggling. It's suddenly 
               very quiet on the street.

                                     MAN
                         Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My 
                         mistake... I'm sorry...

                                     JENNY
                         He doesn't understand... just walk 
                         away...

               The STAR MAN claps a hand over her mouth.

                                     MAN
                         I promise I'm not going to tell 
                         anybody about this... None of my 
                         business... I'm going to move now, 
                         okay...
                              (takes a step to one 
                              side)
                         You guys want to fight, that's up to 
                         you...
                              (takes another step)
                         I'm leaving now... I won't say a 
                         word...

               He keeps his eyes on the STAR MAN until he reaches the back 
               of the Mustang, steals a quick look at the license plate, 
               then blots for his van. The STAR MAN takes his hand off 
               Jenny's mouth and slams her back into her seat. Uttering an 
               expletive in his language he points the gun in her face and 
               keeping it there indicates the red dot on the satel compass 
               floating undisturbed above the dashboard.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Go.

               EXT. STREET - DAWN

               The Mustang moves back into the correct lane and continues 
               on.

               INT. MUSTANG - DAWN

                                     JENNY
                         Could you put the gun down?

               The STAR MAN just stares at her. She points to the gun.

                                     JENNY
                         Gun... Down... Down.

               Slowly, he lowers it to his lap.

                                     JENNY
                         Thank you.

               EXT. ABANDONED LOGGING CAMP - EARLY MORNING

               Shermin's helicopter is taking on fuel from an Army tanker 
               truck. The pilot and co-pilot are catching forty winks on 
               the grass next to the old bunkhouse.

               INT. HELICOPTER - EARLY MORNING

               Major Bell, bleary-eyed and unshaven, is huddled in front of 
               the television screens eating a breakfast off a styrofoam 
               plate. On the top left screen is a satellite picture of 
               Northern Michigan and half of Wisconsin taken with a Doppler 
               radar.

               On the lower left screen is an infrared view of the same 
               area. Over both these views is a schematic of the state 
               boundaries and major cities. On the screens to the right of 
               these views are blow-ups of smaller sections of the overview.

               Lyman and the radar technician are asleep on the floor. Seated 
               in front of the radio console Shermin is going through the 
               telex messages. Next to him the radio technician is bent 
               over the desk with his head in his forearms.

                                     SHERMIN
                         There's nothing... No reports of 
                         sightings or landings or anything... 
                         in the other parts of the country or 
                         overseas... Seems like a totally 
                         isolated incident.

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         It was only an accident that we 
                         discovered them.

                                     SHERMIN
                         I know, but...

               Shermin continues on through the messages. Bell asks the 
               computer to change the pictures on the screens. Rhythmically, 
               a sequence of images appears and disappears.

                                     SHERMIN
                         You married, Major?

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         Twenty-eight years.

                                     SHERMIN
                         To the same woman?

                                     MAJOR BELL
                              (smiling)
                         Yes.

                                     SHERMIN
                         I tried it once... Fourteen years 
                         ago... 'I was a lousy husband and a 
                         worse father. The only thing I'm 
                         good at is this... At least until 
                         yesterday.

               Bell stuffs his breakfast plate into a garbage bag and goes 
               to get a breath of fresh air in the open doorway. Shermin 
               stops at a point on the telex sheet. He reads the message to 
               himself again.

                                     SHERMIN
                         How would you describe the sounds we 
                         heard coming out of that thing's 
                         helmet?

                                     MAJOR BELL
                              (after trying to 
                              imitate them)
                         It was kind of like clicking, maybe 
                         a language wasn't it?

                                     SHERMIN
                         Listen to this.
                              (paraphrasing the 
                              telex)
                         A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire 
                         this morning. When a citizen went to 
                         her rescue the kidnapper threatened 
                         him with a gun and shouted at him in 
                         a strange 'clicking gibberish'...

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         It was a man though... right?

                                     SHERMIN
                         The police think he was high on 
                         drugs...

               Bell shrugs.

                                     SHERMIN
                         What do you think?

               EXT. WISCONSIN FOREST - EARLY MORNING

               With a rush the helicopter rises out of the trees and thunders 
               away.

               EXT. JENNY'S HOUSE - MORNING

               There are Eau Claire police cars on the street. Shermin is 
               out back watching Bell pick his way down the hill. Through 
               the windows we see uniformed policemen in the living room.

                                     MAJOR BELL
                              (slides the last few 
                              feet down the hill)
                         Nothing up there... The grass is 
                         matted down in a few places, but 
                         that could have been anything.

                                     SHERMIN
                         It was the husband. The police finally 
                         got a hold of the witness at work 
                         and showed him a picture of the woman.

               The man standing next to her in the picture was her husband 
               and the witness said that was the guy who kidnapped her.

                                     MAJOR BELL
                         It's the right area, that's for sure.

               Throughout the above, Shermin has noticed a WOMAN in the 
               house next door peeping through her blinds at the activity 
               around Jenny's. She closes the drapes suddenly when she 
               realizes Shermin has spotted her.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Why the clicking language though?

               EXT. NEXT-DOOR HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

               Shermin knocks and waits on the steps with Bell for someone 
               to answer. We hear a chain being pulled off and the door is 
               opened by a freckled-face MAN in his late thirties, dressed 
               in a business suit and wiping the traces of a breakfast from 
               around his mouth.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Sorry to disturb you, sir, but there's 
                         been some trouble next door. I'd 
                         like to ask you a few questions.

                                     MAN
                         What happened?

                                     SHERMIN
                         There's a possibility that Mrs. 
                         Haydn's been kidnapped. We're hoping 
                         you might have seen something.

               A WOMAN in a robe opens the door a little wider to include 
               herself in the conversation. She is as freckled as the man 
               and about the same age.

                                     WOMAN
                              (to the Man)
                         I told you...

                                     MAN
                         Judy, that's stupid.

                                     WOMAN
                         Well, maybe these men won't think 
                         so. We were asleep when a helicopter 
                         woke me up. It made me so nervous I 
                         went into the kitchen for something 
                         to eat. I happened to look out the 
                         window and there was Scott Haydn 
                         with this green thing draped over 
                         his arm pulling Jenny down the walk 
                         to the car.

                                     MAN
                         You know that's impossible!

                                     WOMAN
                         I know what I saw. I've seen him 
                         enough times.

                                     MAN
                              (giving up on his 
                              wife and addressing 
                              Shermin and Lyman)
                         Scott Haydn is dead. He died about 
                         three months ago. We went to the 
                         funeral.

               Shermin and Bell exchange a glance.

               EXT. INTERSTATE - DAY

               Jenny's Mustang is sailing through the beautiful Wisconsin 
               farmland.

                                     STAR MAN (V.O.)
                         R-r-S-s...

               INT. MUSTANG - DAY

               The STAR MAN is copying the letters, upper and lower case, 
               from the Owner's Manual he found in the glove compartment, 
               onto the back of an envelope.

                                     STAR MAN
                         T-t-U...

               He draws the upper case but has to check the manual for the 
               lower case.

                                     STAR MAN
                         u-V-v...

               The STAR MAN looks up as they go by a farm.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (pointing correctly 
                              to the various animals)
                         Cow... Dog... Pig...

               He looks to Jenny for confirmation. She nods absently. He 
               returns to the alphabet.

                                     STAR MAN
                         W-w...

               He forms both the upper and lower case 'X-x' and shows them 
               to Jenny.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What?

                                     JENNY
                              (knows what's coming)
                         X...

               Without smiling the STAR MAN opens his mouth and emits a 
               short chirping laugh.

                                     JENNY
                         What's so funny about X?

               The STAR MAN laughs harder. Jenny watches him warily. He 
               starts to hiccup. He is unable to control it through the 
               laughter.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. SMALL RECTANGULAR ROOM - DAY

               Shermin's image waits on the television screen. He is gaunt, 
               tired and visibly shaken. The picture sizzles and breaks up 
               intermittently. Fox and the three men who watched the autopsy 
               stride quickly into the room.

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                              (his voice quavering)
                         George, we've just confirmed the 
                         existence of the live 
                         extraterrestrial.

                                     FOX
                              (after a beat)
                         When can we expect containment?

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         Well, we're in pursuit of a green 
                         Mustang...

                                     FOX
                              (very controlled)
                         It's in a green Mustang?

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         Yes. It's kidnapped a woman at 
                         gunpoint and from what we can make 
                         out is forcing her to drive it 
                         somewhere.

                                     MILITARY MAN
                              (to the room)
                         This one has a weapon.

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         No, no... A .45, it probably got it 
                         in the woman's house. They were last 
                         seen in downtown Eau Claire...

                                     FOX
                         Why did you let it get into a 
                         populated area?

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         It's taken on a disguise.

                                     FOX
                         Clarify that.

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         It's made itself look like the woman's 
                         dead husband.

               Static breaks up the t.v. picture. When it returns, Fox leans 
               toward the screen.

                                     FOX
                         Repeat the last item.

               Almost reluctantly Shermin holds up Scott Haydn's picture.

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         The extraterrestrial now looks like 
                         this.

                                     FOX
                              (softly)
                         Oh shit!!!

               EXT. INTERSTATE - AFTERNOON

               Jenny's Mustang moves along through the traffic.

               INT. MUSTANG - AFTERNOON

               We are CLOSE ON the back of a ten-dollar bill.

                                     STAR MAN (O.S.)
                              (reading slowly)
                         The United States of America. In God 
                         We Trust. Ten dollars.

               We pull back as he holds the ten up to Jenny.

                                     JENNY
                         Money.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Money.

               He holds up a quarter.

                                     JENNY
                         Money.

               Confused, the STAR MAN puts the money back into Jenny's wallet 
               and reads the first card through its plastic window.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... 
                         Jennyhaydn... Money?

                                     JENNY
                              (shaking her head 
                              'no,' exhausted)
                         We're going to have to stop for gas 
                         soon.

               Under the license is a picture of Jenny smiling broadly. The 
               STAR MAN looks at Jenny, back at the picture, then imitates 
               the smile for Jenny.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What?

                                     JENNY
                         Smile.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Smile... good?

                                     JENNY
                         Yes.

               He practices curling the corners of his mouth up into a smile. 
               One of them freezes as the Interstate curves and a glistening 
               skyline backlit by the afternoon sun comes into view across 
               a river.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (impressed)
                         What?!

                                     JENNY
                         Minneapolis.

                              (reaching into the 
                              leg pouch he took 
                              from his life-support 
                              suit)

                         What are you doing?

               He takes out his camera.

                                     JENNY
                         ...What's that?

               He points the white disc at Minneapolis. With a 'POP,' a 
               cone of light flashes out. It sucks back, almost instantly, 
               bringing with it a three-dimensional image of the skyline.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Minneapolis... good.

                                     JENNY
                         You're full of tricks, aren't you?

               The car starts across the twin cities' bridge.

                                     JENNY
                              (taps the fuel gauge)
                         We need gas.

               The STAR MAN looks at the gauge. Jenny scrunches against the 
               door to avoid contact with him.

                                     JENNY
                         No gas.

                                     STAR MAN
                         No gas.

                                     JENNY
                         This car runs on gas.

               She presses the accelerator to the floor. The car jumps 
               forward.

                                     JENNY
                         Gas...

               She takes her foot off the accelerator and the car quickly 
               slows down.

                                     JENNY
                         No gas.

               EXT. BRIDGE - AFTERNOON

                                     JENNY
                              (V.O.)
                         Gas.

               The Mustang spurts forward a few yards.

                                     JENNY
                              (V.O.)
                         No gas.

               It staggers down to a crawl.

                                     JENNY
                              (V.O.)
                         Gas.

               The car leaps forward again.

                                     JENNY
                              (V.O.)
                         No gas.

               It drops back to a crawl.

               INT. MUSTANG - AFTERNOON

                                     JENNY
                         No gas... car dead.
                              (her head lolls forward 
                              on her chest)
                         We need gas. I don't want to get 
                         shot for running out of gas.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Gas good?

                                     JENNY
                         Yes. Very good.

               INT. MUSTANG - AFTERNOON

               We are LOOKING DOWN Jenny's arm AT a gas station just off 
               Interstate 169 in the Minneapolis suburbs.

                                     JENNY
                         Gas...

               The STAR MAN contemplates the station as they pass it, then 
               turns to Jenny, puzzled:

                                     STAR MAN
                         Go.

                                     JENNY
                         It's closed... closed. We need one 
                         that's open.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Closed?

                                     JENNY
                         You'll see.

               There are no more gas stations in sight. The STAR MAN becomes 
               bored with the silence. He picks up Jenny's wallet. The 
               driver's license is familiar so he flips to the next window. 
               In it is a picture of an older man and woman standing in 
               front of a church.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What?

                                     JENNY
                              (snaps)
                         Not what. Who. What is for things.
                              (touching the steering 
                              wheel, dashboard, 
                              seat, gear shift)
                         What? What? What? What? For people 
                         you use who. Who is he?
                              (points to the man in 
                              the picture)
                         Who is she?
                              (points to the woman)
                         Who are you?
                              (points to the STAR 
                              MAN)
                         Who am I?

               She touches her chest.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (mirrors her gestures)
                         Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? 
                         Who am I?
                              (pause; it clicks for 
                              him and he points at 
                              Jenny)
                         Who are you?

                                     JENNY
                         I am Jenny Haydn.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (flips back to her 
                              license and reads)
                         Jennyhaydn.

               Jenny nods.

                                     JENNY
                         Who are you?

                                     STAR MAN
                         I am...

               We HEAR MODULATED CLICKS of his percussive LANGUAGE.

                                     JENNY
                         That's a big help. Where are you 
                         from?

                                     STAR MAN
                         From?

                                     JENNY
                              (leans forward and 
                              points through the 
                              windshield at the 
                              sky)
                         Are you from up there? Space?

                                     STAR MAN
                              (leans forward to 
                              look with her)
                         Space?

                                     JENNY
                         Up there... I... eh... can't 
                         explain...
                              (leans back)
                         But that's the only place you could 
                         be from.

               The STAR MAN spots a station on the other side of the 
               Interstate.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Gas.

                                     JENNY
                              (shakes her head 'no')
                         Closed.

               He taps the fuel gauge which has dipped below empty.

                                     STAR MAN
                         No gas.

                                     JENNY
                         I know.

               They both scan the horizon for a gas station. When one doesn't 
               come up immediately, the STAR MAN flips to the next picture 
               in the wallet. It is of the man he has become. He is leaning 
               against a fire truck, in uniform.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Who?

                                     JENNY
                         My... husband.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I am husband?

                                     JENNY
                         No. I don't know what you are, but 
                         you're not Scott.

               Silence. The STAR MAN catches her mood. A tear rolls down 
               Jenny's cheek.

                                     JENNY
                              (brushes it away 
                              angrily)
                         Shit.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Shit?

                                     JENNY
                         No, no... don't say that. Bad word.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (likes the sound of 
                              it)
                         Shit... shit... what shit?

                                     JENNY
                              (screams)
                         Stop!! Enough!! Jesus! You're worse 
                         than a parrot!!

               Like closing a zipper, she slides her fingers across her 
               mouth.

                                     JENNY
                         Mouth closed... closed.

               The STAR MAN does as he is told. He doesn't like it, but he 
               does it. With his lips puckered, he looks straight down the 
               road. The car rises out of a gulley. Topping a knoll straight 
               ahead is a gas station with an enormous Exxon sign revolving 
               above it. With his lips firmly pressed together, he tugs 
               Jenny's sleeve and points.

                                     JENNY
                         I see it.

               The STAR MAN reaches forward and squeezes the satel compass 
               back into his palms.

               EXT. GAS STATION - AFTERNOON

               The Mustang comes up the off-ramp toward the pumps.

               INT. MUSTANG - AFTERNOON

               The STAR MAN'S hand closes around the butt of the .45 when 
               he sees the ATTENDANT step out of the office.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Who?

                                     JENNY
                         Attendant. He'll give us gas. Put 
                         the gun down. Under the seat. Under 
                         the seat...

                                     STAR MAN
                         No.

                                     JENNY
                         Oh God! You're going to get us both 
                         killed. Okay... in your pocket...

               She shoves her hand into the pocket of her slacks showing 
               him what to do.

                                     JENNY
                         In your pocket... pocket...

               Jenny eases in next to the pumps and stops. The Attendant is 
               already coming around the front of the car.

                                     JENNY
                         In your pocket, please...

                                     STAR MAN
                              (draws his fingers 
                              over his lips)
                         You. Mouth closed.

                                     JENNY
                         Okay.

               The STAR MAN stuffs the gun into the left pocket of his baggy 
               cords just as the Attendant arrives at the driver's door.

                                     ATTENDANT
                         Morning, folks. Fill her up?

               The STAR MAN looks at Jenny for help. She sweeps her fingers 
               across her mouth to indicate her lips are sealed. The STAR 
               MAN peeks around her at the Attendant.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (overly loud)
                         ...Gas...

                                     ATTENDANT
                         You got it.

               He leaves the window. The STAR MAN watches him until the 
               nozzle is in the Mustang, then pleased with himself, turns 
               to Jenny and lifts his face into a 'smile.'

                                     JENNY
                         I'm going to the ladies' room. You 
                         stay here.

               EXT. GAS STATION - AFTERNOON

               Jenny gets out of the car. When she straightens up, she finds 
               the STAR MAN staring at her over the roof. She slams the 
               door and strides rapidly in the direction of the ladies' 
               room. Stuffing the green pouch in his pocket, the STAR MAN 
               trots after her.

                                     JENNY
                              (wheels on him as he 
                              catches up)
                         Go back to the car.

               The STAR MAN looks at her but doesn't move. Jenny snarls in 
               frustration, then with the STAR MAN on her heels, stalks to 
               the ladies' room and throws open the door.

               INT. LADIES' ROOM - AFTERNOON

               The STAR MAN follows Jenny inside.

                                     JENNY
                         See. It's a bathroom. I'm not trying 
                         to escape. I just have to go to the 
                         bathroom.

               He checks out the stall.

                                     JENNY
                         Satisfied? Now get out. Out.

                                     STAR MAN
                         No.

               Furious, Jenny steps around him and opens the door. She points 
               to the sign on it.

                                     JENNY
                         Women... me.

               She continues out. The STAR MAN goes after her.

               EXT. RESTROOMS - AFTERNOON

               Jenny points to the sign on the next door.

                                     JENNY
                         Men. You go in here.

               She cracks the door for him.

                                     JENNY
                         Come on.

               He takes the door from her and pushes it open for a look 
               inside. Jenny ducks into the ladies' room. He is confused 
               for a moment then takes a long look at the men's room. It 
               means nothing to him. He backs out and tries the ladies' 
               room. It is locked. Not knowing what to do, the STAR MAN 
               stands uncomfortably in front of the door, then like a child 
               waiting for his mother, he sits on the curb. He watches the 
               Attendant lift the Mustang's hood and reach in for the 
               dipstick. The numbers on the pumps turn over, adding up the 
               gallons and the cost of the gas.

               Everything is peaceful and quiet within the circle of light 
               cast by the gas station. The STAR MAN pulls the camera disc 
               out of his pocket and points it at the pumps. The cone of 
               light flashes out and pulls back its three-dimensional image. 
               The Attendant turns around and waves genially at the STAR 
               MAN, who waves back a perfect imitation of the gesture.

               The SHARP RUMBLE of a SOUPED-UP HONDA MOTORCYCLE coming up 
               the off-ramp shatters the mood and the STAR MAN gets to his 
               feet.

               He is startled by the image of the RIDER. In a one piece 
               driving skin and helmet he looks amazingly like a space 
               traveller. The STAR MAN steps cautiously forward for a better 
               look and mutters something to himself in his language. The 
               rider stops his bike at the second row of pumps and swings 
               himself stiffly out of the seat.

                                     RIDER
                         Do I need a key for the head?

                                     ATTENDANT
                         It's open.

               Without taking off his helmet, the Rider sets out for the 
               men's room.

                                     RIDER
                              (over his shoulder)
                         Fill it up.

                                     ATTENDANT
                         You got it.

               The rider's approach frightens the STAR MAN. He backs up to 
               the ladies' room door and knocks. There is no answer. He 
               tries the knob. With the other hand he inches the gun slightly 
               out of his pocket.

               INT. LADIES' ROOM - AFTERNOON

               Jenny is bent over the sink dabbing nail polish around the 
               corners of a paper towel. Her head snaps around to look at 
               the doorknob. It holds.

                                     JENNY
                         Just a minute.

               EXT. RESTROOMS - AFTERNOON

               The STAR MAN tenses and forces a smile as the Rider passes 
               in front of him. A VOICE comes from behind the faceplate.

                                     RIDER
                         Howdy... can't get her out.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (thru the smile)
                         Gas.

                                     RIDER
                         I know how she feels.

               The rider enters the men's room. As the door closes behind 
               him, the STAR MAN's face falls and he knocks frantically on 
               the ladies' room door. Jenny opens it under his knuckles. He 
               blocks the doorway and she backs up as he steps inside.

               INT. LADIES' ROOM - AFTERNOON

               The STAR MAN looks around. Jenny's eyes widen at what is 
               happening behind him. The pneumatic arm above the door is 
               pulling it shut to reveal her paper towel pasted to the back. 
               The message on it, written in red lipstick, reads: KIDNAPPED 
               GOING W ON 169 JADE MUS. LIC#PXV237.

                                     JENNY
                              (stepping around him)
                         It's still a toilet. Hasn't become a 
                         ballroom.

               She tries to swing the door open and hide her message against 
               the wall, but she is too slow. The STAR MAN sees it and steps 
               forward to read.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Kid-nap-ped... go-ing W o-n...

               Jenny realizes he doesn't know what it means.

                                     JENNY
                              (on her way out)
                         That's very good.

               Other graffiti on the door helps convince the STAR MAN Jenny's 
               message has nothing to do with him and after a last look at 
               it, he follows her.

               EXT. GAS STATION - AFTERNOON

               A CAN of Coke CLATTERS DOWN the chute of a drink dispenser. 
               Jenny picks it up and, with the STAR MAN hovering at her 
               shoulder, moves on to the candy machine. He watches a quarter 
               disappear into the slot and when Jenny picks another one out 
               of her purse, he points to it.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Money.

                                     JENNY
                         Yes.

               She inserts the quarter and makes her selection. A Reese's 
               Peanut Butter Cup drops from its position into the pickup 
               bin.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What?

                                     JENNY
                         Candy.

               Using the change from this and another quarter, she selects 
               an Almond Joy.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (as it tumbles into 
                              the bin)
                         Money... candy.

                                     ATTENDANT
                              (to the STAR MAN)
                         That'll be fifteen fifty, sir.

                                     JENNY
                         Here.

               She hands him a twenty.

                                     ATTENDANT
                         Thank you.

               He goes to make change.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (to himself)
                         Thank you.

               Jenny pops the top on the Coke can and on the way to the car 
               takes a sip.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What is...
                              (reads off the can)
                         ...Coke?

                                     JENNY
                         A drink.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (holds his hand out 
                              for it)
                         I...

                                     JENNY
                         You want to try it?

                                     STAR MAN
                         I want to try it.

                                     JENNY
                         This stuff could kill...
                              (changes her mind and 
                              smiles)
                         Be my guest.

               The STAR MAN fills his mouth, swirls it around and swallows.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (after a loud burp)
                         Good.

               He hands the can back to Jenny. She looks at it and knows 
               there are alien bacteria there her body would not like to 
               meet.

                                     JENNY
                         Eh... you keep it. I've had enough.

               The STAR MAN takes another drink. He stops dead when he lowers 
               the can. Jenny continues for a few steps before she realizes 
               he isn't with her. She looks back over her shoulder. Her 
               eyes go immediately to where he is looking. The license plate 
               PXV 237 hangs like an accusation on the front bumper of the 
               Mustang. Jenny decides to brazen it out.

                                     JENNY
                         What's the matter?

                                     STAR MAN
                              (throws the can to 
                              the ground)
                         Shit!

               INT. MUSTANG - AFTERNOON

               Jenny and the STAR MAN ride along in tight-lipped silence.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What is kidnapped?

               Jenny ignores him.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (yells)
                         Kidnapped!!!

               She flinches but remains silent. The STAR MAN snatches the 
               paper towel off his lap and flaps it in her face, jabbing at 
               the word violently with a forefinger.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Kidnapped!!! What is kidnapped?!!

               Jenny can't take it anymore and screams back at him through 
               tears.

                                     JENNY
                         Kidnapped is what you're doing to me 
                         now!!! Kidnapped is pointing a gun 
                         at me and taking me from my house! 
                         Kidnapped is changing yourself into 
                         my husband. I don't know what you 
                         are and I don't care. I just want to 
                         get away from you!

               Jenny's outburst rocks the STAR MAN back into silence. He 
               waits for her to calm down, then slowly takes the gun out of 
               his pocket.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Jennyhaydn.

               She doesn't dare look at him.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I am good.
                              (and he slides the 
                              .45 under his seat)

               EXT. INTERSTATE - NIGHT

               Jenny speeds up to pass a truckload of horses.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What is that?

               She doesn't answer. The car passes the truck. The highway 
               before them is empty.

                                     JENNY
                              (finally)
                         Horses.

                              (without looking at 
                              her)
                         Horses.

               Jenny TURNS ON the RADIO and finds a COUNTRY AND WESTERN 
               STATION.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What?

                                     JENNY
                         Music.

               It is pleasing to him and he listens for a while, then reaches 
               in his pouch and takes out one of the dusty gray marbles. He 
               rolls it between his palms. It changes to a glowing gold as 
               it grows to the size of a baseball.

                                     JENNY
                              (alarmed)
                         What are you doing?!

               The STAR MAN brings the globe close to his mouth and speaks 
               into it.

                                     STAR MAN

                              (eyeing Jenny)
                         I think I can control it by mastering 
                         its language, which is primitive and 
                         easy to learn. Will arrive on time. 
                         Wait for me.

               The STAR MAN opens his hands and, to Jenny's astonishment, 
               the ball rises quickly and seeps through her roof without 
               leaving a trace.

               EXT. INTERSTATE - NIGHT

               The Mustang swerves violently, then straightens itself as 
               the ball comes through the roof and surges into the sky.

               EXT. SKY - NIGHT

               Unexpectedly, Shermin's helicopter storms into view. It is 
               so close we can count the rivets. As it clears, we go to:

               INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

               The flow of traffic on the Interstate below is being fed 
               into the six television screens from infrared cameras on the 
               belly of the craft. The image on the screen under the master 
               begins to move and ends in a close-up of a green Mustang. 
               It's not Jenny's. With a buzz the red dot appears and Fox's 
               face interrupts the view of the Mustang.

                         I just came from a meeting with the 
                         Security Council and
                              (the picture breaks 
                              up, but the voice 
                              continues)
                         in view of the extraterrestrial's 
                         radical change and the fact that all 
                         our efforts
                              (the picture re-
                              assembles)
                         to contact its ship remain unanswered, 
                         it was decided to issue a ten state 
                         'all points bulletin' for Scott Haydn, 
                         Jenny Haydn and the green Mustang. 
                         The officers have been instructed 
                         not to approach the people or the 
                         vehicle but to contact you. You will 
                         then move in and contain the subjects.

               Shermin rubs his hands over his face while he digests this.

                         You sure you want this, because... 
                         that's putting an awful lot of faith 
                         in people we have no control over...

                         I'm afraid the situation demands 
                         that kind of risk.

                                     SHERMIN

                         think'll come out of this. You know 
                         what's gonna come out of this... The 
                         end of religion, the end of 
                         civilization, the end of the earth. 
                         We could become slaves, we could 
                         become a colony of these things. 
                         Don't you see that? Are you too stupid 
                         to see that?

                         Good... It looks like we might be 
                         the welcoming committee, so I think 
                         we should try and figure out what 
                         we're gonna do if we have to come 
                         face to face with this creature.

                         Did your people have any contingencies 
                         rehearsed?

                         No... I guess we never thought it 
                         would happen.

               It's Shermin's turn to look at his feet.

                         Terrific.

               On one of the screens behind him the camera has picked up a 
               lighted billboard advertising 'Kellogg's Corn Flakes' with 
               its slogan 'HAVE A GREAT DAY.'

               EXT. HIGHWAY - EARLY MORNING

               Jenny's Mustang is barreling along well over the speed limit. 
               As it PASSES US, we PAN WITH it TO a sign: SLOW FOR 
               INTERSECTION.

               EXT. INTERSECTION - EARLY MORNING

               A truckload of corn is hurtling down ON US from the north. 
               An empty semi is rumbling up from the south. The light is in 
               their favor.

               INT. MUSTANG - EARLY MORNING

               The STAR MAN is driving. It is obvious that he doesn't see 
               the red light facing him. But Jenny does. And she also sees 
               the trucks closing in from either side.

                                     JENNY
                              (loud)
                         Red light!

               The STAR MAN doesn't see it, doesn't believe her, doesn't 
               slow down.

                                     JENNY
                              (screams)
                         Stop!!!

               EXT. INTERSECTION - EARLY MORNING

               It is as if all three vehicles have heard Jenny. They slam 
               on their brakes at the same time and begin to skid toward 
               each other. It's going to be close.

               INT. MUSTANG - EARLY MORNING

               The prows of the trucks loom over Jenny and the STAR MAN 
               and, for a fleeting instant, it looks like they will join 
               the bugs imbedded in the radiators.

               EXT. INTERSECTION - EARLY MORNING

               The Mustang barely squeaks through and the trucks slam into 
               each other behind it, spilling corn all over the highway.

               INT. MUSTANG - EARLY MORNING

               It finally comes to a stop on the center line.

                                     JENNY
                         That was a red light!! I told you 
                         you have to stop at a red light!!

                                     STAR MAN
                              (sheepish)
                         It was yellow.

                                     JENNY
                         You didn't even see it.

               The STAR MAN looks back for the traffic light. It is hanging 
               from a pole in the middle of the road. Under it the truck 
               DRIVERS are climbing out of the cabs.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I will see it next time.

                                     JENNY
                         You better.

               The STAR MAN angles back into his lane and begins to pick up 
               speed.

               EXT. SIOUX FALLS - SOUTH DAKOTA - DAY

               Deftly, the STAR MAN moves in and out of the afternoon 
               traffic. A bus coming in the other direction hits a pothole 
               filled with water and the SPLASH covers the Mustang.

               INT. MUSTANG - DAY

               Jenny watches the STAR MAN calmly turn on the wipers and the 
               washer and clean the windshield. The light above the 
               intersection ahead turns red and, even though he is still 
               fiddling with the wipers, the STAR MAN manages a smooth stop 
               back of the crosswalk.

                                     JENNY
                              (indicating the red 
                              dot on the satel 
                              compass)
                         Why are you going here? What is here?

                                     STAR MAN
                         My...
                              (searches for word)
                         ...car will take me...
                              (pokes finger toward 
                              sky)
                         ...up there... home.

               The light changes and the STAR MAN continues down the street.

                                     JENNY
                              (at the red dot again)
                         When do you have to be here?

                                     STAR MAN
                         I do not understand.

                                     JENNY
                              (rubs her temples and 
                              laments to herself)
                         How will I do this one?...

               The answer is hovering above the city in front of them.

                                     JENNY
                              (pointing to the sun)
                         Sun...

                                     STAR MAN
                         Yes.

                                     JENNY
                         Sun... day. No sun... night. You 
                         understand?

                                     STAR MAN
                         Yes. Day... night.

                                     JENNY
                         How many days and nights do you have 
                         to go...
                              (prods the red dot)
                         ...here?

                                     STAR MAN
                         Three nights... two days.

                                     JENNY
                         That's not much time. I'll just slow 
                         you down. I have to sleep. I'm very 
                         tired. And I have to wash and eat. 
                         You don't...

                                     STAR MAN
                         I need you.

                                     JENNY
                         I won't tell anybody if that's what 
                         you're worried about. I promise. 
                         You'll keep...

                                     STAR MAN
                         No.

                                     JENNY
                         You'll keep the car. I'll take a 
                         bus...
                              (an awful possibility 
                              occurs to her)
                         Am I going up there with you... in 
                         your ship... up there?

                                     STAR MAN
                         No.

                                     JENNY
                         Then let me go. You don't need me.

                                     STAR MAN
                         No.

                                     JENNY
                         I feel like I'm going crazy here. 
                         You're Scott. But he's dead. I don't 
                         know what's real anymore. I can't be 
                         here with you.

               The STAR MAN is unyielding.

                                     JENNY
                         Do you understand what I'm saying to 
                         you? You can keep the car.
                              (she hands him some 
                              money)
                         That should be enough for gas from 
                         here to there. Please let me go.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (taps the red dot on 
                              the satel compass)
                         When we get here.

               Jenny slams herself angrily back in the seat.

                                     JENNY
                         You bastard.

               Her upper lip trembles and, in spite of herself, she might 
               cry. The STAR MAN sees the center lane is open. He checks 
               his side mirror and drifts over, only to be caught by a light. 
               The car is still rolling when Jenny makes her move. She throws 
               open the door and, by the time the STAR MAN turns around, 
               she is out and running.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Jennyhaydn!

               He takes his foot off the brake to go after her and the car 
               lurches into the cross traffic. He clambers back behind the 
               wheel, regains control and cuts a hard right in front of the 
               other car waiting at the light.

               EXT. STREET - SIOUX FALLS - DAY

               Over her shoulder, Jenny can see the Mustang coming. She 
               dodges up a brick walkway toward a J.C. Penney shopping mall. 
               The Mustang skids to a stop at the curb. The STAR MAN jumps 
               out in time to see Jenny push her way past a stream of 
               pedestrian traffic and enter the mall. He leaves the car and 
               zigzags through the people in that direction.

               INT. SHOPPING MALL - DAY

               As he barges in, the STAR MAN accidentally knocks a cup of 
               Coke out of a YOUNG MAN's hand.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Hey!!

               In a panic to find Jenny, he continues jostling past people 
               to look in the shops that border the atrium.

               MEZZANINE

               Jenny warily approaches the railing and peers over. Below 
               her the STAR MAN comes out of a record store. She turns away 
               and gets on the escalator to the second floor.

               ON THE GROUND FLOOR

               The STAR MAN thinks he sees Jenny in an electronics store, 
               but when the girl turns around, it is obviously not her. 
               Backing out of there, he knocks over a sandwich board 
               advertising a restaurant. The LOUD THWACK it makes when it 
               hits the cement turns faces in his direction.

               Jenny's is not among them. His eyes raise to the mezzanine. 
               Maybe she's there. He looks wildly around for a way up. He 
               spots the escalator and, trying to keep the upper floor in 
               view while he runs for it, he slams into an unattended pram.

               It begins to tip over. The BABY INSIDE SCREAMS. The STAR MAN 
               manages to snatch it out of the carriage before it hits the 
               floor. He is looking for a place to put it when the MOTHER 
               comes charging out of a plant store.

                                     MOTHER
                         My baby!!! He's stealing my baby! 
                         Burt!!

               The STAR MAN holds the baby out to her.

               She grabs it out of his hands and he turns to leave.

                                     MOTHER
                         Burt!! Somebody stop him!! He was 
                         stealing my baby!!

               Two tough-looking MEN in T-shirts step in to block the STAR 
               MAN's way to the escalator.

                                     MAN
                         Where you think you're going?

               Not understanding, the STAR MAN tries to get by them. They 
               push him back.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Please.

               A tall, skinny blond man with spectacles elbows his way to 
               the Mother.

                                     MOTHER
                         He was trying to steal Gloria.

               Two steps and Burt is on the STAR MAN. He spins him around.

                                     BURT
                         Is that right? Huh?

               He throws him back against the crowd that has gathered.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (stutters)
                         Please.

               Burt pulls the STAR MAN up by his shirt front and shakes 
               him.

                                     BURT
                         Is that right? Come on. Answer me.

               Fear erases the STAR MAN's tenuous grasp of English and he 
               begins to jabber in his own language. This makes Burt even 
               madder.

                                     BURT
                         Were you trying to steal my baby? 
                         Huh? Answer me!

                                     STAR MAN
                         Jennyhaydn!

               SECOND FLOOR

               Jenny has just gotten on the escalator to the third floor 
               when she hears her name. She knows she shouldn't but she 
               gets off and joins the crowd at the railing. From there, she 
               can see the STAR MAN trapped in a circle of people. He clubs 
               Burt away from him and tries to thrash his way out of the 
               mob.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Jennyhaydn!

               One of the T-shirts throws him back and Burt begins to punch 
               him. We MOVE IN UNTIL we are CLOSE ON Jenny's face.

               GROUND FLOOR

               Some of the onlookers have joined Burt in his attempt to 
               bring the STAR MAN down. Growling in his own language, the 
               STAR MAN fights back as best he can. The sleeve of his 
               windbreaker is torn. One of the T-shirts lands a blow on his 
               right shoulder that turns the STAR MAN around. He takes a 
               blow on the chest. Another in the kidneys. Burt gets a grip 
               on the STAR MAN's left wrist and holds on. The attackers 
               close in. Jenny's voice cuts through the din.

                                     JENNY (O.S.)
                         Stop it!!! Stop it!!!

               She barges into the fray and starts peeling the men away 
               from the STAR MAN.

                                     JENNY
                         Get away from him!! Leave him alone!! 
                         You stupid jerks!! He's retarded!! 
                         Can't you see that?!! Get away from 
                         him!!

               The men do. Jenny pushes the sleeve of the torn wind-breaker 
               back up on the STAR MAN's shoulder.

                                     MOTHER
                         He was stealing my baby...

                                     JENNY
                         You're wrong!! He would never do 
                         anything like that!!
                              (takes STAR MAN's 
                              hand)
                         Let's go...

                                     MOTHER
                         He had Gloria in his hands!

                                     JENNY
                         He's retarded! I shouldn't have left 
                         him alone!

               She starts to push out of the circle. Burt steps in to block 
               her.

                                     JENNY
                              (hisses)
                         Get out of my way.

               She stares at him until he does, then leads the STAR MAN 
               down the path that opens for them in the crowd. They pass a 
               MALL GUARD who has just arrived.

               EXT. STREET - SIOUX FALLS - DAY

                                     JENNY
                         Are you okay?

               Still shaken, the STAR MAN nods. Jenny realizes that it is 
               comforting to him to have his hand in hers and she leads him 
               like a child down the sidewalk to the Mustang.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (as Jenny puts him in 
                              the passenger seat)
                         Thank you.

               The Mall Guard follows them down the walk-way and watches 
               them drive off. He scribbles the license number in his 
               notebook.

               INT. GREYHOUND BUS STATION - SIOUX FALLS - DAY

               At the counter Jenny puts her Visa card back into her wallet 
               while the CLERK staples the pages of a ticket into a travel 
               folder.

                                     CLERK
                              (handing it to her)
                         Gate three. It's boarding now.

                                     JENNY
                         Thank you.

                                     CLERK
                         Have a nice trip.

               We FOLLOW Jenny THROUGH the people milling around the benches 
               in the waiting area TO the STAR MAN seated in an open-faced 
               coffee shop. He is watching a MOTHER feed her baby in the 
               booth across from him. A map of the United States is spread 
               out on the formica. Jenny plunks herself down catty-cornered 
               from him. The tear in his sleeve has been closed with safety 
               pins.

                                     JENNY
                         The closest I was able to get you 
                         was Lathrop Wells...

                                     STAR MAN
                              (pointing to baby)
                         Is that a baby?

                                     JENNY
                         Yes.

                                     STAR MAN
                         A baby is a new person?

                                     JENNY
                         Eh... yes...

                                     STAR MAN
                         Do you have a baby?

                                     JENNY
                         No... The closest...

                                     STAR MAN
                         Why?

                                     JENNY
                         I'd love to have a baby. But I 
                         can't...

                                     STAR MAN
                         Why?

                                     JENNY
                         I can't... Forget the baby. Okay? 
                         The closest I was able to get you 
                         was Lathrop Wells. You'll have to 
                         hitchhike the rest of the way.

               The STAR MAN looks at the map. Lathrop Wells is a small town 
               north of Las Vegas on Highway 95. From there he runs his 
               finger to a spot in the Funeral Range of Death Valley.

                                     STAR MAN
                         But I must go here.

                                     JENNY
                         I know that. But the buses don't go 
                         there.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (suspicious)
                         What is hitchhike?

                                     JENNY
                         That's easy. I'll explain that in a 
                         minute. This is your ticket. When 
                         you get on the bus here, the driver 
                         will take this part. You will ride 
                         to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask 
                         the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please. 
                         I do not speak English.'

               The STAR MAN nods that he understands.

                                     JENNY
                         Say it.

                                     STAR MAN
                         'Salt Lake City, please. I do not 
                         speak English.'

                                     JENNY
                         The driver will...

                                     STAR MAN
                         But I speak English.

                                     JENNY
                         Will you please do it my way? You'll 
                         get into trouble if you don't. If 
                         anybody talks to you, tell them... I 
                         do not speak English.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (indignant)
                         I do not speak English.

                                     JENNY
                         Right. In Omaha the driver will put 
                         you on the bus for Salt Lake City 
                         and the new driver will take...
                              (bends back second 
                              portion of ticket)
                         ...this part. When you get to Salt 
                         Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, 
                         please'...

                                     STAR MAN
                              (impatient)
                         'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak 
                         English.' What is hitchhike?

                                     JENNY
                         You want this ticket?

                                     STAR MAN
                         Yes.

                                     JENNY
                         Then don't be smart.

                                     P.A. SYSTEM (V.O.)
                         Last call for bus 33 to Vermillion, 
                         Sioux City and Omaha... loading at 
                         Gate 3.

                                     JENNY
                         That's your bus.
                              (picks up the map and 
                              folds it)
                         When you get to Las Vegas, ask the 
                         driver. 'Lathrop Wells, please. I do 
                         not speak English.'

                                     STAR MAN
                              (falling into step 
                              next to her)
                         'Lathrop Wells, please. I do not 
                         speak English.'

                                     JENNY
                              (hands him the map)
                         You keep this. Now this is hitch-
                         hike...
                              (stops in the middle 
                              of the waiting area 
                              to illustrate)
                         You stand on the side of the road, 
                         the highway... you understand? And 
                         you face the cars going in the 
                         direction you want to go. When you 
                         see a car or a truck coming, you 
                         stick out your thumb like this...

               Jenny takes a few sweeps at an imaginary highway with her 
               thumb. The stares this pantomime draws make the STAR MAN 
               more nervous about the bus trip than he already is.

                                     JENNY
                         Your thumb tells the driver that you 
                         want a ride.

                                     STAR MAN
                         The car will stop?

                                     JENNY
                              (continuing toward 
                              the loading platform)
                         Not every car, but... a car will 
                         stop... Maybe not the first car... 
                         maybe number eight, number fifteen...

               The STAR MAN stops.

                                     STAR MAN
                         When do I get to Lathrop Wells?

                                     JENNY
                         Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking 
                         right away and...

               Jenny pushes open a glass door to:

               EXT. LOADING PLATFORM - DAY

                                     JENNY
                         ...you'll have plenty of time to get 
                         to where you want to go.

               The STAR MAN hangs back when he sees the security guards.

                                     JENNY
                         Don't worry. They're not going to 
                         hurt you. Come on.
                              (gives him ticket)
                         Only show this to the driver. Nobody 
                         else. And don't lose it.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Can I have the gun?

                                     JENNY
                         No.

               She maneuvers him into the end of the line.

                                     JENNY
                         You might need this.

               She takes some of the paper money out of her wallet and stuffs 
               it in his pocket.

                                     JENNY
                         Don't be afraid. Do what I told you 
                         and you'll be okay.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (nervous)
                         Yes.

               The line moves forward a step.

                                     JENNY
                         Well... I'm going to go now.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Go?

                                     JENNY
                         Yes. I have a long ride ahead of 
                         me...
                              (takes his hand)
                         Goodbye.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Goodbye.

               He watches her walk away.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Jennyhaydn.

                                     JENNY
                         Yes?

                                     STAR MAN
                         Please stay.

               Jenny comes back and takes his hand.

                                     JENNY
                         I'll stay till you get on the bus.

               A family of four climbs aboard and the line moves up. The 
               STAR MAN is alert to everything happening on the platform. 
               Jenny sneaks him an affectionate look. No one in front of 
               him has baggage to check and they move quickly past the DRIVER 
               until the STAR MAN is next in line.

                                     DRIVER
                         Ticket?

               The STAR MAN hands the Driver his ticket. The Driver rips 
               out the first coupon and hands it back.

                                     JENNY
                         See? You're going to be okay.

               When they stop at the door, she impulsively kisses him on 
               the cheek.

                                     JENNY
                         Goodbye.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (touches his cheek)
                         What?

                                     JENNY
                         It's a kiss...
                              (she motions for him 
                              to get on the bus)
                         Goodbye...

                                     DRIVER
                         Let's go.

               The STAR MAN climbs the steps just ahead of him. The door 
               closes. Its ENGINE REVVING, the bus backs out of its stall. 
               Jenny catches a glimpse of the STAR MAN bent over in the 
               aisle looking out at her. She waves until the bus rounds the 
               building.

               EXT. GREYHOUND PARKING LOT - DAY

               Jenny's green Mustang loops around the end of a row of cars 
               and heads for the street.

               INT. MUSTANG - DAY

               LOOKING OVER Jenny's SHOULDER, we SEE the Star Man waiting 
               for her at the curb.

                                     JENNY
                              (softly)
                         Oh no...

               She stops next to him and rolls down her window.

                                     JENNY
                         What happened?

                                     STAR MAN
                         I was afraid.

               Jenny moans and lays her head on the vinyl of the window 
               sill. When she raises up, he smiles at her.

                                     JENNY
                         Okay, you win. Get in.

               INT. SHOPPING MALL - DAY

               Shermin is standing next to the security guard in the middle 
               of a knot of shouting people.

                                     SHOPKEEPER
                         This kind of thing's real bad for 
                         business...

                                     TOUGH
                         He couldn't even speak English.

                                     MOTHER
                         Those kind of people should be shot.

                                     ONLOOKER
                         What happened?

                                     WAITRESS
                         I think he was just lost...

                                     BURT
                         Who's side are you on?

                                     TOUGH
                         No way he was going to get away from 
                         me.

               We move in on a lapel mike pinned to the front of Shermin's 
               shirt.

               INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

               The hubbub in the shopping center is being recorded on a 
               tape deck. Lyman, a phone to his ear, is seated in front of 
               the television screens.

                                     LYMAN
                         Where's that?... And it was one 
                         person, one way...

               He hangs up and heads for the rear door. Jenny Haydn's current 
               Visa statement occupies the upper left screen. The last two 
               items are circled: The charge for the Greyhound ticket and 
               the credit for the return of that ticket.

               EXT. SHOPPING MALL - DAY

               The security guard tags Shermin into the parking lot.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Eyewitnesses are the worst. You get 
                         two of them together. You got three 
                         stories. You know what I mean?

               Shermin sees Lyman come out of the crowd surrounding the 
               police cars in front of the helicopter.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Is there a reward in this?

                                     SHERMIN
                         Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Because I'm the one who called the 
                         police, you know.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Hey, it's none of my business why 
                         you're chasing a retard... You want 
                         my opinion, it's the girl. She had 
                         to hold the guy's hand all the way 
                         to the car like he was a kid.

                                     SHERMIN
                         You saw that?

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Hey... he didn't look like no big 
                         time criminal to me.

               Lyman meets them. It is obvious he has something to tell 
               Shermin.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Eh... the store tells you to call 
                         when there's trouble, so they won't 
                         get sued... But that shouldn't matter 
                         if there's a reward, right?

                                     SHERMIN
                         I wouldn't think so.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                              (peeling off)
                         That's what I thought. So remember 
                         it was me because sometimes rewards 
                         come late, you know.

                                     SHERMIN
                         We will.
                              (he turns to Lyman)
                         Something's wrong here. She's helping 
                         him now.

                                     LYMAN
                              (alarmed)
                         I know. She bought him a ticket for 
                         Lathrop Wells and put him on the 
                         bus. He didn't stay on though and 
                         they drove off together.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (shaking his head)
                         Doesn't make sense.

                                     LYMAN
                         Maybe he's turned her into one of 
                         them. They enter the crowd around 
                         the helicopter.

               EXT. INTERSTATE 29 - DAY

               The Mustang cruises along between fields of corn.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         Why did your ship land on this 
                         planet... on Earth?

                                     STAR MAN (V.O.)
                         It was a mistake.

               INT./EXT. MUSTANG - DAY

               The following conversation will be played over various views 
               of Americana: a station wagon load of kids, waving and 
               laughing, lovers kissing at a bus stop, billboards, car lots, 
               a dog taking a leak against a tree, cheerleaders practicing 
               on a football field, a funeral cortege, a telephone repairman 
               up on a pole.

                                     JENNY
                         You thought we were a different 
                         planet?!

                                     STAR MAN
                         No. My ship was doing a map of all 
                         the suns and...

                                     JENNY
                         Stars... When a sun is far away, we 
                         call it a 'star.'

                                     STAR MAN
                         We were doing a map of the stars and 
                         all the other things up there when 
                         we saw a small ship. My... eh... we 
                         kidnapped it. On it there was a map 
                         that said how to come to Earth. This 
                         was very important. Before then, we 
                         thought we were the only people in 
                         all the stars.

                                     JENNY
                         You did? That's funny. So did we.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Yes?

                                     JENNY
                         Yes.

                                     STAR MAN
                         We told our home, and the people who 
                         tell us what to do on my planet said 
                         to come and look but not to talk, 
                         not to land, not to shoot. Just to 
                         look from up there. We came and... 
                         the driver of my ship...

                                     JENNY
                         The captain...

                                     STAR MAN
                         The captain wanted to land to see 
                         close and to get some things from 
                         Earth to take home. The police came 
                         and shot at us. One of the people 
                         from my ship was killed.

                                     JENNY
                         Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was 
                         he a good friend?

                                     STAR MAN
                         I don't understand 'friend.'

                                     JENNY
                         A friend is a person that is good to 
                         you... someone you like to be with... 
                         someone you like to laugh with...

                                     STAR MAN
                         He was a good friend... The captain 
                         took the ship away fast and I was 
                         not in the ship.

                                     JENNY
                         The police shouldn't have started 
                         shooting. But you can hardly blame 
                         them. You surprised them. They didn't 
                         know you were up there. When they 
                         saw you, they thought you were here 
                         to hurt us.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I understand.

                                     JENNY
                         Sounds like your captain's going to 
                         get hell when he gets back home.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What is hell?

                                     JENNY
                         It's bad.

                                     STAR MAN
                         He will.

               Pause. Jenny feels the STAR MAN staring at her. She turns to 
               look at him. His gaze doesn't waver. She looks back at the 
               road, then back at the STAR MAN.

                                     JENNY
                         What are you doing?

                                     STAR MAN
                         Are you my friend?

                                     JENNY
                         Yes.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (smiles)
                         I am your friend.

               EXT. INTERSTATE 80 - NIGHT

               Jenny's Mustang is whipping west out of Lincoln, Nebraska. 
               We HEAR A JUMBLE OF RADIO STATIONS as the SELECTOR is RUN 
               THROUGH THE FREQUENCIES.

               INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT

               Jenny is driving. The STAR MAN finds a RELIGIOUS STATION ON 
               the RADIO.

                                     PREACHER (V.O.)
                              (on radio)
                         God is your creator. God is your 
                         master. God is you savior. God is 
                         the only reason that you exist. If 
                         God...

                                     STAR MAN
                              (during the above)
                         Who is God?

               Jenny is tired. She doesn't want to get into that.

                                     JENNY
                         Nobody knows.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Why?

                                     JENNY
                         I don't know.

               The STAR MAN lets it drop and finds a COUNTRY AND WESTERN 
               STATION.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I like this music.

                                     JENNY
                         I've noticed... Do you understand 
                         what they're saying?

                                     STAR MAN
                         Not all... but it feels like a kiss.

               Jenny smiles at him, then:

                                     JENNY
                         Do you have music up there?

                                     STAR MAN
                         Yes.

                                     JENNY
                         I'd like to hear it. Can you sing 
                         something?

                                     STAR MAN
                         I do not want to.

                                     JENNY
                         Don't be afraid... I'd really like 
                         to hear it.

               She TURNS OFF the RADIO.

                                     JENNY
                         Please.

               He turns away from her, clears his throat and begins. His 
               singing is like nothing we have ever heard. Vibrations of 
               tones and glottal stops blend into a haunting, seductive 
               fugue. The STAR MAN stops.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I am not a good singer.

                                     JENNY
                         That was beautiful.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (incredulous)
                         You liked my singing?

                                     JENNY
                         Yes. Sing some more.

               EXT. INTERSTATE 80 - NIGHT

               With the STAR MAN's SERENADE WAFTING over the Nebraska plains, 
               we FALL BACK TO FIND a Highway Patrol car tagging along at a 
               safe distance behind the Mustang.

               EXT. BEST WESTERN MOTEL - NIGHT

               The STAR MAN stops the Mustang in front of the office. He 
               and Jenny get out and go inside. As the door closes on them, 
               three Nebraska Highway Patrol cars speed up the off-ramp. 
               The lead car turns right on a surface street and enters the 
               motel parking lot at the far end.

               The middle car goes straight across the intersection and 
               positions itself at the curb next to the driveway, giving 
               access to a frontage road which leads to an on-ramp. The 
               last car also turns right on the surface street, but parks 
               in a restaurant parking lot directly across from the office.

               INT. OFFICE - BEST WESTERN MOTEL - NIGHT

               In answer to Jenny's bell, the night CLERK comes out of the 
               living quarters in the back, finger combing his sleep-rumpled 
               hair.

                                     CLERK
                         What can I do for you folks?

                                     JENNY
                         How much are your rooms?

                                     CLERK
                         Thirty-seven fifty for one person, 
                         forty-nine fifty for two.

               Drawn by the bright colors on their covers, the STAR MAN 
               wanders over to the magazine rack. By chance, he selects a 
               copy of 'Playgirl' and begins to look through it.

                                     JENNY
                         You have one with two beds?

                                     CLERK
                         Sure.

                                     JENNY
                         I'll take that.

                                     CLERK
                              (slides her a 
                              registration card)
                         Fill this out.
                              (as Jenny writes)
                         Will this be cash or credit card?

                                     JENNY
                         Credit card.

                                     CLERK
                         I'll have to run your card off now.

                                     JENNY
                              (digging through her 
                              purse)
                         We're only going to be here a few 
                         hours...

                                     CLERK
                         It's still the full price.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Jenny, look...

               From behind the STAR MAN, we WATCH Jenny react to the open 
               Playgirl centerfold that he is holding up.

                                     JENNY
                         Put that back.

                                     STAR MAN
                         But I have never seen this before. I 
                         am not complete.

               Although we cannot see it, we know what he is pointing at.

                                     JENNY
                         Put it back.

               The STAR MAN swivels the picture around so that he can see 
               it. Jenny hands the smirking Clerk her credit card. He steps 
               to the side and inserts it into the imprinter. Out of the 
               corner of his eye, he sees a dot of light leave the STAR 
               MAN's forehead to drop behind the magazine and into his 
               trousers.

               The Clerk glances over at Jenny to see if she hears the 
               HISSING that is going on behind the STAR MAN's fly. She does 
               and she hopes it'll stop soon. His eyes on the STAR MAN, the 
               Clerk fumbles the key to 117 off the rack.

                                     CLERK
                         You can park your car in front of 
                         the room.

               He drops the key on the counter.

               INT. MIDDLE PATROL CAR - NIGHT

               Through his side window, the DRIVER can see the motel office.

                                     DRIVER
                              (into microphone of 
                              his radio)
                         What did these two do?

               INT. LAST PATROL CAR - NIGHT

                                     SECOND DRIVER
                         All anybody knows is that they're 
                         armed and dangerous.

               In the office, he can see Jenny and the STAR MAN leave the 
               counter and head for the door. He raises a pair of binoculars 
               to his eyes for a good head-on look at them.

               THROUGH THE BINOCULARS

               We SEE Jenny and the STAR MAN come out of the motel office.

               BACK TO SCENE

               The Second Officer lowers the glasses and looks down at the 
               telex pictures of Jenny and the STAR MAN taped to the 
               dashboard.

                                     SECOND OFFICER
                         Be a piece of cake for us to take 
                         'em.

               INT. LEAD PATROL CAR - NIGHT

               THROUGH the WINDSHIELD, we can SEE Jenny and the STAR MAN 
               approaching the Mustang.

                                     THIRD DRIVER
                         National Security folks should be 
                         here any minute. Let them take care 
                         of it. That's what they get the big 
                         bucks for.

               EXT. BEST WESTERN MOTEL - NIGHT

                                     STAR MAN
                         I want a drink. May I have two 
                         quarters?

               At the passenger door, Jenny sets her purse on the car roof 
               to take out her wallet.

                                     JENNY
                              (handing it to him)
                         You shouldn't drink so much of that 
                         stuff. It's bad for you.

                                     STAR MAN
                         On the radio they say it's good.

                                     JENNY
                         Hurry up.

               Over her purse she notices the patrol car facing her from 
               the restaurant parking lot. There is certainly nothing unusual 
               about a patrol car in a restaurant parking lot. She shrugs 
               it off and gets in the Mustang.

               INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT

               Jenny's behind hasn't even hit the seat before she sees the 
               patrol car parked on the frontage road off to her left. She 
               looks at the STAR MAN. He's busy pounding on the drink 
               machine. She turns around to check the lot behind her and 
               spots the patrol car there.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (coming to the car 
                              with a drink can in 
                              each hand)
                         The machine gave me two. Should I 
                         put one back?

                                     JENNY
                         No. Get in.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (rounding the hood)
                         You can have one.

                                     JENNY
                              (as he gets in)
                         I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive 
                         for a little while longer.

               The STAR MAN stiffens when he sees the patrol car on the 
               frontage road.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Are you angry at me?

                                     JENNY
                         No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.

               EXT. BEST WESTERN MOTEL - NIGHT

               The Mustang moves toward the frontage road.

               INT. LAST PATROL CAR - NIGHT

                         They made us. Let's get 'em.

               EXT. BEST WESTERN MOTEL - NIGHT

               All three patrol cars jam on their rack lights and, with 
               their SIRENS HOWLING, peel out after Jenny and the STAR MAN.

               INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT

               At the SOUND, the STAR MAN snaps his attention to the rear 
               view mirror. It's ablaze with police lights. He tromps on 
               the gas.

                                     JENNY
                         No.

               INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

               Shermin is patched into the Nebraska Highway Patrol and is 
               listening to the pursuit.

               EXT. INTERSTATE 80 - NIGHT

               The Mustang careens down the on-ramp and squeezes into the 
               traffic a hair's breath ahead of an 18-wheeler. This cuts 
               off the patrol cars momentarily, but the Mustang doesn't 
               have the speed to stay ahead of them. Using the other cars 
               on the road as shields, the STAR MAN dodges from lane to 
               lane trying to keep the police from coming alongside.

               INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT

               The lead patrol car feints forward on the STAR MAN's side. 
               The STAR MAN sways over to cut it off and the middle patrol 
               car slips in next to Jenny. The STAR MAN grabs the gun from 
               under the seat.

                                     JENNY
                         No!!! No!!!

               INT. MIDDLE PATROL CAR - NIGHT

                                     DRIVER
                         He's got a gun!!

               INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT

               Jenny screams.

               A shotgun blast from the middle patrol car rips through the 
               door and into Jenny. Part of the FRONT WINDOW is BLOWN OUT. 
               Bleeding badly, she slumps against the STAR MAN.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Jennyhaydn! Jennyhaydn!!

               Her eyelids flutter open and she tries to speak, but can't. 
               The middle patrol car is lining up for another shot. The 
               STAR MAN slams the Mustang into it, sending it spinning onto 
               the shoulder and into a ditch.

               The last patrol car speeds up to replace it. The lead patrol 
               car slips in next to the STAR MAN. They've got him in a 
               sandwich. The STAR MAN stands on his brakes.

               EXT. INTERSTATE 80 - NIGHT

               Caught by surprise, the patrol cars rocket ahead of him. The 
               Mustang cuts across the swatch of land that acts as a center 
               divider in the highway and races west in the eastbound lanes.

               INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT

               The STAR MAN squints against the headlights of the on-coming 
               traffic as he calmly wedges his way straight through it.

               EXT. INTERSTATE 80 - NIGHT

               The lead patrol car tries to follow him but is clipped by a 
               Cadillac swerving to avoid the STAR MAN and bounced back 
               into the center divider. The last patrol car parallels the 
               Mustang in the westbound lanes.

               INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT

               The STAR MAN realizes he's still boxed in. A car carrier 
               swerves by on his left. The lane behind is open. The STAR 
               MAN takes advantage of the opportunity.

               EXT. INTERSTATE 80 - NIGHT

               The Mustang vaults off the shoulder of the highway into an 
               open field and bullets away through the weeds.

               The rush of oncoming traffic traps the three patrol cars in 
               the center divider.

               INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT

               Jenny moans as the car jostles over the rough ground. The 
               STAR MAN puts out a hand to cushion her ride. His headlights 
               pick up a gravel road splitting the field and he turns onto 
               it. In a quick look back, he sees the patrol car shooting 
               across the highway after him.

               EXT. GRAVEL ROAD - NIGHT

               We FOLLOW the Mustang as it winds upward through the grazing 
               lands sparsely dotted with clumps of trees. The plume of 
               dust kicked up by the fleeing car is turned silver by a full 
               moon. The WAIL OF the PATROL CARS is DISTANT BUT CLOSING.

               EXT. PASTURE - NIGHT

               The Mustang barrels around a curve and slides to a surprise 
               stop before a gate in a barbed wire fence that ends the road. 
               With the .45 in his hand, the STAR MAN jumps out of the car 
               and tries the gate. It is locked.

               When he turns back to the car, he sees something that 
               frightens him more than the approaching patrol cars. A 
               helicopter has joined the chase. He looks for a place to 
               hide. A stand of cottonwood and elm fifty yards on the other 
               side of the gate offers the only protection.

               The STAR MAN opens the passenger door. Jenny is soaked in 
               her own blood. He hooks the strap of her purse over his 
               shoulder, lifts her tenderly and, cradling her in his arms, 
               wiggles between a fence post and the gate and jogs into the 
               trees.

               EXT. PASTURE - NIGHT

               The helicopter sets down behind the Mustang. Shermin leads 
               Bell, Lyman and the technicians to the car.

                                     LYMAN
                              (seeing the blood on 
                              the passenger seat)
                         One of them must be pretty badly 
                         hurt.

               Shermin pushes the seat forward. The STAR MAN's life-support 
               suit is stuffed in the space behind it. The patrol cars skid 
               around the curve.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (to Bell, indicating 
                              the suit)
                         Get this back to the copter.

               Shermin takes a bullhorn from Lyman and goes around to the 
               front of the Mustang. The highway patrolmen get out of their 
               cars behind him.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (bullhorn to woods)
                         Mrs. Haydn, please come out. We don't 
                         want to hurt you or your friend. 
                         Please put down your weapon and come 
                         out.

               EXT. TREES - NIGHT

               Jenny's limp weight is beginning to slow the STAR MAN. He 
               hears the bullhorn but doesn't stop.

               EXT. PASTURE - NIGHT

               Shermin lowers the bullhorn and speaks to the patrolmen.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Okay, fan out. These people have a 
                         gun but we want them alive. 
                         Understand?

               EXT. TREES - NIGHT

               A deep shadow on the other side of an elm offers a likely 
               hiding place. He moves through the underbrush toward it. 
               Without warning, his feet begin to slip out from under him. 
               He struggles to regain his balance.

               When he does he looks down to find himself staring at a RAGING 
               RIVER 150 feet below. The bank on the other side is just a 
               few feet above the water and in the moonlight he can see a 
               flat plain cut by a highway that stretches into the distance. 
               Slowly, he backs away from the edge of the cliff.

               From under the elm he watches the helicopter sweep out over 
               the ravine. Its searchlight darts toward him bleaching the 
               treeline. The overhanging branches cloak him and Jenny and 
               the light passes without picking them up. The STAR MAN adjusts 
               his grip on Jenny and starts off in the opposite direction 
               from the helicopter to look for a way down the cliff.

               EXT. TREES - NIGHT

               Shermin, his people and the patrolmen are combing the woods 
               with flashlights in a picketline search. The Third Driver 
               stops at the mouth of a clearing that runs between the 
               cottonwood and elm to the cliff. He takes a bite off a block 
               of chewing tobacco.

               As he replaces it in his pocket, he sees a shadow flit across 
               the far end of the clearing. He swings his flashlight in 
               that direction. The beam catches a piece of Jenny and the 
               STAR MAN.

                                     THIRD DRIVER
                         Over here! They're over here!

               EXT. TREES - NIGHT

               Standing on the rim of the gorge, the STAR MAN sees the rays 
               of his pursuers' flashlights choking off any possible escape. 
               He eases Jenny to the ground behind a boulder. She whimpers 
               with the pain.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (strokes her cheek)
                         You will be all right.

               He stretches over the top of the boulder and scatters FOUR 
               SHOTS at the lights.

               EXT. TREES - NIGHT

               The patrolmen, the technicians and Shermin all hit the ground 
               and kill their lights.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Mrs. Haydn, we don't want to hurt 
                         you. Put down your gun and come out. 
                         We just want to talk to your friend.

               THE STAR MAN AND JENNY

               The STAR MAN peers around the boulder. At that instant the 
               searchlight from the helicopter happens to splash across the 
               men in the field. He sees that their guns are drawn and 
               pointed in his direction. The STAR MAN pulls back and takes 
               a marble from his pouch. It grows and glows gold as the STAR 
               MAN rolls it between his palms. When it reaches the size of 
               a baseball, he clutches it firmly in his right hand and 
               EMPTIES the .45 toward Shermin and the police. This time, 
               there is a BARRAGE OF ANSWERING FIRE.

               With the BULLETS RICOCHETING around him, the STAR MAN lifts 
               Jenny to his shoulder. He massages the golden orb until it 
               becomes the size of a soccer ball, then takes two quick steps 
               to the edge of the cliff and leaps into the abyss.

               EXT. ABYSS - NIGHT

               The upward thrust of the ball supports their fall and under 
               its glow they begin a slow descent to the other side of the 
               river. Above them, the helicopter dips back and locks its 
               searchlight on the shelf of boulders they just left.

               EXT. PLAIN - NIGHT

               The STAR MAN sets down with the smoothness of a man stepping 
               off an escalator. He looks over his shoulder. The helicopter 
               is still concentrating its spotlight on the ridge. He speaks 
               to the ball in his language.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (subtitles)
                         Iron channel message. Almost caught 
                         by pursuers. This may hinder escape. 
                         Wait for me.

               He lets the ball go and, with even more velocity than the 
               others, it zips into the sky.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. TRUCK STOP - NIGHT

               A WOMAN in a Frederick's of Hollywood negligee lets a TRUCK 
               DRIVER out of one of the Winnebagos parked to the side of 
               the main building.

                                     WOMAN
                         Don't forget to tell the boys where 
                         you had a good time.

                                     DRIVER
                              (calling back to her)
                         You weren't that good.

               Her rusty laugh follows him into the parking lot. He walks 
               between the trucks to a semi which has half of a pre-fab 
               mobile home tied onto its flat-bed. The polyethylene that 
               covers the open side of the house flaps in the WIND at the 
               lower corner next to the cab. The Driver opens his door. He 
               takes out a staple gun and refastens the dark green plastic 
               to the house frame.

               INT. HALF HOUSE - NIGHT

               In the middle of the empty bedroom, the STAR MAN tries to 
               cushion Jenny against the sudden JOLTS made by the semi as 
               it lumbers out of the parking lot.

               EXT. HIGHWAY 76 - NIGHT

               With the Driver taking it smoothly through the gears, the 
               semi picks up speed.

               INT. HALF HOUSE - NIGHT

               The STAR MAN moves Jenny into a rectangle of moonlight shaped 
               on the floor by a high, wide window and strips off her blouse.

               The cold light marbles Jenny's skin and makes the blood from 
               her wounds appear black. With her blouse, the STAR MAN wipes 
               away the blood on the right side of her head and neck. He 
               finds a deep glass cut on her cheek and two entry points in 
               her neck. He concentrates on her cheek and we can SEE the 
               glow of his brain through his human skin.

               A bit of the white light comes out of his forehead. It tumbles 
               across to Jenny's cheek and settles into the wound. The STAR 
               MAN watches intently as one end of the wound flares brightly 
               for an instant, then dies. The flesh left behind has been 
               closed without a scar.

               A larger piece of light drops out of his forehead into what's 
               left of the gash. With that area suffused in a healing glow, 
               he shifts his focus to the pellet holes on her neck. He sends 
               two pieces of light plunging into the wounds. Immediately, 
               they spread into halos which we can SEE radiating from under 
               the skin.

               Out of the night comes a LONG BLAST ON the AIR HORN and the 
               STAR MAN has to steady Jenny as the truck swerves around 
               something in the highway.

               When it settles back into its ride, the STAR MAN wipes the 
               blood off Jenny's shoulder. The beams of the passing cars 
               through the plastic catch the fatigue on the STAR MAN's face 
               as he works over Jenny.

               EXT. HIGHWAY 76 - NIGHT

               With its pre-fab house, the semi rumbles through Julesburg, 
               Sterling and Ft. Morgan. By the time it gets to Denver, dawn 
               is beginning to color the tips of the Rocky Mountains.

               INT. HALF HOUSE - DAWNBREAK

               It's still dark in here. With a chunk of light in his left 
               hand, the STAR MAN dabs at the last of Jenny's wounds, leaving 
               behind a phosphorescent bandage. More of these patches glimmer 
               up and down her right side. He checks her over to see if 
               he's missed a wound. He hasn't.

               He covers her with his windbreaker and, exhausted by his 
               efforts, sits back against the wall. He waits to see that 
               Jenny is sleeping comfortably, then presses the palms of his 
               hands together. The satel compass appears between them. The 
               green dot tells him he is still on course.

               EXT. INTERSTATE - SUNRISE

               Colorado Highway PATROLMEN are dropping orange fluorescent 
               cones across two of the three westbound lanes to form a 
               roadblock. The sound of a harmonica draws us to Shermin's 
               helicopter parked in a meadow beside the road.

               EXT. HELICOPTER - SUNRISE

               As the radio technician plays the harmonica, Lyman clangs 
               down the steps and bends to wake Shermin who is sacked out 
               under the fuselage.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Tell him I'm not here.

                                     LYMAN
                         I did.

               Shermin sighs and rolls over on his back. He looks terrible.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Get me a radio. At least I won't 
                         have to look at his face.

               EXT. MEADOW - SUNRISE

               Shermin is holding a field radio to his ear.

                                     FOX (V.O.)
                         We're growing very concerned back 
                         here. There's no use pretending 
                         otherwise. We're rapidly approaching 
                         a 'condition red.' People are 
                         beginning to ask difficult questions.

                                     SHERMIN
                         I'll make this as simple as I can, 
                         George. They disappeared.

                                     FOX (V.O.)
                         I don't care where you're from you 
                         just can't disappear into thin air.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (through a punchy 
                              hysterical laugh)
                         George, listen to what you're saying. 
                         This thing's changed itself into a 
                         man. Disappearing may not be that 
                         big a deal.

                                     FOX (V.O.)
                         So far you've let it cross the heart 
                         of America. For two days it has been 
                         absorbing information that is 
                         detrimental to our security. I don't 
                         see the humor in that.

               Stung, Shermin takes a deep breath, controls himself and 
               returns the radio to his ear.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Maybe... look, this is just something 
                         to think about... from what I got at 
                         the shopping center, it was more 
                         scared than anything else... I don't 
                         feel it's as big a threat as you 
                         think it is...

                                     FOX (V.O.)
                         Is that what's affecting your 
                         performance?

                                     SHERMIN
                         I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm 
                         doing my damndest to catch them. 
                         Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 
                         70 past Grand Junction. They're 
                         heading west. If they're not flying 
                         we have a damn good chance of getting 
                         them. All I'm asking is that you 
                         people think about it.

                                     FOX (V.O.)
                         You just do your job, Shermin. We'll 
                         make the policy.

               EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DAY

               The semi is in the slow lane. Its right rear turn signal 
               blinks steadily telling US that it is leaving the highway 
               and going north at the intersection ahead.

               INT. HALF HOUSE - DAY

               Jenny stirs awake under the windbreaker in the bedroom as a 
               sloppy DOWNSHIFT JOLTS the house. Her eyes flutter open and 
               she looks around the room trying to figure out where she is. 
               The truck leans into the turn. Jenny braces herself on one 
               arm and sits up.

               Catching the windbreaker as it slips off her front, she 
               remembers that she was shot and examines her right side. She 
               runs her fingers over her cheek and neck, across her shoulder 
               and down her side, feeling for traces of the wounds she knows 
               she sustained. She has been completely healed and there are 
               no scars. She leans forward and looks down the hallway.

                                     JENNY
                         Hello... hello.

               The WIND snapping the polyethylene is the only answer she 
               gets. She picks her blouse off the floor next to her purse, 
               but throws it aside and shrugs into the windbreaker when she 
               sees the blood and bullet holes.

               Her sudden rise to a standing position makes her light-headed 
               and she has to lean against the doorway until the spinning 
               stops. With her hands outstretched, as guards against the 
               sway of the truck, Jenny shuffles down the hallway.

                                     JENNY
                         Hello. Where are you?

               There is no one in the kitchen and she continues into the 
               living room. It is empty. Jenny opens the door to an enclosed 
               back porch. It is also empty. The STAR MAN is gone. She 
               returns to the living room and stands there not really knowing 
               what to do next. The countryside rushes by outside a floor-
               to-ceiling picture window.

               A WAIL FROM the semi's AIR HORN jars Jenny out of her reverie 
               and she goes to press her cheek against the window. She is 
               looking past her left hand at the road when she notices a 
               wide green ring on her finger above her wedding band. She 
               steps back from the window to examine it, then with some 
               trepidation, twists it off. As it clears the end of her 
               finger, the STAR MAN's VOICE SPEAKS OUT OF IT.

                                     STAR MAN (V.O.)
                         Jennyhay...

               Jenny drops the ring as if she'd been stung. The STAR MAN's 
               voice stops as soon as she does and the ring bounces across 
               the floor until it hits the baseboard. It looks innocent 
               enough lying there, but Jenny has a great deal of trouble 
               making herself approach it.

               When she finally picks it up, it does nothing. She turns it 
               in her hand and when the side of the ring hole that was facing 
               her when she took the ring off faces her again, the STAR 
               MAN's VOICE CONTINUES.

                                     STAR MAN (V.O.)
                         ...nd. You are all fixed. I'm sorry 
                         you were shot. I was a big problem 
                         for you. Thank you for your help. I 
                         can go to my ship alone now.

               EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

               The semi is picking up speed as it heads north.

               EXT. SEMI'S CAB - DAY

               The Driver checks his side view mirror to see if the lane 
               next to him is clear and is astonished to see a woman's arm 
               sticking out of the polyethylene waving a blouse at him.

               EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

               Smoke billows from under the tires as the semi skids to a 
               stop.

               EXT. SEMI - DAY

               Jenny, her purse over her shoulder, is running toward the 
               cab as the Driver steps out with a wrench in his hand.

                                     JENNY
                         Where did you stop last?

                                     DRIVER
                         What the hell do you think you're 
                         doing?

                                     JENNY
                         Where did you stop last?

                                     DRIVER
                         Stay right there...

                                     JENNY
                         What was your last stop?

                                     DRIVER
                         Elmo's...

                                     JENNY
                         Where's that?

                                     DRIVER
                         About five miles back.

               Jenny's thumb is already out for a ride as she sprints across 
               the highway.

                                     DRIVER
                              (shouting after her)
                         Are there any more in there?

               EXT. HIGHWAY 70 - DAY

               A passing car TAKES US TO the STAR MAN as he runs along the 
               shoulder to a maroon and white '57 Chevy that has pulled off 
               to pick him up.

               EXT. '57 CHEVY - DAY

               A swarthy, bald MAN with hairy arms leans across the seat.

                                     MAN
                         Where are you going?

                                     MAN
                              (re-entering the flow 
                              of traffic)
                         I can only take you to Grand Junction, 
                         but you'll have a better chance to 
                         get a ride from there.

               The STAR MAN smiles.

                                     MAN
                         Where you from?

               The STAR MAN starts to point to the sky, then catches himself.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I don't understand.

                                     MAN
                         Parlez vous Francais?... Habla 
                         Ingles?... Sprechen zie deutsch?

               These are foreign words to the STAR MAN and he pastes on his 
               smile.

                                     MAN
                         Good job, neither do I. What do you 
                         do for a living?

                                     STAR MAN
                              (pretending)
                         I don't understand.

                                     MAN
                         I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'

                                     STAR MAN
                         No.

                                     COOK (MAN)
                         Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as 
                         a cook. That's how I make money.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I understand.

                                     COOK
                         What do you do?

                                     STAR MAN
                              (searches for an 
                              answer, then)
                         I make maps.

                                     COOK
                         Hey, that sounds interesting. You 
                         like it?

                                     STAR MAN
                         Eh... yes.

                                     COOK
                         Make any money?

                                     STAR MAN
                         No.

                                     COOK
                              (takes a pack of Camels 
                              out of his pocket)
                         You don't get rich as a cook, either, 
                         believe me. I got a girl going to 
                         college this fall. The wife had to 
                         go back to nursing to help pay for 
                         it.

               He sticks a cigarette in his mouth and flips one up for the 
               STAR MAN.

                                     COOK
                         Smoke?

               The STAR MAN takes it, quickly examines it, then positions 
               it in his mouth at the exact angle the Cook did. His eyebrows 
               raise when the Cook flicks his Bic and puffs an ash on the 
               end of his cigarette.

               The butane flame is swung in his direction and he flinches 
               back before allowing the Cook to singe his Camel. He copies 
               the Cook's puffing and the end of his cigarette begins to 
               glow.

                                     COOK
                         She wants to become a doctor. She's 
                         a bright kid. Hard worker. I think 
                         she'll make it. But the damned 
                         inflation's driven the tuition up so 
                         high it makes it real tough on a 
                         family like ours.

               The Cook inhales deeply from his cigarette and blows smoke 
               at the windshield. The STAR MAN mimics the inhalation, then 
               chokes. His eyes bulge and his cheeks puff out as he tries 
               to be cool and not cough. The Cook takes no notice of his 
               struggles.

                                     COOK
                         I got two other kids. I don't know 
                         what we'll do when they get old enough 
                         for college.

               Smoke starts to dribble out of the Star Man's nose and mouth. 
               Puzzled, he re-examines his cigarette.

                                     COOK
                         Everybody blames it on the oil crisis. 
                         That might be where it starts. But I 
                         think a lot of people are just using 
                         that as an excuse to rip the rest of 
                         us off. I see it every day in the 
                         kitchen. Peaches. We use the gallon 
                         cans. The price has gone up three 
                         times in the last year. And now the 
                         cans are only half full.

               The Cook takes another drag. As if etiquette required it, 
               the STAR MAN hurries to copy him. This time there are no ill 
               effects.

                                     COOK
                         Do you have children?

                                     STAR MAN
                         No.

                                     COOK
                         They're damned expensive and a pain 
                         in the ass sometimes, but I wouldn't 
                         trade having them for anything.

               The Cook flicks his ash out of the window. A moment later, 
               the STAR MAN mirrors his action.

                                     COOK
                         What do you think of America?

                                     STAR MAN
                         It is beautiful.

               EXT. ELMO'S - DAY

               A truck stop set back as little as the law allows from the 
               BUZZ OF INTERSTATE 70.

                                     JENNY (O.S.)
                         I'm looking for a guy about this 
                         tall, with brown hair and really 
                         gray eyes...

               We FIND Jenny at the set of fuel pumps nearest the highway 
               dogging an ATTENDANT while he services an 18-wheeler

                                     JENNY
                         He had on tan cords, a plaid shirt 
                         and a baseball cap... probably 
                         hitchhiking.

                                     ATTENDANT
                         I don't pay much attention to those 
                         guys.

                                     JENNY
                              (taking out her wallet)
                         In the last hour or so...

                                     ATTENDANT
                         Nope.

               Jenny folds back the plastic windows to the picture of her 
               husband.

                                     JENNY
                         This is him.

                                     ATTENDANT
                              (shakes his head)
                         Sorry.

               We FOLLOW Jenny as she wends her way through the trucks 
               questioning other attendants. The RUMBLE OF TRAFFIC DROWNS 
               OUT their CONVERSATION, but the answer is always the same. 
               Finally, we FOLLOW the picture as Jenny hands it up to an 
               ATTENDANT cleaning the windshield on a Peterbilt cab.

                                     SECOND ATTENDANT
                              (looking at picture)
                         I don't know... I'm not sure. I might 
                         have seen him up the road a piece on 
                         my way in. He's long gone by now.

               He hands the snapshot back to Jenny. She nods a 'thank you' 
               and looks wistfully around the yard. There is nothing she 
               can do. Fitting the picture back into her wallet, she walks 
               away. After a few steps she turns back.

                                     JENNY
                         You know if anybody here's going to 
                         Wisconsin?

                                     SECOND ATTENDANT
                         Ask inside.

               INT. ELMO'S DINER - DAY

               It's bustling, loud and smoky. Jenny is standing just inside 
               the entrance. She licks her lips and tries to clear the frog 
               out of her throat.

                                     JENNY
                              (small voice)
                         Anybody going to...

               Nobody pays any attention to her. Her voice trails off. She 
               swallows hard and tries again, this time booming out.

                                     JENNY
                         Anybody going to Wisconsin?

               The activity in the diner comes to a screeching halt and in 
               the silence Jenny adds in a normal voice:

                                     JENNY
                         I need a ride.

               An OLDER MAN, with a face seamed by cigarettes and weather, 
               waves at her from the counter.

                                     OLDER MAN
                         I'm going to Des Moines. If you can 
                         wait till I finish here, you're 
                         welcome to ride along.

               This gets some good-humored cheers and catcalls.

                                     JENNY
                         I can wait.

               Smiling self-consciously, she takes a seat at the end of the 
               counter and orders coffee from the waitress. While she is 
               waiting for it to come, she happens to glance outside and 
               sees a Colorado Highway patrol car stopped in the yard.

               The officer on the passenger side is talking to one of the 
               attendants. Jenny turns away from the window and finds that 
               she is able to watch the conversation in a strip of mirrors 
               that runs around the top of the pie case. The squad car leaves 
               and her coffee arrives.

                                     JENNY
                              (to the waitress)
                         Where's the phone?

               INT. SIT-DOWN PHONE BOOTH - DINER HALLWAY - DAY

               Jenny drops a dime in the slot and dials 'O.'

                                     OPERATOR (V.O.)
                         Operator... may I help you?

                                     JENNY
                         Could you give me the highway patrol, 
                         please?

               After TWO RINGS, the phone is picked up on the other end of 
               the line.

                                     MALE (V.O.)
                         Sergeant Packert, Highway Patrol.

                                     JENNY
                         My name's Jenny Haydn. I think you're 
                         looking for me. I was kidnapped in 
                         Eau Claire, Wisconsin a couple of 
                         days ago. But I'm free now.

                                     SERGEANT (V.O.)
                         What was your name again?

                         Jenny Haydn. I'm on my way home and 
                         I don't want anybody I'm with shot 
                         at when you...

                                     SERGEANT (V.O.)
                         Hold on.

               EXT. ROADBLOCK (INTERSTATE 70) - DAY

               Standing back of the officers, Shermin watches them check to 
               cars passing through the squeeze point. Every car trunk is 
               opened. Vans and campers are looked into.

               Lyman runs up and whispers in Shermin's ear. Shermin is 
               startled by what he hears. He leaves Lyman in charge and 
               hurries to the helicopter parked in the field beside the 
               roadblock.

               INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

               A TECHNICIAN gives Shermin a headset phone as he enters.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (hand over the mouth-
                              piece)
                         You trace it yet?

                                     TECHNICIAN
                         All we know right now is that it's 
                         east of here.

               Shermin puts on the headset and the technician starts a tape 
               recorder.

                                     SHERMIN
                         This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, 
                         Mrs. Haydn?

                         Look, I just wanted to tell you that 
                         I'm all right and I'm on my way home.

                         You've been through quite an ordeal, 
                         Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where 
                         you are and let us pick you up? We'll 
                         fly you home.

                                     JENNY
                         No. You'll want to ask a lot of 
                         questions I don't want to answer 
                         right now. I already have a ride.

               INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

               The Technician hands Shermin a note which reads: ELMO"S TRUCK 
               STOP/ABOUT 30 MILES EAST.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         I only called to tell you I was free 
                         and not to shoot anybody I was with 
                         if you see me.

               Shermin jabs his thumb upward, indicating that the helicopter 
               should lift off.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Is the man who kidnapped you there 
                         now?

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         I told you. He let me go. I'm on my 
                         way home.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (his hand over the 
                              mouthpiece)
                         Get a highway patrol unit over there.

               EXT. ROADBLOCK - DAY

               Shermin's helicopter lifts off.

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         Mrs. Haydn, I'm going to have to ask 
                         you to stay where you are.

               INT. SIT-DOWN PHONE BOOTH

               A sharp rap on the glass startles Jenny and she turns around 
               to see her ride.

                                     OLDER MAN
                         Ready?

               Jenny holds up a finger that asks for a moment longer on the 
               phone.

                                     JENNY
                              (into phone)
                         Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name 
                         again?

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         Marc Shermin.

                                     JENNY
                         Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If 
                         you want to ask me any questions, 
                         call me at home in a couple of days. 
                         I'm in the book.

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         Do you know what you were kidnapped 
                         by?

               Pause.

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         Mrs. Haydn...

                                     JENNY
                         He doesn't want to hurt anybody. 
                         Please leave him alone.

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         Is he on his way to Lathrop Wells?

               This hits Jenny like a kick in the stomach. She leans her 
               head back against the wall. Her ride is pacing outside the 
               booth.

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         What's he planning to do in Lathrop 
                         Wells? Is he meeting someone there?

               Jenny smashes the receiver back in its cradle and throws 
               open the door.

                                     JENNY
                              (on her way past the 
                              weathered driver)
                         I changed my mind. Thanks.

               She rushes down the hallway to the dining area where again 
               she stands just inside the entrance.

                                     JENNY
                              (at the top of her 
                              lungs)
                         It's me again...

               The place goes quiet except for a smattering of laughter.

                                     JENNY
                         I need a fast ride west.

               INT. PORSCHE - DAY

               The speedometer reads 90. The driver, a bespectacled, pimply-
               faced SIXTEEN YEAR OLD, shifts into fifth gear. Jenny is 
               harnessed in the passenger seat. Chatter from a CB under the 
               dash COMPETES WITH ROCK N' ROLL ON THE TAPE DECK.

                                     JENNY
                         You sure this is your car?

                                     TEENAGER
                              (with a stutter)
                         My grandmother's rich.

                                     JENNY
                              (as they come up on a 
                              station wagon)
                         Slow down, slow down.

                                     TEENAGER
                         Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.

               But he downshifts. The Porsche is going a mere 80 when they 
               pass the station wagon.

                                     JENNY
                              (peering at its 
                              occupants)
                         I told you I'm looking for someone.

                                     TEENAGER
                         In the cars, too?!

                                     JENNY
                         I don't know where he is.

                                     TEENAGER
                         This is going to be a real drag. I 
                         thought you wanted to go fast.

               Howling at full throttle, three highway patrol cars rush 
               past them in the opposite direction. Jenny swivels around to 
               follow their progress until they are out of sight.

                                     TEENAGER
                         They after you?

                                     JENNY
                         What? No, of course not.

                                     TEENAGER
                              (his stutter thicker 
                              than before)
                         Would be kinda neat if they were. I 
                         think I could outrun them. Maybe get 
                         my picture in the papers.

               Jenny takes a second look at this guy. He flashes her a gap-
               toothed grin.

               EXT. OVERPASS - DAY

               The Cook's '57 Chevy makes a left on the street intersecting 
               the off-ramp and stops at the curb. Behind it a large plastic 
               yellow chicken twirls on a pole above the restaurant it 
               advertises.

                                     COOK
                         Well, here we are... You go down 
                         that ramp there, you're sure to get 
                         a ride.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (getting out)
                         Thank you.

                                     COOK
                         And don't be shy about your English. 
                         You speak better than a lot of people 
                         I know.
                              (leaving)
                         Take care of yourself.

               As an afterthought, the STAR MAN duplicates the Cook's wave, 
               then heads down the ramp. As he clears the frame, our VIEW 
               ZOOMS AND ZOOMS AND ZOOMS UNTIL we can SEE a piece of the 
               roadblock in the valley below him. During the MOVE-IN, we 
               BEGIN TO PICK UP CB CHATTER.

                                     VOICES (V.O.)
                         Flash for all you good buddies heading 
                         west on 70. Smoky's got a roadblock 
                         just beyond Grand Junction... Better 
                         dump your dope, they're going through 
                         everything... He's right. I was just 
                         there and I'm still sore...

               INT. PORSCHE - DAY

               Jenny TURNS DOWN the ROCK 'N ROLL to listen to the CB.

                                     VOICES (V.O.)
                         Ah loves to be frisked! What are 
                         they looking for? I'm holding. Any 
                         way around it? Where are you? Oh 
                         no!! There it is!!

                                     TEENAGER
                         I bet you we find your friend at the 
                         roadblock.

               Jenny doesn't answer immediately. She takes her time checking 
               out the people in a VW they are passing.

                                     JENNY
                              (to the road ahead)
                         We better find him before that.

               EXT. INTERSTATE 70 - DAY

               In the style prescribed by Jenny, the STAR MAN raises his 
               thumb to a dilapidated Vega shimmying down the on-ramp. The 
               two blue-haired ladies inside are afraid to look at him as 
               they go by. He has the same luck with an attractive blonde 
               secretary that passes on the highway.

               EXT. ELMO'S - DAY

               A highway PATROLMAN is standing behind the open door of his 
               car speaking into the mike of his radio.

                                     PATROLMAN
                         The girl's not here, Mr. Shermin. 
                         Seems right after she talked to you, 
                         she got a ride west with a kid.

               INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

               All six TV screens display the road rushing under it.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (into mouthpiece of 
                              his headset)
                         You get that, Lyman?

                                     LYMAN (V.O.)
                         We're ready.

               EXT. SKY ABOVE INTERSTATE 70 - DAY

               Shermin's S65 banks through a U-turn and chases west.

               EXT. INTERSTATE 70 - DAY

               A dun-colored Roadrunner gurgles down the ramp and stops in 
               front of the STAR MAN. Two grubby LONG HAIRS in worn western 
               clothes are inside with boxes of house-hold utensils and 
               duffle bags.

                                     LONG HAIR
                         Where you going?

                                     STAR MAN
                         Las Vegas, please.

                                     LONG HAIR
                         We're going to L.A.

               He looks at his buddy stretched on the jumble in the back. 
               The buddy nods.

                                     LONG HAIR
                         Sure. Get in. We can drop you in 
                         Vegas or get you darn close.

               The STAR MAN opens the door and gets in.

               INT. PORSCHE - DAY

               The CB CONTINUES TO CRACKLE with news of the roadblock. 
               Jenny's eyes restlessly search the overpass under the whirling 
               yellow chicken for any sign of the STAR MAN. She sees the 
               dun-colored Roadrunner waiting at the foot of the on-ramp 
               for a break in the traffic, but she is too far away to see 
               who's inside. As the Porsche gets closer, it overtakes an 18-
               wheeler and Jenny's view of the Roadrunner is cut off 
               entirely. She passes without seeing the STAR MAN.

               EXT. INTERSTATE 70 - DAY

               The Porsche weaves through the traffic giving Jenny a chance 
               to look into the cars and trucks it shoots by.

               INT. PORSCHE - DAY

               Jenny is turned around looking back at a camper.

                                     TEENAGER
                         I'm telling you, you're going to 
                         find him at the roadblock, or right 
                         after, or not at all.

                                     JENNY
                         If he didn't want to go through the 
                         roadblock, is there any other way to 
                         get to Vegas?

                                     TEENAGER
                         Fly.

               Jenny gives him a withering look.

                                     TEENAGER
                         The five-fifty. We already passed 
                         it. But it'll take him way out of 
                         his way.

                                     JENNY
                         Pull over. I've got to get back there.

                         Why wouldn't he want to go through 
                         the roadblock?... What did you guys 
                         do?... I won't tell anybody.

                                     JENNY
                         It's easier not to tell if you don't 
                         know.

               EXT. INTERSTATE - DAY

               The Porsche slows to a stop on the shoulder.

                                     TEENAGER
                              (as Jenny opens the 
                              door)
                         Wait. Could I have your autograph?

                                     JENNY
                         Sure.

               She leans back and gives the startled Teenager a kiss on the 
               mouth, then gets out.

                                     TEENAGER
                         I have nothing to do. I'd like to 
                         help you.

                                     JENNY
                         Don't worry. I'll be all right.

               She closes the door. The Teenager takes a last look at her 
               before pulling back on the highway. Jenny waits for a car in 
               the slow lane to go by, then runs across to the line and 
               waits for cars in the fast lane to go by.

               INT. ROADRUNNER - DAY

               The STAR MAN spots Jenny standing on the line peering into 
               the on-coming cars for signs of him. He becomes agitated and 
               his mouth begins to move soundlessly. There is a break in 
               the traffic and Jenny dashes to the center divider. The STAR 
               MAN leans across his driver and yells as the Roadrunner 
               plunges by her.

                                     STAR MAN
                         JENNYHAYDN!!!

               EXT. INTERSTATE - DAY

               Jenny spins around to see the Roadrunner skid to a stop on 
               the shoulder and the STAR MAN get out. A motorcycle bombs 
               by. He starts across the lanes of traffic toward Jenny. A 
               truck blasts past him in the slow lane. He is buffeted into 
               the fast lane. Jenny runs down the center divider to meet 
               him. A VW honks, its tires squeal on the pavement as it 
               swerves around him. He reaches the safety of the center 
               divider. Jenny throws her arms around him and lays her head 
               against his chest. He stands there uncomfortably not knowing 
               how to respond to this human emotion.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I told you goodbye. Why are you here?

                                     JENNY
                         The police are waiting for you up 
                         ahead. There's a roadblock. You have 
                         to go back.

                                     STAR MAN
                         This car will take me to Las Vegas. 
                         I cannot go back.

                                     JENNY
                         The police know about Lathrop Wells. 
                         We have to go another way. Come on.

               She grabs his wrist but he hangs back.

                                     STAR MAN
                         If I don't meet the ship, my people 
                         will go home without me.

                                     JENNY
                         Please understand. If you go this 
                         way, you'll never get to your ship. 
                         The police know about Lathrop Wells. 
                         We have to go another way. I'll get 
                         you to your ship. I promise.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I will go. But not you.

                                     JENNY
                         You shit! I'll decide if I go or 
                         not. Not you. I don't know what you 
                         do on your planet, but I didn't think 
                         that was very nice walking out on me 
                         like you did.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I don't want you to be hurt.

                                     JENNY
                         Come on.

               Holding the STAR MAN's hand, Jenny pulls him toward the road.

                                     JENNY
                         I didn't ask to come along on this 
                         trip, but I sure as hell am going to 
                         be the one to say when I get off.

               They bolt across the lanes of traffic to the other side of 
               the road where she flags down an old black pickup truck. She 
               says something to the driver and she and the STAR MAN climb 
               into the back. As the truck returns to the highway, the CLACK 
               OF AN APPROACHING HELICOPTER OVERPOWERS the TRAFFIC SOUNDS.

               EXT. SKY - DAY

               Shermin's helicopter slices around a pine-dotted peak 
               following the twists of Interstate 70 below. In the near 
               distance, we can SEE the roadblock.

               INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

               Unnoticed by Shermin or the Technicians, the black pickup 
               passes off the television screens carrying their quarry east.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (into headset)
                         Any sign of either of them yet?

               The roadblock appears on the television screens.

               EXT. ROADBLOCK - DAY

               Lyman, wearing a headset plugged into a belt pack, is walking 
               down the line of cars.

                                     LYMAN
                         I don't think they're going to show.

               INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

               A swift kick from Shermin sends a stool clanging into a 
               bulkhead. The Technicians won't meet his eyes when he turns 
               back to them.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Okay. Tell the highway patrol to 
                         block all major arteries off 70 from 
                         here to Elmo's.

               EXT. INTERSTATE 70 - DAY

               Two highway patrol cars scatter the traffic in front of them 
               with their rack lights and SIRENS.

               EXT. PICKUP - DAY

               Jenny and the STAR MAN are sitting against the cab, a horse 
               blanket drawn up around their shoulders. They can see the 
               flashing lights coming from way down the road and watch 
               helplessly as the patrol cars eat up the distance between 
               them.

               EXT. INTERSTATE 70 - DAY

               The pickup makes the turn onto Highway 550.

               EXT. PICKUP - DAY

               For a moment, Jenny and the STAR MAN think they're safe. 
               That hope turns to despair when the two patrol cars loop 
               after them. They keep getting closer. The STAR MAN inches 
               the blanket up over his nose. Unexpectedly, the patrol cars 
               are thrown into a skid. When they stop, they are facing each 
               other ready to inspect the traffic coming off 70. They lower 
               the blanket from their faces. Jenny lays her head back against 
               the cab, exhausted.

                                     STAR MAN
                         The Cook said I speak good English.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. HIGHWAY 550 - LATE AFTERNOON

               A RUMBLE OF DISTANT THUNDER follows the lightning that flashes 
               from the dark clouds hanging on the horizon. Looking 
               incomplete without its trailer, the tractor/cab of a Mack 
               truck makes a turn on a farm road, revealing Jenny and the 
               STAR MAN standing on the gravel. The STAR MAN looks back to 
               where they came from. There is nothing coming so he sets out 
               in the other direction.

                                     JENNY
                         Where are you going?

                                     STAR MAN
                         I must meet my ship.

                                     JENNY
                         Why can't we wait here for a ride?

                                     STAR MAN
                         I feel better if I move.

                                     JENNY
                         We're hundreds of miles from where 
                         you have to be.

               The STAR MAN ignores her and continues to walk.

                                     JENNY
                              (shouts at him)
                         Even if we walk five miles, it's not 
                         going to make any difference.

               Jenny turns toward an oncoming car and sticks out her thumb. 
               The STAR MAN falls into the same pose just back of her. The 
               car honks at them as it breezes by.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (screams after it)
                         Asshole!!

                                     JENNY
                              (shocked)
                         Where did you learn that?

                                     STAR MAN
                         The cook.

               EXT. ROADSIDE - LATE AFTERNOON

               A torrential rainstorm lashes the countryside. The STAR MAN 
               and Jenny splash along the edge of the asphalt. Their heads 
               are lowered against the weather. They are both drenched to 
               the skin.

                                     JENNY
                              (after a few steps)
                         We're not going to get a ride tonight.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I can't stay on this planet.

                                     JENNY
                         No one's traveling in this weather.

                                     STAR MAN
                         You promised you would get me to my 
                         ship.

                                     JENNY
                              (shouts after him)
                         I will. I will. We still have another 
                         day.

                                     STAR MAN
                         You promised.

                                     JENNY
                         What do you want from me? There are 
                         no cars on this road. I didn't ask 
                         for this stupid storm.

               The STAR MAN mutters in his language.

                                     JENNY
                         What are you saying?

                                     STAR MAN
                         You can stop. I will go on alone.

                                     JENNY
                         We're too far away to walk. Don't 
                         you understand?

               The STAR MAN looks at her. With the rain streaming off his 
               face, he looks at her. For the first time, the reality of 
               the situation hits him. He turns and, swearing in his own 
               language, flails at the rain. A distance from Jenny, he stops 
               and cries out in English.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I can't stay here. I want to go home. 
                         I don't want this skin. I don't want 
                         to look like this.

               Jenny can see him standing with his head bowed. She walks 
               over to him.

                                     JENNY
                              (trying to ease his 
                              pain)
                         Why don't you send one of your radio 
                         balloons and tell your captain that 
                         you might be late?

                                     STAR MAN
                         I used the last one to jump off the 
                         cliff...

                                     JENNY
                         Let's find a place out of the rain. 
                         I'm sure we'll get a ride in the 
                         morning.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I can't be late. I don't know if the 
                         radio balloons work above your planet. 
                         I don't know if my words went to the 
                         ship. If I'm not there, the captain 
                         will think I'm dead and go.

                                     JENNY
                         We'll get a ride in the morning.

               A flash of lightning shows us:

               EXT. DESERTED RAILROAD SIDING - DUSK

               Jenny and the STAR MAN are following the tracks to an 
               abandoned boxcar.

               INT. BOXCAR - DUSK

               The STAR MAN climbs in and pulls Jenny after him. Jenny is 
               shivering badly.

                                     JENNY
                         Can you close the door?

               The STAR MAN scrapes it forward. He activates the satel 
               compass which lights the interior of the boxcar. While he is 
               doing this Jenny turns her back to him and takes off her 
               jacket. Her teeth chattering, she tries to wring the water 
               out of it.

                                     STAR MAN
                         You are cold.

                                     JENNY
                         You're damn right I am.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I do not get cold.

               Clutching the windbreaker to her breasts, Jenny looks at the 
               STAR MAN over her shoulder. It doesn't take her long to make 
               up her mind.

                                     JENNY
                              (crossing to him)
                         Open your shirt.

               She waits while he struggles with the buttons. After two she 
               brushes away his hands and undoes the rest. She lets the 
               windbreaker drop and, slipping her arms around his waist, 
               presses her bare chest against his.

                                     JENNY
                              (savoring it)
                         Oh, you're warm... put your arms 
                         around me.

               The STAR MAN does and Jenny jumps as the wet sleeves touch 
               her back.

                                     JENNY
                         Take your shirt off.

               It is difficult with Jenny around his waist, but he manages. 
               He drapes his arms over her. She snuggles into him. The RAIN 
               POUNDS ON THE ROOF. Gradually, Jenny responds to the STAR 
               MAN's warmth and relaxes. She lifts her head off his chest 
               and looks at him.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What?

                                     JENNY
                         Nothing.

               She brushes her lips against his. The STAR MAN's not sure 
               what's happening. But he's not offended. Her next kiss is 
               full and long. He accepts it with his eyes open and when she 
               eases back he leans in for more. Jenny responds. As if on 
               command, the satel compass comes from around behind the STAR 
               MAN to hover in back of Jenny. He takes it between his palms 
               and extinguishes it.

               INT. BOXCAR - MORNING

               Jenny awakens and looks around. The STAR MAN is not with 
               her. As she stands up she hears his VOICE OUTSIDE. He is 
               speaking to something in his language.

               She goes to the door to find out what and sees him standing 
               beside a fenced-in pasture talking to the horses inside.

               EXT. PASTURE - MORNING

               Jenny joins the STAR MAN at the fence.

                                     JENNY
                         Good morning.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Horses.

                                     JENNY
                         You don't forget anything, do you?

                                     STAR MAN
                         No.

               Jenny pets one of the horses on the nose.

                                     JENNY
                              (to the horse)
                         Hello... hello. How are you this 
                         morning?

                                     STAR MAN
                         Do they talk?!

                                     JENNY
                              (laughs)
                         No, they don't talk... We talk to 
                         them.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I understand.

               An appaloosa nudges her way through the others to the fence.

                                     JENNY
                         Oh, you're pretty...

                                     STAR MAN
                         I gave you a baby last night.

               Shocked, Jenny looks at him from around the appaloosa's nose. 
               The STAR MAN is combing a horse's mane with his fingers and 
               he doesn't see her expression.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (meaning the horses)
                         They are beautiful.

                                     JENNY
                         Yes, they are.

                                     STAR MAN
                         You have been very good to me, 
                         Jennyhaydn.
                              (turns to face her)
                         You said you wanted a baby, so I 
                         gave you one.

                                     JENNY
                              (shakes her head 'no')
                         But...

                                     STAR MAN
                         It will be human and it will look 
                         like this.
                              (touches his face)
                         But when it comes it will know 
                         everything I know and everything you 
                         know. That is something from my planet 
                         that I want your baby to have.

                                     JENNY
                         I told you it's impossible for me to 
                         have a baby.

                                     STAR MAN
                         You will have this baby. If you want 
                         it. If you don't, I can stop it now.

               Jenny comes over and puts her arms around the STAR MAN.

                                     JENNY
                         I want it.

               EXT. SKY - DAY

               A formation of six black Bell Cobra helicopters rush at us 
               out of the blue. From above them we can see that they are 
               heading for a small desert town. 'Welcome to Lathrop Wells' 
               is spelled out on a hillside in white-washed stones.

               EXT. AIRSTRIP - DAY

               Grubby, unshaven and unwashed, Shermin, Bell, Lyman and the 
               rest of the crew watch the seven Cobras land in sequence. 
               Fox, immaculate in a freshly pressed black flight suit, climbs 
               out of the first one down and he and Shermin meet in the 
               middle of the runway.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Hello George.

                                     FOX
                         Shermin...

                                     SHERMIN
                         What's all this for?

                                     FOX
                         We have a new directive. I'm taking 
                         over.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (scans the Cobras)
                         We don't have to do it that way. We 
                         can catch him this time.

                                     FOX
                         Washington thinks it's too late for 
                         that.

                                     SHERMIN
                         I've never been taken off an 
                         assignment in my life. Give me twenty-
                         four hours and I'll have him for 
                         you.

                                     FOX
                         You're not hearing me.

                                     SHERMIN
                         You can change a directive, George. 
                         You've done it before. Listen to me. 
                         He's going somewhere in Death Valley. 
                         Lathrop Wells was never anything but 
                         a bus stop. East is the nuclear site. 
                         There are no roads in there. She was 
                         teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling 
                         you. We block the four roads into 
                         Death Valley and we got him.

                                     FOX
                         We'll do that. But how are we going 
                         to hold him? He can change himself 
                         into a man. He can disappear.

                                     SHERMIN
                         That's the chance we have to take.

                                     FOX
                         No, we don't.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Then you're going to have to do it 
                         without me.

                                     FOX
                         You're a career intelligence officer, 
                         Shermin. You'll be in the air with 
                         us.

                                     SHERMIN
                         You're talking about taking a life. 
                         The most unique life form on this 
                         planet. I think we're better than 
                         that.

               EXT. LAS VEGAS - LATE AFTERNOON

               A fire-engine-red Pontiac convertible with two COWBOYS (late 
               fifties) in the front and Jenny and the STAR MAN in the back 
               moves with the traffic along the main drag in the downtown 
               area. The STAR MAN's head swivels from side to side trying 
               to take in the neon that juts up around him. The convertible 
               stops at a light. The cowboy on the passenger side opens the 
               door and tips his hat to Jenny as she and the Star Man get 
               out of the back seat.

               EXT. SIDEWALK (LAS VEGAS) - LATE AFTERNOON

               The STAR MAN is afraid of the crush of people and wants to 
               stay close to Jenny, but is fascinated by the whir and click 
               and jingle of the one-armed bandits that seem to be 
               everywhere.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Is this gambling?

               Jenny nods. A LADY in curlers and pedal pushers hits a twenty 
               dollar jackpot. Hanging onto Jenny's hand the STAR MAN turns 
               around and walks sideways to watch the quarters tumble out 
               into the lady's shopping bag.

                                     STAR MAN
                         The cowboys were right. You can make 
                         money fast gambling.

                                     JENNY
                         You don't make money gambling. You 
                         lose it.

               INT. DRUG STORE - LATE AFTERNOON

               The STAR MAN hangs back to examine a one-armed bandit inside 
               the front door while Jenny goes to the counter. An almost 
               imperceptible blue haze seems to seep from under the STAR 
               MAN's palms as he runs his hands up and down the sides of 
               the machine.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                              (to the clerk)
                         Do you have a good map of Death 
                         Valley?

                                     CLERK (V.O.)
                         We should have. Let me see.

               While the clerk searches for the map the STAR MAN comes up 
               to Jenny.

                                     STAR MAN
                         May I have twenty-five cents, please?

                                     JENNY
                         What for?

                                     STAR MAN
                         I want to gamble.

               Jenny sighs and rolls her eyes and fishes two quarters out 
               of her purse and hands them to him.

                                     JENNY
                         Here are two quarters. When you lose 
                         these, you're not going to get 
                         anymore.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I understand.
                              (heading back to the 
                              machine)
                         Thank you.

               He drops a quarter into the slot and pulls the handle. While 
               the pictures of fruit spin behind the view window, his hands 
               stroke the sides of the machine. An orange, a pear and a 
               cherry stop in the view window. At the counter Jenny explains 
               to the clerk that she is hitchhiking and wants the busiest 
               route into Death Valley without going through Lathrop Wells. 
               The STAR MAN looks long and hard at the machine before putting 
               in his last quarter. He pulls the handle. The blue haze flows 
               from his palms, three cherries lock into a line and the one-
               armed bandit begins to spit quarters.

               INT. CASINO - LATE AFTERNOON

               Jenny is nervous about being here. She feels every face that 
               looks at them could be a cop. The STAR MAN is pulling her 
               through a Maginot Line of slot machines toward a 'Super 
               Jackpot' machine that advertises a $275,000 payoff.

                         This is crazy. We don't have time 
                         for this.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I know how to gamble now.

                                     JENNY
                         You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we 
                         don't get a good ride before dark we 
                         could miss your ship.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I want to get money for you and the 
                         baby.

                                     JENNY
                         I don't need any money for the baby. 
                         I'll be fine.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Inflation, tuition, college. Children 
                         are damned expensive. I know.

                                     JENNY
                         The cook again?

                                     STAR MAN
                              (stepping up to the 
                              'Super Jackpot')
                         Yes.

                                     JENNY
                         If I ever run into that guy, I'm 
                         going to kick his ass.

               The STAR MAN pops a gleaming silver dollar into the machine, 
               pulls the handle and places his hands against the metal. 
               Jenny, knowing it can't work, but hoping that it will, stands 
               back and gnaws on her thumb. Then she sees the blue haze 
               vibrating out of the STAR MAN's palms. Jenny stifles a scream. 
               She looks around to see if anybody else has noticed. They 
               haven't. The STAR MAN smiles at her. The force field does 
               it's work. A picket line of 7's fills the view window. Amid 
               the jangle of bells and flashing lights that accompany a 
               winner Jenny doesn't know whether she should jump for joy or 
               hide her face.

               EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DUSK

               A dot in the distance becomes a brand new Camaro. As it blasts 
               away from under us we see a paper license in its back window. 
               The cabin light is on inside the car.

               INT. CAMARO - DUSK

               In the passenger seat the STAR MAN is riffling through a 
               Columbia "History of the World." A Webster's Dictionary is 
               on the dash in front of him. Wedged between his legs and the 
               transmission well is a shopping bag full of money.

                                     JENNY
                         It'll tell you pretty much everything 
                         about us...

                                     STAR MAN
                         This is very interesting. We are 
                         born knowing our history. We have 
                         other books. But not a book like 
                         this.

                                     JENNY
                         Any words you don't know you can 
                         find in the dictionary.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I understand.

                                     JENNY
                         It'll give you the different 
                         countries, how they came to be, what 
                         they are now, how America came to 
                         be, the governments, the languages... 
                         everything.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (chuckles)
                         Many of my people will not believe 
                         those things are possible. On my 
                         planet there is only one government, 
                         one people, one language. I will be 
                         asked a lot of questions.

                                     JENNY
                         What will you say about us?

                                     STAR MAN
                         I will say that we can be friends.

                                     JENNY
                         We can.

               She notices the green ring on her left hand and takes it 
               off.

                                     JENNY
                         This is yours...

                                     STAR MAN
                         If you want to keep it, you can.

                                     JENNY
                         I'd like to...

               She slips it back on her finger above her wedding band. They 
               drive in silence. The STAR MAN sets the history book on the 
               dash.

                                     JENNY
                              (takes the ring off 
                              again)
                         Would you put some of your singing 
                         in this for the baby?

                                     STAR MAN
                         You want the baby to laugh at me.

                                     JENNY
                         Yes.

               EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DUSK

               With the STAR MAN SINGING IN HIS LANGUAGE, the Camaro moves 
               further into Death Valley. The SONG FADES and we:

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               The Camaro blows by a gas station, closed for the night.

               INT. CAMARO - NIGHT

               The STAR MAN shifts restlessly in his seat as he searches 
               the ghostly landscape for something familiar. He activates 
               the satel compass. The red and green dots are touching.

                                     JENNY
                         How long will it take you to get 
                         home?

                                     STAR MAN
                              (absently)
                         Many, many days and nights...

               He presses the satel compass into his palms.

                                     JENNY
                         Would you like to listen to some 
                         music?

               The STAR MAN shakes his head "no."

                                     JENNY
                         I'm sure we could find a country and 
                         western station.

                                     STAR MAN
                         No, thank you.

               Jenny takes his hand in hers.

                                     JENNY
                         Don't worry. Everything's going to 
                         be fine.

               The STAR MAN smiles wanly at her.

                                     JENNY
                              (leans forward to 
                              look up at night sky)
                         Which star is yours?

               It only takes the STAR MAN an instant to find his home.

                                     STAR MAN
                         There.

                                     JENNY
                         Where?

               He directs Jenny's attention to the constellation Auriga.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (meaning the star 
                              Capella)
                         The yellow one.

                                     JENNY
                         Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When 
                         the baby is born, we'll go out in my 
                         back yard and wave to you.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (smiles)
                         I will wave to you.

               All we can HEAR are the TIRES HUMMING over the road. The 
               Camaro rounds the side of a low hill.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Oh, shit!

               Jenny slams on the brakes. One of the Cobra helicopters, lit 
               from the inside, is parked next to a line of flares across 
               the road ahead.

               EXT. CLOSED GAS STATION - NIGHT

               The STAR MAN is looking through a window at the repair bay, 
               lit by a work light. Jenny is standing in a phone shell on 
               the front of the garage, the receiver to her ear.

               The STAR MAN moves to the office door. He tries the knob. It 
               is locked.

                                     JENNY
                              (to the STAR MAN)
                         They're trying to get him.

               Suddenly the STAR MAN slams his shoulder against the door. 
               It swings open.

                                     JENNY
                         What are you doing?!!

               Fox's voice comes out of the receiver in her hand.

                                     FOX (V.O.)
                         Mrs. Haydn...

                              headset)
                         This is George Fox...

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         I want to speak to Marc Shermin.

                                     FOX
                         You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm 
                         in charge of this operation now.

               EXT. CLOSED STATION - NIGHT

                                     JENNY
                         If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm 
                         hanging up.

                                     FOX (V.O.)
                              (a beat)
                         Okay...

               Tethered by the phone cord, Jenny tries to see what the STAR 
               MAN is doing inside the repair bay.

               INT. REPAIR BAY - NIGHT

               Using an air filter top as a basket, the STAR MAN scavenges 
               from the work bench and the car up on the lift, fuses, lengths 
               of wire, circuit boards from a radio, tubing, metal pipe and 
               a Black and Decker drill. While he is doing this we get 
               glimpses of Jenny pleading his case on the phone. Finally, 
               leaving the receiver dangling at the end of its cord, she 
               comes around to stand in the doorway.

                                     JENNY
                         Mr. Shermin wants to speak to you.

                         Here he is.

               Shermin looks warily at the headset. When the STAR MAN doesn't 
               speak immediately, he takes the initiative.

                                     SHERMIN
                         Hello...

                                     STAR MAN (V.O.)
                         I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.

                                     SHERMIN
                         We can't let you do that.

                                     STAR MAN (V.O.)
                         I don't want to hurt anybody. I just 
                         want to go home.

               INT. COBRA - NIGHT

               Fox is listening to the conversation.

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)
                         All the roads into Death Valley are 
                         blocked. We'd like to talk to you.

                                     STAR MAN (V.O.)
                         If I talk to you, I will miss my 
                         ship.

                                     SHERMIN (V.O.)

                         chance, George.

                                     FOX
                         No deal.

                         I'm afraid we can't let you go.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I understand.

               He hangs up.

               INT. REPAIR BAY - NIGHT

               The STAR MAN shaves the rubber off the electrical lines 
               leading into the fuse box and clips two wires of his own 
               onto the exposed copper. With Jenny watching we have a montage 
               of the STAR MAN working through the night: modifying the 
               insides of the Black and Decker drill, cutting out the mid-
               section above the trigger, fitting electrical components 
               into that area, screwing a pipe into the bit-clamp, welding 
               it together with the spark that arcs between the electrical 
               wires.

               INT. OFFICE (GAS STATION) - NIGHT

               Jenny folds a sheaf of money into a sheet of yellow paper 
               and props it on the cash register. 'For Damages. Thank You' 
               is scribbled on the front. She runs out to catch the STAR 
               MAN who is on his way to the Camaro.

               EXT. CAMARO - NIGHT

               Carrying the modified Black and Decker drill the STAR MAN 
               opens the driver's door.

                                     JENNY
                         Where do you think you're going?

                                     STAR MAN
                         Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. 
                         I must go alone now.

                                     JENNY
                         I said I would get you to your ship 
                         and that's where we're going to say 
                         goodbye.

               INT. CAMARO - NIGHT

               Both hands on the wheel, Jenny is burning down the center 
               line. The STAR MAN bends two thin wires trailing out from 
               the grip of the drill. Jenny winces as he buries them into 
               the flesh on either side of his left wrist. The car skates 
               around the corner of a low hill. They can see that the Cobra 
               is still sitting next to the road.

                                     JENNY
                              (glancing at the 
                              modified drill)
                         I hope that works.

               The STAR MAN is lost in concentration.

               Jenny kills her lights and glues the accelerator to the floor. 
               Three MEN scramble from the helicopter with M16s. A BURST OF 
               SLUGS RIPS THROUGH the Camaro's WINDSHIELD. The STAR MAN 
               leans out the passenger window and with an other-worldly 
               scream, fires. The helicopter is BLOWN TO SMITHEREENS. The 
               concussion throws the men to the ground.

               EXT. BURNING HELICOPTER - NIGHT

               The Camaro whizzes through the falling DEBRIS.

               INT. CAMARO - NIGHT

                                     JENNY
                         It works.

               The STAR MAN slumps in exhaustion and pain.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I do not know how many times I can 
                         do this.

               INT. SHERMIN'S HELICOPTER - NIGHT

               It is filled with the radio voices of the Cobra crews setting 
               up to attack the Camaro.

               EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               The Camaro becomes airborne at the crest of a dip. Only its 
               new shocks save the landing.

               INT. CAMARO - NIGHT

               The STAR MAN draws the satel compass out between his palms. 
               The green dot now covers the right half of the red dot. He 
               presses his palms together and looks past Jenny at the rugged 
               foothills.

               The first light of day is starting to color the sky behind 
               them. Jenny and the STAR MAN are startled by the DRUMMING 
               WHOMP OF A HELICOPTER. The STAR MAN looks out the window for 
               its source. He can't see anything. The SOUND FADES. In a 
               moment, it is REPEATED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CAR and AGAIN 
               IT FADES.

                                     STAR MAN
                         If my ship is not here, we are in 
                         trouble.

               This is a truism that Jenny doesn't want to hear and she 
               flexes her fingers on the wheel.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (points at a 
                              distinctive cone 
                              peak)
                         That's where we landed last time. 
                         Right under that mountain.

               Jenny and the STAR MAN steady themselves for the last leg of 
               their journey. Suddenly, their silence is exploded by a COBRA 
               dropping out of the sky in front of them. Its searchlight 
               bangs into their faces and, with its thirty-calibre MACHINE 
               GUNS BLAZING, it comes straight at them.

               Jenny yanks the Camaro onto the shoulder. The SLUGS CHEW UP 
               the asphalt beside it. She fishtails back onto the road. A 
               SECOND COBRA surprises them from the STAR MAN's side. Its 
               MACHINE GUN KNOCKS OUT the BACK WINDOW before he can FIRE.

               The STAR MAN crawls over his seat and arranges himself in 
               the hole that was the back window to meet the Cobras' next 
               FIRING RUN. It doesn't take them long. The first two have 
               been joined by a THIRD. They swoop down on the Camaro.

               INT. LEAD HELICOPTER - NIGHT

               The gunsights lock on the car below. The CO-PILOT squeezes 
               the trigger.

               EXT. CAMARO - NIGHT

               SHOTS THUMP INTO the trunk in front of the STAR MAN and he 
               FIRES. The lead HELICOPTER ERUPTS, raining pieces of hot 
               metal over the desert floor. The other helicopters are jarred 
               out of their run and their BULLETS harmlessly KICK UP SAND 
               on the shoulder. Before they can regroup, the STAR MAN BLOWS 
               THEM OUT OF THE SKY.

                                     JENNY
                         In front!!! In front!!!

               The STAR MAN has to hang on as Jenny dodges the car out of 
               the path of a Cobra skimming over the highway toward them. 
               As it goes over, he is able to get off a SHOT directly INTO 
               its UNDERBELLY. The BALL OF FLAME almost engulfs the Camaro.

               INT. CAMARO - NIGHT

               The STAR MAN slumps down into the back seat breathing hard. 
               Jenny looks over her shoulder at him and is shocked at the 
               strain that shows on his face.

                                     JENNY
                         Hang on.

               She throws the car into a skid and leaves the blacktop for a 
               dirt road winding between two low hills.

               EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

               At the base of a sandstone cliff, the Camaro slides to a 
               stop. Jenny helps the STAR MAN out. She supports him as they 
               struggle toward the protection of the boulders. Fox's Cobra 
               roars over the hill.

               INT. COBRA - NIGHT

                                     FOX
                              (spots the car)
                         Over there.

               EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

               The STAR MAN turns toward the Cobra. Weakly, he raises his 
               weapon and pulls the trigger. Nothing happens. The searchlight 
               from the Cobra finds them. Its machine guns begin to raise 
               puffs of gravel around them. Jenny grabs the STAR MAN's arm 
               and pulls him into the relative safety of the rocks. The 
               STAR MAN collapses against the cool stone.

                                     STAR MAN
                              (gasps)
                         I can't shoot anymore.

               Jenny looks out between the crags. Shermin's helicopter 
               arrives to join the Cobra. With their searchlights flicking 
               over the sagebrush, they move cautiously toward the cliff. 
               Jenny turns back to the STAR MAN. He is too weak to run 
               anymore.

                                     JENNY
                              (touches his shoulder 
                              lightly)
                         I won't let anyone hurt you.

                         Watch it. They're coming out.

               INT. SHERMIN'S HELICOPTER - NIGHT

               Six images (close-up to full shot) of Jenny and the STAR MAN 
               stepping out of their hiding place fill the television screens 
               in front of Shermin.

                                     FOX (V.O.)
                         End it, Shermin.

               Lyman taps his keyboard. The screens all change to a long-
               shot of Jenny and the STAR MAN with cross-hairs superimposed 
               on them.

               EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

               Shermin's helicopter moves toward Jenny and the STAR MAN 
               standing helpless in the circle thrown by the searchlight.

               INT. SHERMIN'S HELICOPTER - NIGHT

               The cross-hairs have locked on Jenny and the STAR MAN. Shermin 
               knows he can't do it. He picks up a headset.

                                     SHERMIN
                         George... Do you hear me, George?

                         What?

                                     SHERMIN
                         I just retired.

                                     FOX (V.O.)
                         Shermin!! Shermin!!!

               Shermin flips a switch on the console that cuts Fox off.

                                     SHERMIN
                              (to his crew)
                         Let's get out of here.

               EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

               Shermin's helicopter passes over the heads of Jenny and the 
               STAR MAN and rises into the dawn sky.

               INT. COBRA - NIGHT

                                     FOX
                         Shermin!!!

               He throws down his headset.

                                     FOX
                              (to the pilot)
                         Lock in.

               The gunsights lock in on Jenny and the STAR MAN. Fox's grip 
               tightens on the trigger. Suddenly the helicopter begins to 
               vibrate and drift off its target. Fox looks toward the sound 
               coming from his right and his eyes widen in fear as he sees 
               the STAR MAN's ship looming over him.

               EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

               The spacecraft passes over the top of the helicopter. The 
               whirling downdraft emanating from the spaceship's underbelly 
               yanks the Cobra away from Jenny and the STAR MAN and whips 
               it into a spin which gets faster and faster until it 
               disintegrates and falls to the desert floor.

               EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

               Jenny and the STAR MAN shield their faces against the DUST 
               STORM that billows under the WHINING DESCENT of the 
               spacecraft. It settles into a landing across the dirt road 
               resting on its three pods. With a crack, a cone of bright 
               white light blasts from the underside.

                                     JENNY
                         Well...

                                     STAR MAN
                         I must go.

               Jenny nods.

                                     STAR MAN
                         What do I do now?

                                     JENNY
                         You say you love me and kiss me 
                         'goodbye.'

               The STAR MAN puts his arms around her and holds her tight.

                                     STAR MAN
                         I love you.

                                     JENNY
                              (her head on his 
                              shoulder)
                         I'm never going to see you again, am 
                         I?

                                     STAR MAN
                         No.

               He kisses the tears out of her eyes, then full on the mouth.

                                     JENNY
                         I love you.

               The STAR MAN steps back and places a hand on Jenny's stomach.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Tell the baby about me.

                                     JENNY
                         I will.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Goodbye.

               He turns from her and walks to his ship. Jenny watches him 
               go, then remembers something.

                                     JENNY
                         Wait!!

               She gets the Webster's Dictionary and the Columbia History 
               of the World from the Camaro and runs to the STAR MAN. He 
               takes them and kisses her again.

                                     STAR MAN
                         Thank you, Jennyhaydn.

               Jenny backs away as the STAR MAN walks under the ship into 
               the white light. He waves one last time to Jenny and is 
               swallowed into the ship by the light.

               EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

               Jenny turns away from the stinging sand as the space-craft 
               lifts off. When she looks again, it is high and moving over 
               the foothills. A banking turn brings it back. The ship dips 
               low over her, rocks itself in a gesture of farewell, then 
               shoots off into the stars. When she can no longer see it, 
               Jenny drops her wave with a sigh and starts back toward the 
               Camaro.

               Over her walk, we SUPER:

               FADE IN:
          1    EXT.   ROADSIDE DINER - EARLY MORNING
          
               A strip of two-lane highway runs through a tall pine forest. There
               is a truck-stop coffee shop beside the roadway. A few 14-WHEELERS
               are scattered across the big dusty parking lot. Morning sunlight
               glints off their chrome stacks. It bakes the asphalt and warms the
               mangy hides of stray DOGS asleep in the dirt. A HELICOPTER hovers
               about the treetops like a lazy hummingbird. It's the beginning of a
               perfect day.
          
               A highway PATROL CAR slowly trolls among the trucks and dogs and
               parks beside the slat and shingled building.
          
               TWO TELEPHONE LINEMEN are scaling a power pole at the forest's edge.
          
          2    POWER POLE - ANGLE ON TELEPHONE LINEMEN
          
               High on the pole, the linemen lean back against their safety straps
               to work, their bodies forming a "Y." One of them suddenly turns,
               pointing at a nearby treetop.
          
                                              FIRST LINEMAN
                                   Lookee there!
          
               He grabs a PORCELAIN INSULATOR from his belt, cocks his arm and
               hurls it across the open stretch. It lands smack in the middle of
               the tree. SQUAWK! A rattle of leaves, a rustle of feathers and a
               HUGE BUZZARD comes flapping out. The lineman cackles over his
               marksmanship.
          
          3    CLOSE ANGLE ON BUZZARD - MOVING SHOT
          
               The big, frightened beady-eyed bird is lumbering through the sky,
               flapping for its life and suddenly...SPLAT! It crashes head-on into
          3A   the bubble of the passing HELICOPTER.
          
          4    INT.   HELICOPTER
          
               The ship rocks as the PILOT wrestles the controls. There are THREE
               OTHERS in the cabin. The man beside the pilot, ELI CROSS, is
               sketching in a manuscript and eating an apple. He glances up in
               irritation.
          
                                              ELI
                                   Hey, will you stop wiggling?!

                                  Don't yell at me...yell at the
                                  goddamn crazy bird! It tried to
                                  kill us!
          
                                             ELI
                                     (back to his manuscript)
                                  Oh yeah, that's your story. What's
                                  the bird got to say about it?
          
              Eli bites into his apple, grimacing at the mushy mouthful    He tosses
              it out the hatch.
          
          5   EXT.   FOREST - TREETOPS
          
              The apple drops into the trees, bounces down from branch to branch
              and falls on the slanted roof of the ROADSIDE DINER beneath. It
              rolls down the eaves, off the edge and lands on top of the parked
              Highway Patrol car.

                                  Something hit the roof.
          
                                             SECOND POLICEMAN
                                  So will the Chief...if we don't grab
                                  this guy Cameron.
          
              They climb out as we see a SECOND PATROL CAR sliding up behind them.
              MORE POLICEMEN emerge from the second car.
          
          7   EXT.   DINER - ON POLICEMEN
          
              They huddle, then move toward the diner entrance.     As they pass an
              open WINDOW the CAMERA HOLDS.
          
              INT.   DINER

              A FRY COOK serves behind the long counter where MEN on stools eat
              watching the overhead TV. There is a PINBALL MACHINE in action.
              The policemen are seen ENTERING b.g. A TRUCK DRIVER ambles up and
              straddles a stool.
          
                                             TRUCK DRIVER
                                  Gettin' hot early. It's gonna be a
                                  scorcher.
          
              The fry cook fills the driver's empty water glass from a pitcher,
              then move down the counter.
          
                                               -3-
          
          
          9    ANGLE ON CAMERON
          
               He sits a few stools away. He's about 25, even-featured, bone-
               weary. His appealing face needs a shave. The cook fills his water
               glass. The ice cubes rattle as Cameron's hand trembles. His eyes
               are riveted on the policemen.
          
          10   CAMERON'S POV
          
               Two policemen take seats at a booth across from the counter; one
               policeman moves to a WALL TELEPHONE, another stands near the CASH
               REGISTER looking at a magazine. They seem nonchalant, but are
               placed to block all avenues of escape.
          
          11   ANGLE ON CAMERON
          
               Suddenly startled as someone slaps him on the arm.       He whirls to
               face the man beside him.
          
                                             MAN
                                  That's really a beaut...really a
                                  beaut!
          
               The MAN is staring at the TATOO which shows below the rolled-up
               sleeve of Cameron's shirt, a large American Eagle with elaborate
               scrollwork and a patriotic slogan. The man pulls up his own sleeve
               to show a small tatoo of an anchor.
          
                                             MAN (CONT'D)
                                  My wife still yells about this...but
                                  yours -- that's some eagle...like a
                                  billboard.
          
                                             CAMERON
                                      (eyes on police)
                                  Yeah, that's the grand old bird.
                                     (a half-smile)
                                  Right now I just wish the son-of-a-
                                  bitch could fly.
          
               Cameron rises and moves across the diner to the pinball machine.
          
          12   ANGLE ON PINBALL
          
               The PLAYER wiggles and contorts, using body English to influence the
               balls.
          
                                               -4-
          
          
          
                                           HECKLER
                                Hey Morton, you think your ass is
                                connected to the machine? You
                                wiggle, it's gonna make the ball go
                                where you want?
          
          12A   Cameron's eyes scan the room, passing the TV above the counter. On
                it, the commercial shows a beautiful girl (who we'll later know as
                NINA FRANKLIN) bending over a bowl of dog food. Her ass, too,
          12B   wiggles engagingly. The pinball player leaves the machine.
                Cameron, stalling for time, works the plunger while a cop stalks
                closer; like the cat to the mouse hole.
          
                                           POLICEMAN
                                Hey, you're lucky. Somebody left a
                                free ball.
          
                                            CAMERON
                                Uh huh.
          
                Cameron shoots. The ball bounces crazily inside the machine, lights
                and buzzers flashing. Another policeman approaches.
          
                                           SECOND POLICEMAN
                                You got 20,000! You're gonna win...
          
                                            CAMERON
                                Win what?
          
                                           SECOND POLICEMAN
                                A free game!
          
                                           CAMERON
                                Terrific...
          
                He rests his hands on the machine, glancing about.    Escape seems
                hopeless.
          
                                           CAMERON (CONT'D)
                                ...that's just what I needed...one
                                more chance to lose.
          
                In a lightning-swift motion, the cop clamps his hands down over
                Cameron's wrists, snapping the HANDCUFFS on. The trap has sprung.
          13    CLOSE ON COP AND CAMERON
          
                Cameron nods his head in resignation. A big uncontrollable grin
                breaks and spreads over the cop's face.
          
                                              -5-
          
          
               Then suddenly, Cameron bolts, desperately springing full speed for
               the back door. He flings it open. The cops are moving toward him.
               One has almost got his gun out.
          
                                            POLICEMAN
                                Cameron!   Halt! I'll shoot!
          
               Cameron lunges through the doorway, not realizing in his frenzy the
               screen door still blocks his path. He tears through it, but gets
               stuck halfway.
          
                                           CAMERON
                                   (panicked)
                                No!...God, don't shoot!
          
               Swinging his manacled arms like a club against the tangled mesh, he
               breaks free and runs.
          
          14   EXT.   REAR OF DINER
          
               As Cameron flies down the back steps, a COP stationed at the rear
               door, caught off-guard, tries to stop him but is shoved flat on his
               back. Cameron weaves and scrambles across the yard, over fences,
               between the shed and the barn, rolling beneath a building, out the
               other side. Behind him, distant shouts and a gunshot.
          
          15   INT.   FOREST - MOVING SHOT ON CAMERON - DAY
          
               As Cameron runs, he moves with a skill that suggests forests are not
               alien to him. He crouches low, following tiny avenues in the maze
               of tree trunks, scrambling on all fours over needles and fallen
               cones. Sweat pours down his face. His breath rasps in his throat.
               He breaks into a clearing and FREEZES...suddenly face to face with a
               MAN who crouches, blocking his path. It is one of the telephone
               linemen we saw earlier.
          
          16   WIDER ANGLE
          
               The lineman, kneeling at his tool chest, is surprised by Cameron.
               The other lineman is halfway up the power pole. They both stare at
               Cameron's handcuffs. Cameron edges back, his escape route blocked.
               The man on the ground grabs a WRENCH and moves forward with the same
               gleam in his eye we saw when he scared that bird from the tree.
          
                                           LINEMAN
                                Stand right there like a good old
                                boy and do what I say. You wanna
                                try and mess with me, you've had
                                fair warning. I was a combat Marine
                                in Korea. Okay?
          
                                                 -6-
          
          
               The lineman advances on him as Cameron backs away.
          
                                             CAMERON
                                  Korea? No shit, so was my old
                                  man...
                                     (he suddenly stamps his
                                      foot and shrieks)
                                  Aaaaaaaargh!
          
               The lineman jumps in surprise. Then, enraged like a startled bull,
               he lunges forward with the wrench. Cameron uses the man's weight
               against him, his moves those of a trained fighter. A hard knee to
               his stomach doubles up the lineman. The handcuffed arms slam down
               like a club between his shoulder blades driving him to the ground.
               A kick thrown sideways to his head and the man is out. The other
               lineman who had started to descend the pole freezes and takes one
               step back up. Cameron grabs the lineman's toolbox in his handcuffed
               grasp and dashes off into the forest.
          
          17   MOVING SHOT - ON CAMERON
          
               He slides down a slope on a carpet of fallen leaves, tumbling to the
               bottom and falls face forward into a running stream where he holds
               his head and drinks. CAMERA MOVES ACROSS the terrain. There are no
               pursuers, the forest is silent.
          
          18   CLOSE UP - HANDCUFFS
          
               The jaws of a wire-cutter clamp down severing the chain connecting
               the cuffs around Cameron's wrists. He lifts his knee from the
               cutter handle. His arms are now free. He wedges a chisel against
               one bracelet and swings a sledgehammer against it. We hear his
               sharp outcry.
          
          19   ANGLE ON CAMERON
          
               Doubled up, holding his wrist in pain. The bracelet is still
               intact. He buttons his shirt cuffs over the metal bands and climbs
               the slope to the bright sunlight on the road above.
          20   EXT.   OLD ABANDONED ROAD - DAY
          
               Cameron is trudging along the old road winding down through the
               mountainous pass. He crosses a bridge. Through the arches of its
               low stone railing, he sees a BLACK RIVER twenty feet below rushing
               toward the sea. Then, glancing back, he is suddenly alert.
          
                                                 -7-
          
          21   CAMERON'S POV
          
               In the far distance, almost lost in the shimmering heat waves from
               the road, is a tiny speck moving toward him.
          
          22   ANGLE ON CAMERON
          
               He clambers down the embankment behind the railing, peering out from
               this hidden vantage.
          
          23   ANGLE ON ROAD
          
               The speck grows larger. The SOUND of the engine is faintly audible
               now. Sunlight flashes from metal and glass. Cameron's apprehension
               suddenly changes to wonderment, for the vehicle is not the police as
               he had feared, but something else. Moving in the shimmering heat
               wave is a splendid, high, humpbacked World War I vintage DUESENBERG
               SEDAN with gleaming brass headlights, roaring towards him.
          24   ANGLE ON CAMERON
          
               He scrambles up the embankment to thumb a ride. The Duesenberg
               roars past him, filling his eyes and mouth with dust. Suddenly
               there is a screech of brakes.
          
          25   ANGLE ON CAR
          
               The Duesenberg goes into a skid and then bounces to a stop.
               Running, Cameron reaches the car, pulls the front door open and
               climbs in beside the DRIVER.
          26   INT.   CAR
          
                                               CAMERON
                                  Thanks.    I thought you didn't see
                                  me.
          
               The driver, BURT, is a husky, red-haired man about Cameron's age and
               deeply agitated. Pounding his fist against the steering wheel, he
               talks half to Cameron, half to himself.
          
                                               BURT
                                  Damn it.    Screwed it up.   Lost my
                                  nerve.
          
               Fishing a Vick's inhaler from his pocket and shoving it in his
               nostril.
          
                                                -8-
          
          
                                           BURT (CONT'D)
                                Goddamn sinuses. Can't even see
                                straight.
          
               Cameron looks at him, puzzled.
          
                                           CAMERON
                                You want me to drive?
          
               Burt whirls on him, enraged.
          
                                           BURT
                                What the hell is that supposed to
                                mean?!
          
                                           CAMERON
                                   (confused)
                                No offense...thought you might...
          
                                           BURT
                                Every one of you jerks is a goddamn
                                hotshot expert! Thanks for the vote
                                of confidence. If you think you can
                                do any better, just come and try it!
          
               He puts his boot in Cameron's stomach and shoves hard.
          
          27   EXT.   CAR
          
               Cameron comes flying out and lands on his back in the road as the
               Duesenberg squeals forward, its open door slamming shut from the
               momentum.
          
               Stunned, the wind knocked out of him, Cameron rises to his elbows.
               Before the old relic has gone thirty yards, again the brakes
               screech, swinging the car into a sliding salute turn, one hundred-
               eighty degrees and it is suddenly screaming back toward Cameron.
          28
               INT.   CAR - ANGLE ON BURT
          
               Driving with one hand on the door handle, his head halfway out the
               window watching the bridge railing and the water beyond.
          
                                             -9-
          
          29   ANGLE ON ROAD - CAR AND CAMERON
          
               Cameron, sprawled on the road, is momentarily paralyzed at the sight
               of the Duesenberg's great brass grill bearing down. His hand closes
               over a rock and with the same illogical gesture that a soldier
               flings a Coke bottle at a tank, Cameron hurls the rock in the
               direction of the car and frantically rolls sideways. The big
               spinning tires brush him as they pass. We catch a momentary glimpse
               of the rock smashing against the gleam of the passing windshield.
          
               As he stops rolling, once more face down in the dust, eyes closed,
               expecting death, he becomes aware there is only silence. He opens
               his eyes, climbs to his feet. The road is empty. The Duesenberg is
               gone. Astonished, confused -- he walks to the side of the bridge
               where the railing ends and the car might have plunged off. There is
               nothing below but the rushing black water. Here and there bubbles
               swirl to the surface. They could be from a sinking car or could be
               caused by the current.
          
          30   ANGLE ON CAMERON
          
               His thoughts racing. Was it the sun, has he imagined the whole
               thing? Suddenly a HELICOPTER appears, hovering, almost at eye
               level. Sunlight flashes through the spinning blades like a strobe.
          
          31   WIDER ANGLE
          
               It is the same helicopter we saw in the opening sequence. It has
               swiftly descended beside the bridge just beyond the railing,
               catching Cameron with no chance to run or hide. FOUR MEN Can be
               seen inside the plastic cockpit barely a few feet away. The man
               beside the PILOT is ELI CROSS. He grabs the radio microphone and
               begins speaking into it. Cameron whirls, scrambles down a bank to a
               field. The helicopter drops to within a few feet of the water,
               hovers. Protected from sight, Cameron runs between the tall stalks,
               away from the road.
          
          32   CAMERON - MOVING SHOT
          
               Glancing back through the stalks as he runs, Cameron sees a STAKE
               TRUCK barreling toward the sight of the accident. In the back,
               THREE MEN are frantically putting on black wet-suits. They look,
               from this distance, like little black toys tumbling against each
               other. Cameron runs on.
          
                                              - 10 -
          
          33    EXT.   BLUFF - OVERLOOKING SEASHORE TOWN
          
                A few hotels, like a cluster of old Victorian gingerbread, surround
                a sandy cove beyond which is the sea. There is a fishing pier,
                boardwalk, hot dog stands, pizza parlors, all swarming with
                sunbathing TOURISTS. The town's bucolic, turn-of-the-century charm
                might even survive these, if not for a monstrous yellow CONSTRUCTION
                CRANE, which juts ten stories into the sky from the center of the
                sandy cove. Cameron appears on the bluff.
          
          34    ANGLE ON CAMERON
          
                Surveying the town -- expressionless, a jungle beast going to
                survive no matter what -- at least for a few more hours. He reaches
                down and rips off his trouser legs at the thigh, turning them into
                cutoffs a vacationing bather might wear. He pulls off his worn
                boots and flings them into the brush, his eyes never leaving the
                town below. There are crowds to get lost in down there. He
                unbuttons his sleeve and looks at the handcuff still encircling his
                wrist. Stopping beside a large rock, he smashes the bracelet
                against it. It won't open. Grimacing in pain, he re-buttons the
                sleeve, opens his shirt and begins descending the palisades toward
                the town.
          35    EXT.   BOARDWALK
          
                The SCREEN is yellow and on it are the words: 'HAVE A NICE DAY.'
                THE ANGLE WIDENS and we realize the words are on the back of a
                YELLOW HAT that jiggles as its wearer walks. It is Cameron. Beyond
                him we see the tide of tourists in oils and ointments flirting with
                the sun. Teenage girls at portable toilets adjusting their bikinis.
                The boardwalk cops in white shirts, looking like ice cream vendors,
                whom Cameron deftly avoids. Then, he looks up at the sky,
                perplexed: the helicopter from the bridge is overhead, circling.
                Cameron watches it warily as he walks.
          
          35A   ANGLE ON BOARDWALK
          
                A BIG CROWD has formed at the railing of the pier. Many of the
                people with CAMERAS CLICKING at the sand below. Cameron notices the
                helicopter is now sharing the sky with a brightly painted open
                cockpit BIPLANE. It is a WORLD WAR I FIGHTER with BRITISH INSIGNIA.
          
          35B   ANGLE ON BOARDWALK AND SKY
          
                Cameron works his way through the crowd. All eyes now look upward
                at the plane. A LOUD VOICE is HEARD coming through an electric
                BULLHORN.
          
                                             - 11 -
          
          
                                           VOICE
                                All right, people. Quiet! We're
                                losing the sun! This is a take!
                                You're welcome to watch, but please,
                                no flashbulbs. They'll spoil the
                                shot.
          
               Cameron's world has become more ordered again. It's a film company
               shooting on location -- this somehow must explain the Duesenberg.
               His eyes go to the scene below.
          36   ANGLE ON COVE
          
               A CAMERA RIG suspended from the end of the yellow construction crane
               is PHOTOGRAPHING the surf where EXTRAS in German WWI uniforms
               unload ashore. The bright little plane has started a lazy dive
               toward the soldiers, its engine whining. From here it looks as
               fearsome as Snoopy and the Red Baron.
          
          37   ANGLE ON THE BEACH
          
               As the British plane pulls out of the dive, there is a tremendous
               explosion. In the flash of smoke and flame, barge, rowboats,
               ammunition and people are blown sky-high. The smoke from the
               exploding ammunition momentarily obscures the scene.
          38   ANGLE ON CROWD
          
               The onlookers are very impressed and pleased and then abruptly their
               pleasure turns to horror and disbelief.
          39   ANGLE ON COVE
          
               As the smoke lifts, the Tom and Jerry violence has become a
               horrifying reality. Bodies are scattered about. One man has been
               severed in half, drenched in blood. Chunks of meat, arms and legs
               litter the beach.
          40   ANGLE ON CROWD
          
               Paralyzed by the sense of catastrophe.
          
                                           MAN
                                   (shouting)
                                Something went wrong.
          
               Then, people begin to moan and scream.
          
                                                 - 12 -
          
          41    CLOSE ON CAMERON
          
                Staring tensely at the carnage.      By reflex, a shout escapes his
                lips.
          
                                               CAMERON
                                   Medic!   Get the medics!
          41A   A WOMAN sags into a faint.      A small child in the crowd is crying and
                clutching Cameron's leg.
          
          42    ANGLE ON COVE
          
                As the scene continues we hear a voice on the Bullhorn.
          
                                               VOICE (O.S.)
                                   Cut!   I said CUT! That's a print.
          
                Suddenly the reality of the horror turns into an obscene, absurd
                farce as what appear to be the missing parts of bodies begin
                wriggling out of the sand where the extras were partially buried to
                create the macabre effect and now the extras become whole human
                beings before our eyes once again.
          
          43    ANOTHER ANGLE
          
                The crowd reacts in various ways. Sighs of relief, laughter, anger.
                The exhumed extras wipe sand from their eyes and shake it down their
                trouser legs.
          
                                              A.D.
                                      (yelling)
                                   Beautiful, Harvey. You gave
                                   everybody a heart attack.
          
                HARVEY, the Second Unit Director, yells back.
          
                                              HARVEY
                                   Eli will hate it. He said he wanted
                                   the shot in one? Now watch, he'll
                                   do six hours of pick-ups.
          
                The crowd disperses.      A TOURIST turns to Cameron.
          
                                              TOURIST
                                   Great...but why do they always use
                                   so much blood? It ruins the
                                   realism, don't you think?
          
                                              - 13 -
          
          
                                          CAMERON
                                  (still shaken, quietly

                               ...asshole...
          
               The tourist stiffens as Cameron turns away, his attention now drawn
               by the beating sound of the helicopter. He glances up.
          44   CAMERON'S POV
          
               The helicopter is descending toward the beach while the FILM CREW
               rapidly moves equipment from the last scene into piles to clear a
               landing site.
          
          45   ANGLE ON FISHING PIER
          
               Wary of the men in the chopper, Cameron is moving down the pier away
               from the landing site. Suddenly he stops short, caught by something
               he sees O.S. Excitedly he points and begins to shout.
          
                                            CAMERON
                               Hey!    Hey you...!
          46   CAMERON'S POV
          
               Below him, walking away on the sand is one of the actors with the
               same red hair, the same old British army jacket as Burt -- the man
               in the Duesenberg. Hearing the shout, the actor stops and
               tentatively turns. It's a mistake. Clearly the features are
               different. It's not Burt.
          47   ANGLE TO INCLUDE CAMERON
          
               Cameron is puzzled. He watches as the red-haired actor looks about
               to see who called and finding no one, starts off, but is stopped by
               a LITTLE OLD LADY holding a parasol and offering her autograph book.
          
                                          LITTLE OLD LADY
                               Mr. Bailey! Aren't you Raymond
                               Bailey, the actor? Would you please
                               sign your autograph? Write 'to
                               Emily...for eternal peace.'
          
               Raymond signs the book with the easy charm of a man who's done it a
               million times. He has those special rugged good looks that belong
               to Marlboro men and movie stars.

                               I'm certainly glad you're all right.
                               I lost my husband and my son in the
                               wars...
          
               The sound of the chopper blades has become deafening as it hovers
               for a landing. The Old Lady snatches her autograph book and heads
               for the landing site.

               As it touches the ground and its doors fly open. Out step the
               CREWMEN and ELI CROSS. The ASSISTANT DIRECTOR rushes up and shouts
               over the hissing blades of the idling chopper.

                                happened?
          
               Their words are lost in the sound of the rotor as the chopper slowly
               rises. The sudden WIND from its blades blows some screening off a
               pile of equipment. It falls on the Little Old Lady who has been
               approaching Eli and topples her into the surf. She is trapped in a
               tangle of ancient skirts and petticoats. Before she can regain her
               balance, a wave tumbles her further into the sea.
          
          49   ANGLE INCLUDING CAMERON
          
               Cameron, sitting on the edge of the pier over the water, has watched
               this mini-disaster. The undertow from the wave has swept the Old
               Lady directly beneath him. Reaching down toward her, he yells:
          
                                            CAMERON
                                Hey!   Hey, give me your hand!
          
               He can't quite reach her. As a last resort, he drops off the edge
               into the water by her side.
          50   ANGLE ON WATER
          
               He grabs for the struggling Old Lady.
          
                                           CAMERON

                                okay.
          
               Like groping through seaweed, he reaches past her tangled skirts,
               grasps her waist and lifts her to keep her head above water. She is
               choking, gasping for air. She turns her face toward him.
          
          51   CAMERON'S POV
          
               Her features are distorted; they seem to be melting away. She frees
               her hand and violently tears at her face, pulling away the RUBBER
               MASK on which is the melting putty and make up. With it goes her
               wig and what is left is a startlingly beautiful young girl.

                          ...Franklin.
          
          The sun glistens on the wet, wild young perfection of her face,
          ingenuously sparkling laughter and for an instant it's breathtaking
          - a universal boyhood fantasy to suddenly be thrown this close to
          that kind of "movie star" beauty. It's something Cameron feels in
          the pit of his stomach.

          As they are only in a few feet of water, there is no longer any
          reason to hold her. He starts to put her down.
          
                                     NINA

               Eli, surrounded by the crew and dozens of tourists, is standing at
               the water's edge as Cameron wades in and sets Nina down.

               At the sight of Eli, she becomes like a little girl who, having
               skinned her knee and run to daddy, now can allow herself to cry.

                                wanted you to see the makeup, Eli.
                                Where were you?...I even got

               Nina is surrounded by people who are rubbing her with towels, taking
               pictures, all shouting at once. The CROWD closes in, excluding
               Cameron to the outskirts.

               THREE CREWMEN hustle her off, as she searches the crowd for
               Cameron...then spots him.

               from the helicopter.

                          You guys really used to call them
                          gooks? I thought that was just Time
                          Magazine.

                               That was 'Nam. What should I call
                               'em, WOPS? Nobody'd known what I
                               was talkin' about.
          
               He turns to follow Eli's gaze.
          
          54   CAMERON'S POV - POLICE CAR
          
               A POLICE CAR has driven onto the beach. From it, THREE OFFICERS
               have emerged. They are armed and efficient looking. The PRODUCTION
               MANAGER moves to greet them. Eli takes Cameron's wrist and gently
               pulls him back into the shadow of the pilings, (privately reacting
               to the handcuff he feels beneath the shirt). JAKE, the Chief, is
               irate enough to be clearly heard from this distance.
          
                                          JAKE
                               All right, this time you've had it!
                               Where is he?!
          
                                          PRODUCTION MANAGER
                               Chief, I'm glad you dropped by. Eli
                               says you gotta do something about
                               all these people on the beach.
          
                                          JAKE
                                  (bellowing)
                               Thirty minutes is what you've got to
                               get your goddamn equipment off this
                               beach and out of town!...You tell
                               Eli Cross if your men are on the
                               streets after four o'clock, I'll
                               throw their ass in jail!
          55   ANGLE ON ELI AND CAMERON
          
               Eli squats down on his heels and leans back against a piling,
               smiling up at Cameron.
          
                                          ELI
                               Speaking of jail...would you get
                               upset if I asked how many cops were
                               after you?
          
                                          CAMERON
                                  (suddenly grim)
                               What are ya talkin' about?

                                     ELI
                             (off-hand)
                          Your I.D. bracelet...the look on
                          your face...the way you ran from the
                          bridge...
                             (with exaggerated delicacy)
                          I...don't suppose you want to tell
                          me what you did.
          
          Cameron studies Eli, not knowing what to make of him.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          No...I don't.
          
                                     ELI
                             (brightly, with humor)
                          ...Could I try categories?
          
          Cameron half laughs despite himself.
          
                                     ELI (CONT'D)
                             (glancing O.S.)
                          Ever done any stunt work?
          
                                    CAMERON
                          What?
          
                                     ELI
                          How'd you like to be a stunt man?
                          You look like you're in pretty good
                          shape, fast on your feet. You could
                          do it.
                             (getting to his feet)
                          Besides, You're not gonna have much
                          choice.
          
          WIDER ANGLE
          
          Jake has spotted them and is approaching with his men and the
          Production Manager. Eli puts his hand on Cameron's shoulder and
          steps out into the sunlight.
          
                                     ELI
                             (softly, to Cameron)
                          Now, don't get hasty. And, remember
                          your ass, it's just like mine...
                          maybe I can save them both.

                                     PRODUCTION MANAGER
                             (trailing after Jake)
                          ...but we've gotta have three days
                          to finish this picture...
          
                                     JAKE
                             (striding toward Eli)
                          You said you'd be gone four days
                          ago, before the season started. You
                          lie, break promises...
                             (he is now close enough
                              and shouting at Eli)
                          Cross, I've gone out of my way, but
                          this time...
          
          A TRAM beeps, clangs and passes between them, interrupting Jake and
          leaving him sputtering. As it departs, Eli seizes the moment.
          
                                     ELI
                          Jake, it's been a rotten morning.
                          You're hot and tired. Let's go in,
                          have us a drink and find out what's
                          eating you.
          
                                     JAKE
                             (turning beet red)
                          Don't treat me like these other
                          morons! You know goddamn well
                          what's eating me is that Duesenberg
                          on the bottom of the river with the
                          dead man in it!
          
          There is silence. Eli stands thoughtfully kicking the sand with his
          toe. Then Jake starts shouting again.
          
                                     JAKE (CONT'D)
                          I mean, that is a goddamn public
                          bridge and a public river! You go
                          there without permits, without any
                          precautions and get a man killed!
          
                                    ELI
                             (gently)
                          Jake...
          
                                     JAKE
                          No more bullshit explanations. Just
                          go...before I figure out how to hang
                          you with a manslaughter charge!

                                       - 22 -
          
          
                             (after a pause; quietly)
                          No explanations...don't have any.
                          But, maybe he does...
                             (staring at Cameron)
                          Go ahead, ask him, Jake.
          
          Eli's words are exploding in Cameron's mind -- that illusory event
          on the bridge has crystallized into hard reality.
          
                                     CAMERON
                             (wide-eyed)
                          ...Now wait!...You're not blaming me
                          for...
          
                                     ELI
                             (wheeling on Cameron)
                          Why not, Burt?! Because you're a
                          fake?! Because you're just a
                          goddamn daredevil with a head full
                          of marbles?!
          
          Cameron vaguely understands that Eli is trying to pass him off as
          Burt and that he, somehow, may be saved by going along with this
          madness. Eli, turning to Jake, continues passionately...
          
                                     ELI (CONT'D)
                          He grabs the bread, blows the shot,
                          screws you up...screws me up. He's
                          dumb, Jake, but thank God, he ain't
                          dead yet. So do me a favor, put
                          your handcuffs on this son-of-a-
                          bitch and put him some place where
                          he can't get hurt!
          
          The Chief is dazed. If this is Burt, the stunt man, he is obviously
          alive. Jake goes to Cameron.
          
                                     JAKE
                          How did you get out of the car?
          
                                     ELI
                          He didn't get out. Our divers got
                          him out...and brought him back in
                          the chopper.
          
          The Chief stares at Cameron. His clothes and hair are wet. There
          is a small bruise on his cheek from when he fell out of the
          Duesenberg. He looks the part. Jake turns to Eli with resignation.
          
                                    JAKE
          
                                       - 23 -
          
          
                          Cross, when these three days are up,
                          I'm going to arm my men with
                          shotguns and tell them it's open
                          season on any fruit carrying a
                          camera.
          
          He walks to the waiting police car, surrounded by TOURISTS snapping
          pictures. He glares at them, angry at the world. Eli puts his arm
          on Cameron's shoulder and leads him through the dispersing crowd
          toward the hotel. Eli is now easygoing and friendly.
          
                                     ELI
                          You did that very well.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          I didn't get a chance to say a word.
                          I just listened.
          
                                     ELI
                          There are only a few actors in the
                          world who have mastered that art.
                          Anyway, it was a good audition. You
                          landed the part.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          How? What about the crew? They
                          going to look at me and say, 'Hi,
                          Burt?'
          
                                     ELI
                          Unless you prefer, 'Hi, Elizabeth.'
                          Don't worry about my crew, they'll
                          call you anything I want 'em to.
                          Look, I'm not being callous. Burt
                          is a fucking tragedy, but there's
                          nothing in the world I can do about
                          it...I've gotta have this location
                          for three more days...and you need a
                          place to hide.
          
          They have reached the steps of the HOTEL. A BUS has stopped in
          front. TOURISTS are piling out. The POLICE CAR pulls up and parks
          nearby. Jake and his men can be seen surveying the crowd.
          
                                     A.D.
                             (shouting in b.g.)
                          Eli! The crew's waiting.   We need
                          the next setup!

          Eli turns back to Cameron as they mount the steps.

                          By tomorrow the local cops'll know
                          what I look like. I can't hang
                          around.

                             (expansively)
                          "Burt," stop worrying! Haven't you
                          heard of "movie magic?"
                             (pointing to the etched
                              glass doors of the hotel)
                          That door is "the looking glass,"
                          and inside...is Wonderland. You're
                          gonna pose as a stunt man, who's
                          posing as an actor, who's posing as
                          a character in a movie...who's
                          posing as an enemy soldier...In that
                          big a crowd, who's gonna notice you?
                          People like to believe in things and
                          cops are just people.
          
          The have reached the front door.   Eli holds it open for Cameron.
          
                                     ELI
                             (with mock confidentiality)
                          Frankly, your problem's so simple,
                          it's almost beneath me. Have faith,
                          'Alice.' Close your eyes and enjoy.
          
          In exhaustion and resignation, Cameron nods and wearily closes his
          eyes.

                          It's wet.

                His eyes open. He stares at his face in the mirror, pleased at the
                subtle transformation. His hair has been cut shorter and dyed red,
                somehow changing his whole aspect. He rubs the red mark on his
                wrists where the bracelet has been removed.
          
          56A   WIDE ANGLE
          
                Part of the laundry room is being used for the film's Hairdressing
                Department. Cameron sits in a barber chair wearing a plastic apron,
                surrounded by dryers, wigs, etc. In b.g., washing machines churn
                constantly. DENISE, the Hairdresser, an attractive earthy woman of
                thirty-two, stands over him. He is still wary and trying not to
                show it.
          
                                            CAMERON
                                    (looking in mirror)
                                 ...Could be worse...could be
                                 green...I think I like it.
          
                                            DENISE
                                 Of course you like it...ask
                                 anybody... Denise gives great hair.
                                 Got any grass?

                                 Nope.
          
                She touches his hair to test the dryness, holding her hand there for
                a moment longer than seems necessary. He grins at her, rises and
                crosses to the wall mirror to get a better look.
          
                                            DENISE
                                 What else don't you have that I
                                 need?
          
                She moves to a basement window and gazes out.
          57    POV - BEACH
          
                Through the window, the crew is setting up a shot while Eli
                rehearses with Nina and his red-haired male star, RAYMOND BAILEY,
                (who Cameron earlier saw on the beach). Bailey is dressed as a
                World War I British aviator and Nina as a young girl of that era.
          
                                            DENISE'S VOICE
                                 Our male star isn't going to like
                                 you...

                             (moving toward window)
                          Why not?
          
                                     DENISE
                          You're too good looking. His idea
                          of a perfect stunt double is two-
                          hundreds pounds of hamburger in a
                          red wig...
          
          He studies the view, his attention focused on Nina.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          What's she like? I've seen her on
                          TV.
          
                                     DENISE
                             (irritated by his
                              interest in Nina)
                          At selling douche powder, she's
                          fabulous; dog food?...I'm not sure
                          she's sincere.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          What are you sore about?
          
                                     DENISE
                          I'm not sore. Isn't that what you
                          wanted to know?
                             (with sarcasm)
                          ...Or did you mean, what's the real
                          Nina Franklin like--without the
                          greasepaint and tinsel...
          
          Moving to a pile of laundry heaped on the floor, she pokes around
          with the toe of her shoe.
          
                                     DENISE (CONT'D)
                          ...You mean, what's she like --
                          underneath?
          
          Snaring a crumpled garment, she kicks it toward Cameron, who catches
          it instinctively, then holds it up for inspection -- a pair of
          (Nina's) lace panties. He grins, mildly embarrassed by the charade.

                                   What do those say about the girl who
                                   wears them? Shy? Delicate?
                                   Sensitive?
          
               She reaches for the panties, but instead takes his hand and yanks
               sharply, pulling him off balance, falling back on the laundry pile
               with Cameron on top of her, their faces inches apart; surprise on
               his, amusement on hers.

                                   Still wet...very wet.
          
               Cameron is trying to remember: what was it Eli said? "Close your
               eyes, relax and enjoy." Across the room the washing machines churn,
               whirl and heave.
          
          59   EXT.   BEACH AREA
          
               Eli and his crew are shooting a scene: a "pick-up" shot for the
               explosion sequence we saw earlier. Eli and GABE, the cameraman, are
               lying beside the camera. Before them, the "severed" arm protrudes
               from the sand in which its owner is buried, out of sight.
          
                                              ELI
                                   You sure he can breathe?
                                      (a mumbling assent from
                                       beneath the sand)
                                   Where's Raymond?
                                      (Raymond kneels beside
                                       him)
                                   Remember, you just crashed...you
                                   were wandering the beach behind the
                                   German lines looking for a place to
                                   hide when you saw the explosion.
                                   You're stunned by the carnage. That
                                   bomb was dropped by a guy in your
                                   squadron. Okay? Roll the film.
          60   POV THRU CAMERA
          
               Through the CAMERA, WE SEE the 'arm' protruding from the sand. We
               HEAR o.s. VOICES yelling: "Turning"... "speed"... "action." We see
               the fingers begin to move spasmodically. Eli's voice yells: "Okay,
               Raymond!"
          
               Suddenly the fingers on the hand start to swell, bigger and
               bigger...like a rubber glove filling with air...then BANG! BANG!
               BANG! The (balloon-covered) fingers EXPLODE.

          61   ANGLE ON BEACH
          
               Everyone has broken up with laughter at the prank, including Eli.
               Gabe is patting Eli's face, Raymond squeezing his jaw affectionately
               as one would a pet dog's.

                                Gotcha that time! Didn't we?
          
                                           ELI
                                   (through his laughter)
                                Yeah, you got me another half-hour
                                behind.
          
               Eli climbs to his feet as the laughter subsides. Cameron, now
               wearing a uniform exactly like Raymond's, watches from the
               sidelines.

                                more important than wrinkles...and
                                that makes us so scared and crazy,
                                we'll do anything. Go off

                                anything.
          
               There is great sadness among them.     Eli breaks the mood lightly.

               Cameron crosses to them. He and Raymond stand appraising each
               other, red-haired men in identical uniforms. As Raymond offers his

                                My new cock and balls?
          
                                           ELI
                                   (quickly)
                                Not new...It's important not to let
                                that get around as yet. So, for the
                                time being, let's make like he's the
                                same guy.
                                   (adding a touch of color)
                                But no longer known as "Bad-assed
                                Burt." Ever since his 'fortunate
                                rescue,'...we call him "Lucky."
          
          62   EXT.   CHURCHYARD - ANGLE ON CHUCK - LATER THAT DAY
          
               CHUCK BARTON is a tall, rugged-looking man in his mid-thirties, the
               Stunt Gaffer on Eli's film. A MESSENGER trots up and presents a
               receipt book. Chuck sets down his stunt bag and signs it absently.
          
                                           MESSENGER
                                Your film from that camera in the
                                Duesenberg's on the way to the lab.
                                Put it on the plane with my own
                                little hands.
          
                                          CHUCK

                          When do we get it back?
          
                                     MESSENGER
                          Don't know. Stamped it "rush."
          
                                     CHUCK
                          If I stamp "rush" on my mare's ass,
                          she'll still take eleven months to
                          foal. Call the lab and find out
                          when!
                             (quietly)
                          I lost a man today. I wanna see
                          that footage and find out why.
          
          As the Messenger leaves, Chuck strolls over to where Cameron stands
          waiting, circles around him, sizing him up. Cameron is no longer
          wearing the uniform, but now is in jeans and a work shirt.
          
                                     CHUCK
                          Done any stunt work?
          
                                     CAMERON
                          Not really.
          
                                     CHUCK
                          Not really?   You have or you
                          haven't?
          
                                     CAMERON
                             (good-naturedly)
                          I got out of Vietnam in one piece.
                          Let me tell you that wasn't a bad
                          stunt.
          
                                     CHUCK
                             (skeptically)
                          That's ancient history.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          Seems like yesterday.
          
                                     CHUCK
                             (pointing at church
                              steeple)
                          Could you jump from that tower to
                          the that roof?
          
                                              - 31 -
          
          63   ANGLE ON CAMERON (AND STEEPLE)
          
               Gauging the fifteen-foot gap between the CHURCH STEEPLE and the roof
               of the nearby MUNICIPAL BUILDING. He unconsciously grimaces at the
               four-story drop between them.
          
                                          CAMERON
                                  (being glib)
                               Once, to save my ass, I jumped out
                               of a banana tree into an oxcart full
                               of buffalo shit. Does that count?
          
                                            CHUCK
                               We'll see.    Put these on.
          
               He throws Cameron some knee pads from his stunt bag and begins
               marking off two lines on the bare earth between the gravestones in
               the churchyard.
          
                                          CAMERON
                                  (puzzled by the pads)
                               Where do they go?
          
                                          CHUCK
                                  (tapping his knee)
                               Under the pants.
                                  (pointing to lines he has
                                   drawn)
                               I want you to jump from here...to
                               there.
          
               Cameron hops up to the starting line, finishing with the knee pads
               clumsily, surveys the distance of not more than seven feet.
          
                                          CAMERON
                               Okie-dokie.
          
               Makes a casual jump, landing on the line and looking at Chuck for
               approval.
          
                                          CHUCK
                               Very good. Except you're dead!!
                               Your brains are scattered all over
                               the goddamn pavement. You landed on
                               the edge and fell backwards four
                               stories. Where do we send the body?
          
                                       - 32 -

                             (returns to the starting
                              line)
                          Don't bury me yet.
          
          He takes a running start and leaps hard.    While he's still in mid-
          air, Chuck yells.
          
                                     CHUCK
                          You're still dead! You fell over
                          the other side of the building.
          
          Cameron has landed three beyond the mark and looks up at Chuck a bit
          shaken.
          
                                     CHUCK (CONT'D)
                          You wanna try it right, once? You
                          should land in a tuck-and-roll.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          Show me, sergeant.
          
          Chuck launches himself head-first. His hands touch the ground just
          beyond the second mark to break his fall, easing him into a shoulder
          roll, he somersaults to his feet.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          Very fancy.
          
          He takes a running start and does the same.   Not quite as well, but
          well enough. As he rolls to his feet:
          
                                    CAMERON
                          Okay?
          
                                    CHUCK
                          Better.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          My speciality is Hopscotch.
          
          Chuck turns on him enraged, overreacting.
          
                                              - 33 -

                                And Burt's specialty was drowning.
                                You know one goddamn daredevil on
                                this picture was enough! What the
                                hell was Eli thinking, giving me a
                                smart-ass, cocky, amateur kid when I
                                need a stunt man! It's a little
                                different running across that roof
                                when they're pumping tracer bullets
                                over your head.
          
                                           CAMERON
                                   (eloquently pleading his
                                    case)
                                I was running for twenty-six months
                                with guys shooting at me...not over
                                my head...at my head and I'm alive.
                                I knew daredevils. I got nothing
                                against them...it's just they're all
                                dead. So ease off and give me a
                                chance...
          
               Cameron is surprised to see that Chuck is grinning.
          
                                           CAMERON (CONT'D)
                                   (genuinely)
                                Hey, were you putting me on?
          
                                            CHUCK
                                Me?   I wouldn't know how to do that.
          
               Chuck starts to walk away, then stops and looks at Cameron.
          64   EXT.   ROOFTOP MUNICIPAL BUILDING - CLOSE ON CHUCK - MINUTES LATER
          
                                           CHUCK
                                   (pained)
                                Can you imaging Eli doing a World
                                War I picture without horses? Do
                                you know the gags I could do with
                                four runaway horses pulling a
                                caisson?
          
               Cameron sailing into the SHOT. Chuck ducks slightly, catching
               Cameron on his back and flipping him into a somersault. Cameron
               lands on the sharply slanted slate roof of the municipal building.
               Chuck stands beside him straddling the peak. The church steeple can
               be seen in b.g. (and we now realize time has passed and we are no
               longer in the graveyard of the previous sequence, but atop the
               building).

                                   (climbing to his feet)
                                What's Eli got against horses?    I
                                love horses.
          
                                           CHUCK
                                Don't butter me up.
          
                Cameron goes running at Chuck and once again flies over his
                shoulder. Sprawling on the slippery slate, he looks up to see Chuck
                strolling down the hazardous incline like a mountain goat. Cameron
                scrambles to follow.
          
                                           CHUCK
                                   (as he walks)
                                We'll draw a sight line for you to
                                follow down the roof here, while
                                you're rolling. Now there's nothing
                                very difficult. But this is where
                                you gotta think. Your mind can't be
                                on snatch. It's gotta be on
                                grabbing that gutter.
          
                They have reached the lower edge of the roof.    Cameron looks down at
                the drop.

                Chuck has stopped and they peer down through a skylight to where the
                crew is setting up a shot in a room below.

               They move to another edge of the roof overlooking a NARROW CENTRAL
               COURTYARD. They gaze down at a WINDOW AWNING two stories below that
               juts from the side of the building-wing across the court.

                                When the pipe breaks loose, you fall
                                and hit that awning. Then Eli yells
                                "cut" and old Raymond takes your
                                place for the close-ups and the
                                glory. That's where the German
                                soldiers catch him and throw him in
                                the nuthouse. They're shootin' that

               Cameron's face is beginning to sweat and the veins are bulging from
               the growing strain of some physical effort.

               CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal Cameron dangling from a section of rain
               gutter, four stories above the ground.

          66   INT.   MUNICIPAL BUILDING - ASYLUM SET
          
               In a large vacant hall on the ground floor of the municipal
               building, a movie set has been erected representing the ward room in
               a World War I military asylum. In it, Eli's crew is filming a
               sequence -- a dozen enraged INMATES in tatters, heads shaven, wild-
               eyed, advance toward Raymond, shrieking (as though in echo of
               Cameron's exultant yell).
          
          67   CLOSER ANGLE
          
               Raymond, dressed as a British Flyer, his face bloodied, crouches and
               retreats in terror, a man caught in a nightmare, as these mutilated
               derelicts suddenly swarm over him. One, like a mad dog, goes fro
               his throat, another wields his own artificial limb as a club.
               Raymond (in character) breaks free and screams.
          
                                           RAYMOND
                                ...STOP!...Get away!!
          
               For an instant, the inmates stop in stunned silence -- broken only
               by a distant shout overhead.

          ANGLE ON CREW
          
          Eli stands amidst the camera crew photographing the scene.   He is
          waving for order.
          
                                     ELI

                          that roof...
          
                                     ELI
                             (cutting him off)
                          ...Never mind. I didn't like it
                          anyway.
          
          As Eli steps down from the DOLLY, a solemn, quiet man approaches him
          from among the onlookers. It is SAM BAUM (the writer).
          
                                     SAM
                          What's wrong?
          
                                     ELI
                          The scene's wrong.

                          Call a break.
          
          The A.D. Calls "Five minutes" and the crew moves toward the coffee
          urn. Eli wanders toward the door, Sam pursuing.
          
                                     SAM
                             (fighting for his scene)
                          Eli, it played like a dream.   My
                          God, it was Marat-Sade.

                                the middle of the night when you
                                first read it, raving about the
                                magical madhouse scene, the upstairs
                                maid?
          
               Eli rips the page with the "madhouse scene" from his screenplay as
               they stride out of the building.
          
          69   EXT.   MUNICIPAL BUILDING
          
               There, beside the rear entrance on a pile of construction sand, sits
               Eli, cross-legged, staring morosely at some kids who play nearby.
               He is absently folding a torn script page into a paper airplane.
               Behind him, at a respectful distance, stand the Production Manager,
               A.D., half a dozen assorted crew chiefs and Sam Baum, all looking
               concerned. Sam looks at the others, shrugs and approaches Eli,
               squatting beside him on the sand pile.
          
                                           SAM
                                What do you wanna do, Eli?...
                                They're all waiting.
          
               While Sam talks, Eli takes a fistful of sand and pours it in Sam's
               shoe. Suddenly noticing, Sam yanks his foot away.

               Sam has finished replacing his shoe and Eli pours a fistful of sand
               into Sam's other shoe.

               Eli is at the head of a long table, CAMERA PULLING BACK TO REVEAL a
               dozen members of the company dining with him. Nina sits beside Eli
               listening with rapt attention to Sam's monologue, her dessert fork
               sensuously lingers at her lip.
          
                                           SAM
                                Two years ago you were all charged
                                up to make a great big anti-war
                                statement and they wouldn't let you.
                                Now they let you, but you haven't
                                got a war. What you've got is egg
                                on your face because Vietnam's long
                                gone and it's too late!

               The truth in Eli's statement registers on Sam. Cameron sits farther
               down the table, watching Nina watch Eli...and wishing she were
               watching him.

                                one of the symptoms.

                                What's the disease?

                          That's the big question, Sam. Name
                          the disease and you've licked the
                          screenplay.
                             (indicating Cameron)
                          Ask him. 'Cause he knows what the
                          film is about. Right Lucky? Tell
                          'em...How'd you like Vietnam?

                          You drafted?
          
                                    CAMERON
                          No.
          
                                     ELI
                          See, Sam? Here's another one who
                          hates war...but he enlisted.
                              (to Cameron)
                          You fought in Vietnam for two years?
                          ...I mean actually were out there
                          killing people...
          
                                     CAMERON
                          ...Hey, I didn't kill that many
                          people...
          
                                     ELI
                          Don't be modest, Lucky. Everybody
                          digs a little violence...What was
                          that you said on the beach?
          
          Cameron is starting to bristle at Eli's needling, particularly with
          Nina watching.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          About what?
          
                                     ELI
                          About getting home for Thanksgiving?
          
                                     CAMERON
                             (tentatively)
                          ...that you better figure the guy
                          coming at you is trying to kill
                          you...?
          
                                    ELI
          
                                         - 41 -
          
          
                            Yeah. See, Sam?...That's what the
                            disease is about...being scared
                            shitless. Inventing enemies.
                            Whistling in the dark. I wish you'd
                            talk to the kid, Sam, I mean it.
                            You know, really, you guys should
                            room together.
          
                                       SAM
                               (getting the last word)
                            Hey, Lucky, give me your cot by the
                            window and I'll let you read a great
                            madhouse sequence.
          
          They all laugh.
          
                                       SAM
                               (surrendering)
                            All right, Eli. I'll write you
                            another scene. What difference does
                            it make? The studio will cut it all
                            out anyway and what you got left is
                            a lot of swell battle scenes, which,
                            when I was back there they said were
                            "just terrific."
          
                                       ELI
                               (simply)
                            No, they won't.
          
                                       SAM
                            Yeah, what makes you different?
          
                                       ELI
                               (quietly)
                            Because they know if they cut my
                            picture, I'll kill 'em.
          
          The deadly in Eli's voice was more than intended and there is
          suddenly an awkward silence at the table. Cameron eyes Eli with a
          wry smile.
          
                                       CAMERON
                            You mean, bang? Kill 'em, just like
                            that?

                                (matter of fact)
                             No. I'll kill 'em and eat 'em...I
                             hate to waste anything.
          
                                        SAM

                             They call him "Eli the Terrible..."
          
                                        ELI
                             Sam, my picture is the only kid I've
                             got! If the studio said your
                             daughter, Jennifer, would look
                             better with her fingers chopped off,
                             what would you do?
          
                                        SAM
                             Being an insecure writer, I'd call
                             my agent...and get another opinion.
          
          Everyone laughs.
          
          Jake, the Chief of Police, is seen in the background approaching the
          table. Cameron spots him and starts to rise.
          
                                        CAMERON

                                (arriving)
                             Don't go away, Burt.   I want you.

                             Jake! Long time, no see. You taken
                             care of my problem with the beach?
          
                                        JAKE
                             I'm not talking to you.
                                (to Production Manager)
                             I understand you got that film out
                             of the Duesenberg...

                             It's at the lab, Jake.
          
                                            - 43 -
          
          
                                          JAKE
                               I'm talking to this gentleman.
                                  (to Production Manager)
                               We want to see it.
          
               Cameron, realizing the film might disclose his presence on the
               bridge, reacts with alarm, which increases as Eli says...
          
                                          ELI
                               Tell the Chief it's our pleasure.
                               Soon as it gets back...but ask him
                               why.
          
                                           JAKE
                                  (choked up with its
                                    importance)
                               You can tell your Mr. Cross this
                               inquiry comes from a source so high
                               it is not his to question...
                                  (now at a loss for proper
                                    words)
                               ...it is his to do it, or else.
                               Someone they're looking for may have
                               been on that road when the car went
                               off.
                                  (to Cameron)
                               Burt, you see anybody?
          
               Then, suddenly noticing something different about Cameron's
               appearance...
          
                                          JAKE (CONT'D)
                               Hey, did you have red hair
                               before?...
          
                                          CAMERON

                               She sprays it every day so I look
                               like Raymond...I didn't see a soul.
          
                                          ELI
                                  (to the rescue)
                               Tell the Chief that Burt was so busy
                               being brilliant, he wouldn't have
                               noticed Jesus Christ walking on the
                               water.
          
               Jake pulls a PHOTOGRAPH from a manila envelope and hands it to
               Cameron.

               A wire photo, front and side views of Cameron, taken at his military
               induction. War ages a man...he looks younger and quite different in
               his GI Haircut.
          
                                          ELI (V.O.)
                               Hey, Burt! You got it upside down.
                               The eyes go on top.
          
          72   ANOTHER ANGLE
          
               Cameron hands the photo back to the Chief, who passes it around the
               table. Denise receives the photograph, studies it and glances up at
               Cameron, expressionless. He returns her gaze.
          
                                          JAKE (V.O.)
                               A couple of telephone linemen say
                               they saw him headed this way.
          
               Eli takes the photograph.

                               night...

                                I know a weary gay who's going with
                                him!
          
               They mince off (the fag act all the more amusing because of
               Raymond's strictly masculine looks). Eli shouts after them.
          
                                           ELI
                                So long as you're back in ninety
                                minutes. It's a work night for some
                                of us.
                                   (loftily)
                                ...Those who give a shit.
          
               Raymond "gathers" Nina along the way, wrapping his arm about her
               shoulders -- Cameron watching silently. Then, charging from across
               the dining room like a tanker steaming in their wake, comes a
               gushing, overwrought, blue-rinsed MATRON.
          
                                           MATRON
                                Miss Franklin! Miss Franklin! Your
                                'Feminique Spray' commercial is on
                                TV. My God, it's simply heavenly!
          73   INT.   CAMERON'S HOTEL ROOM - CLOSE ON DRESSER - NIGHT
          
               Drawers are slamming open and shut as Cameron hurriedly stuffs his
               few belongings into his pockets.
          
               WIDER ANGLE
          
               It's a mean little bedroom, with Sam's clothes, typewriter, etc., in
               evidence. Seeing Sam's wallet, Cameron pulls a wad of money from
               it, at the same time accidentally knocking Sam's false teeth off the
               dresser. He hesitates, then stuffs back all the bills but a twenty.
               He strides to Sam's closet, pulls out shirt and slacks, stuffs them
               in a cloth beach bag, also belonging to Sam and starts out the door.
               Then he stops, gets on his hands and knees, looking for the false
               teeth, which he finally finds. Now, annoyed at himself for being a
               "nice guy," he throws them carelessly on the dresser and quickly
               exits.

          74    EXT.   HOTEL - LATER THAT NIGHT
          
                As Cameron moves down the steps, the returning company STATION WAGON
                pulls to a stop in the driveway. Nina, Raymond and a few others
                emerge from the car. Cameron turns away so as not to be seen as
                they pass him on the steps heading for the entrance.
          
                                              DENISE
                                   Bet they're looking for that nut who
                                   killed all those campers in Montana...

                                      (drunk)
                                   ...Too many campers, weed 'em out!
                                   ...Imagine, sitting an hour at a
                                   roadblock.

                                   We should have waited, it wouldn't
                                   have been an hour.
          74A   They've entered the hotel. Cameron continues to the bottom of the
                stairs, hesitates, looking back at Nina.
          75    CAMERON'S POV
          
                Silhouetted through the etched glass doors (on the other side of
                "The Looking Glass") he sees the lithe, gay, exquisitely beautiful
                figure of Nina -- light sparkling from the cut glass dances about
                her face -- a hauntingly romantic image.
          76    ANGLE ON CAMERON
          
                He watches for a moment with hopeless longing. Finally, turning
                from her, he looks about at the dark water and deserted boardwalk.
                There come some of Eli's crew, laughing, joking, cutting a swatch
                through the stillness, pushing their heavy brutes toward some nearby
                spot to light a night shot. There's the CHURCH TOWER. He stares at
                it, wavering in his resolve to leave, wondering what would happen
                if...
          
                                              NINA'S VOICE
                                   What next? Do you rescue the maiden
                                   from the tower?
          
                She has come up behind him, unnoticed.    He turns, startled, and
                there she stands.

                                       CAMERON
                                (smiles)
                          Hi.
          
          For a moment they search each other's eyes -- for intentions.   Then
          she glances at the tower.
          
                                     NINA
                          Yes. It does look pretty high.
                             (with concern)
                          Are you worried about tomorrow?
          
          Cameron's mind is racing over all the things he'd like to say so she
          would know him instantly. But his answer is simple and sounds
          sincere.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          Not much. I guess if there were any
                          real danger, Eli wouldn't let me do
                          it, would he?
          
                                    NINA
                             (quickly, reassuring)
                          No. I'm sure it's safe.
          
                                    CAMERON
                             (abruptly, with a boyish
                              grin)
                          Good. Then you jump.
          
                                    NINA
                             (laughing)
                          Okay.
          
          She understands the slightly jealous rebuke for her blind faith in
          Eli. Her laughing answer hangs like a challenge.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          Well, come on.
          
                                     NINA
                             (willing, but flustered)
                          What, right now?
          
          For a moment he weighs it: whether to "run" or stay. Then acts on
          his decision. Starting to laugh, he takes her hand and pulls her
          toward the tower. She holds back, struggling playfully.

                                Don't worry, I'll give you a push.
                                Isn't that what a pal's for?
          77   INT.   BELL TOWER - NIGHT
          
               It is crowded with bells, a small walkway and railing surrounded
               them. The city lights are seen beyond. Below are the sheds where
               crewmen are preparing the next day's shooting. Just beyond is the
               overwhelming silhouette of the huge CRANE. Nina and Cameron reach
               the top of the stairs winded and laughing, as they rush to the
               railing and lean over. Nina gasps, clutching Cameron in genuine
               fright.

                                can't jump from this...you'll get
                                killed! It's crazy!...

                                ...It's not that bad. It looks
                                worse at night... Chuck says it's
                                like robbing a candy store.
          
                                           NINA
                                   (getting angry)
                                Now stop that! ...I'm going back.
          
               She whirls to go.   He stops her, taking her by the shoulders.
          
                                           CAMERON
                                ...What's wrong?
          
               Her concern for him has turned to anger, like a mother slapping her
               child for running in the street.
          
                                           NINA
                                It's just dumb...to strut around
                                trying to talk brave...
          
               His arm still restrains her. She takes hold of it, then suddenly
               softens with a look of slight surprise.

                                Not really.
          
                                            NINA
                                Yes.   You are...You're trembling.
          
               After a moment, he answers quietly.
          
                                           CAMERON
                                So are you...and you're not even
                                gonna jump.
          
               It's true. She is trembling and so is he -- not from fear. He
               slowly draws her toward him, her mouth reaching up to his. And then
               they are devouring each other. Abruptly, they're illuminated by a
               fierce blast of white light. They separate and stare, blinking in
               shock and confusion.

               They are pinned in the crossbeams of two more giant arcs. Quickly
               she yanks him down with her out of sight behind the railing.
          78   EXT.   CHURCHYARD - ELI AND CREW - NIGHT
          
               Eli is lounging in the bucket suspended from the crane.   Beside him
               Gabe adjusts one of the giant brutes.

                                I could kill this brute and fill
                                with juniors. You'd get a halo
                                around the tower.

               Gabe smiles, scurries off. Eli glances at the tower, grins, having
               toyed with them long enough, he yells.

               The church door swings open. Nina and Cameron emerge, covering
               their embarrassment with bravado. Nina is prattling as though to a

                                ...And those bells are so
                                interesting. Imagine four hundred
                                years ago by boat from Amsterdam.
                                Thank you for the tour. It was so
                                informative. I'm going to write my
                                father. He's so interested in God
                                and things like that.

                                Hiya.   Want a lift?
          
               Eli miraculously appears from above. He descends and rides around
               beside them in the bucket of the crane.

                                There once was a maiden fair,
                                smooching a guy with red hair...
          
                                           NINA
                                Eli, get away with that thing!

                          ...Could it be Raymond who's turning
                          this dame on? ...Or his double,
                          young Lucky Pierre?
          
          Unable to elude Eli in his basket, Nina turns on him in mock
          frustration.

                          It's gotten to the point where I
                          have to look under the stopper of
                          the bathtub when I take a shower to
                          make sure I've got some privacy!
                             (broadly gesturing to
                              group)
                          Thank you one and all and good
                          night!
          
          Privately, she gives Cameron's arm an affectionate squeeze, then
          disappears around the corner of the building. He is left holding
          the beach bag, pursued by the Peter Pan in the basket. It has now
          dropped to ground level so Eli is looking up at Cameron.
          
                                     ELI
                          Step right in, folks...the "Killer
                          Crane" ride of the century.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          Thanks, I'll walk.
          
          Eli's basket now moves up a few feet so he's looking down at
          Cameron, riding beside him while he walks.
          
                                     ELI
                          Ah, youth. Six hours in town and
                          caught with the leading lady. Not
                          bad. Shouldn't be so upset.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          Okay to be upset about what happened
                          in the dining room? Why'd you
                          promise to show that cop the film?
                          He'll recognize me.
          
                                     ELI
                          You really don't trust me, do you?
                          Hop in. I got a present for you.

                He pulls Cameron into the basket beside him so unexpectedly that
                Cameron drops Sam's bag. Eli picks it up and plops it into
                Cameron's lap. Suddenly Cameron finds himself soaring skyward at a
                stomach-churning rate -- while Eli rattles on...probing, disarming,
                quixotic...
          
                                           ELI (CONT'D)
                                You constantly amaze me. You don't
                                go to movies. What's that tatoo, a
                                disguise? You a Commie? Don't you
                                know that King Kong was only three
                                feet tall? He came up to Fay Wray's
                                belly button. If God could only do
                                the tricks we can. What are you
                                worried about the film and the cop
                                for?
          
                Now, hanging ten stories above the city, Eli is adjusting his
                viewer, looking at a cluster of RED FLASHING LIGHTS IN THE DISTANCE.
                He hands the viewer to Cameron, who looks through it.
          
          81A   We see a telescoped view of THE POLICE ROADBLOCK at the end of a
                highway with cars waiting to get past ARMED POLICE.

                                advice.

                          You've got that look again. That
                          gleam of the sprinter about to set a
                          record for the 50-yard dash. Is
                          that why all those cops are chasing
                          you? What are you, some kind of sex
                          freak running across America with
                          your fly open? Is that why they're
                          after you?
          
                                     CAMERON
                          You're close. What's your advice?
          
                                     ELI
                          Button your fly and be at the

                          with the rest of the crew. Climb
                          aboard our chartered 707 and fly
                          away with us to where the setting
                          sun bleeds into a million swimming
                          pools a man can hide in. You do
                          swim as well as run?
          
                                     CAMERON
                             (overwhelmed by the
                              offer)
                          I'll swim like a fish. You really
                          mean it?
                             (Eli nods)
                          Why are you trying to save my ass?
          
          Eli hesitates, then answers quietly -- for him there is great
          meaning in it.

                              the mood broken)
                          ...Besides, I've fallen madly in

          82   EXT.   CHURCH TOWER - NEXT MORNING - BRIGHT DAYLIGHT
          
               The thunderous clang of bells! Cameron ready, coiled tight, heart
               pounding as loud as the bells. A burst of machine gun bullets tears
               through the railing beside him, sending splinters flying against his
               face.
          83   CAMERA CREW
          
               HARVEY (Second Unit Director) and CAMERA OPERATOR behind the
               MITCHELL, looking up tensely. Harvey gestures, yelling.

          84   IN BELL TOWER
          
               Near Cameron, the SECOND A.D., crouched out of sight with a walkie-
               talkie, stabs a finger at him.
          
                                            SECOND A.D.
                                Go!...Go!
          
               A burst of tracer bullets streak past Cameron. Sparks fly, as stray
               bullets seem to bounce and ricochet off the bells.
          85   MACHINE GUN
          
               A 50-calibre MACHINE GUN, a SPECIAL EFFECTS MAN in Levi's and sport
               shirt, pumping tracers past the bell tower.
          86   TWO SHOT - BELL TOWER
          
               The Second A.D. slams his hand down on a PLUNGER, setting off a
               series of explosive squibs. Like machine gun bullets, they start
               shattering the railing, moving toward Cameron, forcing him to the
               edge of the tower.
          
               Vaulting over the rail, he clings to the side of the bell tower.
               Explosive bursts disintegrate the railing in his hand. He shoves
               out, launching himself into space. Twisting, hurtling across the
               gap between the buildings, falling, crashing to the slate roof,
               crawling and scrambling for a hand hold. The relentless tracer
               bullets chip the slate beside him. Crouching low, Cameron, like an
               animal, moves across the roof to the safety of a water tower.
               Squibs burst over his head and spouts of water stream from the
               tower.
          
                                             - 55 -
          
          
               Moving around the tower, suddenly there are TWO GERMAN SOLDIERS
               running at him with bayoneted rifles. He wheels and there stands
               ANOTHER GERMAN (Chuck), who leaps toward him, slamming down his
               rifle butt. The blow glances off Cameron. They grapple, kicking,
               clawing, rolling down the steep slope, picking up momentum.
          87   RAIN GUTTER
          
               The roof's edge rushes toward them, below it a fearsome drop.
               Cameron's hands reach out desperately grabbing for the railing as
               Chuck, screaming, hurtles off the edge, writhing as his body tumbles
               in space toward the ground.
          88   CAMERON
          
               Sweat pouring from his face, a gash on his cheek gushes blood, his
               eyes glazed, he pulls himself back on the roof.
          89
               CATCHER
          
               Chuck, lying relaxed on the straw and mattress safety pad which
               caught him on the ground, looks up, cups his hands and shouts at
               Cameron.
          
                                           CHUCK
                               Go!...Go!
          
          90   ROOF
          
               Cameron, running for his life along the edge of the roof, the
               soldiers shooting down at him from the roof's peak. He reaches the
               far end, looks down. There is the awning jutting from an adjacent
               wall two stories below. He scrambles off the roof. Clinging to the
               down spout, he starts descending it.
          91   SPECIAL EFFECTS MAN
          
               Looking up from the ground, he yanks a control rope.
          
          92   CAMERON
          
               The bracket holding the down spout breaks loose. The spout starts
               to fall away from the side of the building. Cameron clings to it,
               riding its downward arc as though it were a falling tree.
          
                                               - 56 -
          
          93   AWNING
          
               At the end of the arc, Cameron throws himself free for a safe
               landing and smashes against the awning. Instead of holding, it rips
               apart like paper and, in that unexpected instant, Cameron's eyes
               widen in genuine terror as he plummets through the shredded canvas
               toward a skylight one floor below.
          94   SKYLIGHT
          
               Exploding in a shower of glass and wood as it is struck by Cameron's
               body. He hurtles downward toward a blur of images.
          95   ANGLE ON COT
          
               Collapsing from the impact of Cameron's fall. The MAN and WOMAN who
               were making love on the cot have been flung to the ground and roll
               entwined with him. Cameron is dazed. Like a drowning man, he rages
               to free himself from the tangle of naked limbs and smothering flesh.
               A painted face shrieks in laughter -- as the door to the room he is
               in is thrown open, revealing:
          
          96   BROTHEL SET ­ INT. MUNICIPAL BUILDING
          
               Cameron has fallen into a cubicle in what appears to be a World War
               I German army brothel. In the high-ceilinged room, there is a row
               of cots separated by makeshift screens. COUPLES jump up from the
               cots startled. A line of partly naked GERMAN SOLDIERS waiting their
               turn at the whores have broken into shouts and laughter at Cameron's
               unorthodox entrance. They crowd around the cubicle where Cameron
               fell and now struggles with the couple.

                          Wait your turn like the rest!
          
          Cameron's confusion changes to helpless fury as he kicks and
          struggles against a forest of grasping hands ripping his clothes
          away, passing him back toward the rear of the line.

                          This is a whorehouse, not a stable.
          
          Whores have left their cots to join in the assault, screeching in
          glee. As he maniacally lashes out at his good-natured molesters,
          the blood from Cameron's face smears a whore's body.
          
                                    ELI'S VOICE
                          Cut!
          
          Instantly everything stops. Cameron is sprawled half-naked on his
          knees at the end of the line. Enraged, he whirls toward Eli who has
          caused this humiliation. Then the CLAPPING begins, the CAST and
          CREW applauding his stunt. People slap him on the back admiringly.
          A robe is thrown around him. He is helped to his feet. Suddenly
          Nina is there flinging her arms about him and kissing him on the
          mouth.
          
                                     NINA
                          I'm so proud of you...I could just
                          die!
          
          He is pulled away from her by the backslappers. Now Cameron is
          responding to this strange new sensation -- the warmth of public
          acclaim. He regains his poise, hoping his embarrassing anger wasn't
          noticed. Chuck is now beside him, reaching up to the wound on
          Cameron's face and pulling away the plastic makeup patch with fake
          blood inside; the "wound" is gone. He starts feeling Cameron's
          shoulders, arms and ribs for possible damage.

                 fender of the Duesenberg. Cameron views it with a strange sense of
                 unease. Putting his arm around Cameron's shoulder, Eli leads him
                 toward the back door yelling to mechanic.
          
                                             ELI
                                  You'll have it ready on time?
          
                                             MECHANIC
                                  Yeah, but don't look under the hood
                                  or you'll find a Chevy.
          
          100B   At the door, Eli can barely open it to squeeze through.
          
          101    INT.   STORAGE ROOM
          
                 An incredible number of people have wedged themselves into this tiny
                 smoke-filled room, peering over each other's heads toward a lighted
                 area at the far end.
          
                                             ELI
                                     (shouting)
                                  Harvey in here?

                                Quiet. We're shooting.
                                   (then back to business)
                                Come on...let me have a little more
                                face...a little more face!
          
                Eli squats on his haunches peering between the legs of the onlookers
                and tugs on Cameron's sleeve to join him.
          
          102   POV
          
                Hazily, through the restless shifting limbs, male and female, like
                the first rays of morning sun breaking through to the depths of the
                forest, we glimpse Raymond and Gabe shooting their eight millimeter
                epic: Two people screwing in a rowboat. Raymond suddenly throws
                his hands up in despair.
          
                                           RAYMOND
                                   (screaming)
                                Cut!
                                   (indignantly)
                                Jesus, Kenneth. Great control. All
                                right, who's doubling for Kenny on
                                the inserts?
          
          103   ANGLE ON ELI AND CAMERON
          
                Cameron and Eli rise to their feet.
          
                                           ELI
                                Can you believe this? They spend
                                the whole day working in a
                                whorehouse and look how they relax?
                                That's dedication. You think sex
                                can save the world?
                                   (grins at Cameron)
          
                                           CAMERON
                                That's not my bag, Eli.
          
                                           ELI
                                Sex, or saving the world?
          
                                           CAMERON
                                ...The world, that's your special
                                job. And Jesus, are we all lucky to
                                have you around...
          
                Suddenly Cameron is shoved backwards by the door as someone pushes
                against it to get in.
          
                                              - 63 -
          
          
          104   ANOTHER ANGLE
          
                It is Harvey standing in the doorway with Nina.
          
                                            HARVEY
                                    (to Eli)
                                 Hey Chief, ya lookin' for me?
          
                Nina tries to peer over the heads of the crowd, pushing into the
                room. Cameron steps toward her without thinking. He wants her out
                of there.
          
                                            NINA
                                 What's happening?   What's going on?
          
                                            GABE
                                    (joking)
                                 Look who's here! Nina, we need you.
                                 Still got your makeup on?
          
                Nina, who by now has seen what's happening, laughs.
          
                                            NINA
                                 That's a daring touch, Raymond!    The
                                 rowboat. Terribly symbolic.
          
                There is general laughter, but not shared by Cameron. He
                surprisingly finds himself angry at Nina's presence here and
                everyone's easy familiarity toward her. She sees Cameron and Eli
                through the smokey dimness and works her way toward them smiling.
                Eli puts his arms about her shouting over the din.
          
                                            ELI
                                    (kidding her)
                                 Just like the old days, huh kid?
                                 Remember the sunglasses and garter
                                 belts back when we got our start?
                                 Make you nostalgic?
          
                More laughter.   Nina turns to Cameron.
          
                                            NINA
                                 Hi Lancelot. What's a nice boy like
                                 you doing in a place like this?
                                 Going to rescue the maiden from the
                                 boat?
          
                                            ELI
                                 He just asked if he could do the
                                 rowing. Didn't you, kid?
          
                                       - 64 -
          
          
          
                                     CAMERON
                          Having fun with me, aren't you?
                          It's Eli's potty training class.
                          Show little Lucky the pretty lady.
                          Make dirt on the pretty lady. Watch
                          little Lucky puke. Trouble with you
                          is you think the whole world is your
                          own personal crapper.
                             (Cameron starts to exit)
                          Have yourself a time...Just wallow
                          around in it, man. Watching you
                          makes me feel like Mr. Clean.
          
          Cameron storms out in a rage. Eli watches with a thoughtful smile.
          Sam, who has witnessed the outburst, turns to Eli, furious:
          
                                     SAM
                          ...Goddamn little prudish bastard!
          
                                     ELI
                          No more than you and me...it's the
                          human condition. We just hide it
                          better.
          
                                     SAM
                          ...Are you kidding?...If That guy in
                          the rowboat was a Marine sticking a
                          bayonet in her instead of a cock,
                          that uptight son-of-a-bitch would
                          have saluted.
          
          Eli starts laughing.
          
                                     SAM (CONT'D)
                          Fucking Fascist. What are you
                          laughing at?
          
                                     ELI
                          It's just...that girl in the
                          rowboat, she looks exactly like your
                          daughter, Jennifer.
          
                                     SAM
                             (outraged)
                          Goddamn you, Eli.   That's not funny!
          
          He grabs Eli by the shirt front, cocking his fist.
          
                                    ELI
                             (laughing and wrestling)

                                 Get 'em, Sam! Sic 'em! Kill 'em,
                                 boy! That's my uptight killie
                                 doggie...
          
                Sam's anger fades to a sheepish grin, realizing he's fallen into
                Eli's trap. Where his daughter is concerned, he's just as prudish
                as Cameron. Eli snaps an affectionate headlock around Sam's neck.
          
                                            SAM

                                 See what I mean? Old Victoria's
                                 still got us all by the balls. God

                                 is, we like to make movies about it.
          
                With hardly a pause, he turns.

                Rubbing his hands together (the old pro taking over), he starts
                pushing his way through the crowd.

                He elbows his way to center stage.

                On the folding chairs facing the PORTABLE SCREEN, a dozen people are
                silhouetted against the light from the projected dailies. Cameron
                enters, pausing so his eyes can adjust to the dark.

                In the dimness, Nina sits separated from Eli, Sam and a few others.
                On the screen, a World War I British biplane in steady flight is
                interrupted by a couple of subliminal cuts. Another subliminal
                flash holds and replaces the scene on the portable screen. It's a
                "NUDIE" SHOT -- a rear view of the lady taken in the rowboat the
                night before.

                The watchers all break up, recognizing the work of Raymond and Gabe.

                                   I love her smile...
          
                As Nina laughs good-naturedly, the airplane is back on the portable
                screen.
          107   ANGLE ON CAMERON
          
                Involuntarily smiling to himself and now less uptight about last
                night, he walks over and sits down beside her.
          
                                              CAMERON

                Without even glancing at him, Nina gets up and moves to a chair some
                distance away. He is stunned, then angry. Then confounded. Then

                 Nina, close to tears, quickly gets up and hurries out of the
                 theater, as Cameron sits there numbly staring at the screen.
          
          107A   POV
          
                 On the portable screen, Raymond in helmet and goggles is in the
                 cockpit of an airplane. He stuffs a bottle of champagne into a
                 leather flying boot, dangles the package over the side and lets it
                 go. Raymond looks down and salutes (like that famous scene in
                 "WINGS").

                                 that.
          
                 Eli's voice yells 'cut' on the sound track. The angle on the
                 portable screen widens and we see that the airplane sits on the
                 ground with an electric fan blowing wind in Raymond's face.

                 Now the scene on the portable screen changes: from the ground, we
                 see the same biplane flying low. An object drops from the cockpit
                 (the boot). Then there is a burst of flame in the engine. Trailing
                 smoke, the plane wobbles, crash-lands (sliding alarmingly close to
                 CAMERA). It ground-loops, goes up on one wing and, as it crashes
                 down, we see that the pilot who we assumed was Raymond, is really a
                 dummy that is flapping absurdly and falling to pieces before our
                 eyes during the crash. There are groans, laughter and raspberries
                 O.S.

          109   (SHOCK CUT TO SKY) - CLOSE ON GERMAN FIGHTER PLANE - DAY
          
                It screams down vertically, full power, machine guns blazing, then
                smashes into the earth, shredding to fragments hurled in every
                direction. The dead German pilot is flung crumpled to the ground.
                The plane's carcass explodes, filling the screen with fire and black
                smoke through which we see a brightly colored PARACHUTE descending.
                The FIGURE dangling beneath it passes through the smoke and flames
                and tumbles to the ground, rolling, his parachute now ablaze. It is
                Cameron dressed in a British flyer's uniform.
          110   ANGLE WIDENS
          
                To show the hand-held Arriflex at Gabe's eye, Eli behind him,
                steering Gabe by the back of his belt and carrying the battery pack
                as they photograph Cameron shedding the harness. With the camera,
                they crouch and move together like a three-headed, four-armed, four-
                legged creature.
          
                Banking steeply, a British fighter roars past Cameron, its wingtip
                almost brushing the ground, machine guns rattling, driving some
                advancing German soldiers back toward the woods.
          
                The plane touches down to rescue Cameron, the pilot beckoning.
                Cameron has pulled off the dead German pilot's boots and helmet.
                Stray bullets strike about him as he sprints to the idling British
                plane. It is a single-seater. It starts to pick up speed. He
                grabs a strut and scrambles up onto the lower wing.
          
          111   ANGLE ON CONSTRUCTION CRANE
          
                The bucket hanging from the giant CRANE descends. Smoothly Eli
                guides Gabe backward, seating him in the bucket. The bucket rises,
                lifting Gabe while he photographs the scene, as the plane with
                Cameron on the wing becomes airborne.
          112   ANGLE ON PICKET FENCE

          113   ANGLE ON CRANE BUCKET AND BRITISH AIRPLANE
          
                The giant arm of the crane swings and rises with the plane,
                completing Gabe's spectacular shot. Now we see a HELICOPTER drop
                into frame, photographing the plane from the other side. The
                chopper and the vintage British plane bank together in perfect tight
                formation with Cameron standing spread-eagled between the wing
                struts like a flying Christ, as they soar into the sun.

                against the struts. His white silk scarf streams into the tearing
                wind. Jamming a champagne bottle into the German's boot, he holds
                it up. The pilot grins approval, popping the cork on a second
                bottle which spouts foam into the slipstream. Laughing, he passes a
                glass to Cameron and pours from above. The liquid is lost in the
                wind. Shrugging, he swigs from the bottle and hands it to Cameron.
                Cameron drinks. The champagne pours down his throat and face and,
                holding the strut with one hand, he rises to his feet.
          
                The pilot waggles his wings, giving Cameron a seesaw ride to get his
                bottle back. Cameron now seems drunk. He lets go of the strut and
                stands leaning against the wind. As the pilot toasts his courage,
                Cameron's balance falters and he grabs the strut.
          
                Now, Cameron picks his way through the guywires toward the end of
                the wing. Then he bounces up and down, rocking the plane. The
                pilot starts to sing to Cameron's rhythm, "How ya gonna keep 'em
                down on the farm..." And Cameron dances the Charleston.
          115   INT.   HELICOPTER
          
                Gabe at the eyepiece of the Mitchell, slowly tilting up and down to
                follow the action.

                                    pills?
          
                Through the plastic bubble, the biplane can be seen in the distance
                going through its antic maneuvers.
          
                                               ELI

                                    what's eating him...that makes it
                                    sort of interesting.

                CLOSE ON BIPLANE
          
                Cameron holds the boot poised, lets go. Then, the pilot is struck
                by a bursting shell. As he slumps over, the plane skids and slips
                and drops off into a spin. Cameron clings for his life as the
                sickening momentum grows, until his feet are flung out from under
                him and he dangles from the wing, whipping in space.
          117   WIDE ANGLE
          
                Suddenly it becomes clear how what we are seeing is possible -- the
                airplane is no longer in flight, but is dangling a few feet above
                the ground, suspended from the cable of the huge crane. The crewmen
                shove at its tail and wingtips to keep it revolving. Cameron is,
                indeed, clinging to the wing strut, his feet held in space by the
                centrifugal force. But, if his hands slip, he will fall ten feet
                instead of to certain death.

          119   ANGLE ON CRANE OPERATOR
          
                Easing some levers back.
          120   POV THROUGH LENS
          
                As the spin slows down and the plane appears to level out, Cameron
                regains his footing, perches on the wing and looks forward in
                growing horror.
          
          121   WIDER ANGLE
          
                As the swinging arm of the crane glides the plane forward toward a
                stand of trees at the edge of a clearing.

          122   PAST CAMERON - MOVING SHOT
          
                We see the rapidly approaching trees. Closer and closer, until with
                a horrendous crash, the plane sails between two trunks, shearing off
                the wingtips, the nose smashing into another, hurling Cameron off
                the wing like a crumb flicked from the table.
          123   EXTREME CLOSE UP - CAMERON
          
                Apparently hurtling through the air, his eyes widen at the impending
                impact. A gasp and then a sharp cry. But instead of the
                crash...the ANGLE WIDENS and we see it is Cameron reaching orgasm.
                With extreme contentment on his face, he rolls over revealing Nina,
                who, it is clear, has also had a lovely time.
          
          124   WIDER ANGLE - INT.   NINA'S HOTEL BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
                They are in bed in a pleasant large room (the Queen Anne Suite),
                untidy, with script pages, wigs, costumes, fresh flowers, the
                leftovers of a room service dinner. Nina caresses his back,
                noticing bruises. She kisses them gently and starts to giggle. He
                looks at her quizzically.
          
                                           NINA
                                That's twice for me today. Now.
                                And when I watched you do the stunt.
          
                The ALARM CLOCK on the dresser BEGINS RINGING.   He sits up, puzzled.
          
                                           NINA (CONT'D)
                                I have to study my scene for
                                tomorrow. The Old Lady at the
                                cemetery. It's brutal. I set the
                                clock in case we dozed off.
          
                Cameron gets up, moving toward the dresser to turn off the clock,
                but instead stops at the stand holding the Old Lady wig. He runs
                his fingers through it as the clock continues to ring.
          
                                           CAMERON
                                How come they cast you as an old
                                lady?
          
                                           NINA
                                I start out as a young girl hiding
                                this American flyer. I'm Austrian...
                                Will ya turn off the clock?
          
                Subtly, we sense something is bothering Cameron.    He ignores the
                still-ringing clock.
          
                                       - 75 -

                          Anyway, his patriotism is stronger
                          than his love and he leaves me with
                          another little patriot in my belly.
          
          During this he has taken the wig and puts it over his head, glancing
          in the mirror.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          Why can't I double for both of you?
                          I could use the money and I don't
                          look half bad.
          
                                     NINA
                             (seriously)
                          Honey, you'll ruin it.    Take it off.
          
          He does.
          
                                     NINA (CONT'D)
                          The clock's electric. It'll ring
                          forever.
          
          Instead of turning off the clock, he crosses to the Old Lady's dress
          on a hanger. He looks at the dress appraisingly.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          Eli might really go for that, the
                          big soldier as a little old lady.
          
          Disturbed, Nina leaves the bed, turns off the alarm clock and
          adjusts the wig properly on its stand.
          
                                     NINA
                          What's wrong?

                          Everything's beautiful.
          
          They embrace and cling to each other. She starts back for the bed,
          but he detours for the clock and pulls out the alarm again, and
          again it BEGINS RINGING.
          
                                     NINA
                          What are you doing?
          
                                       - 76 -
          
          
                                     CAMERON
                          We've got to consider Eli. If you
                          don't study the scene, he'll be
                          mad...then you'll get mad...and I'll
                          get shot out of a cannon.
          
          With the alarm still ringing, he starts toward the bed.
          
                                     NINA
                          Did you fall on your head today?
          
                                     CAMERON
                          I want it to ring.
          
                                    NINA
                          Why?
          
                                     CAMERON
                          For me, that's why. That's Eli
                          yelling for you to work on your
                          scene and us saying, "Up yours,
                          Eli," and I like that.
          
                                     NINA
                          Do you want to leave?
          
                                     CAMERON
                          I want to make love to you while Eli
                          is screaming his head off.
          
          The whole idea is so incongruous that she starts laughing. He gets
          on the bed with her. THE ALARM CONTINUES TO RING. They struggle
          about, giggling at the absurdity.
          
                                     NINA
                          I can't make love with the clock
                          ringing.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          Betcha can.
          
          While he moves over her body, she grabs a pillow and hurtles it at
          the clock. It falls over, but keeps on ringing. By now, Cameron
          has entered Nina and she is rapidly becoming more involved in that,
          than in the clock.

                 CLOSE ON MOVIOLA
          
                 In the darkness, the machine is like an ominous hunchback,
                 splattering shards of light against Chuck's intensely watching face.
                 He is highly disturbed at the unseen image.
          
                                               CHUCK

                 ANGLE WIDENS, showing a small STORAGE ROOM has been converted to a
                 makeshift EDITING ROOM, where Chuck sits working the MOVIOLA.
                 Slowly becoming aware of someone, he glances up through the spinning
                 reels and dimly sees Cameron leaning in the doorway.
          
                                               CHUCK
                                    There was no way it could go
                                    wrong...unless he just went ape.
          
                 Cameron ambles over as Chuck reverses the film to see it one more
                 time. Even as he catches a glimpse of the film whirring backward,
                 he realizes he's seeing BURT'S DEATH SCENE in the water. Now Chuck
                 has reached the beginning of the film and is moving it forward
                 again.
          125A   CLOSE UP - VIEWER OF MOVIOLA
          
                 The film whirs as we see through the windshield over Burt's
                 shoulder, the car flying through the air, hitting the water and
                 sinking beneath the surface. Burt goes through the motions of a man
                 trying to free himself.
          
                                               CHUCK

                                               CAMERON
                                    That crack...in the windshield...
          
                                              CHUCK
          
                                              - 78 -
          
          
                                 What about it? Probably from the
                                 impact. No water coming in.
          
                Cameron's face reflects immense relief. At least he's not guilty of
                that. The flung stone was not the cause. Now, abruptly, Burt's
                body begins to move more violently.
          
                                            CHUCK'S VOICE
                                 There! Look at that. He's starting
                                 to panic. Will you, for Christ's
                                 sake, tell me why?
          
                As Chuck slows the film, we see Burt's head duck beneath the view of
                the underwater camera, leaving only the steering wheel and
                windshield. For an instant, the current changes the light and the
                crack glows brightly, like a spider web. Burt reappears, his face
                now toward camera, wild with terror. The slow motion lends a
                bizarre elegance to his agony. Abruptly, the FILM GOES BLACK.
          
                                            CHUCK
                                 Shit. That's where it stops. That
                                 fuckin' Henry...got spooked and took
                                 his finger off the remote button.
          
                                            CAMERON
                                 Is this how the story was supposed
                                 to end, with the flyer dying in the
                                 water?
          
                                            CHUCK
                                 Sure as shit ended that way for
                                 Burt, didn't it?
          
          127   INT.   REHEARSAL HALL - DAY
          
                In one of the private DINING ROOMS off the lobby, tables and chairs
                are pushed against the wall to make room for a rehearsal now in
                progress. Some early morning TOURISTS have gathered outside the
                entrance, watching. A few members of the kitchen staff peer through
                an inside doorway. Sam and key crewmen stand on the sidelines as
                Eli rehearses with Nina.

                                     ELI
                             (gesturing)
                          The graveyard's over here...
                             (he takes a few steps)
                          ...Her car's parked here.
                             (sets down a folding
                              chair)
                          ...Lots of these little graveyards
                          along the roadside...most of the
                          stones are unmarked...
          
          He takes Nina by the hand and pulls her down beside him, kneeling on
          the floor.
          
                                     ELI (CONT'D)
                          You're tired...you're broke...all
                          things which meant so much are gone.
                          What's left is a single memory...
                          that brief bright love.
          
          Nina's listening intensely but something catches her eye. Among the
          tourists at the doorway stands Cameron, who has paused to watch, his
          costume slung over his shoulder. He nods to her with a small tender
          smile. Subtly, so Eli won't notice, she smiles back, then renews
          her concentration.
          
                                     ELI (CONT'D)
                          ...You spent your month's pension in
                          hiring the car. You just can't look
                          for his grave any longer...so you
                          pick one...any one. You kneel...
                          then lay the flowers down.
                             (yells to the prop man)
                          What have we got for her?
          
                                     PROPERTY MAN
                          I got roses.
          
                                     ELI
                          No...something she picked herself...
                          wildflowers or something.
          
          Sam crosses over to them and kneels beside Eli and Nina.
          
                                              - 80 -
          
          
                                            SAM
                                    (hesitantly)
                                 Eli. An idea, maybe. Instead of
                                 flowers, what if she brought him the
                                 things of their life together...of
                                 their sexuality...like her
                                 nightgown, her underclothes...
          
                Eli looks at him thoughtfully.
          
                                            SAM (CONT'D)
                                 'Course they'd be rags by now, but
                                 let me show you this...
          
                From a paper bag, he takes a SMALL BRONZE CASTING of a BEAR and A
                GIRL on a SWING beneath a tree. He sets it down.
          
          128   INSERT ON THE BRONZE
          
                Sam's hand presses a lever on the side of the bronze. There is a
                whirring of the clockwork and a music box melody plays. The girl
                begins to swing. The bear slides toward her. She mechanically
                lifts her bronze dress until they meet, performing their clockwork
                love rite. Nina giggles.
          
                                            SAM'S VOICE
                                 It's authentic. Early Victorian.
                                 Mechanical bronzes were quite a
                                 thing.
          129   ANGLE ON GROUP
          
                Eli shakes his head patiently, kindly.
          
                                            ELI
                                 Sam, you'll get a belly laugh.
          
                                            SAM
                                 What do you mean?   It'll break their
                                 hearts!
          
                Eli begins to beam. Sam, realizing he has again fallen into the
                trap, winces, chagrined. Eli grabs him in a bear hug.
          
                                            ELI
                                 Welcome to the picture, Sam!
          
                Sam struggles to escape from the iron grip as Eli dances him about
                in joy.

                Denise, with spray can and fingertips, is massaging in red dye, as

                uniforms.

                                You just sit here...dry...and
                                repent.
          
                She crosses to the men at the makeup table.
          
                                           ACTOR
                                Glad ya could tear yourself away.

                                 the dog food lady before they even
                                 get to you. You may not work 'til
                                 midnight.
          
                                            ACTOR
                                 You wait. Eli'll wave his wand and
                                 get it out of her in five minutes.
          
                                            DENISE'S VOICE
                                    (trimming his hair)
                                 You're confused...He got it into her
                                 in five minutes. To get it out of
                                 her...it takes longer.
          
                There is general knowing laughter as Denise crosses back to Cameron
                and sees by the look on his face she has hit her target. The
                thought of Nina and Eli as lovers had never occurred to Cameron.

                The effect is stronger than she had expected.     Now compassion sets
                in.

                                 scorned...I'll say anything.
          
                Cameron just sinks back in the chair, slowly dying.

                Over the tinkling sound of the music box, the BEAR and MAIDEN
                perform their ritual as the CAMERA PULLS BACK revealing the
                GRAVESTONE decorated with the worn filmy lace undergarments of
                another era. They flutter in the soft wind and amber light of a
                summer afternoon, strangely beautiful against the mossy granite
                marked "UNKNOWN." Somehow these rotting women's underthings have
                the dignity of a sacred tapestry draping an altar.

                The ANGLE WIDENS and we see Nina, now made up to look wrinkled and
                gray, tragically old, her eyes moist as she kneels beside the grave.

                          either. I think both of us are
                          bears.
                             (a soft nostalgic smile)
                          Go, young maiden, you'll be late for
                          your piano lesson.
          
          An elegantly-dressed CARIBINERRI (ITALIAN POLICEMAN) appears.
          
                                     CARIBINERRI
                          Signora...signora...
          
                                     OLD LADY (NINA)
                          I'm almost finished.
          
                                     CARIBINERRI
                          Signora. This desecration... some
                          flowers perhaps...would be
                          permitted.
          
                                     OLD LADY (NINA)
                          But, we want these.
          
                                     CARIBINERRI
                          Please, signora. It's not right.
                          The grave is unmarked.
          
                                     OLD LADY (NINA)
                          Ask the driver how many graves we
                          visited today. I could have chosen
                          five hours ago. I came here and my
                          soul said, "Oh yes." I know that is
                          hard to believe...
          
                                     CARIBINERRI
                             (shrugging)
                          Anything is possible, signora.
                             (tries urging her to her
                              feet)
                          Now, you must permit me to escort
                          you to your car.
          
                                     OLD LADY (NINA)
                          As soon as I am gone, you will take
                          everything away.
          
                                    CARIBINERRI
                          No...
          
                                       - 84 -
          
          
                                     OLD LADY (NINA)
                             (tears streaming down her
                              face)
                          You will, and I can't stop you, and
                          it's wrong. We loved each other...
                          Where else should these go?
          
          The unexpected sound of laughter makes her turn to see a SMALL GROUP
          OF PEOPLE who've gathered beside their PARKED CARS watching.
          
                                     OLD LADY (NINA)
                          Yes, I know I'm ridiculous, but you
                          laugh without knowing anything. You
                          would buy a plastic wreath for a man
                          of such importance.
          
          She pulls free of the Caribinerri and, trying to kneel down,
          stumbles and falls. Now, like some confused child, she searches
          among the garments. Taking a SCROLL from a wooden box, she shakes
          it at them like a schoolteacher would a ruler.
          
                                     OLD LADY (NINA)
                          President Wilson...from the
                          President of the United States...for
                          heroism. To me for sheltering
                          him...
                             (smiling to herself)
                          How silly. I 'sheltered' him to be
                          with him. He was my beloved...Where
                          is it?...Oh, here, did you see this?
          
          She now holds up a fist from which dangles a swastika on a sash.
          
                                     OLD LADY (NINA)
                          Given to me by Adolf Hitler...for
                          our son. Our son...
          
          Her voice suddenly fierce with the pain of that memory.
          
                                     OLD LADY (NINA)
                          ...Our son!!!
                             (then, with simple
                              reverence)
                          ...A thousand years of peace...is
                          what he said. That would be very
                          nice.
          
          The Caribinerri, spellbound, has taken a backward step, bumping into
          a REFLECTOR, which now teeters and falls into the scene, knocking
          off his hat, barely missing the Old Lady and crashing across the
          grave and shattering all illusion. The Caribinerri stands there
          
                                             - 85 -
          
          
                with his eyes closed and his fists clenched, wishing he were in the
                grave. Nina stands in speechless horror.

                                           ELI
                                ...and print.
          
                It's deadly silent as Eli walks over to Nina.    They stare at each
                other for a moment.
          
                                           ELI
                                   (eyes brimming over)
                                Thank you, baby.
          
                They fall into each others arms like lovers never do.
          134   MEDIUM - CAMERON WATCHING ELI AND NINA EMBRACE
          
                Everybody is applauding, wild with joy over Nina's great
                performance. Tears of happiness run unabashedly down Sam's nose.
                Only Cameron is sullen, seething with anger and jealousy as he views
                them in the light of his recent information.
          
                                           A.D.

                                Don't pack it...just stick it in the
                                truck. Come on, we're losing sun,
                                everybody. In ten minutes at the
                                farmhouse!
          
                Cameron is standing aside, while Nina vainly looks around for him.
                Denise is unpinning her wig. Chuck approaches Cameron.

          Cameron, still watching Nina and Eli in the now dwindling circle of
          admirers, doesn't answer.

                          You know Eli... "Tell the soldier
                          it's an extra hundred bucks and
                          he'll do it without the asbestos."

                          day! Did you see her performance?
                          Terrific. It's a day for humility

          135   ANGLE - EXT.   FARMHOUSE - DAY
          
                As it explodes, Cameron is BLOWN THROUGH THE WALL -- ON FIRE. He
                tumbles to the ground, frantically writhes, rolls, trying to smother
                the flames, finally collapsing in some wagon tracks filled with
                muddy water. Cameron lifts his head at the approach of a THUNDERING
                SOUND...an ENGLISH CAISSON hurtles toward him, the driver dead and
                mangled over the barrel of the gun, the horses insane with terror.
                Before Cameron can move, the charging horses are on top of him. He
                rolls between their hooves, the giant steel wheel of the caisson
                barely missing him. Shells from a cannon barrage are bursting all
                about. Cameron staggers to his feet and scrambles over a low stone
                wall for protection, drops to the other side and then hurtles into
                the air as the wall is shattered by an exploding shell.

                As Cameron falls into the shot, landing on a hidden TRAMPOLINE near
                the stone wall, bouncing up and down 'til he finally comes to rest.

                                 Who said that?
          
                Cameron stares over the edge of the trampoline as Henry, the
                assistant cameraman, uneasily faces Eli.
          
                                            HENRY
                                 We had a film run-out.

                                 How many feet are left in that
                                 camera?

                                 Thirty-six feet.
          
                Eli advances murderously on the assistant cameraman, building to a
                rage we have not seen in him before.
          
                                            ELI

                                 going to do this to me? How dare
                                 you yell cut on my set?

                                Thirty-six feet is nothing...
          
                                           ELI
                                It's twenty-two seconds! In twenty-
                                two seconds, I could break your
                                spine...I could pinch your fucking
                                head off like an insect and smear it
                                on the pavement...I could put
                                twenty-two bullets in that fat gut
                                of yours! The only thing I can't
                                seem to do in twenty-two seconds is
                                keep you from fucking up my film!
          
                Cameron is so intrigued that he hasn't realized an EMBER is burning
                through his asbestos protector, until suddenly he feels the flame
                and frantically begins beating it out and thus, is even denied the
                pleasure of savoring Eli's anguish.

                trouble with Cameron and that she might be at fault, she has decided
                to do a campy, cutesy Blanche Dubois stepping off "THE STREETCAR
                NAMED DESIRE" number, ten years too soon.
          
                                           NINA

                                ...I can't tell you how pleased I
                                was with your conduct. When you
                                congratulated me after my scene this
                                afternoon, all the other glowing
                                tributes faded to nothing...
          139   WIDER ANGLE - INT.   CAMERON'S AND SAM'S ROOM
          
                Sam has stopped typing and sits silently, waiting for the storm.
          
                Cameron lies on his bed in a T-shirt and shorts, an elastic bandage
                around his knee and an ice bag at his neck, coldly watching Nina's
                performance as she grandly moves through the doorway into the room.

                          ...Nevertheless, I'm cancelling your
                          invitation to an intimate party
                          given by my parents, who arrived
                          unexpectedly to honor me on the
                          occasion of my birthday...but don't
                          feel too badly. As consolation for
                          a lovely evening missed, I'm
                          presenting you with the "good-sport-
                          of-the-month" award.
          
          From behind her back, she takes an APPLE with a tiny cocktail
          parasol stuck in it and holds it out to Cameron. Cameron lies
          glaring at her with mounting rage.
          
                                     NINA (CONT'D)
                          Mr. Baum, will you notify this young
                          savage that it's customary to cover
                          one's privates when accepting an
                          award? It's one of the common
                          courtesies, like...congratulating
                          people.
          
                                     CAMERON
                             (coldly)
                          What should I congratulate you for?
                          The fucking scene or for fucking the
                          director?
          
          Nina stands there shaken, looking at him sadly.
          
                                     NINA
                          For fucking the director, honey.
                             (biting into apple)
                          Didn't you know that's how little
                          girls get into the movies?
          
          She leaves. Cameron lies there seething, then abruptly leaps up and
          storms into the bathroom. Sam sits rubbing his head, resumes
          typing. Cameron rages out of the bathroom, flings himself onto the
          bed. Unwinding the elastic bandage, he sprays ethyl chloride on his
          knee. Sam's typing stops.
          
                                     SAM
                             (quietly)
                          Young man, taking my life in my
                          hands, I must inform you that you
                          are an asshole.
          
          Cameron ignores Sam.

                          that I'm Eli's best friend. I know
                          quite a lot about him and Nina.

                          He met her three years ago. Two
                          lonely people rattling around New
                          York. A brutal winter. Eli's
                          marriage had just broken up...

                          ...All she had to do was tell me!

                          She could have done that in four
                          seconds. They went to bed once and
                          they were lousy as lovers. But they
                          had a problem. They liked each
                          other. They recognized some area of
                          mutual sensitivity. I'm boring you.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          You telling me he banged her once
                          three years ago?
          
                                     SAM'S VOICE
                             (disgusted)
                          I'm going to see if they can put me
                          up in the employees' toilet.
          
          He begins to type again, then philosophically...
          
                                     SAM'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                          I think he 'banged' her twice to
                          confirm the awful truth...Was she
                          supposed to be a virgin?
          
                                    CAMERON
                          Yeah...
          
          But he says this so sadly and looks so miserable that Sam knows he
          has reached him and it touched.

                                    I had a virgin once. Had to go to
                                    Guatemala for it. She was blind in
                                    one eye and had a stuffed alligator
                                    that said, "Welcome to Miami Beach!"
          
                Cameron sits there feeling dumb and full of regrets. Then he gets
                up, goes to Sam's closet and begins rummaging through the clothes.
                Sam watches him curiously.

                                    pounds and changes his name to

                The pleasant SEAFOOD RESTAURANT is on the pier over the water.
                Cameron, now wearing Sam's sweater after all, is searching about the
                crowded room trying to find Nina and what might be her family. He
                is about to leave when he sees a group at a window table, a MAN and
                WOMAN in their early fifties and a FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD GIRL,
                attractive despite the baby fat. Something about the composite of
                all their features is familiar enough to give them a second look.
                In doing so, he sees a half-eaten BIRTHDAY CAKE on their table, in
                front of an empty place. He goes to the table.

                                I was sort of invited to a birthday
                                party and I can't seem to find
                                it...and this seems to be a birthday

                                very emotional for the ladies.
          
                At this moment Cameron can tell from their faces that they've seen
                Nina behind him. He turns.

                Nina has emerged from the ladies' room looking miserable and is
                walking toward them. At the shock of seeing Cameron, her hand flies
                to her mouth in such embarrassment and joy and confusion at the way
                she feels, that she starts back to the refuge of the ladies' room.
                Catching herself, she turns back to face him, her eyes now glowing
                with tears of happiness.

                He moves forward and kisses Nina. We now realize we are at her
                HOTEL ROOM DOOR. She on the inside, he on the outside, kissing
                through the doorway, which stands slightly ajar. With their mouths
                barely parting:

                                 A season pass.

                                    (smiling)
                                 Good night.
          
                Closing the door.
          143   INT.   HOTEL BAR - LATE NIGHT
          
                On HENRY (the ASSISTANT CAMERAMAN who Eli screamed at), his luggage
                beside him, his elbows, empties, loose change scattered before him
                on the bar top.
          
                                            HENRY
                                    (looking up)
                                 Lucky...hey Lucky, come over here!
          
                                       - 94 -
          
          
          ANGLE shifts to include Cameron a few stools down.    He looks up from
          his beer and crosses to henry.
          
                                     HENRY (CONT'D)
                          Guess who tole 'em to take their job
                          and stuff it?
          
                                     CAMERON
                          Ya quittin'?
          
                                     HENRY
                          Fuckin' A. Gettin' out tonight.
                          But not without splittin' a Schlitz
                          with the one guy, 'cept me, who
                          wouldn't take shit from that
                          screwball.
          
          As the BARTENDER is taking away the empties, Henry puts his finger
          down on a DIME.
          
                                     HENRY (CONT'D)
                          Change is for you, except that.
                          That's a very special dime.
                             (holds it up for Cameron
                              to see)
                          Know what this is? Ask me!
          
                                     CAMERON
                          It's a dime...am I close?
          
                                     HENRY
                          It's Eli Cross' ass. People think
                          'cause you're easygoin' they can
                          walk all over you. Bull-shit...I'm
                          blowin' the whistle with this dime
                          in that phone...killin' a man and
                          hiding it from the police...are you
                          kiddin'...? Who is he think he is?
          
          Cameron pales, knowing that drunken Henry's desire for revenge can
          expose him to the police. He grabs the dime from Henry's fingers
          and drops it into a PEANUT VENDING MACHINE.
          
                                     HENRY
                          What the hell you doin'?
          
          Cameron stuffs the bag of peanuts in Henry's shirt pocket, grabs his
          suitcase and hustles him out of the bar toward the FRONT DOOR.
          
                                    CAMERON
          
                                       - 95 -
          
          
                          I'm putting you in a cab for your
                          own good and sending you to the
                          airport. He's mine, Henry, all
                          mine. Just leave that son-of-a-
                          bitch to me!
          
          They have reached the HOTEL DOORWAY.   By now, Henry is convinced
          Cameron means business. He stops.
          
                                     HENRY
                          Do whatever you wanna do, but I
                          better do it with ya! You'll need
                          help 'cause that goddamn looney is
                          dangerous.
          
                                     CAMERON
                             (blustering)
                          Not to me, he ain't. I'm going to
                          the cops. You gotta earn your
                          living in pictures, but I don't give
                          a shit. He can't hurt me.
          
                                     HENRY
                          Don't be too sure. Damned psycho
                          nearly strangled me! Don't believe
                          me? Wanna see marks...?
                             (tears open shirt collar
                              to show bruises)
                          ...Lucky to be alive!
          
                                     CAMERON
                             (confused)
                          Henry, what are you talking about?
                          I watched that whole thing today, he
                          didn't even touch you.
          
                                                - 96 -
          
          
                                              HENRY
                                   Not today. When Burt went into the
                                   water.
                                      (Cameron is wide-eyed)
                                   I could tell from up there in the
                                   chopper something' was wrong. So, I
                                   stopped shootin' and that crazy man
                                   gets me by the throat and starts
                                   screamin' to roll the film...I mean
                                   that guy's down there dying and he's
                                   screamin', "Keep shooting! Keep
                                   shooting!" Then, he starts fighting
                                   me for the switch and it falls
                                   down...like a crazy house up there,
                                   with him thrashin' on the floor...He
                                   didn't care about Burt. All he
                                   cared about was to get that man
                                   dyin' on film! Sickest thing I ever
                                   seen!
          
                As Henry's last words sink in, Cameron stands pale and shaken.
          
                                              HENRY (CONT'D)
                                   I better grab that cab.
          
                Henry takes the suitcase from Cameron's numb hand and pushes through
                the door, looks back for a parting shot.
          
                                              HENRY (CONT'D)
                                   You tell 'em everything...don't
                                   mince words...
          
                As he goes towards cab, some MERRYMAKERS push their way into the
                lobby.
          144   CLOSE ON CAMERON
          
                Staring ahead, Henry's words echo like his own death warrant. The
                merrymakers jostle past him, discussing suntan ointments. Cameron
                turns and walks across the HOTEL LOBBY and UP the STAIRS...his pace
                increasing until he is taking them three at a time.
          
          145   CLOSE ON DOOR LOCK
          
                Cameron's hand thrusts KEY into the hole, flings open the DOOR TO
                NINA'S BEDROOM and barges in.
          
                                              CAMERON
                                      (overwrought)
                                   Nina...your crazy Eli...
          
                                               - 97 -
          
          
                 He FREEZES. Over his shoulder, we see Nina, naked, lying on the
                 bed. Raymond, also naked, sits slumped on the edge of the bed,
                 utterly disconsolate. The three stare at each other, an absurd
                 tableau. Cameron whirls and leaves, slamming the door behind him,
                 almost off its hinges.
          
          146    INT.   HOTEL LOBBY
          
                 He comes down the steps like a madman. Raging, Cameron stomps
                 across the lobby toward the glass doors that will take him out of
                 Eli's grotesque wonderland. He collides with a group of returning
                 night FISHERMEN still in their slickers, carrying their equipment,
                 their catch wrapped in newspapers. For a moment he is tangled in
                 their tackle, FISH TUMBLING AND SLIDING along the marble floor.
          
                                             FISHERMAN
                                  Jesus...don't step on 'em.
          
                 Cameron stares at them, whirls and rushes back across the lobby and
                 up the stairs.
          
          147    INT.   NINA'S BEDROOM
          
                 As Cameron bursts in.   She stands in her robe in the center of the
                 room, glaring at him.
          
                                             NINA
                                     (screaming)
                                  Get out of here!
          
                 Hearing WATER running in the bathtub, he dashes in, but finds the
                 bathroom empty. He moves to the closet and slides the door so
                 violently that it almost falls off: No Raymond.
          
                                             NINA (CONT'D)
                                  Get out!!!
                                     (raging)
                                  I'll have you thrown out!
          
                 She crosses to the phone.
          
                                             CAMERON
                                  Is there anybody in this whole
                                  company you haven't screwed?
          
          147A   In the HALLWAY, a little group of PASSING TOURISTS turn in
                 wonderment at the tumult through the open doorway. Nina leaves the
                 phone, crosses to the door and kicks it shut in the people's faces
                 with all her strength.

                          You stupid, ignorant bastard! How
                          dare you storm in here like you won
                          me in a raffle?!
          
          Cameron, realizing for the first time that instead of being ashamed
          or frightened, she is livid with rage?
          
                                     CAMERON
                             (coldly)

                          I am not your girl! I am that man's
                          girl! That man and I have been
                          lovers for six months! I've known
                          you two days!

                             (ironically)
                          Then gee, ma'am, I sure hope you
                          didn't tell him about all that
                          ballin' last night.
          
                                     NINA
                          Don't you dare be clever with me!
                          He came scratching at the door
                          tonight like a beaten dog, begging
                          me to say that you were some twenty-
                          four hour nonsense.
                             (against her will she
                              starts to cry)
                          ...and I had to tell him I thought I
                          was falling in love with...
          
                                     CAMERON
                             (not giving an inch)
                          You couldn'a said that with your
                          clothes on?!
          
          Nina lets out an incoherent roar of rage.
          
                                     NINA
                          Goddamn you! The wounded stud! He
                          is entitled to some dignity! To
                          lose his "pure and faithful lover"

                 Dailies are in progress. Eli watches, surrounded by a few crew
                 members. Cameron sits in the back row with Nina's MOTHER, FATHER
                 and SISTER. Nina is not present. On the PORTABLE SCREEN is a shot
                 of Nina as a wild, radiant eighteen-year old Austrian girl running
                 pell-mell along a willow-lined VILLAGE STREET, dodging children and
          148A   bicycles. She collides with an OLD MAN, her basket falls, its
                 contents scattering; his momentary anger vanishing as he is infected
                 with her joy of life. He helps her refill the basket and she
                 rewards him with a sausage and a kiss. The old man watches her
                 wistfully as she runs away.

                The room dims and the film starts. We see a slate board reading
                "150A Take 1." The clapper claps and the board is removed,
                revealing an ATTIC. Nina sprawled on her stomach, stark naked, atop
                Raymond's naked body, her breasts resting on his chest, her legs
                apart, interlocked with his. They look directly at the CAMERA
                awaiting their cue with the calm resignation of two people waiting
                for the Wilshire bus. The MAKEUP GIRL appears in the shot spraying
                Nina's back and ass with glycerin sweat from an aerosol can. She
                disappears as Eli's voice on the sound track calls, "ACTION." The

                and loss. She is reacting in anguish to something O.S. But, even

                earthquake, about to shatter. The sick, loathesome shame that fills
                her, brims over and the statue's blind eyes flow tears.

                As she falls apart before our eyes, and an O.S. VOICE on a PLAYBACK
                TAPE insinuates into our consciousness, echoing as though heard
                through many loudspeakers.

                Hands reach in and drape a sash around Nina's throat. From it
                dangles a SWASTIKA. For Nina, there is still no voice, no camera,
                only the obliterating shame for that image of her naked body burned
                into her father's memory. And yet, that shame is so similar to the
                shame she should be feeling as the woman in Eli's film at this
                mockery of her son's death.

                The THUNDEROUS SOUND of ten thousand voices shouting: "Sieg Heil!
                Sieg Heil!" has shattered Nina's isolation. She is now aware that
                her personal despair has been used to accomplish an acting trick,
                and it only adds to her degradation and sense of shame, ironically
                making her performance even more poignant. The crowd on the
                playback roars with fanatic zeal.

                On the projection screen we see a helicopter SHOT OF THE DUESENBERG

                beast who's just heard the trap slam shut behind him. His eyes dart
                around at the official-looking faces staring at the O.S. film. One
                face looks disturbingly familiar, but in the dark he can't place it.

                 He holds the booklet out to him and it is very hard for Cameron to
                 reach out and take it. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees the
                 FBI MEN leaving the building, heading off in another direction. He
                 stares at the booklet.

                Eli has been watching him thoughtfully.

          168   INT.   NINA'S BEDROOM
          
                Scattered about the room are suitcases, a wardrobe trunk, the almost
                completed packing for tomorrow's departure. Nina lies in bed
                staring into nothing, Cameron beside her. Each is talking aloud to
                himself, adrift in his private world, unaware they have lost contact
                with the other. The room is semi-dark, except for the nightstand
                light on Cameron's side, by which he studies the BOOKLET Eli gave
                him.

                          Okay, Chuck. I'll meet you in an
                          hour.
                             (he hangs up)
                          For me. Amazing how they keep
                          secrets around here.
          
          He walks over to the still-stricken Nina and tenderly embraces her.
          She leans against him, the trembling subsiding.

                          shooting...

          By now she is stalking about the room throwing things from one
          suitcase to another as Cameron silently watches her.

                Which stands alone like Moby Dick awaiting its victim. Chuck and
                Cameron appear from behind the car, stalking it like it were the
                Sunday Special on a used car lot, Chuck the "hearty" salesman,
                Cameron the reluctant customer.

                                 guys could build an Arabian out of a

                                             CAMERON
                                 Why not?   You built a stunt man out
                                 of one.
          
                                            CHUCK
                                 Stunt man? Three days and you've
                                 already grown those big brass balls?
                                 Jump up and down and let me hear 'em
                                 clang, and then do me a favor and
                                 leave 'em home for this gag.
                                    (yanks open the door)
                                 There's just enough room in that
                                 Duesenberg for a normal guy...who
                                 thinks!
                                    (Cameron slides in)
                                 Show me how long you can hold your
                                 breath.
          
                Cameron inhales deeply and Chuck clicks his stopwatch.

                          Now, look around. Whaddya see?...No
                          roll bar in the roof. That's
                          because the roof caving in really
                          looks gassy on film. You got your
                          protection in the back of the
                          seat...steel sheeting. If the roof
                          goes too far, you get your goddamn
                          head down quick! You listening to
                          me?!...Nod Your head.
                             (slapping Cameron on
                              back)
                          You got good lungs.
                             (buckles Cameron's
                              seatbelt)
                          You got no shoulder harness because
                          it would show on camera. So when
                          you hit the water, you brace
                          yourself against the steering wheel.
                          It's reinforced. You couldn't break
                          it loose with dynamite...you gettin'
                          light-headed yet?
          
          Cameron shakes his head, "No."
          
                                     CHUCK
                          Keep your hands off the doors...
                          You're leaving through the window.
                          You lower them slowly as you sink to
                          equalize the pressure. What are you
                          waitin' for? I'm not gonna be down
                          there holding your hand.
                             (Cameron lowering
                              windows)
                          Slower. When you hit bottom, the
                          windows are open and you're gonna
                          make like a minnow. But first, a
                          little fresh air wouldn't hurt. You
                          reach down under the seat and, what
                          do you know, a respirator...Make
                          like you're reaching for it.
                          There'll be one there tomorrow.
          
          Cameron reaches for the non-existent respirator.

                          No, keep your face forward, the
                          camera is behind you and it's still
                          running.

                 By this time, Cameron's breath is giving out and he's struggling to
                 hold it.
          
                                            CHUCK (CONT'D)
                                 You feel like your lungs are gonna
                                 burst? Good. That's the way you're
                                 supposed to act like you feel. The
                                 moment that water gets above your
                                 nose, you gotta look like you're
                                 drowning. Remember? Burt wasn't so
                                 good at that.
          
                 That knocks the wind out of Cameron.

                The POLICE STATION comes into view, seen through the window of the
                company car, which slows as it moves toward the curb. Eli, sitting
                on the front stoop, leans wearily against the stone lion. As he
                sees the car approach, he moves toward it quickly, opening the door
                almost before it stops.

                                Gabe, Nina...
          
                Eli pulls Gabe and Nina toward the police station, yelling back to
                Cameron and Chuck.

                Cameron watches them, confused, as they start up the steps toward
                the station house.

                                I hate this, damn it! Couldn't you
                                have done it without me?
          
                                           ELI
                                Let's say you owe it to him. Until
                                two or three days ago, I had a
                                pretty good actor on my hands. Next
                                time you take out the clippers, be a
                                little humane, make sure the guy's
                                got one to spare.

                                What did you want me to do? Take
                                him in the back room and unzip his
                                fly every time he fluffed a line?
                                What else can I do for your film?

                                inside and make sure you give the

                As the three enter. The station is old with a high sergeant's desk
                and wooden benches against the walls. Raymond, beyond tears,
                destroyed, sits among the other refuse of the night: derelicts,
                stoned kids, etc. On one bench is a SAILOR, with that adenoidal
                look that betrays the weakness he tries to hide with his "butch"
                arrogance. Jake, in the doorway of his office, savors the fact that
                he has finally nailed Eli Cross. Eli captures the setup in a
                glance...then, instant theater. He strides across the police
                station to Raymond, takes his head in his hands and kisses him smack
                on the mouth.

                Gabe has come up behind a PATROLMAN, grabs him by the hips and
                starts humping like a dog in heat. The policeman shrieks in dismay
                and tries to escape, but Gabe trots along as if they were locked.
          
                                           ELI

                                 Jake! Throw some water on him,
                                 quick! Only way to get 'em apart!
          
                Gabe is now distracted by the sight of the sailor, who is agape with
                growing disbelief. Gabe ogles him.
          
                                            GABE
                                 Yummy...look at the seafood! You're
                                 a humpy little number.
                                    (then to Raymond,
                                     stamping his foot)
                                 You nasty boy. You could've died of
                                 mercury poisoning.
          
                The sailor leaps to his feet in horror, screaming.
          
                                            SAILOR

                furiously, confronting Jake.

                                 I'm registering a complaint! Thirty-

                                 from your local virgins. The
                                 Chamber of Commerce didn't say
                                 anything about that in their
                                 brochure.
          
                                            JAKE
                                 You can stop clowning, Eli, I've got
                                 a sworn complaint from this
                                 sailor...
                                    (jabbing his finer in
                                     Raymond's O.S. direction)
                                 ...Your man over there touched his
                                 genitals.

                She is snuggled against him tenderly, her open mouth kissing his
                neck and cheek. Raymond, although aware of his desperate situation,
                is too sick with self-loathing to respond.
          175   ANGLE ON ELI AND JAKE
          
                                            ELI

                                 know your anal invert from a hole in
                                 the ground. Raymond makes bad
                                 jokes, but they're not illegal.
                                 Christ, you've seen us all on the
                                 set...clowning around.

                Cameron stands, peering in through the big front window, feeling
                once again betrayed. It's like watching TV with the sound shut off.
                From here, Nina and Raymond are very convincing. Chuck leans
                against a lamppost, smoking a cigarette, as the charade goes on.

                Eli pays no attention, knowing that he's got Jake.     He gestures
                toward Nina embracing Raymond.

                                 lady who's got an early call and
                                 would like to spend some time with
                                 her boyfriend before she makes
                                 "night-night." Now, can I please
                                 get 'em outta here before they
                                 really do something illegal...and in

                It's three o'clock in the morning. The corridors are empty as the
                elevator door swings open and Nina and Eli step out and move down
                the hallway, functioning on their last ounce of nervous energy.

                          I'm a nice person. I just wish I
                          had the strength to go to his room
                          and break his spine. On the last
                          day of filming the queen decides to
                          come out of the closet! Wouldn't
                          that have made a lovely headline?
                          You understand, of course, that the
                          film would've been destroyed. Doing
                          that to me...

                          goddamn much. Why's everybody on my
                          back? When's somebody gonna say,
                          "There, there Eli?" I'm really
                          surrounded by friends, allies and

          They have reached a turn in the corridor where each would go his
          separate way. They stop.

                Partly crated props and costumes, luggage belonging to the departing
                film crew is piled against the wall and on shelves. In the
                cavernous half-lit room, Cameron, once again the coiled, stealthy
                animal, moves through the shadows among the racks of suitcases,
                pulling them aside, searching. Discovering one, he sets it on the
                floor. It's locked. With a metal bar, he breaks the lock and
                eagerly rifles the contents. Then, sensing a presence, he turns.
                There stands Nina at the base of the steps watching him. With only
                a glance to her, he goes on with his search.

                Cameron stuffs the wallet in his pocket, moving along the row of
                suitcases. He pulls out a duffel bag, unzips it, shaking the

                 contents on the floor. Now with the open bag on his arm, he goes
                 along the row of costumes and props like a man in the supermarket,
                 stuffing in things he will need: a pair of hiking boots, a couple
                 of work shirts, a heavy jacket. Passing a shelf of bayonets, he
                 picks one out and throws it in the bag.

                                 looked real nice at me, and said you

                                 he only gave me twenty years. No

                                 was in that prison -- nineteen
                                 months -- and then I was gone! I
                                 was gone!

          179D   Suddenly the ice turns to steam. His self-control shatters like
                 glass. There in the basement of a 100-year old hotel, before an
                 audience of one, Cameron ERUPTS, spewing out the memory of his
                 mortification and crucifixion...not without the silent resignation
                 of Jesus, but with the howling rage of a mad dog...Pluto with the

          Cameron starts running across the room and just as he's about to
          hurl it, he COLLIDES with a jutting shelf, which knocks him flat on
          his back. The shelf falls and thirty or forty one-gallon PAINT CANS
          cascade on top of him. It looks disastrous. Nina runs to him,
          terrified, but before the last can has even come to rest, Cameron
          emerges from the pile of cans, throwing them aside, still thrashing
          and screaming as he struggles to his feet.
          
          At the sight of him, Nina starts laughing. But Cameron, who has
          somehow managed to keep his grip on the laundry basket, raises it
          over his head as if nothing has happened, hurls the clothes bin,
          screaming:

                          STRAWBERRY SNATCH!
          
          With the effort, Cameron's feet fly out from under him as if he had
          stepped in oil. In fact, he has stepped in paint, and lands flat on
          his ass in the green goo. Nina "bracks" out an uncontrollable
          guffaw.

          But, as she reaches him, her feet too are caught in the paint and
          she slides forward like an ice skater, spraddling him, landing on
          her ass. His rage vanishes as he points at her, breaking into a
          fiendish, uncontrollable cackle. These pratfalls are a catharsis
          that has released the pressure and the madness. They attempt to
          gain their feet, skidding and sliding in the paint. He succeeds,
          but Nina fails.

                          freaked out of my head! And,
                          suddenly there's this big flashlight
                          shining in my face. I just grabbed
                          that goddamn ice cream bucket and
                          slopped it...right over the guy's
                          head!
          
          Although Cameron's got nothing in his hands, he pantomimes swinging
          that fifty-pound ice cream bucket around in the air, losing his
          balance and landing on his back in the paint beside Nina. Her
          hysteria is renewed, but Cameron stops laughing.

          179H   Then, Cameron, realizing the absurdity, starts giggling too. Out of
                 control, Nina scrambles to her feet and dashes for the ladies room.
                 Cameron follows her to the door, still talking as it closes behind
                 her.

                                  I'll tell ya, it's a bad year to
                                  mess with cops. You get the FBI

                 Abruptly, Cameron's energy is gone. The hilarity is over.   He leans
                 his forehead against the door in exhaustion and despair.

                 The DUESENBERG STANDS silhouetted in the darkness, light glinting
                 dimly off it like the gleam from fine wood of a splendid coffin
                 waiting in the slumber room before services begin. Behind it, a
                 side door of the garage opens. But it is not visitors coming to pay
                 their last respects, it is Cameron and Nina. He is wearing Burt's
                 clothes.
          
                 Nina moves quickly to a WHITE CONVERTIBLE as Cameron crosses to the
                 big overhead garage doors and hits the electric SWITCH. NOTHING
                 HAPPENS. He flips another switch and harsh overhead lights
                 illuminate the reality of the garage. Nina has started the
                 convertible, as Cameron tries to lift the garage door handles.

                 Nina gasps. Cameron whirls towards the voice. A COP with a big
                 flashlight stands in the open doorway peering in at them.

          181   EXT.   THE OLD ABANDONED ROAD - EARLY MORNING
          
                In the stillness, as the morning sun crests the trees, their shadows
                move like a parting curtain, leaving sunlight to warm the old stones
                of the abandoned road. The ancient bridge spans the black river,
                idling toward the sea. It is a perfect day, tranquil except for the
                faint distant "rumbling" intruding into our consciousness. As it
                grows louder and LOUDER, a flock of birds is frightened from the
                trees, a rusty beer can by the roadside begins to tremble and roll
                from the vibration.
          
                Rounding the bend of the road into view are a half-dozen kids on
                bicycles, peddling furiously, laughing and yelling and looking back
                at what now appears behind them: the first vehicle of an incredible
                carnival parade -- or is it a funeral procession? Long, short,
                tall, fat vehicles; the stretch-out car, the cab towing portable
                toilets, the tractor pulling a generator rig, the Cortez Camper
                dressing rooms, the stake-bed loaded with reflectors rattling like
                radar screens, panel trucks with studio emblems, a vintage German
                army truck filled with soldiers, patrol cars and motorcycles, the
                huge, bright yellow construction crane on its Caterpillar treads,
                its pneumatic snout jutting forward thirty yards like a morning
                hard-on sniffing around for some tunnel to hump -- a few technicians
                straddle it having their morning Danish and coffee. In the midst of
                these, on a low-slung flatbed trailer rides the Duesenberg -- the
                coffin on its caisson.
          
                The caravan grinds, hisses, wheezes to a halt and the A.D., astride
                the hood of the first vehicle, dismounts and raises his electric
                bullhorn to begin what will be an incessant squawking of
                instructions, reprimands, coaxings and complaints.

                                is over. Another fifteen minutes
                                and we start losing sun. Come on,
                                let's get the equipment off those
                                trucks.
          
                The Second A.D.'s run around like sheepdogs herding the laborers,
                snapping at their flanks, barking their instructions over electric
                horns.

                                want the Duesenberg?
          
                Grips and laborers are carrying the big reflectors through the brush
                into the hills.

                                hang a platform under the bridge
                                with the speed camera?

          183   ANGLE ON THE DUESENBERG
          
                Being rolled up to a mark in the center of the road. Crewmen swarm;
                in and under it, tuning, polishing, testing, installing camera,
                sound, electrical equipment, as Chuck hovers over them.

                                bend...
          
                As motors rev, the two sheepdogs squawk: "Out of sight..." "Behind
                the bend...," then are lost in the rising dust of their herd.
          184   ANOTHER ANGLE
          
                Cables are being strung out of sight along the side of the road,
                snapped into junction boxes that spread their electrified tentacles,
                strangling the landscape.

                                off the boom and into the bushes.
                                Come on, people, let's think! We're
                                losing the sun!
          185   ANOTHER ANGLE FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD
          
                Gabe, Chuck, the A.D. and a Technician move down the road toward us,
                shoulder to shoulder, halting on the bridge. Chuck and Gabe move to
                the stone railing. Chuck taps on it, producing a hollow sound.
                Gabe, examining a corner of this false section...

                                section. It looks phony as hell.
          
                The A.D. has been drawing a chalk line across the road.

                Behind it, the last of the equipment trucks is being jack-knifed out
                of sight. A row of reflectors stand like sentinels on the hill,
                bathing the Duesenberg in light. Workmen swarm about it like ants
                on the queen's birthday.

                                to see it again. So, once the

                As Cameron moves toward it uncertainly. Eli, some distance away,
                surrounded by members of his crew, glances up.

                Cameron walks around it, testing and checking, but moving
                relentlessly toward the humpback trunk. A horn honks and a police
                car slides up. Jake leans out the window, waves at Cameron
                jovially.
          
                                           JAKE
                                How do you guys get accident
                                insurance? Must cost you an arm and

                He drives on toward a parked German army truck, in which lounge
                several soldiers. Chuck approaches Cameron.

                                 They'll be shooting at you and
                                 that's what's supposed to make you
                                 go into the river.
          
          190A   They've reached the truck where Jake stands proudly. The Property
                 Man is handing out rifles and boxes of bullets to the German
                 soldiers, whom we now recognize as police officers from the town.
                 One cop, tying his shoe, lifts his head and grins at Cameron like an
                 old buddy -- the officer from the garage last night.

                                 company the last six weeks?

                 If Cameron was upset by the change in the stunt, he is now really
                 unnerved by the sight of those cops with guns. The second cop is
                 loading cartridges.

          191   ANGLE ON DUESENBERG'S TRUNK
          
                As Cameron arrives and casually leans against the trunk and then
                gently taps. He must get Nina out of there. With determination, he
                reaches for the trunk handle. Arms wearing the same costume as his
                own reach in, holding the trunk closed. It is Raymond.
          
                                               RAYMOND

                                    doesn't...then it doesn't really
                                    matter...does it?
          
                How can he know?     -- Everything is out of control -- a voice calls.

                He turns and moves numbly to the car door.

                                    that red light out of the corner of

                A tiny red light is mounted in the corner over the windshield.

          The technician tightens a final screw on the red light then, leaning
          back out of the car, yells O.S.

                          Does it work?
          
          Cameron, barely hearing, looks straight ahead without response.
          Jake lounges at the driver's window, kibitzing the operation.

                          What?
          
          The words "CAMERA ON" sound exactly like "CAMERON." It sounded as
          though his real name was called and he automatically answered. Has
          his identity been exposed? His eyes widen. The technician, getting
          no response, calls to Jake.

          He whirls to see Jake staring at him. His hand darts to the
          ignition key, the engine roars to life.

          Cameron realizes his error, but it's too late, he's in a panic. In
          his mind, he's given himself away. The road ahead is clear -- GO!
          He jams the car in gear and slams the accelerator to the floor. The
          Duesenberg leaps forward, screeching wildly. In its wake -- chaos.
          Everyone running, yelling...

                At their master's voice, they leap.

                Speed. The needle hits sixty-five -- seventy -- climbing fast.
                Cameron grips the wheel, looking at that empty road. An involuntary
                shout swells up and escapes his mouth.

                                        trunk)
                                    Hang on to everything, baby, we're
                                    on our way! You okay?
          
                The needle hits eighty -- eighty-five. Ahead, the bridge is rushing
                toward us. Now the arches of the stone railing are strobing past.
                Through them, he sees the black river which he has escaped.
                Triumphantly, his hand rises, middle finger extended. Suddenly the
                red camera light goes on, the underwater camera behind him begins
                whirring. He moves his finger behind him for a perfect close-up,
                (recalling that moment in the tower):

                The center of the bridge is an instant away, an approaching blur.

                Crouching -- tensely watching the chalk line on the road as the

                Blam! The whole front wheel of the car is blown off by an explosive
                charge.

                The Duesenberg drops on one axle. Metal screams against stone, as
                though it were Cameron himself, screaming. Skidding, spinning,
                tearing through the papier-mache railing, plunging out of control
                into space, where it hovers for a brief instant and arcs downward
                like a dying bird.
          197   INT.   DUESENBERG - CLOSE ON CAMERON
          
                A cry of such anguish and despair.

          198   INT.   DUESENBERG - WIDE ANGLE PAST CAMERON THROUGH WINDSHIELD
          
                The river rushes up and the car smashes into it with a deafening,
                shattering roar, plunging beneath the surface to a dark and
                soundless world -- except for a tiny red light, the whir of a camera
                and Cameron's desperate cries. Tearing his seatbelt off he flings
                himself toward the rear of the car, clawing at the back seat to
                reach Nina. Incredibly, there is sunlight again as the car is
                buoyed to the surface. There, again, is the living world - the
                road, the trees. In that brief instant, through the rear window,
                Cameron has a wild, tilted glimpse of a pink pinafore -- Nina,
                standing by the rail looking down, Eli beside her. The car noses
                downward, water rising swiftly over the rear window. The last image
                on Cameron's retina is that wild, eager, little-girl excitement on
                Nina's face. Then he's alone again, entombed in the darkening water
                as the car plunges toward the bottom.
          
                Cameron sits, immobilized at the realization that his betrayal is
                total. Everyone, even Nina, has conspired to bring him to this --
                red light glowing, camera whirring, to capture the moment of his
                death.

                Outrage galvanizes him to action. He reaches for the door handles,
                to rip them open -- they snap off in his hands. Now there is a
                rumbling and rending of metal as the roof begins to implode,
                crushing down toward him. Under the immense pressure, the rear
                window bursts inward, the river rushing in a wild torrent. The
                memory of Chuck's voice..."the windows." He lowers the front window
                slowly. The water now pours in faster. The level has risen to his
                chin. He gasps a final breath and the water rises over his head.
                Still the red light burns. He reaches beneath the seat for the
                oxygen cylinder and tries to pull it loose. It won't move. The
                impact of the car hitting the water has bent the seat frame. His
                groping hand finds the hose, the oxygen mask. A hope. Though every
                second is robbing his chance for life, his movements under water are
                as in slow motion. Pulling the mask to his face, he takes an eager
                breath and chokes as water fills his mouth. The rubber tube has
                broken loose from the cylinder and is floating free -- as it must
                have with Burt. Pressure of the onrushing water has stopped as the
                water reaches the roof. For a moment there is a strange stillness
                which Cameron, his lungs bursting, swims through, out the window and
                toward the surface.

                Moving upward through river slime, in a world that grows lighter, in
                a desperate race to reach air.
          
                Daylight! Gasping, half unconscious, barely able to move his arms
                to stay afloat. Adrift in the current, he touches land, clawing at
                the rocks and pulling himself onto the shore. His muscles, still
                moving by motor reflex, driven by survival instinct, take him
                crawling from the river bank through the tall grass -- still the
                fugitive, the "man on the run." Then, he lifts his head and stops
                at what he sees before him:
          
          200   POV
          
                Fanned out across the field is a row of men, guns held ready.
                Policemen from the truck in their German uniforms moving forward
                slowly -- carefully searching the terrain in an arch which, as it
                closes, must irrevocably reach Cameron.
          201   ANOTHER ANGLE
          
                It's over. Without strength or will, he lies waiting for them as
                though his eyes were made of glass. They see him now, but their
                pace doesn't change. As they take the last few steps toward him, he
                sees their shoulders, waists, knees and then only a circle of feet
                around him.
          
                Their hands roughly grab him, pulling him to his feet, shoving him
                brutally about. Angry cop faced growling: "Kill the son-of-a-

                bitch," "Shoot 'im," "Cut it," "Hang 'im," and then loudly, "Cut
                it!" He feels a blow on the back, then another. They seem too
                gentle. Why is that cop smiling? Some of them are walking away.
                Where are the handcuffs? Why is he shaking my hand instead? Then
                the jumble of voices is becoming clearer..."No matter what they pay
                you, make 'em give you a raise!"..."Fantastic, my wife thinks being
                a cop is dangerous -- you guys are terrific!" It finally sinks in,
                the insane, absurd, devastating, humiliating realization that it was
                all just another scene in a movie that came off as planned.
          
                He is alive and free. Is that gurgle we hear in Cameron's throat
                the water that he swallowed or an unseemly giggle? Then it chokes
                into laughter.

                Here comes Chuck, running across the field with his silly stunt bag
                filled with elastic bandages. How funny. Here's the helicopter
                hovering with Gabe descending the rope ladder bearing film for Eli,
                who runs to meet him. How hilarious. There's the pink
                pinafore...Nina holding the skirt up to her waist as she wades
                through the tall grass towards him. How sweetly absurd.
          
                                              A.D.
                                   All right, come on...let's get the
                                   stuff in the trucks, we're losing
                                   sun!
          203   ANGLE ON CAMERON
          
                Chuck has reached Cameron, throwing a blanket over him.   He pulls a
                pint from his back pocket.
          
                                              CHUCK
                                   Take a belt. Don't be stingy.
          
                As Cameron tilts his head back, the bottle to his mouth, he sees
                skin divers setting down their rescue equipment and stripping out of
                their dripping wet-suits.

                Chuck, who is rubbing Cameron violently through the blanket to
                restore his circulation, replies with the highest compliment he can
                pay?
          
                                              CHUCK

                                   too loud.

                Nina has reached an impasse twenty yards away in her journey of love
                toward Cameron -- a muddy section of swamp.

                                I can't come any further. What
                                should I do? I'll get the dress all
                                muddy and I need it for the next

                                When Eli told me you'd   changed your
                                mind and decided to do   the stunt, at
                                first I didn't believe   him, but I
                                guess you really did.    I tried to
                                find you.
          
                Eli is standing nearby listening to this macabre exchange between
                lovers.

                                Lucky, were you wonderful...I guess
                                I have to go now. See you after.
          
                She awkwardly turns, her dress still held high and yells back over
                her shoulder...

                                I'm sorry I was so nutty last night.
                                I always get crazy at the end of a
                                film.
          
                Nina continues picking her way toward the road.   And then...
          
          205   CLOSE ON NINA
          
                Suddenly she turns, running headlong, pell-mell across the swamp and
                through the mud holes, drenching her pink pinafore into a muddy rag,
                losing a shoe, ripping her hose -- and then wildly into the arms of
                Cameron, smearing him with love and mud! And then, just as quickly,
                she is gone, racing back across the field, hopping like a rabbit
                without her shoe, toward the road.
          
          206   ANOTHER ANGLE
          
                Cameron is brimming with pleasure.    Chuck, totally ignored, picks up
                his stunt bag.
          
                                           CHUCK
                                   (dryly)
                                Lover, I think your circulation's
                                back to normal. And please, next
                                time will ya listen for the cue --
                                the word is "action."
          
                He walks off, leaving Cameron draped in the blanket like an Indian.
                Eli steps up to him looking very serious, lifts his hand in the
                Indian sign of greeting and says:
          
                                           ELI
                                "How!" I have always had a great
                                compassion for your people. Long
                                before it was popular, I felt a
                                repugnance for General Custer.
          
                Cameron stares at him, incredulous.

                                right. I hope this doesn't screw up

                          film. When they previewed it in his
                          hometown, army enlistment went up
                          six hundred percent. I'm making
                          this film trying to convince the
                          whole world that maybe there's a
                          better way to get home for
                          Thanksgiving...and I can't even
                          convince one dumb kid with a
                          tattoo...I couldn't have you run
                          around paranoid the rest of your
                          life thinking I was trying to kill

                                     ELI
                             (to Cameron)

                          Rewrite the battle scene and let the
                          tank run him over! The stunt pays
                          six-fifty!
          
          The helicopter takes off, zooms under the bridge, up into a
          hammerhead and soars back, while Cameron continues to scream at it.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          Come back here. I'm tired of being
                          your goddamn clown! Pay me my
                          thousand bucks!
          
          Eli's voice on the helicopter's P.A. speaker echoes through the
          canyon, as the chopper cavorts overhead and skims away.

                                                        1944 SHOOTING DRAFT


                

               EXT. GARDEN CITY STATION - DAY

               CLOSE SHOT -- station signboard. It reads:

                                      "GARDEN CITY"

               CAMERA PANS to show the dusty platform of a typical small 
               Arizona town of the late nineties.

               CAMERA TRUCKS ALONG platform PAST a line of sleeping figures, 
               consisting of a couple of drunks, an Indian, two Mexicans 
               and a mongrel dog.

               CAMERA STOPS on the window of the ticket office. Inside the 
               office can be glimpsed the Station Agent dozing in a chair 
               with his feet up against the grill of the ticket window. The 
               clicking of the signal indicator is heard. The agent opens 
               his eyes, flips up the indicator and begins to get to his 
               feet sleepily.

               MED. SHOT

               line of sleeping figures, with dog in f.g. The sound of a 
               distant train whistle is heard o.s. The dog, which up to now 
               might have been dead, opens one eye and looks past camera.

               LONG SHOT

               railway track with the three-car train approaching.

               MED. SHOT

               line of sleeping figures. The dog jumps up barking furiously 
               and runs out of shot past camera. The sleeping figures come 
               to life and look toward camera. At the same time, the door 
               of the ticket office opens and the agent appears.

               FULL SHOT

               railway track. The train is now almost at the station.

               EXT. PLATFORM - DAY

               FULL SHOT -- with the line of men now standing on the edge 
               of the platform looking toward camera. Train steams slowly 
               in past camera, and stops, with a tall, wide-shouldered man 
               of about 28 (Rocklin), dressed in new store clothes, cowboots 
               and a broad-brimmed white hat, in f. g. standing on steps of 
               day coach with a small valise and saddle in his hands. Behind 
               Rocklin a conductor.

               MED. SHOT

               baggage car. The baggageman is standing at the open door of 
               the car with two sacks of mail. He drops them to the platform 
               and waves to the conductor o.s. and begins to close the doors 
               of the baggage car.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               on Station Agent and conductors. The latter signals the 
               engineer. The train whistle sounds again o.s. and the shadow 
               of the moving train begins to pass across the Station Agent's 
               face.

               TRUCKING SHOT

               As Rocklin comes along the platform carrying the valise in 
               one hand and balancing the saddle on his shoulder with the 
               other, a man behind him picks up the two mail sacks and exits 
               from scene. The station bums look at Rocklin curiously. His 
               expression giving no encouragement, they slink back out of 
               the sun and begin to settle down in their old places again. 
               At the ticket office, Rocklin pauses and looks around 
               uncertainly.

                                     STATION AGENT
                              (at office door)
                         Expectin' someone?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (after a second's 
                              pause)
                         I guess not. Where's the stagecoach 
                         office?

                                     STATION AGENT
                              (pointing)
                         Back of the depot.

               EXT. GARDEN CITY STAGE DEPOT - DAY

               The stage is drawn up in front of the depot, over which is a 
               sign --

                                      RED ROCK STAGE

                                  J. Harolday Proprietor

               Rocklin, making his way along the walk, almost reaches the 
               depot when his attention is arrested by the sight of Dave, 
               the stage driver, who has just rounded in front of the lead 
               horses. He pauses close to one horse's head. Rocklin sees 
               Dave take a bottle from his person, uncork it as he glances 
               around, and raise it to drink. The bottle is almost to Dave's 
               lips when the horse shies, swinging its head. The bottle is 
               knocked from the old fellow's hands and smashes on the ground. 
               Now Rocklin witnesses a scene of intense fury, which he finds 
               amusing despite its seriousness. Old Dave rants and snorts -- 
               beats his thighs, his heads, flings his arms wildly and 
               exhibits his utter disgust generally.

                                     DAVE
                              (to horse)
                         Consarn you, Blossom -- lookit that -- 
                         jus' lookit what you done --
                              (some more pantomime)
                         I'm tellin' you, Blossom that --
                              (indicating broken 
                              bottle)
                         -- makes you the most aggravatin' 
                         female as ever I had a despise fer -- 
                         I've got a good notion to pizen you -- 
                         an' what's more --

               He stops talking abruptly because his hand has, quite by 
               chance, felt the spare bottle he carries, which he has 
               forgotten in his anger. A most satisfying smile lights his 
               bewhiskered face as he brings the bottle into view. He uncorks 
               it, and stepping a few paces from the horse, raises the 
               bottle.

                                     DAVE
                              (to Blossom)
                         Heh-heh -- fooled you, didn't I? --
                              (chuckles)
                         Fooled myself, too.

               ON ROCKLIN

               who has been watching Dave's performance. He smiles his 
               amusement and now proceeds toward the stage office.

               INT. GARDEN CITY STAGE DEPOT - DAY

               PAN SHOT. Rocklin enters and moves over to the counter, behind 
               which is the stage agent, a mild-looking man with pebble-
               lens glasses. During the scene, the character who picked up 
               the mail sacks from the platform, comes in, dumps the sacks 
               on the counter and leaves.

                                     STAGE AGENT
                              (to Rocklin)
                         Howdy.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (indicating stage)
                         That the stage for Santa Inez?

                                     STAGE AGENT
                              (nods)
                         Leaving any minute.

               Rocklin puts his saddle on the counter, and taking out a wad 
               of bills, drops them on the counter. The Stage Agent counts 
               out the fare.

                                     STAGE AGENT
                         Santa Inez -- seventeen-fifty --
                              (returning the balance)
                         Name?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Rocklin.

               The Stage Agent turns to make out the ticket. Rocklin takes 
               some tobacco and paper from his vest pocket as he glances 
               outside.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Mind if I ride alongside the driver?

                                     STAGE AGENT
                              (over his specs)
                         It's all right with me -- if it's 
                         all right with Dave -- He's mad -- 
                         His last trip -- Had a row with 
                         Harolday, the boss -- Old-timer, 
                         Dave -- an' a grumpy old cuss.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (soberly)
                         I like grumpy old cusses -- Hope to 
                         live long enough to be one.

                                     STAGE AGENT
                              (puzzled)
                         Yeah?

               He shakes his head and hands Rocklin the ticket, and moves 
               over to the door with one of the mail sacks in his hand.

               EXT. GARDEN CITY STAGE DEPOT - DAY

               The Stage Agent, carrying a mail sack, and Rocklin come from 
               the stage depot and reach the stage as Dave is in the act of 
               climbing up to the driver's seat.

                                     STAGE AGENT
                         Here's your mail, Dave --

               Dave looks over his shoulder at the Agent and steps to the 
               ground, as Rocklin climbs up to the driver's seat.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (as he steps up to 
                              the seat)
                         -- and a passenger.

               Dave glares at Rocklin climbing up to the seat, and he is 
               about to order him down when Rocklin, now seated, looks down 
               at him and asks rather wistfully --

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Mind if I ride up here?

               Dave does mind, but his better judgment tells him to step 
               carefully in his attitude toward this stranger, who does 
               things first, then asks permission. His only answer to Rocklin 
               is a characteristic grimace which is eloquent enough. And 
               now Dave turns on the Agent, who becomes the target of his 
               pent-up wrath.

                                     DAVE
                         Where's them wimmen?

                                     STAGE AGENT
                         Up at the hotel.

                                     DAVE
                              (yanking mail sack 
                              from Agent)
                         Why ain't they here? -- This is the 
                         stage depot, ain't it -- ?
                              (heaves sack into 
                              boot)
                         Ain't it?

                                     STAGE AGENT
                         You can pick 'em up there -- it's 
                         only up the street --

                                     DAVE
                         On'y up the street -- an' they cain't 
                         walk it -- What's the matter -- don't 
                         Easterners have laigs like other 
                         folks?

               Dave stalks around the rear of the coach. The Agent meantime 
               stretches himself up toward Rocklin.

                                     STAGE AGENT
                              (so Dave won't hear)
                         Hold tight when you git in the 
                         mountains, mister -- When he gits 
                         riled you can hear the passengers 
                         prayin' for miles.

               Dave has climbed to his seat, and now the coach lurches away, 
               leaving the Agent shaking his head dubiously.

               EXT. GARDEN CITY HOTEL - DAY

               From the porch of the hotel. We see the stage approaching as 
               the hotel handyman brings a trunk and a couple of bags from 
               the hotel to the street. The coach pulls up and stops.

                                     DAVE
                              (to handyman)
                         Whar's them wimmen? -- They waitin' 
                         for you to carry 'em out?

               Before the handyman can answer, Dave's attention is taken by 
               someone calling his name from across the street. Meantime, 
               an Indian squaw wobbles from the hotel with bow and arrow, 
               etc. Rocklin buys bow and arrow.

                                     SADDLER
                              (as he comes to Dave)
                         Dave -- Dave -- tell Arly Harolday 
                         her saddle ain't ready yet, will ya?

                                     DAVE
                              (getting to the ground)
                         I ain't tellin' that crazy female 
                         nothin' -- Last time I seen her she 
                         threatened to rip the hide off'n me 
                         and bat me dizzy with it.

               Dave goes to the rear of the coach.

                                     SADDLER
                              (looks up to Rocklin)
                         Mister -- will you tell the Agent at 
                         Santa Inez to tell Miss Harolday her 
                         saddle ain't ready yet?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (nods)
                         I'll say that.

               PORCH OF HOTEL

               Miss Martin steps out onto the porch followed by Clara and a 
               gentleman, presumably the hotel manager or clerk. The women 
               are obviously Easterners and are attired in the good taste 
               of the period. Miss Martin is a domineering woman, approaching 
               middle age. Her niece, Clara, is a well-bred, attractive 
               girl of twenty-one and completely under the influence of the 
               older woman.

                                     CLERK
                              (as group comes through 
                              door)
                         By next year, madam, we expect to 
                         have a bathtub on each floor.

               Miss Martin stops short and looks o.s.

               ON DAVE AT REAR OF THE COUCH

               having a time lifting the trunk up into the boot. Miss Martin 
               and the others come into the scene.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Now don't drop it --

               Dave pauses to see who is talking.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         At your age you'd best not be lifting 
                         things so heavy.

                                     DAVE
                              (grimaces)
                         Mebbe you're young enough to hoist 
                         her up your own self.
                              (tries to lift trunk 
                              again)

               CLOSE SHOT

               on Clara. She is looking rather timidly up at Rocklin.

               CLOSE SHOT

               on Rocklin. He is grinning appreciatively at old Dave. Now 
               he notices Clara and regards her soberly a moment.

               FULL SHOT

               Dave has heaved the trunk in place and is securing it.

               Miss Martin, about to enter the coach, notices Clara staring 
               up at Rocklin.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Clara!

               Clara snaps her attention from Rocklin to her aunt. The Clerk 
               steps to the side of the coach and opens the door. He assists 
               Clara inside -- and now Miss Martin.

               INT. COACH - DAY

               Miss Martin and Clara. Miss Martin is just sitting. She looks 
               coldly at Clara.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (in low voice)
                         Staring as though you'd never seen a 
                         man before.

               EXT. GARDEN CITY HOTEL - DAY

               Dave, Rocklin and Clerk. Dave is at the moment climbing to 
               his seat on the other side of the coach. The Clerk swings 
               the door closed and looks up to Rocklin and speaks more or 
               less confidentially.

                                     CLERK
                         Try to hold him down or he'll scare 
                         the women to death.

               ON ROCKLIN

               He is looking down at the Clerk and answers quite casually, 
               but loud enough to be heard by the women.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         I never feel sorry for anything that 
                         happens to a woman.

               INT. COACH - DAY

               THROUGH window of door -- Miss Martin and Clara. The women 
               have obviously overheard Rocklin's remark. Miss Martin smiles 
               vindictively at Clara, who flushes.

               CAMERA PULLS BACK to include the Clerk, who moves to the 
               coach door.

                                     CLERK
                         Well, I hope you have a nice trip, 
                         ladies.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         I hope we get there -- wouldn't 
                         surprise me if we didn't.

               EXT. GARDEN CITY HOTEL - DAY

               On Dave and Rocklin.

                                     DAVE
                              (mutters)
                         Wait till I get you on the road, you 
                         old buzzard, you'll be surprised all 
                         right.

               He takes up the reins and shouts the team away.

                                                               DISSOLVE OUT

               DISSOLVE IN

               EXT. ARIZONA COUNTRY - DAY

               EXTREME LONG SHOT -- with the stage hardly more than a black 
               dot below, its curl of rising dust in the midst of the whole 
               broad expanse. As the coach disappears from shot, the two 
               mounted men appear riding at an easy pace and continue in 
               the same direction as the coach.

               EXT. DRIVER'S SEAT OF COACH - DAY

               MED. CLOSE SHOT -- Dave and Rocklin, the latter staring 
               straight ahead. As they roll with the roll of the coach, 
               Dave steals a look at his companion.

                                     DAVE
                         I wonder why a young feller who don't 
                         have to wants to come into this God 
                         danged country?

               Rocklin ignores Dave's question and continues staring ahead. 
               Dave glances down toward the women.

                                     DAVE
                         Say -- did you mean what you said 
                         back there about wimmen?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (grimly)
                         Every word of it.

                                     DAVE
                              (chuckling)
                         Then you're smarter than most.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Maybe I seen more of 'em than most.

                                     DAVE
                              (looking at him 
                              admiringly)
                         Shouldn't be surprised. Shouldn't be 
                         a leetle bit surprised.
                              (reflectively)
                         All the same...

               He breaks off and chuckles again.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (unsmilingly)
                         All the same -- what?

               Dave doesn't reply, but lifting the pint of whiskey, jerks 
               out the cork with one movement of his thumbnail.

                                     DAVE
                              (offering bottle to 
                              Rocklin)
                         Take a slug.

               Rocklin drinks and gives the bottle back to Dave, who all 
               but empties it in one pull.

                                     DAVE
                              (holding up the bottle 
                              and squinting through 
                              it)
                         Whiskey and wimmen -- ever think how 
                         much alike they are? Both fool you, 
                         but you never figger out how to do 
                         without 'em.

               Rocklin makes no reply. Dave offers the bottle again.

                                     DAVE
                         Take another.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Not just yet.

                                     DAVE
                              (unoffended)
                         Well...
                              (putting the bottle 
                              to his lips)
                         Here's to her.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Who?

                                     DAVE
                         The next one that fools you.

               He empties the bottle and shies it away. At the same time, 
               the coach hits a particularly bad patch of road and there is 
               muffled exclamation from inside the coach. Dave leans over 
               and looks down o.s.

               INT. COACH - DAY

               MED. CLOSE SHOT -- Clara and Miss Martin. The former is 
               showing the effects of the rough ride, but the old lady is 
               hanging on grimly.

               EXT. DRIVER'S SEAT - DAY

               Dave straightens up, grinning.

                                     DAVE
                              (with relish)
                         Mighty rough stretch along here.

               He whips up the team, at the same time weaving a little 
               unsteadily in his seat.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Like me to speel you a while?

                                     DAVE
                         Nope. I've had a few snorts but that 
                         don't make no difference. Leas'ways, 
                         never has...
                              (after a second's 
                              pause)
                         Don't ever git wore out, and useless, 
                         like me.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Who're them as say you are?

                                     DAVE
                         Harolday, for one. Oh, I ain't belly-
                         aching. Reckon he's entitled to his 
                         opinion. But him and me never did 
                         see eye to eye.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         What's wrong?

                                     DAVE
                         It's constitootional, I reckon. Like 
                         that step-daughter of his is crazy -- 
                         he's too sane. Believes In law and 
                         order.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (grinning)
                         What's wrong with law and order?

                                     DAVE
                         Depends on who's a-dishin' it out. 
                         Never was good at takin' orders 
                         meself. As for the law -- well, you'll 
                         soon find out what that means 'round 
                         these parts.

               The coach hits a particularly bad bit of road and there is 
               an exclamation from inside. Dave grins and urges the team on 
               cheerfully.

                                                               DISSOLVE OUT

               DISSOLVE IN

               EXT. RIM - ARIZONA COUNTRY - DAY

               FULL SHOT -- as Dave pulls up the stage at the top of a long 
               downgrade and looks out appreciatively at the view. From 
               this crest of the rim, a vast expanse of country is visible.

               CLOSE SHOT

               stage. Miss Martin thrusts her head out of the window.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Driver? Driver, what's the matter?

                                     DAVE
                         Nothin'. Restin' hosses. Git out and 
                         stretch yore laigs if you want.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Resting horses? What for? I can see 
                         with my own eyes it's downhill.

               Dave brightens visibly at this challenge.

                                     DAVE
                         You in such an all-fired hurry, lady?

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Certainly, we are in a hurry.

                                     DAVE
                              (beaming)
                         Well -- we'll hurry some.

               His whip cracks like a rifle shot and the startled horses 
               literally jerk the heavy stage over the rim and down the 
               grade.

               LONG SHOT

               grade, with the stagecoach bounding and reeling down the 
               narrow road and around the sharp bends.

               CLOSE FULL SHOT

               Dave and Rocklin on stage as it thunders downhill. Dave is 
               leaning out and listening hopefully for the outcries from 
               within. None come. Rocklin is hanging on with both hands and 
               mildly amused.

               INT. STAGECOACH - DAY

               The two women are really being scrambled.

               EXT. STAGECOACH - ARIZONA COUNTRY - DAY

               CLOSE TWO SHOT -- Dave and Rocklin. Rocklin is as calm as if 
               he were walking. Dave is more and more pleased with himself. 
               He again leans out to listen.

               LONG SHOT

               grade, with coach approaching in b.g. In f.g. the road narrows 
               and makes a sharp turn at the very edge of a precipice. There 
               is no possible way of getting the coach safely around this 
               turn except at a walk.

               LONG SHOT

               road, from point of view of driver's seat, establishing the 
               same menace ahead.

               CLOSE TWO SHOT

               Dave and Rocklin, as Rocklin glances out of the corner of 
               his eyes as if wondering whether or not Dave is too drunk to 
               perceive the disaster. He makes no move, however, to advise 
               or interfere.

               FULL SHOT

               road; at danger corner, as stage comes in. At the very last 
               second, Dave pulls in the horses and negotiates the turn in 
               safety.

               CLOSE SHOT

               stage. Dave grins at Rocklin, then listens for the outcry he 
               expects from the women within. The old lady's head bobs out 
               of the window.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (fiercely)
                         Now what's the matter. Why are we 
                         stopping again?

               Old Dave's mouth drops open, and as Rocklin begins to grin 
               at his discomfiture.

               DISSOLVE

               EXT. STAN'S PLACE - DAY

               FULL SHOT of lonely adobe which serves as a combination 
               roadhouse, stage station and bar. As the coach rolls into 
               f.g., a little Mexican boy (Pablo) runs out to change the 
               horses.

                                     PABLO
                              (as Rocklin swings 
                              down)
                         Buenas noches, senor.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Buenas noches, amigo.

                                     PABLO
                              (grinning at the 
                              friendly tone)
                         Ha llegado anticipademente, senor.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Tuvimos suerte en haber llegado.

               He glances pointedly at Dave who is climbing down unsteadily 
               and Pablo bursts out laughing.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               on door of coach. As Dave comes into shot, Miss Martin's 
               head pops out of the window.

                                     DAVE
                              (gruffly)
                         We stop here.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Why do we stop here?

                                     DAVE
                         If you wanta eat and stretch yore 
                         laigs.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Will you please stop referring to my 
                         legs!

                                     DAVE
                         You got some, ain't you?

               He turns and lurches toward the roadhouse.

               INT. STAN'S PLACE - DAY

               FULL SHOT from doorway. It is a large barn-like room on one 
               side of which is a bar. On the other side is a fireplace and 
               a partition behind which is a rough dining table and benches. 
               Standing at the bar drinking with his back to the door is a 
               wizened little man, dressed in an odd assortment of ragged 
               garments of unrecognizable origin. On the counter is a 
               travelling prospector's pack, to which is strapped an 
               assortment of prospector's equipment, including a pick and 
               shovel. As Dave enters, the man (Zeke) turns around and 
               reveals a face even hairier than Dave's.

                                     ZEKE
                              (holding out his arms)
                         Dave!

                                     DAVE
                              (letting out a yell 
                              and rushing to Zeke)
                         Why, Zeke, you two-legged old coot!

               CLOSE SHOT

               Zeke and Dave as they beat one another on the back.

                                     DAVE
                         Whar you been all these months?

                                     ZEKE
                         Up in the hills workin' my way down 
                         the biggest hole you ever seed.

                                     DAVE
                         Good -- What's at the bottom of it?

                                     ZEKE
                         Nothin'!

                                     DAVE
                              (roaring with laughter)
                         What, again!!

               MED. SHOT

               Rocklin has entered and moved to the fire. Miss Martin and 
               Clara enter and stand in the doorway watching the scene at 
               the bar. A pale-faced, dyspeptic-looking man of about 45 
               (Stan) comes from the kitchen and approaches them 
               ingratiatingly.

                                     STAN
                         Good evening, ladies. How about 
                         something to eat?

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (with a dubious look 
                              toward the pair at 
                              the bar)
                         Well -- if it won't take too long.

                                     STAN
                              (leading the way toward 
                              the partition)
                         This way, ladies.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               bar. Dave has just fitted a cylindrical record of "She Was 
               Only a Bird in a Gilded Cage" to an old-type phonograph.

                                     DAVE
                         Yep -- this is my last trip.

                                     ZEKE
                         Why?

                                     DAVE
                         Old Harolday won't take back what he 
                         said.

                                     ZEKE
                         What'd he say?

                                     DAVE
                         "You're fired."

               They both yell with laughter and slap one another on the 
               back.

               MED. SHOT

               from fireplace. Rocklin is standing in f.g. looking down at 
               the fire and making the inevitable cigarette from his pocket 
               dip. Seated at the table are Clara and Miss Martin. From 
               o.s. comes the sound of Zeke and Dave singing to the 
               phonograph record. Miss Martin glares indignantly in the 
               direction of the bar, obviously about to make a protest. At 
               this moment Stan comes from the kitchen with a large dish in 
               his hand which he dumps on the table.

                                     STAN
                         There you are, folks. Dig in and 
                         help y'rselves.

               Miss Martin, sitting forward eagerly, suddenly sees the dish 
               of meat and freezes.

               CLOSE SHOT

               dish of meat. It is swimming in greasy brown gravy.

               MED. SHOT

               Miss Martin as she shudders dyspeptically and closes her 
               eyes.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               bar, as Stan comes from the table to Dave and Zeke.

                                     STAN
                         Supper, Dave?

                                     DAVE
                              (noisily)
                         I'm drinkin' mine. Set 'em up.

               MED. SHOT

               table. Clara has filled a plate with food, which she offers 
               to her aunt.

                                     CLARA
                         Auntie --

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         With my dyspepsia? Do you want to 
                         kill me?

               Clara hesitates for a second, then looks across to Rocklin.

                                     CLARA
                         Aren't you going to have any supper?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Reckon so.

               He comes to table and begins to help himself. There is a 
               loud burst of laughter from the bar.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Young man, that driver's had all the 
                         liquor he can take.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Has he?

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         You know he has. You're not a complete 
                         fool, are you?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Frequently.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (to Clara, furiously)
                         The rudeness of people in these parts 
                         is appalling!

               Clara looks apologetically at Rocklin, then away again 
               nervously. Suddenly, she sees something o.s. and drops her 
               knife and fork with a little start.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               window. A thin, unpleasant-looking face is seen through the 
               glass. The windowpane is defective and so distorts the lower 
               part of the face into a hideous smile. It is the younger of 
               the two men who were watching the coach outside the hotel.

               PANNING SHOT

               on kitchen door as Stan comes through with a dish of potatoes. 
               A man's voice is heard o.s. and he pulls up abruptly.

                                     BOB CLEWS' VOICE
                         Well, well -- smells like a mighty 
                         nice bit of veal.

               CAMERA HAS PANNED TO include the side door next to the window 
               and almost opposite to the dining table. The owner of the 
               face at the window (Bob Clews) is now standing in the doorway. 
               Behind him is the man with the sheriff's badge on his dirty 
               vest (Jackson). As they come forward toward Stan, the latter 
               shows obvious signs of nervousness.

                                     BOB CLEWS
                         Doin' yourself well these days, Stan.

                                     STAN
                         A friend of mine was by an' sold me 
                         a quarter of beef.

                                     JACKSON
                              (insinuatingly)
                         The same friend as sold you that 
                         hide Bob, here, found stashed in 
                         your barn yesterday?

                                     STAN
                         Hide -- What hide?

                                     BOB CLEWS
                         The one that might send you to the 
                         penitentiary.

                                     JACKSON
                              (smugly)
                         What did you do with it, Stan?

                                     STAN
                         I never had no hide stashed --

                                     BOB CLEWS
                              (harshly)
                         I saw it yesterday under the hay.

                                     STAN
                         Then it must still be there.

                                     JACKSON
                         No it ain't -- we looked -- Where is 
                         it?

                                     STAN
                         I tell ya --

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (who has been an 
                              interested witness)
                         What is all this?

               Jackson, as though noticing the women for the first time, 
               raises his hat.

                                     JACKSON
                         Afternoon ma'am. Miz Caldwell ain't 
                         it?

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         No -- Martin -- Miss Martin -- This 
                         is Miss Caldwell.

                                     JACKSON
                              (to Clara)
                         Glad to know you, miss -- Been 
                         expectin' you at Santa Inez. I'm 
                         Sheriff Jackson. Any relation of Red 
                         Caldwell's a friend of mine.

                                     BOB CLEWS
                              (that oily smile)
                         You're sure gonna brighten things up 
                         considerable around the K.C. Ranch.

               Miss Martin gives Clews an icy stare and snaps her eyes to 
               Jackson.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (indicating Stan)
                         What's going on with him?

                                     JACKSON
                         Just a little matter of the law.

                                     BOB CLEWS
                              (hastily)
                         Rustlin'.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Wrestling?

                                     BOB CLEWS
                         Rustlin' -- cattle stealin'.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Oh -- a thief --

                                     STAN
                              (visibly worried)
                         I tell ya I never --

                                     BOB CLEWS
                              (quickly)
                         Save it --

                                     JACKSON
                              (to Miss Martin)
                         Matter of fact -- Bob, here, says 
                         that the hide he saw yesterday had 
                         the K.C. brand on it.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Oh -- hmmm -- well, what do you intend 
                         doing about it?

                                     BOB CLEWS
                              (looking at Stan)
                         Law's pretty harsh 'round here on 
                         cattle thieves.

                                     JACKSON
                              (being the kind man)
                         Course, we don't want to make a 
                         mistake with an old-timer, but --

               Rocklin speaks from where he leans against the wall, casually 
               smoking.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         How about the owner of that beef -- 
                         mightn't he have somethin' to say 
                         about it?

               There's a pause in which all have turned their attention to 
               Rocklin.

                                     JACKSON
                         Meanin'?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Red Caldwell -- he's the owner of 
                         the K.C., ain't he?

                                     BOB CLEWS
                              (after a short chuckle)
                         You're 'way behind the herd, mister -- 
                         Red Caldwell died three weeks ago.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (glaring at Clews)
                         Was murdered, you mean.

                                     JACKSON
                         That's right -- shot in the back -- 
                         not far from here.

                                     BOB CLEWS
                              (significantly to 
                              Stan)
                         Maybe he was gettin' on to things 
                         about the cattle that's been missin' 
                         from the K.C. lately.

                                     STAN
                         I tell ya I ain't never had any hide --

                                     BOB CLEWS
                              (quickly)
                         Well, you got beef --

                                     STAN
                              (meekly defiant)
                         Yes -- an' I got a bill of sale fer 
                         it, too.

               Jackson and Clews exchange a quick glance.

                                     JACKSON
                         S'pose you let me see that bill of 
                         sale.

                                     STAN
                              (starts for kitchen)
                         It's right out here.

               Jackson follows, looking at the women.

                                     JACKSON
                         Like I said -- I wouldn't want to 
                         make a mistake with an ole-timer.

               Jackson follows Stan into the kitchen. Clews moves to the 
               fire and lunges there picking his teeth and eyeing Clara, 
               who stirs uneasily under the man's gaze.

               MED. SHOT

               as Rocklin comes out of the thoughtful mood in which he has 
               been plunged by the information about Red Caldwell and notes 
               the by-play between Clews and Clara. He frowns and makes a 
               movement as if about to rise. At the same time, Dave and 
               Zeke, whose voices have been heard throughout In the b.g., 
               stagger into the shot.

                                     DAVE
                              (chuckling and pointing 
                              to Miss Martin)
                         See that one?
                              (confidentially)
                         She ain't got no laigs.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Hold your tongue.
                              (to Zeke, who is gaping 
                              at her)
                         And you -- stop staring as if we 
                         were monsters.

               Zeke takes it and staggers into the b.g. near Bob Clews.

                                     DAVE
                              (to Rocklin)
                         Where's Stan? We got to have another 
                         drink.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         He's outside tryin' to explain away 
                         a hide.

                                     DAVE
                         Eh?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (indicating food)
                         Seems we're eatin' stolen beef.

                                     DAVE
                         Somebody's loco. Stan might have 
                         given house-room to bit o' dead beef, 
                         but he'd never be fool enough to 
                         leave the hide lyin' around.
                              (to Zeke)
                         How 'bout it, Zeke?

               Zeke opens his mouth to speak, and slowly folds up, sliding 
               down the wall to the floor.

               MED. SHOT

               as Clews comes from the fireplace and joins the group.

                                     BOB CLEWS
                         That's the way it is, Dave.

               Dave has gone to Zeke's aid and now peers at Clews closely, 
               recognizing him for the first time.

                                     DAVE
                              (disgustedly)
                         Oh -- it's you.

                                     BOB CLEWS
                         That's right -- your old pal Bob 
                         Clews.

                                     DAVE
                              (shoves Clews)
                         Git away from me -- you two-timin' 
                         horse thief.

                                     BOB CLEWS
                              (grinning)
                         Them's fightin' words, pardner.

               Stan and Jackson come from the kitchen. Dave is again picking 
               up Zeke, but seeing Stan, lets Zeke drop.

                                     DAVE
                              (moving to Stan)
                         Hey, Stan -- don't let 'em hang 
                         nothin' on you, you ain't done. 
                         They're just a couple of fourflushers -- 
                         the pair of 'em, everybody knows 
                         that.

               Jackson addresses everyone present with an indulgent Smile.

                                     JACKSON
                         Crazy drunk.

                                     DAVE
                              (wheels on Jackson)
                         Mebbe I am drunk -- mebbe that's why 
                         I'm tellin' the truth -- I'm drunk 
                         an' I'll say what I think -- I'll 
                         say what I know.

               Zeke, on the floor, takes up Dave's belligerent mood for a 
               flash.

                                     ZEKE
                         So will -- I --
                              (goes out again)

               Jackson goes to Dave.

                                     JACKSON
                         Don't act up this ways, Dave -- They's 
                         women watchin'.

               Clews moves in to Jackson and Dave, and now both men urge 
               Dave toward the door.

                                     DAVE
                              (attempting to throw 
                              them off)
                         Git your hands off me --

                                     BOB CLEWS
                              (to company in general)
                         What he needs is a short lay-down.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (taking a step forward)
                         I'll lend a hand.

                                     JACKSON
                              (brushing past him)
                         Me an' Bob'll look after him. We're 
                         his friends -- come on, Bob.
                              (as they steer Dave 
                              through door)
                         Careful now -- don't hurt him.

               They exit. Rocklin stands frowning a second, then turns toward 
               the table where Stan is making a show of clearing dishes, 
               etc.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (quietly to Stan)
                         How are things standin' now between 
                         you an' the law?
                              (indicates direction 
                              Jackson went out)

                                     STAN
                              (not wanting to talk 
                              about it particularly)
                         All right, I reckon --
                              (looks at Rocklin; 
                              more confidently)
                         I guess this bill of sale --
                              (indicates it in Vest 
                              pocket)
                         -- kinda winded him.

               Rocklin's lips curl in a wise smile.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Good thing you saved it.

               Zeke is discovered on all fours crawling around on the floor 
               near the table where the women sit. He seems to be looking 
               for something.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (mystified)
                         What are you doing?

               Zeke turns his hairy face up toward Miss Martin.

                                     ZEKE

                         Sorry to have a ruckus in front of 
                         you ladies. Dave's an ornery old

                         to drive on, I'm afraid.

                         Don't.

               He turns abruptly and walks out the front door to the coach. 
               Jackson stares after him a moment, uncertain. Now he turns 
               to the women.

                         His friends, eh?

               He kneels again, picks Dave up, and prepares to carry him

                         By the way, how did you say it 
                         happened?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (stolidly)
                         I didn't.

                         was in saying how Dave was kickin' 
                         up a ruckus up at Stan's place.

               of friendly warning.

               They down the drinks. There is a burst of excited comment 
               from o.s. and they all look around toward the poker table.

                         They're certainly running for him.

               MED. SHOT

               Poker table and including bar. Sammy Haynes has risen and is 
               pushing back his chair.

                         Besides, I on'y came in to oblige.

                              shouting)
                         Come on, Doc. I still got to take 
                         something from you.

                              (shaking his head)
                         No more tonight, son. I've a full 
                         day ahead.

               Judge Garvey in foreground has been watching Rocklin, as if 
               trying to sum him up. He now leans forward with an 
               ingratiating smile.

                                     GARVEY
                         How about you, sir? Care to sit In? 
                         I'm warnin' you, though -- our young 
                         friend here has been holding 
                         phenomenal cards.

               Rocklin smiles and begins to shake his head.

                                     CLINT
                              (with a cocky grin)
                         Have a heart, Judge. This ain't no 
                         two-bit saddle-tramp's game. This is 
                         for real money.

               Rocklin turns very slowly and stares at Clint. The others 
               watch curiously. Without taking his eyes off Clint, he comes 
               forward slowly and stands looking down at him. Then, 
               unbuttoning the flap of his pocket, he takes out the wad of 
               bills and drops it on the table, at the same time sinking 
               into the chair vacated by Sammy. The tension amongst the 
               onlookers relaxes and Clint grins at Garvey and winks 
               significantly.

                                     GARVEY
                         Fine! Oh -- this is Pap Fossler; 
                         Shorty Davis; Ab Jenkins; Mr. 
                         Harolday, and my name's Garvey -- 
                         Judge Garvey. I didn't get your name.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         I didn't give it.
                              (to Pap, who is holding 
                              the cards)
                         Deal.

                                                               DISSOLVE OUT

               DISSOLVE IN

               INT. SUN-UP BAR - NIGHT

               MED. SHOT -- poker table, including Cap, who is watching. 
               Pap Fossler is dealing. There is an atmosphere of tension 
               around the table, and it is obvious that Clint has been 
               losing. As he picks up his cards, he is unable to restrain a 
               smile of triumph. Rocklin makes a bet. Pap Fossler and the 
               man next to him fold immediately.

                                     CLINT
                         Raise you twenty.

               This is more than Rocklin has in front of him.

                                     PAP
                              (quietly)
                         Table stakes, Clint.

                                     CLINT
                         Not if he wants to dig.

               He stares challengingly at Rocklin. Rocklin takes out a 
               wallet, from which he removes a bill and sees the raise.

                                     GARVEY
                              (folding)
                         No place for me.

                                     PAP
                         Cards?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         One.

                                     CLINT
                              (eagerly)
                         One for me.

               He reaches for it almost before it is dealt and as a result 
               the card, a Queen, falls face up. Clint looks at it gleefully, 
               snatches it up and puts it in his hand. Rocklin watches him 
               impassively.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Don't you know that Queen is dead?

                                     CLINT
                         I can take it if I want it.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Sure -- if you want -- but you'll 
                         have to beat my hand with four cards.

                                     CLINT
                              (hotly)
                         I'm playing these, mister!

               Rocklin glances inquiringly at the other players. All are 
               dead-panned, unwilling to interfere. Rocklin looks toward 
               Cap, who stands near him.

                                     CAP
                              (shaking his head)
                         I'm not settin' in.

                                     GARVEY
                              (smoothly)
                         Why don't you split the pot?

                                     CLINT
                         I'm not splitting -- I'm betting!

               He shoves all the money in front of him into the pot.

                                     CLINT
                         Are you calling?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (calmly)
                         No.

               Clint excitedly starts to rake in the pot.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         I'm raising.

               He shoves in the money in front of him, which is more than 
               Clint's and in addition takes from his wallet more bills.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Dig.

               Clint, very excited, empties his pockets, which is not enough.

                                     CLINT
                              (to other players)
                         Let me have some money

                                     PAP
                              (speaking for all)
                         You're in deep enough, Clint.

                                     CLINT
                              (disgusted, to Rocklin)
                         I've called for all I've got.
                              (spreads out his cards)
                         Full house.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         No good.
                              (spreads his hand)
                         Kings up. Your third queen is dead.

               Rocklin starts raking in the pot. Clint, almost hysterical, 
               jumps up, draws his gun and thrusts it almost into Rocklin's 
               face. The other players roll away from the line of fire.

                                     CLINT
                              (screaming)
                         You -- mister -- get away from that 
                         table. And get out of here. Maybe 
                         from now on you'll know a full house 
                         beats two pairs -- four-flusher!

               Rocklin, his hands outspread, slowly straightens up, rises 
               and backs away. At the foot of the stairs, he turns 
               deliberately and walks upstairs. When he disappears from 
               view --

               CLINT - WITH OTHERS AT THE POKER TABLE

               Clint breaks the tension, looking from one to the other.

                                     CLINT
                         No man can run a bluff on me.

               There is a cold silence.

                                     PAP
                              (finally)
                         He wasn't armed.

                                     CAP
                         I don't like to tell men how to play 
                         cards unless I'm settin' in -- but I 
                         mebbe ought to have spoken up.
                              (directly to Clint)
                         That Queen was dead, Clint -- and 
                         you know it.

                                     CLINT
                              (arrogantly)
                         When anybody plays poker with me, 
                         they play my game or not at all.

                                     CAP
                         You can't just go makin' your own 
                         rules, Clint --
                              (starts for the bar -- 
                              stops and turns)
                         -- an' if I was you I'd hightail 
                         outa here before he comes back.

                                     CLINT
                              (jolted)
                         Comes back?

                                     CAP
                              (wearily)
                         He's the kind.

               Cap turns and resumes his trek to the bar. Suddenly he stops 
               before reaching it and is looking up, o.s.

               THE TOP OF STAIRS FROM CAP'S ANGLE

               Rocklin is standing there grimly surveying the situation. As 
               he starts down the stairs...

               THE GROUP AROUND THE POKER TABLE

               They are staring o.s. Clint is very uneasy. And now Rocklin 
               moves slowly into the scene.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (with deadly calm)
                         I've come for my money.

                                     CLINT
                              (nervously pleasant)
                         It's all yours, mister -- Cap, there -- 
                         Cap is an old gambler -- he says you 
                         were right all the time.

               Clint again looks around for approval, but gets no response. 
               Rocklin comes slowly forward, picks up the money from the 
               table and turns back to the stairs. As he reaches the foot 
               of the stairs, he turns and looks straight at Garvey with a 
               peculiar expression.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         By the way, Judge -- the name is 
                         Rocklin.

                                                                   FADE OUT

               INT. ROCKLIN'S BEDROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - DAY

               TRUCKING SHOT -- on a small cracked mirror in which can be 
               seen the reflection of a man shaving. A voice is heard 
               singing, atrociously off key.

                                     SINGER'S VOICE
                         She was only a bird in a gilded 
                         cage...
                              (etc.)

               CAMERA PULLS BACK to show that the owner of tie voice is 
               Rocklin, who has almost finished shaving. As he scrapes his 
               chin and whistles, peering at himself in the little cracked 
               mirror, he hears the sound of the door opening and turns, 
               then ducks quickly as a boot flies past him, just missing 
               the mirror. There is the sound of the door slamming and 
               Rocklin grins. He picks up the boot and goes to the door 
               leading to Dave's room.

               INT. DAVE'S BEDROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - DAY

               As Rocklin enters, Dave is discovered almost dressed sitting 
               on the bed. Rocklin, glad to see him, smiles and tosses the 
               boot to him.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         How you feelin'?

                                     DAVE
                         After that singin'? -- Thirsty.
                              (pulls on his boot)

                                     ROCKLIN
                         How's your head?

                                     DAVE
                              (evidently not aware 
                              of what happened)
                         Oh -- a mite hungover -- but I'll 
                         feel better once I git downstairs.

               He hurries out the hall door. Rocklin, amused at the old 
               coot, starts back into his room.

               INT. ROCKLIN'S BEDROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - DAY

               Rocklin is just coming through the door and sees something 
               o.s., stops and freezes.

               CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Bob Clews leaning against the 
               open ball door leading into Rocklin's room. He smiles as 
               Rocklin sees him.

                                     BOB CLEWS
                         I knocked, but guess you didn't hear 
                         me.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (closing door to Dave's 
                              room)
                         What do you want?

                                     BOB CLEWS
                              (grinning)
                         Looks like you stirred things up 
                         around here last night, stranger.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         That all you came to say?

                                     BOB CLEWS
                         No. I got a message for you.
                              (getting no response)
                         From Old Man Harolday. Wants to see 
                         you out front.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         What about?

                                     BOB CLEWS
                         Maybe he wants to thank you for 
                         teaching that pup of his a lesson.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (after a second)
                         I'll be down.

               Clews hesitates for a second as if anxious to wake sure he 
               is coming, then, turning, he disappears into the hall. Rocklin 
               wipes the last of the lather off his chin, buckles on his 
               gun-belt and picking up his hat goes out, closing the door.

               INT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY

               MED. SHOT -- Dave, at the bar, grabbing a bottle, pours 
               himself a drink which he sinks in one draught. He shudders 
               and repeats the dose. During this, an excited murmur of voices 
               has been heard o.s. Dave turns and looks toward the far side 
               of the saloon and suddenly gapes.

               MED. SHOT - FROM THE BAR

               with Dave in f.g., and SHOOTING TOWARD the street. A group 
               of men, including Cap, the bartender, is gathered round the 
               window looking out into the street. Dave staggers across to 
               them and begins to push his way to the window.

               the stagecoach office, which is situated diagonally across 
               the street from the Sun-Up.

               CAMERA HOLDS ON one group standing in front of Pap Fossler's 
               store, opposite the Sun-Up.

                                     AD LIBS
                         Here he comes. Watch the fun. This 
                         should be good. Etc.

               EXT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY

               ON the window. The men inside, including Dave and Cap, are 
               pressed against the glass.

               CAMERA MOVES BACK and PANS TO the alleyway at the side of 
               the saloon. Rocklin is coming toward the street.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Rocklin, as he comes out of the shadow of the alleyway and 
               stands blinking in the full sunlight. Sensing something 
               unusual, he looks quickly around.

               PANNING SHOT

               from Rocklin's ANGLE. CAMERA PANS OVER the groups in the 
               street, STOPPING ON one which includes Bob Clews. As Clews 
               sees Rocklin, he nudges a bystander and looks toward the 
               stagecoach office with a grin.

               CAMERA PANS to include Arly and Juan.

               TRUCKING SHOT ON

               Rocklin as he takes in the situation. With a grim look, he 
               begins to move along the sidewalk, CAMERA TRUCKING WITH him. 
               Suddenly, there is the clatter of a horse's hooves and Arly 
               gallops into shot, forcing the mare up onto the sidewalk and 
               barring Rocklin's progress.

                                     ARLY
                              (imperiously)
                         Is your name Rocklin?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (coldly)
                         Yes.

                                     ARLY
                              (contemptuously)
                         I want that money you took from my 
                         brother last night.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (quietly)
                         Are you crazy? Or just ignorant?

                              (flaming)
                         You took it at the point of a gun --
                              (suddenly whipping a 
                              revolver from her 
                              saddle holster)
                         -- and I'm taking it back the same 
                         way!

               Rocklin, as he looks coldly from Arly to the run and back 
               again. Calmly taking the reins, he forces the mare's head up 
               and moves on. Furiously, Arly spurs the mare alongside, CAMERA 
               TRUCKING WITH them.

               A shot comes from o.s. and strikes the building close to 
               him. He stiffens but keeps on walking. Another shot comes 
               even closer this time. He keeps walking.

                         You lied to me, didn't you?

                         I...

                         Don't think I'll forget this. Making 
                         a fool of me in front of the whole 
                         town.

               Before Clint can reply, she wheels the mare and gallops out

                         Boy, oh boy, was that a near thing! 
                         She'd just as soon have hit you as 
                         missed. You don't know how lucky you 
                         were, son.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Don't I?
                              (indicating whiskey 
                              with a sickly grin)
                         Why d'you think I need this?

               He sinks the whiskey and begins to pour himself another. At 
               the same time, the swing-doors open and Bob Clews comes 
               through. AS Rocklin raises the glass to his lips, Bob Clews 
               hits him on the back, causing him to spill the whisky.

                                     BOB CLEWS
                         Funniest sight I ever seen.

               There is a moment's pause. Then with a slow, grim smile of 
               satisfaction, Rocklin turns and knocks Bob Clews off his 
               feet.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               with Bob Clews on the floor, tugging at his gun. As it comes 
               free of the holster, Rocklin brings his heel down on Clews' 
               wrist, grinding on it with his whole weights. Then, kicking 
               the gun out of reach, Rocklin steps back. Bob Clews sits up, 
               clutching his wrist and weaving back and forth.

                                     BOB CLEWS
                              (moaning)
                         You broke it! You broke it!

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Try another trick like that on me 
                         and it'll be worse.

                                     BOB CLEWS
                         I never played you no trick. You 
                         broke my wrist.

               WIDER ANGLE

               to include the bystanders. They look at Bob Clews without 
               sympathy. He gets to his feet and stumbles back, collapsing 
               in a chair.

               CLOSE SHOT

               at bar, Dave has taken the bottle from Cap and is refilling 
               Rocklin's and his own glass ecstatically.

                                     DAVE
                              (gurgling with delight)
                         Oh boy -- has somebody come to town!

               He sinks both drinks quickly and is about to refill them 
               when Cap takes the bottle from him.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (to Cap)
                         Where'll I find Judge Garvey?

                                     CAP
                         He rooms behind his office down the 
                         street. Don't usually pull up the 
                         blinds till around noon, though.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (putting down money)
                         He will this morning.
                              (to Dave)
                         See you later, old-timer...

               As he moves toward the door.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

               Clint Harolday is seen at the window peering furtively toward 
               the Sun-Up Saloon. He suddenly notices something o.s. which 
               prompts him to say something which we of course cannot hear. 
               Now Garvey appears at the window.

               EXT. MAIN STREET - SANTA INEZ - DAY

               Rocklin, FROM Garvey's ANGLE as he leaves the Sun-Up and 
               starts toward the Judge's office.

               EXT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

               Garvey and Clint, at the window. From their expressions it 
               is apparent that anxious words are passing between them, and 
               now Clint suddenly drops from sight.

               ROCKLIN APPROACHES - LOOKS THE PLACE OVER - AND ENTERS

               EXT. MAIN STREET - SANTA INEZ - DAY

               ON Arly and Juan, mounted. They see Rocklin going into 
               Garvey's place.

               INT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

               MED. SHOT -- TOWARD door, with Garvey at desk in f.g. The 
               door opens and Rocklin enters.

                                     GARVEY
                              (effusively)
                         Oh, come in, Mr. Rocklin. Come right 
                         in.

               Rocklin looks him over for a second, then comes quietly to 
               the desk.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         I understand you were Red Caldwell's 
                         lawyer?

                                     GARVEY
                              (immediately on guard)
                         I was.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Know anything about this?

               He takes out a letter and hands it to Garvey. The latter 
               takes it slowly, handling it as if it were dangerous. He 
               looks from the letter to Rocklin and back again. Then 
               reluctantly, he opens it and begins to read.

               LETTER -- It reads:

               Dear Mr. Rocklin:

               Glad you have made up your mind to take the job. Enclosed 
               find train fare and $150 advance on wages.

               Yours faithfully,

               J. Caldwell

               MED. SHOT

               Rocklin and Garvey. The latter looks up from the letter 
               completely bewildered.

                                     GARVEY
                         I don't understand. Job? What job?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Foreman.

                                     GARVEY
                              (gaping)
                         On the "K.C."?
                              (trying to take it in)
                         But -- but why should he want you?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Why not? Good foremen don't grow on 
                         bushes.

               There is a little pause, with Garvey still bewildered.

                                     GARVEY
                              (thinking hard)
                         Is that your only motive for coming 
                         here?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         What other motive could I have?

                                     GARVEY
                         I don't know -- It's just that Red 
                         Caldwell was a peculiar man -- had a 
                         funny way of doing things.

               He studies Rocklin a short moment, then sits back comfortably 
               and relieved.

                                     GARVEY
                         Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Rocklin, that 
                         you've been brought all this way on 
                         a fool's errand, but -- I'm afraid 
                         the deal's off.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Off?

                                     GARVEY
                         I don't want to be too hard on you, 
                         but as executor of the estate I have 
                         to consider the interests of the new 
                         owner. How about, say, a hundred in 
                         full settlement?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (thoughtfully)
                         Well --

               There is a knock on the door. Garvey rises and speaks on his 
               way to the door.

                                     GARVEY
                         That's my last word -- think it over.

               Garvey opens the door, and Miss Martin stalks in followed by 
               Clare.

                                     GARVEY
                              (graciously)
                         How do you do, ladies --

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (icily)
                         You are Judge Garvey, I presume.

                                     GARVEY
                              (nods)
                         Yes -- and you are --

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Miss Martin -- and my niece, Clara 
                         Caldwell.

                                     GARVEY
                              (reaching for a chair)
                         Of course -- of course --

               Miss Martin sits stiffly as she eyes Rocklin coldly.

                                     GARVEY
                         You came at a very opportune moment, 
                         madam. This gentleman claims to have 
                         some sort of a letter from the late 
                         Mr. Caldwell, engaging him as foreman 
                         of the "K.C."

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         What!

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (to Garvey)
                         What do you mean -- claims to have? -- 
                         You saw it, didn't you?

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (before Garvey can 
                              answer)
                         You can't hold us to account for 
                         every promise made by that man. 
                         Everyone knows he wasn't responsible 
                         for his actions half the time. And 
                         if you think I'd have you as a foreman --

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (finds it hard to 
                              control himself)
                         Listen, lady -- I'd rather walk for 
                         somebody else, than ride for you.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (taken aback)
                         Well -- the impudence --

                                     ROCKLIN
                         All I come for this morning was to 
                         pay beck the hundred and fifty Red 
                         Caldwell sent in advance.

                                     CLARA
                         Oh, no

               They all turn and stare at her.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Don't interfere, Clara. Of course he 
                         must pay it back.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         The railway fare -- well, I reckon 
                         we can check that up against the 
                         time lost and call it quits.
                              (throws down a roll 
                              of bills in front of 
                              Garvey)

                                     CLARA
                              (summoning up her 
                              courage)
                         But, Mr. -- er -- I don't know your 
                         name...

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (raising his hat)
                         Rocklin, miss.

                                     CLARA
                         Mr. Rocklin, it isn't fair for you 
                         to pay anything back.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         That's how I'd prefer it, If you 
                         don't mind, miss -- never did care 
                         fer owing favors to no one -- 
                         especially women.

                                     CLARA
                              (as if she had been 
                              struck)
                         Oh!

               The sound of rapid steps approaching from outside is heard 
               and they all look toward the door.

               MED. SHOT

               on door, as it opens to admit Arly. Ignoring everyone in the 
               room except Garvey, she comes abruptly to the desk, with the 
               riding quirt dangling from her wrist.

                                     ARLY
                         I've just heard they let George Clews 
                         out of penitentiary and that he's 
                         headed this way. You might tell him 
                         from me, if he sets foot on the Santee 
                         Ranch, I'll shoot him on sight.

                                     GARVEY
                         But really, Miss Arly, why should 
                         you deliver your message through me?

                                     ARLY
                         You have mutual friends.

                                     GARVEY
                         If you're referring to Sheriff 
                         Jackson...

                                     ARLY
                         I am.

                                     GARVEY
                         But that's absurd. The fact that he 
                         employs one of the Clews brothers 
                         doesn't make the other his friend.

                                     ARLY
                              (contemptuously)
                         Have it your own way; but it'd be 
                         fair to warn him, because I mean it.

               For the first time, she appears to be conscious of the 
               presence of the other women.

                                     GARVEY
                              (hastening to change 
                              the conversation)
                         Oh, Miss Caldwell, this is Miss 
                         Harolday -- Miss Martin, Miss 
                         Caldwell's aunt. You should know one 
                         another, seeing you'll be neighbors. 
                         Miss Harolday runs the Santee Ranch 
                         for her stepfather. She's a famous -- 
                         ah -- horsewoman in these parts.

                                     CLARA
                              (with ingenuous 
                              enthusiasm)
                         I know. I saw you ride into town 
                         this morning. You looked lovely. 
                         Just what I'd like to be.

               Arly stares at her unbelievingly for a second.

                                     ARLY
                              (slowly, a bit 
                              flustered)
                         Yes?

               She looks slowly from Clara to Rocklin, as if suspecting 
               collusion.

                                     CLARA
                              (completely innocent)
                         Oh, this is Mr. Rocklin. He drove us 
                         in from Garden City last night. He...

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (dead pan)
                         I already met Miss Harolday.

                                     CLARA
                         Oh.

                                     ARLY
                              (stonily, to Rocklin)
                         I've a message for you -- from 
                         Harolday.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (murmuring)
                         What, again?

                                     ARLY
                         He wants you to come down to the 
                         office.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         What for?

                                     ARLY
                         He's got a proposition to make -- 
                         about riding for him. Sixty a month.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Hmmm -- That's a foreman's wages.

                                     ARLY
                              (suddenly exploding)
                         I wouldn't offer you a red cent.
                              (controlling herself)
                         But it's his money.
                              (bitingly)
                         And the way things are shaping, maybe 
                         we could do with somebody as mean as 
                         you around the ranch.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (pushing her way 
                              forward)
                         I warn you, you're making a great 
                         mistake. This man is no good.

                                     CLARA
                         Auntie!

                                     ARLY
                              (to Rocklin ignoring 
                              Miss Martin)
                         Well? D'you want the job?

               CLOSE SHOT

               Rocklin, as he stares at Arly with an enigmatic expression. 
               Suddenly, he seems to make up his mind.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (indicating the door)
                         Lead the way.

               MED. SHOT

               as Arly turns abruptly on her heel and exits the way she 
               came. Rocklin makes a little gesture to the ladies with his 
               hat and follows. As he goes, Juan, who has been leaning 
               against the doorpost, follows, closing the door behind him.

                                     CLARA
                              (after they have gone)
                         Auntie, why did you have to say that? 
                         I simply don't understand you...

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (cutting in, grimly)
                         But I understand you.
                              (scathingly)
                         I'd be ashamed of myself. Throwing 
                         myself at a man like that.

                                     CLARA
                         I... I...
                              (suddenly bursting 
                              into tears)
                         Oh, you're horrid -- horrid. I wish 
                         I'd never come.

               She turns abruptly and drops onto the couch by the window. 

               CAMERA PANS TO HOLD A CLOSE TWO SHOT of Garvey and Miss 
               Martin.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         You must excuse her. She's young.

                                     GARVEY
                         And inexperienced.

               Garvey leans back in his chair and smiles.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (significantly)
                         And young people must be protected 
                         from themselves at times -- don't 
                         you agree?

               Miss Martin throws him a quick look, which he returns 
               steadily.

                                     GARVEY
                              (at last, with a grim 
                              echo of a smile)
                         Exactly.

               EXT. MAIN STREET - SANTA INEZ - DAY

               Arly and Rocklin walking along the street, not far from 
               Harolday's office. Rocklin glances back toward Julio, who is 
               following a few paces behind them. He rides his horse and is 
               leading Arly's.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (to Arly, indicating 
                              Julio)
                         Does he always follow you?

                                     ARLY
                              (defiantly)
                         He's not following me -- he's with 
                         me -- he's always with me.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (takes it mildly)
                         Oh -- just an old Indian friend.

                                     ARLY
                              (straight at him)
                         The best friend I've got.

               Rocklin nods, looks back again at Julio, then back to Arly 
               as they go out of shot.

               INT. SANTA INEZ STAGECOACH OFFICE - DAY

               PAINING SHOT -- as Arly comes to from the street, followed 
               by Julio and Rocklin.

                                     ARLY
                              (abruptly to Rocklin)
                         Wait here.

               CAMERA PANS her over to a door marked "PRIVATE," which she 
               opens without knocking.

               INT. HAROLDAY'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY

               MED. SHOT as Arly comes through from the outer office toward 
               Harolday, who is seated at desk in f.g. At Arly's abrupt 
               entrance, he looks up, startled.

                                     ARLY
                         I've just hired a man named Rocklin 
                         and said you made me do it. Sixty 
                         dollars and he 'll earn it -- while 
                         he lasts.

               There is a little pause. Harolday's face is completely dead 
               pan. He looks out of the window for a second, then back at 
               Arly.

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (quietly)
                         Why did you do it, Arly?

                                     ARLY
                         So I can fire him. I hate him. Clint 
                         and he quarrelled last night. Clint 
                         lied about it and I made a fool of 
                         myself.
                              (nodding toward the 
                              outer office)
                         He's outside now.

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (with a little sigh)
                         All right. Send him in.

               Arly goes to the door and opens it.

                                     ARLY
                              (calling)
                         Come in.

               Rocklin comes in and Arly exits without a word, closing the 
               door behind her.

               REVERSE SHOT

               as Rocklin comes from the doorway into f.g. of shot, facing 
               Harolday, who is seated on the far side of the desk.

                                     HAROLDAY
                         Mr. Rocklin, what happened between 
                         you and my son last night?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Poker.

                                     HAROLDAY
                         Hmmm. About this suggestion of you 
                         working for me.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         It's your suggestion, not mine.

                                     HAROLDAY
                         Ye-es. Sixty dollars is big money.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (turning to go)
                         If you've changed your mind...

                                     HAROLDAY
                         No, no.... Wait a minute. I take it 
                         you've had the experience.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Enough for Red Caldwell to hire me 
                         as foreman.

                                     HAROLDAY
                         Oh -- had Caldwell hired you?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Yeah -- but I won't ride for the new 
                         owners -- so that leaves me open.

                                     HAROLDAY
                         I see -- Were you a friend of Red's?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         No -- I guess he just heard about 
                         me.

               A sudden clatter of feet is heard and all eyes turn toward 
               the door.

               MED. SHOT

               as Dave, followed by Arly and Juan, bursts in. His eyes go 
               around the room quickly until he finds Rocklin.

                                     DAVE
                              (as excited as a 
                              schoolboy)
                         George Clews is in town. He's seen 
                         what you done to Bob and he's a-
                         lookin' for you.

               They all look quickly toward the window.

               EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

               LONG SHOT -- from stagecoach office window. The center of 
               the street is clear and men's heads are peering from doorways.

               INT. HAROLDAY'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY

               MED. SHOT -- group at window, looking into street.

                                     HAROLDAY
                         The street is clear.

               Dave turns and looks curiously at Rocklin, who frowns 
               impatiently.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (to Dave irritably)
                         Tell him I'll be out in the street 
                         in front of the saloon.

                                     DAVE
                              (dashing out, radiant)
                         Uh-huh!

               INT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY

               The place is quite full and the atmosphere is one of 
               expectancy despite the outward casualness of the patrons. A 
               group lolls near the window, looking toward the stage office. 
               At the door a couple of customers peer out over the swinging 
               doors. The bar supports other customers engaged in various 
               private conversations but all are mindful of the presence of 
               George Clews who, with his brother, Bob, stands at the bar's 
               center, morosely toying with a glass of whisky in front of 
               him. He is quite conscious of the subtle glances of the 
               others, but regards them all with disdain. He downs his drink, 
               and speaks his thought to Bob.

                                     GEORGE CLEWS
                         I'm gonna get his ears.

               Suddenly Old Dave appears in a high state of excitement, and 
               halts with the swinging doors half open.

                                     DAVE
                              (loudly)
                         Hi you, George Clews --

               George Clews turns.

                                     DAVE
                         Rocklin says if you don't come out, 
                         he'll come in here after you, an' 
                         tear you apart.

               George Clews frowns. His eye catches sight of a king-size 
               glass of beer being slid across the bar to Shorty Davis, 
               standing alongside him. That quick, Clews beats Shorty to 
               the glass and hurls it at Dave, who ducks out. Cap, 
               anticipating trouble, brings a sawed-off shotgun up from 
               under the bar and now watches Clews and Shorty.

                                     SHORTY
                              (taps Clews)
                         That was my beer, you know.

                                     GEORGE CLEWS
                              (nastily)
                         If he comes in again -- I'll throw 
                         you.

               Before Shorty can reply, Clews yanks his hat down over the 
               little fellow's eyes, and gives him a backward shove that 
               sends him sprawling into a corner where we leave him 
               struggling to get his hat off. The crowd resents this, but 
               doesn't dare do anything, except Cap, who holds his shotgun 
               in sight.

                                     CAP
                              (to the Clews)
                         That does it, boys -- you know where 
                         the door is.

                                     GEORGE CLEWS
                              (to Bob)
                         Com-mon -- I'll get his ears.

                                     CAP
                         Not until I get my money --

               George and Bob Clews are now a few steps from the bar. They 
               have turned as Cap spoke and are looking at the shotgun.

                                     CAP
                         There's three drinks and a broken 
                         beer glass.

                                     GEORGE CLEWS
                              (to Bob, after a 
                              second's deliberation)
                         Pay 'im.

               George turns and starts for the doors as Bob comes back to 
               the bar to settle up.

                                     GEORGE CLEWS
                         I'll get his ears.

               ON PAP FOSSLER AND THE OTHERS AT WINDOW - AS GEORGE CLEWS 
               BURSTS OUT THROUGH THE DOORS

                                     PAP
                              (quietly)
                         That Rocklin'll kill him for sure.

                                     CUSTOMER
                         Le's hope.

               EXT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY

               As George Clews steps outside, a mangy mongrel dog, basking 
               close by, evidently recognizes him and tails it away, leaving 
               George blinking at him.

               LONG SHOT

               Rocklin -- FROM George's ANGLE. He is walking slowly forward 
               down the middle of the street.

               MED. SHOT

               George, looking baffled by the steady approach.

                                     GEORGE CLEWS
                              (yelling)
                         I'm coming -- and you'd better run!

               He steps down from the sidewalk into the street and then 
               stands still again.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Rocklin -- CAMERA MOVING WITH him as he comes slowly and 
               steadily forward.

               CLOSE SHOT

               George. His hands are on his guns, but drunk or not, he has 
               too much sense to draw too soon.

               EXT. STAGECOACH OFFICE - DAY

               MED. SHOT -- Harolday watching from behind the window of his 
               office. Behind Harolday are Julio and Arly. The latter makes 
               a step as if about to move to the door, but Julio restrains 
               her.

               INT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

               MED. CLOSE SHOT -- as Garvey, Miss Martin and Clara watch 
               the scene below -- Garvey and Miss Martin excitedly and Clara 
               in great distress.

               EXT. HOTEL - DAY

               CLOSER SHOT -- men in hotel doorway, taut with excitement.

               FULL SHOT

               Rocklin -- SHOOTING PAST George, whose hands are on his gun 
               butts. Rocklin's thumbs are hooked in his belt as he continues 
               slowly forward, his eyes fixed on George's.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (quietly)
                         Draw a gun and I'll kill you.

               MED. SHOT

               George, as he stands bewildered and open- mouthed. Rocklin 
               enters scene, suddenly whips out his gun and brings it 
               crashing down alongside George's head. The barrel strikes 
               though the crown of his hat and he goes down like a pole-
               axed steer.

               INT. HAROLDAY'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY

               MED. CLOSE SHOT -- group at window. Arly gives an involuntary 
               exclamation of pleasure, which she instantly checks, then 
               she moves abruptly out of shot, followed by Juan. Harolday 
               continues to stare frowningly out of the window.

               INT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

               MED. CLOSE SHOT -- group at window, with Garvey obviously 
               disapponted, Miss Martin bridling and Clara showing obvious 
               relief.

               EXT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY

               MED. SHOT -- Rocklin and crowd as they swirl around him 
               offering congratulations. Dave pushes his way through the 
               crowd and thumps Rocklin on the back in wild enthusiasm. At 
               the same time, the sound of a horse cantering is heard, and 
               Jackson comes into shot.

                                     JACKSON
                              (to Rocklin)
                         Hey, you! What's this you been up 
                         to?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         I just laid a gun barrel over the 
                         head of a drunk friend of yours -- 
                         same as you did over Dave's here 
                         yesterday.

                                     DAVE
                              (surprised)
                         Eh?

                                     JACKSON
                              (blustering)
                         I don't know what you're talking 
                         about.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (calmly)
                         You're a liar!

               He turns contemptuously and begins to move back towards the 
               stage office completely ignoring Jackson, who rides alongside 
               blusteringly.

                                     JACKSON
                         Now you lookee here, young feller. 
                         You go on talking that way and you'll 
                         find yourself in trouble.

               The crowd which has been following now begins to razz him 
               openly. He turns and glares, but without effect. He gives a 
               final shout to Rocklin.

                                     JACKSON
                         Don't say you ain't been warned.

               Pulling his horse around, he sets off in a lope up the street.

               MED. SHOT

               as Miss Martin comes along the street, determinedly, followed 
               by Clara, until she is face to face with Rocklin outside the 
               stage office where Arly and Juan are mounted ready to move 
               off.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (ignoring everyone 
                              but Rocklin)
                         I saw you. I saw you strike that 
                         poor man.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Yes, ma'am. As hard as I could.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         You ruffian, you!

               Clara pulls her sleeve imploringly.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Let me go!
                              (to Rocklin)
                         I knew the sort you were the moment 
                         I set eyes on you. You can't fool 
                         me! You're nothing but a common 
                         adventurer! Come, Clara!

               She takes Clara by the arm and sweeps past them towards the 
               hotel. Rocklin looks after them with a grim expression and 
               then up at Arly, who has been listening intently. She returns 
               his look steadily for a second. Then, with a mocking smile, 
               she wheels the mare and canters out of shot, followed by 
               Juan. He looks after her for a second; then with the same 
               grim look, enters Harolday's office.

               INT. HAROLDAY'S OFFICE - DAY

               Harolday is standing at the window, looking toward the door, 
               having seen Rocklin approaching. The door opens and Rocklin 
               enters and resumes his conversation as though it were hardly 
               interrupted.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         -- Now what was that you were sayin' 
                         about Caldwell?

                                     HAROLDAY
                         You being hired by Red Caldwell only 
                         confirms what I'd suspected -- he 
                         was getting ready to fight.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (trying to get 
                              information)
                         Fight? Who?

                                     HAROLDAY
                         Organized rustling. Well at least -- 
                         that's my belief. Red was no friend 
                         of mine. Too fond of taking the law 
                         into his own hands. But he had my 
                         sympathy. He'd been harder hit than 
                         any of us. And on top of it all, he 
                         lost his foreman.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         You mean, he quit on him?

                                     HAROLDAY
                         He was shot -- in the back -- with a 
                         bullet from the same caliber rifle 
                         as got Red.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Got any ideas?

                                     HAROLDAY
                         No -- Except that the man you just 
                         pistol-whipped is in on it somewhere.
                              (bitterly)
                         Pity you didn't kill him when you 
                         had the chance.

               Rocklin realizes that maybe Harolday is trying to throw a 
               curve -- trying to get him to talk.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Say -- it don't sound as if it's 
                         goin' to be too easy for them wimmen 
                         at the K.C.

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (watching him keenly)
                         Want to go back and work for them?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         No, sir. And I ain't jumping at this 
                         offer o' yours either because I don't 
                         hold with working for wimmen.

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (quickly)
                         Oh, you mean my step-daughter. Well 
                         don't worry. She won't interfere 
                         with you...Rocklin -- I figure we've 
                         been losin' cattle over a place called 
                         Table Top -- it's the back way into 
                         the Topaz Ranch and the perfect route 
                         for rustlers -- I'm going to send 
                         you up to the line camp -- you don't 
                         mind working a lone hand -- do you?

                              (measuring)
                         -- I like workin' that way.

                              (rising and holding 
                              out a hand)
                         Good -- be ready to move out this 
                         afternoon.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. MAIN STREET - SANTA INEZ - DAY

               On Dave and Pap Fossler engaged in conversation in front of 
               Pap's store. In the b.g. -- across the street, we carry the 
               entrance to the Sun-Up Saloon.

                                     DAVE
                              (in his best sales 
                              talk)
                         -- now Pap -- I'm givin' you first 
                         call on me services. They's lots of 
                         other folks lookin' fer a good man, 
                         too -- you know. So if you want me, 
                         you better hurry and speak up because --

               During Dave's speech Rocklin has come from the Sun-up carrying 
               his valise. He pauses a moment, looking around. Dave sees 
               him.

                                     DAVE
                         'scuse me, Pap -- Be right back to 
                         find out when I start.

               He hurries across the street toward Rocklin.

               EXT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY

               On Rocklin just stepping off the curb. Dave comes in to him.

                                     DAVE
                         Whar you off to?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         I'm riding for the Topaz Ranch.

               They start across the street, slowly toward the stage office.

                                     DAVE
                         What! -- Have you gone plumb loco?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Good money -- sixty a month

                                     DAVE
                         There ain't enough money in this 
                         town to make it worth your while to 
                         work for that gal.

               Rocklin gives Dave a quizzical look, which Dave mistakes for 
               weakening.

                                     DAVE
                         When she gits goin' she can be 
                         meaner'n a skillet full o' snakes. 
                         She ain't goin' to forget the way 
                         you made a fool of her today -- in 
                         front of the whole town.

                                     PAP FOSSLER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Hey, Dave.

                                     DAVE
                         Be right with you.
                              (to Rocklin)
                         It's pizen that's what it is -- jus' 
                         plain --- What you want to hang around 
                         this town for anyways? --

               Dave and Rocklin have reached middle of the street. Pap 
               Fossler's voice comes again from o.s.

                                     PAP FOSSLER'S VOICE
                         Hey, Dave.

               Dave reacts with a squint in Pap's direction. He runs out 
               toward Pap, but would rather stay with Rocklin. THE CAMERA 
               FOLLOWS Rocklin ACROSS the street To the stage office, where 
               see Arly and Tala sitting on their horses apparently waiting 
               for Rocklin. A third horse is standing by with Rocklin's 
               saddle on it.

               Rocklin, upon reaching the front of the stage office, pauses 
               a moment, to look over the horse carrying his saddle -- 
               glances up to Arly.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Be right with you.

               He goes into the stage of office, as we

               DISSOLVE IN

               EXT. FORKED ROAD - DAY

               LONG SHOT -- as Rocklin, Arly and Juan canter along a dirt 
               road over open country with the mountain ranges in the 
               distance.

               CAMERA PANS to show a buggy on the road ahead, approaching a 
               wooded dell where the road divides.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               of the buggy, showing Miss Martin riding in front, beside 
               Shorty Davis, who is driving, and Clara with her back to the 
               driver, facing the oncoming trio. Miss Martin hears the sound 
               of the approaching horses, and looks over her shoulder.

               MED. SHOT

               Arly, Juan and Rocklin, with Miss Martin in F.g. The latter 
               scowls and looks quickly to her front as the riders draw 
               level with the buggy, Rocklin coining to the right, alongside 
               Clara.

                                     CLARA
                         Good afternoon, Mr. Rocklin.
                              (looking at the sky)
                         Lovely day, isn't it?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Reckon it is pretty nice. So you're 
                         moving in on the "K.C." eh?

                                     CLARA
                              (hesitating and 
                              throwing a look toward 
                              Miss Martin)
                         We-el, not exactly moving in. You 
                         see...

               MED. SHOT

               with Miss Martin in f.g. and SHOOTING OVER her shoulder to 
               include Clara and Rocklin.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (acidly, locking 
                              straight ahead)
                         Do you have to discuss our private 
                         affairs with every rag-tag-and-bobtail 
                         cow-person we meet, Clara?

                                     CLARA
                              (in a low voice)
                         Auntie!

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Sorry if I butted in, ma'am. Jest 
                         passing the time o'day.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         We can do very well without it -- 
                         thank you.
                              (with a look over her 
                              shoulder)
                         And you're keeping your lady friend 
                         waiting.

               Rocklin looks quickly in the same direction.

               MED. SHOT

               from Rocklin's ANGLE, with Arly and Juan at the fork in the 
               road. They are looking back towards the buggy which has taken 
               the lower road to the right of the copse.

               REVERSE SHOT

               with Arly and Juan in f.g. and the buggy in the distance. 
               Rocklin raises his hat to the women in the buggy and canters 
               back to Arly, who has been watching with a peculiar 
               expression.

                                     ARLY
                              (coldly)
                         I thought maybe you'd changed your 
                         mind again.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (cheerfully)
                         Nope.

               She looks at him angrily for a second as if about to say 
               something sarcastic. Then, repressing herself, she wheels 
               her horse and canters off along the side of the copse. Rocklin 
               throws an amused glance, at Juan, who has been watching with 
               an enigmatic expression. He returns Rocklin's look with a 
               stern, menacing frown. Then, with a gentle flick of the rein, 
               he urges his horse after Arly. Completely baffled, Rocklin 
               scratches his head for a second, then follows.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. RANCH HOUSE - SANTEE RANCH - LATE AFTERNOON

               MED. SHOT -- as the three canter up the driveway to a smart-
               looking ranch house. Arly dismounts and throws her reins to 
               Juan.

                                     ARLY
                              (over her shoulder to 
                              Rocklin)
                         Juan'll show you the bunkhouse. I'll 
                         talk to you about your duties in the 
                         morning.

               Before Rocklin can speak, she runs quickly up the steps of 
               the verandah and disappears into the house. Leading Arly's 
               Horse, Juan moves out of shot to the left of the ranch house 
               and Rocklin follows.

               EXT. CORRAL - SANTEE RANCH - LATE AFTERNOON

               MED. SHOT -- as Juan comes into shot leading the mare, 
               followed by Rocklin. They both dismount and begin to off-
               saddle.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         How far is the line-camp at Table-
                         Top?

                                     JUAN
                         Twenty-five -- thirty mile.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         I'm moving out there first thing in 
                         the morning.
                              (as Juan turns and 
                              stares)
                         Boss' orders. Care to show me the 
                         way?

               There is a moment's pause. Then, what almost amounts to a 
               smile of relief, crosses Juan's face.

                                     JUAN
                         I will show you.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. SANTEE RANCH - DAY

               LONG SHOT -- as Rocklin and Juan ride out from the ranch 
               through the early morning mist and turn off in the direction 
               of the distant line of mountains.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. ENTRANCE TO CANYON - DAY

               LONG SHOT -- as the two leave the open country and enter the 
               mouth of a steep and narrow gorge at the foot of the mountain 
               range.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT

               as Juan pulls up and dismounts, followed by Rocklin.

                                     JUAN
                              (pointing ahead)
                         The trail is straight ahead. You 
                         will find the cabin at the top.
                              (turning back to his 
                              horse)
                         Adios, Senor.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (challenging, but 
                              perfectly friendly)
                         Senor Romerez, it appears that you 
                         do not like me.

               For a second Juan does not reply. Then, as he speaks, he 
               takes a tobacco pouch from his pocket. Rocklin, his mind on 
               other things, does not take particular notice of the pouch, 
               but we cannot help notice the pouch ornament -- a steer's 
               head of hammered silver.

                                     JUAN
                              (during the above 
                              business)
                         Senor, that is true. I do not like 
                         you.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Why?

                                     JUAN
                              (extending the pouch)
                         Permit that I offer you a cigarette.

               Rocklin shakes his head. Juan, having spilled tobacco in a 
               paper, now puts away the pouch and rolls his own.

                                     JUAN
                         It is not your fault that your shadow 
                         is black. But you will only bring 
                         unhappiness to my senorita. I do not 
                         blame you, but I fear I must hate 
                         you.

               He turns abruptly and mounts the waiting horse; then looks 
               down from the saddle.

                                     JUAN
                         Adios, Senor.

               He rides quickly out of the shot.

               MED. SHOT -- as Rocklin forces his horse up the last few 
               feet of the steep trail at the top of the canyon, and pulls 
               up at the top of the rise with a look of amazement.

               FULL SHOT - FROM ROCKLIN'S ANGLE

               A rich meadow stretches ahead with a stream running through 
               it, and a cabin at the far end. Steep escarpments surround 
               the lush meadow land, making an idyllic scene. As Rocklin 
               comes slowly into shot with the same look of startled 
               appreciation on his face and begins to move toward the cabin,

               approaches a smallish freight wagon, pulled by two horses. 
               As the driver sees Juan and waves his whip, the Mexican 
               swerves from his course and canters toward the wagon.

               MED. SHOT

               wagon, which we now see is being driven by Dave. On the side 
               of the wagon is written: TRANSPORT & GENERAL FREIGHTAGE -- 
               Pap Fossler and Sons. Juan canters into shot and pulls up 
               alongside the wagon.

               DISSOLVE IN

               EXT. TOPAZ RANCH HOUSE - DAY

               Shelley, a Negro servant of the Harolday household, is 
               discovered sweeping the front porch. Behind him we see Clint 
               open the door -- peer furtively out -- then cross the porch 
               to its edge when he looks o.s. as though searching for 
               someone.

               Shelley, meantime, has noticed Clint, but goes right on with 
               his sweeping. His only reaction is a disparaging glance over 
               his shoulder.

                                     CLINT
                              (turning to Shelley)
                         Have you seen Arly?

                                     SHELLEY
                         No, suh, Ah didn't see Miss Arly 
                         today, but Ah seed her las' night, 
                         and she shore was mad.

               To emphasize his point, Shelley puckers his mouth in a 
               whistle.

                                     SHELLEY
                         Plenty mad!

               Clint's face tightens as he anticipates what is in store for 
               him. Over the scene comes the gradually increasing sound of 
               a feminine voice, gayly humming the notes of a popular tune 
               of the period. Clint's strained features relax in a can-that-
               be-Arly expression, while Shelley stops dead in the middle 
               of a sweep, and now both stare incredulously, o.s.

               ANGLE

               From their ANGLE we first see only the corner of the house, 
               while the owner of the voice approaches from the other side. 
               Now Arly comes into view, entirely oblivious of Clint and 
               Shelley watching her. She seems more attractive, in a feminine 
               way, this morning. It may be the skirt and blouse she is 
               wearing. Then again it may be the flower she is, even now, 
               adjusting in her hair. The presence of the two men suddenly 
               startles her. The song ends abruptly, while her hands fall 
               quickly away from the flower.

               ARLY

               As Arly moves toward the porch, Shelley snaps back to life 
               and resumes sweeping -- but furiously. Clint regards the 
               girl in the vague manner of the puzzled gent he is.

                                     CLINT
                              (not too definitely)
                         'Mornin', Arly --

               Arly is coming toward Clint.

                                     ARLY
                              (pleasantly)
                         'Mornin', Clint.

               She steps close to Clint, and he slowly backs up a step, for 
               he does not know she came up to him merely to pick up her 
               jacket lying on the ground near the step.

                                     CLINT
                              (as Arly leans down 
                              to pick up the jacket)
                         You must be feeling pretty good.

               Arly straightens up with the jacket in her hand, and the 
               corner of her mouth curls in a faint smile. She turns now 
               and starts along the walk, and takes only a few steps when 
               Clint comes to her side.

               ARLY AND CLINT WALKING

                                     CLINT
                              (as he joins Arly)
                         Say, Arly -- about that poker game, 
                         night before last, I ---

                                     ARLY
                              (tossing it off)
                         Forget it.

                                     CLINT
                              (did he hear correctly)
                         Forget it?

               Arly pays no attention to Clint. She is looking o.s. and 
               stops walking.

               EXT. GROUNDS NEAR TOPAZ RANCH HOUSE - DAY

               Tala, on his horse, as seen by Arly. Over the scene comes 
               Arly's voice calling from a distance.

                                     ARLY
                              (calling)
                         Tala.

               Tala reacts to the call by heading his horse at a slightly 
               different angle.

               ARLY AND CLINT

               Arly is looking o.s. toward Tala. Clint is now eyeing his 
               sister up and down quite openly. She turns her head now and 
               catches Clint looking her over.

                                     ARLY
                              (after a stilted pause)
                         Well --

                                     CLINT
                              (with a perplexed 
                              smile)
                         What is this? --

               A gesture of his hand indicates the way Arly has gotten 
               herself up. That quick, Arly's hand goes to the flower in 
               her hair. And, that quick, she guiltily withdraws it.

                                     ARLY
                              (bravely nonchalant)
                         What do you mean?

                                     CLINT
                         What do I mean? --

               Before he can explain, Tala pulls up in his horse and we 
               hear his voice over the scene.

                                     TALA'S VOICE
                         Good morning, Arliete.

               ARLY, TALA AND CLINT

               Tala sitting astride his horse smiles down at the girl.

                                     ARLY
                         Good morning, Tala.

                                     TALA
                         You have make yourself very pretty 
                         today.

               Arly is jolted by Tala's innocent remark, and she can't help 
               giving Clint a little side glance in the way of reaction. 
               Clint has not missed Tala's crack nor Arly's glance, and 
               when she gives it to him he says:

                                     CLINT
                              (pleasantly)
                         See what I mean?

               He tosses her an altogether knowing look now, and leaves, 
               going up the walk toward the house. Arly turns to Tala.

                                     ARLY
                         Have my horse saddled and sent around 
                         right away -- will you?
                              (then as a casual 
                              afterthought)
                         You can have that Rocklin bring it.

               She glances over her shoulder toward Clint going up the walk. 
               And then, looking back to Tala, finds he hasn't moved, but 
               remains smiling down at her.

                                     ARLY
                         What's the matter?

                                     TALA
                              (easily)
                         Rocklin is not here.

                                     ARLY
                              (breathlessly)
                         He quit?

                                     TALA
                         He has gone to the line camp at Table 
                         Top.

                                     ARLY
                         What?

                                     TALA
                         It was Mr. Harolday's orders.

               Arly looks away. Her eyes stare blankly into space as she 
               struggles with the mixed emotions of anger and disappointment. 
               Tala, aware of her plight, slowly dismounts and comes to the 
               girl's side.

                                     TALA
                              (in a fatherly manner)
                         Why do you make your heart heavy 
                         with thoughts of him, little one. -- 
                         He is not for you.

                                     ARLY
                              (bitterly)
                         Be quiet.

                                     TALA
                         He has made the choice, Arliete. 
                         With your own eyes you saw it 
                         yesterday.

                                     ARLY
                              (impatiently)
                         Oh --

                                     TALA
                         And she, too, has opened her heart 
                         to him -- Already she has summoned 
                         him to her.

                                     ARLY
                              (this turns her around)
                         What do you mean?

                                     TALA
                         Dave -- of the white beard -- carries 
                         a letter to Rocklin -- It is from 
                         her.

                                     ARLY
                         How do you know that?

                                     TALA
                         I have just now met Dave, and he 
                         tell me. -- So now he rides to Table 
                         Top.

               Arly is quiet a moment.

                                     TALA
                         Little one you --

                                     ARLY
                              (quickly, as she starts 
                              for the house)
                         Oh, leave me alone.

               LONG SHOT

               entrance to ranch. Entering the driveway from the direction 
               of Santa Inez, comes Harolday, still looking the distinguished 
               citizen.

               HAROLDAY RIDES UP TO THE PORCH - CLOSE TO ARLY AND JULIO

                                     HAROLDAY
                         Good morning, Julio -- morning Arly.
                              (to Julio as he 
                              dismounts)
                         Fetch my briefcase -- it's on my 
                         desk.

               Julio exits.

               HAROLDAY TURNS HIS ATTENTION TO ARLY WHO

               still smarting under the disappointment about Rocklin, seems 
               lost in thought. After regarding her a moment Harolday speaks.

                                     HAROLDAY
                         Looks like we're going to get that 
                         land we've been wanting along the 
                         river bottom.

               Arly turns her eyes on Harolday, who continues.

                                     HAROLDAY
                         I didn't tell you -- but I bought 
                         the mortgage on the Hardman ranch, 
                         and it's due today -- On my way over 
                         there now.

               Arly's eyes burn as she tosses her head slightly.

                                     ARLY
                         Did you send that Rocklin to Table-
                         Top?

                                     HAROLDAY
                         I did.

                                     ARLY
                              (furiously)
                         Well, let's get things straight. 
                         This place was my mother's -- now 
                         it's mine and Clint's -- It's true 
                         you've been helping out -- but the 
                         way things are going we'll soon be 
                         able to pay you back every penny we 
                         owe. Meanwhile, I'm running this 
                         outfit and I expect to give the 
                         orders.

                                     HAROLDAY
                         You generally do.

                                     ARLY
                         Why did you send Rocklin up to Table-
                         Top?

                                     HAROLDAY
                         It seemed to me a good idea -- what 
                         with all this rustling going on --

                                     ARLY
                         Who'd ever try driving cattle over 
                         Table-Top? -- Unless they were crazy.

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (coldly)
                         I don't agree with you. In any case -- 
                         if you must have it -- I'd no 
                         intention of engaging a man at 
                         foreman's wages just to gratify the 
                         whims of a jealous woman!

                                     ARLY
                              (dangerously)
                         You take care what you're saying.

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (very controlled)
                         It's you should take care, my dear. 
                         I'm afraid there's one man you can't 
                         rawhide into jumping the way you 
                         want. You've made a fool of yourself 
                         over him once. Better watch out you 
                         don't do it again.

               He turns abruptly and walks off the verandah.

               MED. SHOT

               as Harolday comes from the verandah to his horse. Juan is 
               standing there with the briefcase which Harolday takes with 
               a yank, mounts his horse and rides out.

               The CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE on Arly, who stands in furious 
               silence watching Harolday ride away.

                                                                   FADE OUT

               EXT. CANYON ROAD ON THE WAY TO TABLE-TOP - DUSK

               Old Dave is jogging along in his wagon. A rumble of thunder 
               echoes through the canyon. Dave reacts with a look toward 
               the sky.

               of storm clouds gathering.

               A night shot of the mountain road near Table-Top. It is a 
               wooded section of the plateau, and occasional flashes of 
               lightning illuminate the big trees skirting the road. Dave, 
               in his wagon, looms out of the b.g., and as he nears the 
               camera we hear him urging the team through the downpour. As 
               he passes and continues hurriedly on his way, we

                                                                   FADE OUT

               FADE IN

               INT. CABIN - NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT on a soiled and wrinkled envelope lying on a table. 
               It is addressed to:

                               Mr. Rocklin c/o Santee Ranch

               The CAMERA PULLS BACK and Rocklin is revealed at the table, 
               looking down at the letter. His hat is tipped back on his 
               head, and his sleeves are rolled up. He is mixing dough in a 
               bowl sitting on the table near the letter, and his hands are 
               all gooey. Dave is discovered in front of the fireplace where 
               his outer shirt and socks are drying. It is dark outside, 
               but the storm has abated. Rocklin goes to a shelf near the 
               fireplace to get a pan.

                                     DAVE
                              (during the above)
                         Durn funny -- that storm quittin' 
                         just about the time I get here.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         No funnier than you sloggin' through 
                         it, just to deliver a letter from a 
                         woman.

                                     DAVE
                              (disgustedly)
                         Reckon I'm gettin' to be more of a 
                         fool the older I get.

               Dave watches Rocklin at the table shaping the dough for 
               biscuits and putting it in the pan.

                                     DAVE
                         When are we gonna get around to 
                         readin' it?

               Rocklin cannot help smiling a bit at the way Dave includes 
               himself in.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Thought I'd wait till mornin' -- 
                         might be bad news an' I wouldn't be 
                         able to sleep.

               Dave screws up his face in utter disgust and turns his 
               attention to his drying clothes.

               Rocklin, meanwhile, takes a flour sack from the table, wipes 
               the dough from his hands and picks up the letter. He goes 
               over to the fireplace, opening the letter the while, and 
               sits on the bench. Dave, seeing this, edges discreetly around 
               in back of Rocklin in order to see over his shoulder.

               The letter open, Rocklin takes out a roll of bills along 
               with the folded message. He lays the envelope on the bench.

                                     DAVE
                         Mmmm -- dineroo.

               Rocklin places the money in his shirt pocket for the moment, 
               and opens the folded message.

               LETTER. It begins with the usual Dear Mr. Rocklin.

               Rocklin's voice is heard over the insert as he reads from 
               here.

                                     ROCKLIN'S VOICE
                              (reading)
                         Forgive me if this letter is a trifle 
                         incoherent, but I am terribly worried 
                         and unhappy.

               BACK TO SCENE.

                                     DAVE
                         Who wouldn't be -- livin' with that 
                         ole screech owl.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (continues to read)
                         I am desperately in need of help and 
                         advice from someone whom I feel I 
                         can trust, and I am appealing to 
                         you, because I regard you in the 
                         same way my Uncle surely must have. 
                         I heartily dislike and distrust Judge 
                         Garvey --

                                     DAVE
                              (interrupting)
                         Huh -- Smart girl --

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (going on)
                         But my Aunt seems to have suddenly 
                         revised her opinion of him, and now 
                         wants me to place all my affairs in 
                         the Judge's hands and return east. 
                         Such is certainly not my wish.

                                     DAVE
                              (significantly)
                         Looks kinda like she's formed an 
                         attachment.

               Rocklin glares up to Dave.

                                     DAVE
                              (quickly)
                         For the locality, I mean.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (continues reading)
                         I wanted so much to give ranch life 
                         a trial, but fear circumstances are 
                         against me, especially in view of 
                         the recent Indian trouble --

                                     DAVE
                              (explosively)
                         Indian trouble --
                              (in normal tone)
                         Good Lord, they ain't been any Indian 
                         trouble around here in --

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (caustically)
                         You want to hear the rest of this?

                                     DAVE
                              (getting the inference)
                         Might's well -- come this far.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (reading)
                         I want to apologize for what took 
                         place this afternoon. And I am 
                         returning the 150, because I feel it 
                         is rightfully yours. You must take 
                         it. Faithfully yours, Clara Caldwell.

               The letter finished, Rocklin regards it a moment, then slowly 
               returns it to the envelope as he gazes thoughtfully into the 
               fire.

               Dave meantime straightens up -- scratches his shaggy top, 
               and turns his attention once more to his drying clothes.

                                     DAVE
                              (feeling his socks)
                         Well -- what do you make of it?

               Rocklin continues looking into the fire as he lays the letter 
               back on the bench and takes out tobacco to roll a cigarette.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Somebody's sure bustin' to get her 
                         out of there.

               Dave sits alongside Rocklin and begins putting on his socks.

                              (after a pause)
                         Wonder why the old lady's playin' 
                         along?

                                     DAVE

                         'em?
                              (pause)
                         Got to admit though, I feel a mite 
                         sorry for the young'un -- nice little 
                         tyke.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Too nice for this country.

                                     DAVE
                              (after a slight pause)
                         She's shore a pretty thing.

               Rocklin has been mulling things over.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Don't know how I could help her -- 
                         even if I wanted to -- I don't know 
                         any thing about this Garvey -- or 
                         Caldwell -- or --

                                     DAVE
                         Well, now -- I could mebbe help you 
                         out some, there -- Fact, I could 
                         tell you somethin' 'bout ole Red 
                         that might be interestin'.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         You must have known him pretty well -- 
                         What kind of a man was he?

               Rocklin goes to the table and resumes molding biscuits.

               Dave has his boots on and is putting on his outer shirt.

                         Caldwell? -- The best -- cantankerous 
                         cuss -- but a real cowman, believe 
                         me -- He was a big feller, like 
                         yourself -- Fact, you coulda passed 
                         fer a blood relation, come to think 
                         of it.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (casually, as he busies 
                              himself with the 
                              biscuits)
                         Was the Judge and Red friends?

                                     DAVE
                              (anigmatically)
                         That's what you'd say. Garvey managed 
                         all Red's business. Besides which 
                         they was regular drinkin' pals -- 
                         played poker together most nights -- 
                         tho' they do say Red got the worst 
                         of it.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Red was a gambler, eh?

                                     DAVE
                         Oh, yeah -- reckon a pretty poor 
                         one, tho' -- still you'd say him and 
                         Garvey was friends.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (after a side glance 
                              to Dave)
                         Anything ever happen to make you 
                         think they weren't?

                                     DAVE
                              (moves close to Rocklin)
                         Rock -- I'm gonna tell you somethin' 
                         I ain't never told anybody.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (with a slight smile)
                         Think you can trust me?

               Dave grimaces his confidence.

                                     DAVE
                         The last time I seen Red was the day 
                         he died --

               In the pause Rocklin remains silent.

                                     DAVE
                         -- 'Twas in town -- he jus' come out 
                         of the stage office. Tried to book 
                         passage to Garden City but couldn't 
                         on account I had a full load. -- 
                         Well, sir, he took me aside and give 
                         me a printed sheet of paper and says, 
                         "Read it." I looked it over and fer 
                         as I could see it was a paper from 
                         one of them Chicago sportin' firms, 
                         tellin' how to manipulate trick 
                         playin' cards.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Marked cards.

                                     DAVE
                              (nods)
                         Reckon so. -- Seems Red found some 
                         cards and this paper in a coat one 
                         of his friends loaned him one night.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Whose was it?

                                     DAVE
                         Well, now that's just what I asked -- 
                         but all he said, was that it belonged 
                         to a good friend. Then he said he 
                         wasn't waitin' fer the next coach, 
                         but was ridin' over to see the 
                         district judge about it alone.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         That's when they got him.

                                     DAVE
                         Yes, sir -- 'bout a mile or so from 
                         Stan's place. A bullet in the back 
                         an' his pockets empty.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         How come you never told this before?

                                     DAVE
                         Who was there to tell? -- Sheriff 
                         Jackson? -- Him an' Garvey's thick 
                         as thieves.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         How about what's his name -- Harolday? -- 
                         He's no friend of the Judge's, is 
                         he?

                                     DAVE
                         Hates his guts -- sure riles him to 
                         see young Clint hangin' onto the 
                         Judge's coattails. All the same, I 
                         jus' decided to keep my mouth shut 
                         and my eyes open.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (after a pause)
                         Even if it was Garvey Red was talkin' 
                         about -- it don't follow that he 
                         killed him.

                                     DAVE
                         No -- general opinion is that it was 
                         rustlers.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Why would rustlers take the evidence 
                         Caldwell had with him?

               Rocklin moves away to a large earthen jug holding water as 
               Dave talks.

                                     DAVE
                         Looks to me if you get the man who 
                         owned the marked cards, you get the 
                         killer.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (drinking)
                         Funny tho' -- first the K.C. foreman -- 
                         then Caldwell -- an' now these women.

                                     DAVE
                         Lordy -- you ain't thinkin' somebody 
                         might try bumpin' them?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (slowly, to himself)
                         I'm not so sure somebody hasn't tried 
                         already --
                              (to Dave)
                         Remember, when we stopped to change 
                         horses on the way Over from Garden 
                         City --

                                     DAVE
                         Shore -- you told me how Jackson and 
                         Clews tried to frame Stan.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (nods)
                         Yeah. Like they wanted to be sure 
                         he'd keep his mouth shut about 
                         something.

               Dave sits down on a box sitting against the wall, directly 
               under the large earthen jug of water.

                                     DAVE
                         And layin' that gun across my skull -- 
                         an' offerin' to drive the coach 
                         themselves.

               A SECTION OF THE CLEARING - MOONLIGHT

               A dark, mysterious figure on a horse raises his rifle --

               INT. OF CABIN - NIGHT

               SHOT.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (nods)
                         It was almost as if --

               A shot splinters the windowpane and shatters the earthen jug 
               on the shelf directly above Dave's head. The contents pour 
               down on Dave and he topples over. Rocklin meanwhile has wiped 
               the lantern off the table and ducked. They are both on the 
               floor in the faint glow coming from the fireplace.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (going to Dave)
                         You all right?

                                     DAVE
                              (blustering)
                         Will be if I ever get dry.

               Rocklin takes off his hat and puts his finger through two 
               holes drilled by the bullet.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Lookit that --

                                     DAVE
                         Good Lord --

               Rocklin puts the hat aside -- crawls over to his gun belt -- 
               straps it on.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Come on --

               He opens the door cautiously. Then sneaks out, followed by 
               Dave.

               EXT. OF CABIN - MOONLIGHT - AFTER THE STORM

               Rocklin and Dave stand close to the cabin, just clear of the 
               door, tensely scanning the surrounding darkness.

               Water can be heard dripping from the cabin roof, and an owl 
               hoots in a near-by tree.

               The sound of neighing horses comes from the direction of the 
               corral. Both men re-act.

                                     DAVE
                         My team.

               Almost immediately the neighing is repeated, but this time 
               from another direction entirely -- and from a distance.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         That's not your team.

               He moves to the corner of the cabin, followed by Dave.

               HORSE IS STOMPING NERVOUSLY

               and now it starts away, galloping through the deep grass at 
               the edge of the clearing. Only the lower part of the animal 
               is seen, along with the legs of the rider.

               ROCKLIN AND DAVE HEAR THE SOUND OF RETREATING HOOF BEATS

               And they can barely make out their quarry riding hell-bent 
               toward the deep blackness of the trees.

               Rocklin fires and runs out into the moonlight in the clearing -- 
               Dave close behind.

               Rocklin halts -- fires again -- and again. Dave fires.

               The mysterious rider is now swallowed by the night.

               Dave starts after him again. Looking back, he sees Rocklin 
               has not moved.

                                     DAVE
                         Come on --

                                     ROCKLIN
                         No use -- he's gone.

                                     DAVE
                         Mebbe we winged him.

               He starts through the wet grass alone. Rocklin turns back 
               toward the cabin.

               DAVE - PLOUGHING THROUGH THE GRASS

               He has reached the edge of the clearing where a slight 
               embankment leads to the level of the trees. He is just 
               starting up to higher ground when his eyes catch something 
               on the embankment, shining in the moonlight. It proves to be 
               a tobacco pouch bearing a steer's head of hammered sliver. 
               It is dry, so has evidently just been dropped. Dave pockets 
               it, and proceeds warily along the mystery rider's trail.

               ROCLKLIN - WHO HAS JUST ABOUT REACHED THE CABIN

               He looks back in Dave's direction, and then looking toward 
               the cabin, suddenly stops and tenses.

               THE CABIN DOOR IS PARTLY OPEN

               and through it Rocklin can plainly see an indistinct form 
               moving in the faint glow of the dying fire.

               ROCKLIN DRAWS HIS GUN AND MOVES STEALTHILY TOWARDS THE CABIN 
               DOOR

               INT. OF CABIN - NIGHT

               Rocklin has reached the entrance unheard, and silently watches 
               the strange figure, its back to him, now headed for the 
               fireplace with his saddlebag, taken from the bunk. He sees 
               the intruder start emptying his saddlebag on the bench in 
               the light of the fire. He sees him suddenly stop and pick up 
               something hidden from his view.

               At that instant, Rocklin slams the door shut.

               The intruder whirls around.

               It is Arly -- tense -- and now defiant.

               The two regard each other like vicious animals in the same 
               cage. Arly's heart is pounding, but you would never know it.

               And now Rocklin, his gun away, starts closing in, slowly -- 
               but Arly holds her ground -- her eyes never leaving his.

               When Rocklin reaches Arly, he takes her one hand from behind 
               her back, and slowly forcing it up sees what is obviously 
               Clara's letter in her tightly clenched fist. He tries to 
               open her hand, and Arly, knowing she lacks the strength to 
               prevent it, suddenly whips out a knife with her free hand. 
               But that quick, Rocklin grabs the knife hand, and without 
               any apparent effort, wrenches it free of her grasp and tosses 
               it across the room, where it lands on the bunk. Arly relaxes 
               her grip on the letter meanwhile, and Rocklin gets it, and 
               tears it very deliberately, letting the pieces fall at her 
               feet.

               He turns his back on her now, going over to his hat on the 
               floor.

               Arly is furious in her helplessness and humiliation. And 
               Rocklin's smug manner isn't helping any. He picks up his hat 
               and, glancing at Arly, puts his finger once more through the 
               bullet holes.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (smiling wryly)
                         Not bad shootin'.

                                     ARLY
                              (right back at him)
                         You think I did that?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Sure -- to draw us away from here.
                              (looks at his hat)
                         You know, you cut it mighty close -- 
                         Good thing I ain't got brains enough 
                         to fill it.

               Rocklin puts his hat on. He sees Arly looking down at the 
               torn letter.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (suppressing smile)
                         Too bad you had to come 'way up here 
                         through that storm for nothin'.

                                     ARLY
                              (affectedly)
                         I haven't minded a bit --
                              (harshly)
                         -- because I came up to fire you.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Oh --
                              (nods)
                         I see.

               Rocklin goes toward the bunk with his saddlebag.

                                     ARLY
                         Get out of here -- get off the Santee 
                         and don't ever come back.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Mind if I wait for Dave? He ought to 
                         be along any minute -- Be funny if 
                         he winged that shadow of yours.

                                     ARLY
                         If you mean Juan -- you're loco. 
                         He's not even up here.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (mildly surprised)
                         You came up alone?

                                     ARLY
                         Yes.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (half believing her)
                         Then who was that we took out after?

                                     ARLY
                         The man who shot at you.

               Rocklin sits on the bunk and casually picks up Arly's knife.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Who was he?

                                     ARLY
                         I don't know.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         You mean you won't tell.

                                     ARLY
                         I mean I don't know -- Why should I 
                         lie to you?

               That last from Arly brings a kind of smile to Rocklin's face -- 
               a smile that says in effect -- "Are you kidding?" He gets up 
               from the bunk to go to the door, and finding himself still 
               holding Arly's knife, throws it back to her in a seemingly 
               casual manner. It passes too close to Arly for comfort and, 
               Rocklin just opening the door, gets the knife right back -- 
               that close to his ear he feels the breeze. He looks at it, 
               quivering in the door. Then, moving to Arly in what could be 
               construed as a threatening manner, he takes her in his arms 
               and kisses her. Arly is caught completely unaware. Rocklin's 
               action disarms her. But it is, after all, what she really 
               wants, so before the kiss ends, Arly's arms slowly entwine 
               themselves around Rocklin's neck. In the middle of the kiss 
               Rocklin gently but forcefully takes her arms from around his 
               neck and puts her from him.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         I guess you forgot -- you jes' fired 
                         me.

               He goes to the bunk -- picks up his saddlebag, coat, etc., 
               and starts for the door.

               Arly has been silently watching.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (turning near the 
                              open door)
                         So long.

               Dave's voice is heard just outside the cabin door.

                                     DAVE'S VOICE
                         Hey, Rock --

               Dave now rushes through the door, puffing and excited.

                                     DAVE
                         -- He got away -- but guess what, I --

               He sees Arly and pulls up abruptly.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (slowly to Dave)
                         You guess --

               Rocklin gives Arly a disparaging side glance and starts out.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (to Dave, who is trying 
                              to figure things out)
                         Come on.

               EXT. OF CABIN - NIGHT

               Rocklin is headed for the corral as Dave catches up to him.

                                     DAVE
                              (glancing back to the 
                              cabin)
                         Fer a man who's got a despise fer 
                         wimmin, you sure do get all snaggled 
                         up with 'em.

               INT. OF CABIN - NIGHT

               Arly, her back to us, is standing in the open doorway watching 
               the two headed for the corral.

               Her mood is evidenced by the manner in which she suddenly 
               slams shut the door. As she turns and leans against it, we 
               see tears in her eyes, and hear suppressed sobs. Her eyes 
               light on the bits of torn letter, and presently we see her 
               face set itself grimly, and now she walks toward the fireplace 
               and, passing the torn bite of paper, kicks at them viciously.

                                                                   FADE OUT

               FADE IN

               EXT. MAIN STREET - SANTA INEZ - DAY

               LONG SHOT -- of Rocklin as he comes riding into town. As he 
               nears the corner where the stage and Harolday's office is 
               situated, the CAMERA MOVES IN, getting Rocklin and one of 
               the Harolday employees repairing the wooden sidewalk near 
               the hitching rail.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (as he dismounts)
                         You work for Harolday?

               The man nods.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Here's one of his horses -- I'll 
                         pick up my saddle later.

               He enters the building.

               INT. HAROLDAY'S OFFICE - DAY

               PANNING SHOT on Harolday as he sits at the desk working on a 
               ledger. The sound of a door opening is heard. Harolday looks 
               up casually as if expecting a customer, then suddenly gapes. 
               CAMERA PANS to include doorway in which stands Rocklin.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Howdy...

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (frowning)
                         I thought I sent you up to Table-
                         Top.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         That's right.

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (slowly)
                         What happened?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (taking off his hat)
                         Well, this, for one thing.

               He pokes a finger through the hole in the crown. Harolday's 
               eyes narrow.

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (after a little pause)
                         I told you you'd regret letting that 
                         rat Clews off so easy.

               Rocklin looks at him with a queer expression without replying.

                                     HAROLDAY
                         What's the matter? Don't you think 
                         it was him, then?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (slowly)
                         I been figgerin'. Don't seem 
                         reasonable Clews was in condition to 
                         take that sort of chance alone... 
                         Besides -- how could he have known I 
                         was up there -- that soon. And -- 
                         George Clews ain't the only one I've 
                         run contrariwise to in this town. 
                         There's that Mexican, for instance.

                                     HAROLDAY
                         Juan?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         He as good as told me yesterday that 
                         him and me was due for a run-in one 
                         of those days.
                              (suddenly nodding 
                              toward window)
                         And then there's him!

               Harolday looks sharply toward the window.

               EXT. MAIN STREET - SANTA INEZ - DAY

               MED. SHOT from office window. Clint is hurrying across from 
               the direction of the Sun-Up Saloon toward the office.

               INT. OUTER STAGECOACH OFFICE - DAY

               PANNING SHOT on Clint as he enters from street and crosses 
               to the door of Harolday's office.

               INT. HAROLDAY'S OFFICE - DAY

               MED. SHOT on door of inner office with Harolday at desk in 
               f.g. As the door opens it conceals Rocklin from Clint.

                                     CLINT
                              (excitedly)
                         I just heard that -- that Rocklin 
                         was --
                              (sees Rocklin)

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (slowly)
                         Was what?

                                     CLINT
                              (subdued)
                         Was shot at last night.

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (very calm)
                         Mr. Rocklin was just telling me all 
                         about it.
                              (significantly)
                         Any idea who might have done it?

               Clint looks quickly at Harolday and back at Rocklin with 
               frightened eyes.

                                     CLINT
                         Not me.

               Rocklin makes no reply.

                                     CLINT
                         You ain't trying to pin it on me?
                              (his courage returning)
                         'Cause if you are, you're in for a 
                         big disappointment. I was over at 
                         the Sun-Up playing poker with the 
                         Judge and the rest of the boys till 
                         early morning. If you don't believe 
                         me, ask for yourself.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (after a pause)
                         All right. I believe you. But that 
                         don't mean you couldn't tell a thing 
                         or two as would help -- if you wanted.

                                     CLINT
                              (very nervous again)
                         What d'you mean?

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (sharply)
                         Yes. What sort of thing would Clint 
                         here know about, that would help 
                         identify the man who tried to kill 
                         you last night?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         This for one.

               He pulls out the tobacco pouch which Dave found at Table-
               Top.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Ever seen it before?

               CLOSE SHOT

               Clint as he stares wide-eyed at the pouch.

               MED. SHOT

               group, with Rocklin and Harolday both watching Clint intently.

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (harshly)
                         Well, go on -- speak up. Did you 
                         ever see it before?

                                     CLINT
                              (avoiding Harolday's 
                              eye)
                         No. Course I didn't
                              (suddenly raging at 
                              Rocklin)
                         Quit riding me! I don't know nothin' 
                         about it I tell you. Jest because I 
                         had a run-in with you over a game o' 
                         cards, that don't mean I'd sneak up 
                         on you in the dark and...

               Rocklin's disdainful smile takes the speech out of Clint, 
               who just sort of runs out of words. Rocklin hesitates for a 
               second then moves toward the door.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Harolday and Clint are at window looking past camera toward 
               the street. They see Rocklin carrying his saddle, walking 
               toward the Sun-Up. Shorty Davis hails Rocklin, says something 
               to him and points to the Sun-Up. Rocklin leaves, walking 
               faster.

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (frowning deeply)
                         He means trouble.

               He turns from camera toward the desk.

                                     CLINT
                              (still at window)
                         Aw, what do I care.

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (turning on him with 
                              cold fury)
                         Listen, I never did have much use 
                         for you. You're a poor specimen at 
                         the best; but as a would-be bad man 
                         you're nothing but a laughing stock. 
                         Why, the way you lied about that 
                         pouch just now wouldn't have deceived 
                         a six-year old.

                                     CLINT
                         I...

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (harshly)
                         All right, let it go at that. But I 
                         got myself to think of. It wouldn't 
                         suit me at all just now to have you 
                         shown up in public for what you are 
                         by that trouble-shootin' cowhand. My 
                         advice to you is to get out of the 
                         district and stay out.
                              (taking a key from 
                              his vest pocket)
                         You'll find some money in the safe 
                         at the ranch. Take what you need and 
                         put the key in the desk drawer. Now 
                         get.

               INT. UPPER HALL - SUN-UP SALOON - DAY

               Rocklin comes down the hall carrying his saddle and looking 
               at the room numbers. As he nears the f.g. he locates the 
               room he is looking for (it is a room facing toward the rear 
               of the Sun-Up). He knocks. Almost immediately the door opens 
               and Clara stands there -- flushed and embarrassed.

                                     CLARA
                         Oh, Mr. Rocklin --

               INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - DAY

               This is the room in which Clara has arranged to meet Rocklin, 
               who later takes it as his own.

               SHOT at door as Rocklin steps into the room.

                                     CLARA
                         I'm so glad I've found you -- I was 
                         on my way to the Santee and learned 
                         you were in town.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (putting his saddle, 
                              etc., aside)
                         Just got in.

                                     CLARA
                         I feel perfectly awful, running after 
                         you like this, but --

                                     ROCKLIN
                         You got trouble, eh?

                                     CLARA
                         My aunt found out I wrote you and 
                         made a terrible scene --

                                     ROCKLIN
                         You haven't signed everything over 
                         to that Garvey, have you?

                                     CLARA
                         No -- and because I refused, Auntie 
                         said she would sign an affidavit 
                         that I'm still underage, and then, 
                         as my guardian she can do what she 
                         likes.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Got anything to prove you're not 
                         underage?

                                     CLARA
                              (after a slight pause)
                         No -- but Mr. Garvey has a letter 
                         that would prove it. My aunt wrote 
                         it before we came out here.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         S'pose we could get it?

                                     CLARA
                         He'd never give it to me.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (starts for door)
                         Wait here.

                                     CLARA
                              (with a slight start 
                              toward Rocklin)
                         Oh, please -- you --
                              (she hesitates, not 
                              quite sure what to 
                              say)
                         You won't go getting yourself in 
                         trouble -- I -- I'd rather give up 
                         everything -- I mean --

               Rocklin notes her confusion. He regards her with a slight 
               sympathetic smile. Then opens the door and exits.

                                                               DISSOLVE OUT

               DISSOLVE IN

               INT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

               CLOSE SHOT -- a letter written in a bold feminine hand. It 
               reads:

               DEAR MR. GARVEY:

               In answer to your letter of the 25th, kindly be advised that 
               my niece, Clara Caldwell, became of age January 11th of this 
               year. And, although I am no longer her legal guardian, it 
               behooves me, as her nearest kin, to show continued interest 
               in her affairs --

               The CAMERA HOLDS LONG ENOUGH for the letter to be read. And 
               now the letter begins to be consumed in a flame as the CAMERA 
               PULLS BACK showing the burning letter in Judge Garvey's hand. 
               He is standing over the potbellied stove in his office, and 
               Miss Martin is close to him watching the letter burn. Garvey 
               finally lets it fall from his fingers onto the top of the 
               stove. He lifts the lid, lets the remains fall inside, and 
               smiles to Miss Martin.

                                     GARVEY
                         That takes care of that --
                              (crosses to his desk)
                         Now, I'll draw up an affidavit right 
                         away and everything will be taken 
                         care of as we want it.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (not too enthusiastic)
                         I certainly hope so -- it's not myself 
                         I'm concerned about --

                                     GARVEY
                              (getting out the papers)
                         -- Of course not.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         I can't say I'm very happy about 
                         doing this -- I only hope it works 
                         out for the best.

                                     GARVEY
                         It's the better choice of two evils -- 
                         now let's see --
                              (begins to write)
                         I, Elizabeth --
                              (looks at Miss Martin)
                         It is Elizabeth, isn't it?

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Yes --

                                     GARVEY
                         -- Elizabeth Martin, of Danvers, 
                         Massachusetts, do hereby --

               The door opens and Rocklin enters. Miss Martin, who has been 
               pacing nervously, stops in her tracks. Garvey, taken 
               completely by surprise, feigns an affected casualness. Rocklin 
               eyes them both suspiciously as he slowly closes the door.

                                     GARVEY
                              (leaning back in his 
                              chair)
                         Well, Mr. Rocklin, this is indeed a 
                         surprise. Didn't expect to see you 
                         so soon. I understood you were riding 
                         for the Santee.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (coldly)
                         That's right.

               It is quite obvious to Garvey that Rocklin is here on 
               business. He turns to Miss Martin.

                                     GARVEY
                              (to Miss Martin)
                         Perhaps you'd better come back later --

               Miss Martin is in accord with that suggestion, and after 
               giving Rocklin the frigid eye, flounces out, slamming the 
               door.

               Garvey shakes his head, wipes his brow, and is returning to 
               his desk.

               INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

               SHOT -- door to Garvey's office. Miss Martin has her ear 
               glued to the panels. Over scene comes Rocklin's voice.

                                     ROCKLIN'S VOICE
                         I came for that letter.

               Miss Martin reacts.

               INT. OF GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

               SHOT -- Garvey and Rocklin.

                                     GARVEY
                              (calmly)
                         Did you say letter?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         That's right -- the one Miss 
                         Caldwell's aunt wrote from out east 
                         sayin' she was of age. Remember?

                                     GARVEY
                         No -- I'm afraid I don't.

               INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

               SHOT -- door. Miss Martin reacts with nod of satisfaction 
               and leaves.

               INT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

               Rocklin goes to the filing cabinet where he opens the drawer 
               marked "C." As he fingers through the papers, Garvey sits 
               back in his chair, watching.

                                     GARVEY
                         What is your interest in this letter?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         My only interest is getting' it.

                                     GARVEY
                         You realize what this is, don't you? -- 
                         Robbing -- armed robbery at that.

               Rocklin pulls open the "M" drawer.

                                     GARVEY
                         I warn you, you're in for a 
                         disappointment.

               Not finding the letter in the "M" drawer, Rocklin goes to 
               the desk and pulls the handle of one of the drawers. It is 
               locked.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Open up.

                                     GARVEY
                              (has had about enough)
                         Listens, you --
                              (suddenly controls 
                              himself)
                         There's nothing in there that'd 
                         interest you.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (grimly)
                         I'd like to make up my own mind about 
                         that.

                                     GARVEY
                              (forces a chuckle)
                         All right -- I'll open it -- just to 
                         convince you I'm not hiding any 
                         letter.

               Garvey unlocks the drawer and opens it. It is found to contain 
               nothing but two brand new decks of playing cards.

               The UNOPENED DECKS OF CARDS.

               BACK TO SCENE. Garvey seems a little too anxious to close 
               the drawer, and before he can do so, Rocklin has one hand 
               inside. Garvey, checked for a second, looks up at Rocklin.

                                     GARVEY
                         What's the idea?

               Rocklin slowly withdraws his hand, holding one of the decks.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         These cards --

                                     GARVEY
                              (attempting to bluff 
                              it out)
                         Anything wrong in a man having cards 
                         in his possession?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Depends on what kind they are -- 
                         'specially when they're under lock 
                         and key.

               The two regard each other silently a moment. Now Rocklin 
               casually slips the deck he holds into his pocket.

                                     GARVEY
                              (too politely)
                         You're taking those, I presume.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         That's right.

               He takes a step away. Garvey turns him by touching his arm.

                                     GARVEY
                              (has had almost enough)
                         Now, you look here --

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (soberly)
                         You're the one who better start 
                         lookin' -- lookin' for a way out for 
                         killin' Red Caldwell.

                                     GARVEY
                              (blanches)
                         Caldwell --

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (takes up one of the 
                              decks of cards)
                         He found out about these -- and you 
                         went and killed him.

                                     GARVEY
                              (with an affected 
                              smile and unnatural 
                              calmness)
                         And you believe a story like that?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         I will until I hear a better one.
                              (puts deck he holds, 
                              in his pocket)
                         I'll just take this along -- the 
                         district judge at Garden City should 
                         be mighty interested.

               He starts around the desk toward the door. From the corner 
               of his eye he catches Garvey reaching for a gun in the middle 
               drawer. Before he can raise it, Rocklin is on him with a 
               blow that sends Garvey reeling back toward the stove.

               Rocklin starts for the door again, and just misses being 
               struck by a chair which Garvey hurls with vicious fury. The 
               chair crashes against a window.

               EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

               The sound of breaking glass attracts the attention of passers-
               by, as well as Miss Martin seated in her surrey with Sammy, 
               the K.C. China-boy.

               INT. OF GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

               The two are now fighting in earnest.

               VARIOUS FLASHES

               of the fight, intercut with townspeople gathering outside.

               EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

               Dave pulls up in his wagon.

               INT. OF GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

               It is pretty well wrecked. Rocklin has Garvey just about 
               done in. He gives him one final Sunday punch and Garvey goes 
               down and stays down. At that moment, Dave and Pap Fossler 
               enter followed by other curious natives.

                                     DAVE
                         Say -- looks like you two been 
                         disagreein' 'bout somethin' --
                              (to Fossler, who has 
                              gone over to Garvey)
                         He ain't daid, is he?

                                     PAP FOSSLER
                         Not permanently, I don't reckon. -- 
                         What happened, anyways?

                                     DAVE
                              (to Rocklin)
                         You musta found out somethin'.

                                     PAP FOSSLER
                              (with a wink to Dave)
                         I reckon the Judge did, too.

               They exit, and almost immediately Miss Martin enters, and 
               after gaping in horror at the appearance of the place, sees 
               the Judge, who, having regained consciousness, bestirs himself 
               on the floor.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Oh, dear -- dear -- are you hurt?

                                     GARVEY
                              (getting up painfully)
                         Get out of my way --

               Garvey, on his feet now, makes for the door leading to his 
               living quarters at the back of the office. Miss Martin follows 
               him.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (haughtily)
                         Now don't you use that tone of voice 
                         to me --
                              (going through doorway)
                         I'll have you understand I --

               She sees the bed and shrieks upon realizing where she is, 
               and backs out quickly, almost catching the door which Garvey 
               slams in her face.

               EXT. MAIN STREET - SANTA INEZ - DAY

               Rocklin and Dave as they walk from Garvey's office. Dave has 
               a time hopping along against Rocklin's strides.

                                     DAVE
                         -- Find out who owns that tobaccy 
                         pouch yet?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (staring straight 
                              ahead)
                         No -- but get hold of Clint Harolday.

                                     DAVE
                         Clint -- Is he in on it?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Can't say for sure -- Bring him to 
                         the Sun-Up, and don't take no for an 
                         answer.

               Dave leaves and exits from shot in the direction of the stage 
               office. Rocklin goes off toward the Sun-Up.

               EXT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY

               PANNING SHOT. Juan is lounging against the corner of the 
               building, soberly watching Rocklin's approach. As Rocklin 
               comes into the scene he spots Juan, and stops a moment as 
               though deciding whether or not to question him. During this, 
               Juan casually takes his ornamental tobacco pouch from his 
               pocket and begins to roll a cigarette.

               The CAMERA PANS Rocklin to the side of the building and up 
               the outer stairs.

               INT. UPPER HALL - SUN-UP SALOON - DAY

               Rocklin comes through the door and down the hall. He reaches 
               his room, and is about to open the door when he hears a 
               familiar voice inside. He listens.

                                     ARLY'S VOICE
                         -- So now you know the truth. And if 
                         you think you can steal him away 
                         from me, you're welcome to try it.

               Rocklin frowns and enters.

               INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - DAY

               Rocklin steps into the room, holding the door partly open as 
               he focuses his attention on Arly. Clara, who has been sitting 
               in the rocker near the window, gets up and is the first to 
               speak.

                                     CLARA
                              (anxiously)
                         Did you get it?

               Rocklin closes the door.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         No -- but I don't think it's gonna 
                         matter much -- you go on back to the 
                         K.C. and I'll be out in the mornin' 
                         and take you with me to Garden City 
                         to see the district judge.

                                     CLARA
                         But I hate putting you to that 
                         trouble.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         No trouble at all -- I'm going anyway.

                                     ARLY
                              (casually)
                         You look like you've been fighting.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (soberly)
                         What are you doin' here?

                                     ARLY
                         I was just telling Miss Caldwell 
                         about -- well -- you and me.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (his eyes narrowing)
                         What about, you an' me?

                                     CLARA
                              (sensing the static 
                              in the atmosphere)
                         I think I'd better be going...

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (turning quickly from 
                              Arly)
                         Just a minute --
                              (glances at Arly)
                         What all has she been tellin' you?

                                     CLARA
                              (embarrassed)
                         Oh -- oh, really I'd rather not --

                                     ARLY
                              (interrupting)
                         Go ahead, tell him --
                              (looks at Rocklin and 
                              goes on defiantly)
                         -- and I dare him to deny it.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Deny what?

                                     CLARA
                         That she was with you last night at 
                         the cabin in the mountains.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Well -- why should I deny it?...

                                     ARLY
                              (quickly)
                         And didn't you make love to me?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (this is getting a 
                              bit thick for him)
                         Make love to you --

                                     ARLY
                              (forcing her point)
                         You didn't kiss me -- I suppose?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Did you expect me to deny that, too?

                                     ARLY
                              (smiles at Clara)
                         You see?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (to Clara)
                         Now, maybe you ought to hear what 
                         I've got to say --

               Clara is terribly hurt, but struggles to be grown-up about 
               it.

                                     CLARA
                         Please -- you needn't explain. After 
                         all, it really isn't any of my 
                         business, is it?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (in the pause he looks 
                              at Arly)
                         You little --

                                     ARLY
                              (quickly)
                         That's it -- start swearin'--
                              (to Clara)
                         Just like a man.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         If there wasn't a lady here, I'd do 
                         more to you than swear.

                                     CLARA
                         I don't know how I can ever thank 
                         you for trying to help me. I do 
                         appreciate it ever so much --
                              (to Arly)
                         Don't think too harshly of me, will 
                         you -- I --

               Clara can say no more without breaking. So she turns away 
               quickly and hurries out the door. Rocklin does a slow burn 
               as he glares at Arly.

                                     ARLY
                              (sincerely -- after a 
                              pause)
                         She's lovely, isn't she? -- So sweet -- 
                         honest, and helpless.

               Rocklin makes no reply.

                                     ARLY
                         Pity you didn't fall in love with 
                         her, instead of me.

               Arly is being ridiculous now. He ignores her remarks and 
               concentrates his attention on one of his hands -- he may 
               have sprained it slightly in the fight.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         You might's well know right now that 
                         you or no woman is ever goin' to get 
                         me.

                                     ARLY
                         Don't be so sure -- I don't think 
                         I'm doin' so badly.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Don't you?

                                     ARLY
                         Don't you know?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         I know there ain't a dirty trick you 
                         wouldn't play to get what you want.

                                     ARLY
                              (smiling)
                         I always get what I want.

               She takes a folded piece of paper out of her pocket and drops 
               it on the dresser as Rocklin watches her.

                                     ARLY
                         -- See?
                              (opens the door)
                         -- 'Bye now --

               The door closes. Rocklin stands a moment. Now curiosity brings 
               him to the dresser where he takes up the paper and unfolds 
               it.

               CLARA'S LETTER. The torn pieces have all been sorted and 
               pasted together on a sheet of paper

               BACK TO SCENE. Rocklin holds the letter. He is mad. He shakes 
               his head -- What a gal --- Now he is almost smiling -- almost. 
               He folds the letter -- puts it in his pocket. Takes off his 
               gun-belt and hangs it over the rocker near the window, and 
               stretches out on the bed, as we

                                                                   FADE OUT

               FADE IN

               EXT. CALDWELL HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

               ON Clara hurrying toward the front door in a suppressed state 
               of excitement. She has presumably just arrived at the ranch 
               in advance of Miss Martin. She enters the house after a glance 
               toward the gate.

               INT. HALL - CALDWELL HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

               Clara enters hastily and beats a path to the door of her 
               room.

               INT. CLARA'S ROOM - CALDWELL HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

               The door flies open. Clara bursts in, closing the door in 
               the same movement. Her eyes swing to someone o.s. and she 
               freezes to the spot.

               ON

               Miss Martin, standing by the window, cold and threatening. 
               She has not taken the time to remove her hat. After a moment's 
               pause, she moves slowly toward Clara.

               The CAMERA PANS WITH her into a TWO SHOT. Clara, her back 
               pressing harder and harder against the door, becomes more 
               terrified at the other's approach. Miss Martin appraises the 
               girl a short moment and now suddenly slaps her hard across 
               the face. Clara opens her mouth, about to scream, but even 
               stifles this impulse under the cold stare of her aunt.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (quietly but viciously)
                         Whatever is to become of you?

               Clara can only stare as one under an hypnotic spell.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Have you no sense of pride, or 
                         decency? Throwing yourself at that -- 
                         that wretch, like any shameless hussy.

               Clara hasn't moved.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         I thought we'd done with him -- but 
                         no -- you have to run to him and 
                         tell him all our business --

               Clara merely gasps for a breath of air, but Miss Martin, 
               thinking her about to speak, goes on, more forcefully now.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Don't you dare deny it -- you know 
                         very well you told him about that 
                         letter I wrote Mr. Garvey.

               Clara remains silent.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Didn't you? --

               Clara, now utterly broken, moves away. Miss Martin, her eyes 
               still rivited on the girl, follows.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Didn't you?

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               INT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

               The office has been more or less cleaned up since the fight. 
               Garvey is discovered near the window. He has cleaned himself 
               up but bears some evidence of the fight. He is reading a 
               letter as Sammy, the K.C. China-boy, stands waiting near the 
               door.

               LETTER. The message is written in the same bold hand of Miss 
               Martin already seen in the previous letter:

               Mr. Garvey,

               I have just learned that despicable Rocklin person intends 
               to take Clara to Garden City in the morning -- evidently to 
               have you investigated. I thought you had better know about 
               it.

               E.M.

               BACK TO SCENE. Garvey puts the message in his pocket as he 
               addresses Sammy.

                                     GARVEY
                         Tell Miss Martin that I'll take care 
                         of everything.

                                     SAMMY
                         -- You take clare of evelything.

                                                               DISSOLVE OUT

               DISSOLVE IN

               INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - NIGHT

               On Rocklin, stretched across the bed, examining the cards in 
               the light of a lamp.

               EXT. REAR OF SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT

               Garvey comes from around the building's corner and peers 
               furtively through the darkness toward the lighted windows of 
               Rocklin's room.

               EXT. MAIN STREET - SANTA INEZ - NIGHT

               The area in front of the Sun-Up. Dave's wagon pulls up to 
               the hitching rail in front of the saloon. Clint, stripped of 
               his gun, is driving with Dave, alertly watching him. They 
               get down from the wagon and Dave prods Clint toward the corner 
               of the building.

               EXT. SIDE OF SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT

               Garvey has left the spot where we saw him look up to Rocklin's 
               window. We now see him as he rounds a rear corner of the 
               building and goes toward the outer stairs leading to the Sun-
               Up's second floor. He starts up the steps and stops almost 
               immediately and stares o.s.

               ANGEL

               From Garvey's ANGLE as he sees Dave bringing Clint from around 
               in front of the building toward the stairway.

               CAMERA HOLDS

               Garvey steps quickly to the ground and takes up a position 
               around the roar corner. He watches the two men approach the 
               stairway and go up. He moves out of the shot now, going toward 
               the street. The CAMERA HOLDS on the corner, and we see Tala 
               come into view, as though from nowhere, and take the exact 
               position at the building's corner vacated by Garvey only a 
               moment before. It is apparent that he is watching Garvey, 
               and after a momentary pause he too moves stealthily out of 
               the scene.

               INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT

               PANNING SHOT on Rocklin asleep. He is fully dressed, as we 
               last saw him, with the exception of his boots. He is stretched 
               full length on top of the covers. His gun-belt still hangs 
               over the rocker, close to the open window. A knock on the 
               door brings him to a sitting position.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Come in --

               CAMERA PANS TO door as Clint enters reluctantly, followed by 
               the triumphant Dave.

                                     DAVE
                         Here he is, Rock. Caught him jist in 
                         time near the Santee. Headed fer 
                         out, I'd say.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Sit down, Clint.
                              (to Dave, as he reaches 
                              into his pocket)
                         How about goin' down below an' havin' 
                         one on me?

               He tosses Dave a coin, who catches it. Then Rocklin puts on 
               his boots.

                                     DAVE
                              (delighted)
                         Well, now -- that's right thoughtful -- 
                         Holler if you need me.

               Dave exits.

                                     CLINT
                              (belligerently, as he 
                              stands near the window)
                         What's this all about?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (calmly, as he stands 
                              up)
                         It ain't gonna do you any good to 
                         get all het up and tough, kid --

               Rocklin begins rolling a cigarette as he moves toward Clint.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         I just want to ask you a few questions -- 
                         that's all.

               EXT. SIDE OF SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT

               An unidentifiable form is seen moving through the darkness 
               toward the outer stairway. As it nears the stairway, the 
               CAMERA MOVES IN so that as the mysterious figure begins 
               stealthily up the stairs, we see only the feet through the 
               rungs.

               The CAMERA THEN PANS QUICKLY AND ZOOMS INTO A CLOSE SHOT of 
               Juan, across the alley. And now through Juan's eyes we watch 
               the ascent of the mysterious intruder: The Mexican's line of 
               vision gradually raises, then the eyes slowly move across 
               the camera as the dark figure proceeds along to the rear 
               portion of the verandah.

               INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT

               Rocklin finishes rolling his cigarette and lights it.

                                     CLINT
                         I told you once, I don't know who 
                         owns that pouch-- and I don't know 
                         who shot you.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (calmly)
                         Forget it -- that's not what I want 
                         to talk to you about, anyway.

                                     CLINT
                              (harshly)
                         Well, what do you want to talk about? 
                         Come on, get it over with.

               EXT. VERANDAH - REAR OF SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT

               The mysterious form has moved past the darkened windows along 
               the verandah and is nearing Rocklin's lighted room -- stops 
               close to the open window.

               INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT

               SHOT -- Rocklin and Clint.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Clint -- I want you to tell me why 
                         Garvey murdered Red Caldwell --

               Clint tenses -- stares -- finds breathing difficult.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         You know -- don't you?

                                     CLINT
                              (shaking)
                         Me? No!

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Oh yes you do.
                              (advancing on him)
                         And you're going to tell me all about 
                         it.

                                     CLINT
                         I don't know nothing, I tell you -- 
                         I --

               Rocklin slaps Clint's face open-handed, throwing him off 
               balance, then grabs him by the shirt front.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Talk!

                                     CLINT
                         I tell ya, I...

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (hitting him again)
                         Talk!

               Completely terrified, Clint opens his mouth as if about to 
               speak. Suddenly he sees something out of the shot over 
               Rocklin's shoulder and his expression changes. Rocklin looks 
               quickly in the same direction.

               MED. SHOT

               window. A gloved hand has come out of the dark and is reaching 
               through the window for Rocklin's gun in the belt which is 
               hanging over the chair.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Clint and Rocklin. The latter is still looking toward the 
               window. With a swift movement Clint picks up the water jug 
               from the washstand and brings it down on Rocklin's head. As 
               Rocklin falls out of shot, Clint turns to the window with a 
               triumphant smile. Suddenly his expression changes.

                                     CLINT
                              (in a hoarse scream)
                         No! No, don't!

               There is a shot from o.s. and Clint's hands go to his stomach. 
               With a gasp of pain he doubles up and collapses on the floor.

               SHOT

               window. The hand of the killer pitches the gun toward Rocklin 
               and disappears.

               INT. BAR - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT

               Lined up at the bar are Dave, Pap Fossler, Shorty Davis and 
               a few others. Cap is in his usual place. At the poker table 
               are Doc Riding, Sam Haynes, Ab Jenkins and one or two others.

               The shot has evidently been heard, for everything seems to 
               have stopped, and Dave and Pap Fussier are looking up toward 
               the ceiling, as are others. Now Dave snaps back to life -- 
               gulps down his drink, and hurries toward the stairs. As he 
               starts up, the others move slowly in the same direction.

               INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT

               Rocklin is on the floor, groggy. He shakes his head, and as 
               his senses return, he picks up the gun and just gets to his 
               feet as Dave rushes in.

               Dave sees Clint's body on the floor -- notices the gun in 
               Rocklin's hand. He opens his mouth to speak but nothing comes 
               out. All he can do is stare and grimace. The sound of hurrying 
               feet comes from the hall, and presently the mob closes in, 
               crowding the room and the hall.

               Pap Fossler, who has been one of the first to enter, kneels 
               over Clint.

               During this, there are general ad libs from the crowd.

                                     AD LIBS
                         What happened? Who is it? Clint 
                         Harolday -- Etc.

                                     PAP FOSSLER
                         Where's Doc Riding?

                                     AD LIBS
                         Get the Doc. Hey, Doc -- He was down 
                         below. Here he is.

               Doc's voice is heard from the hall as he makes his way through 
               the jam.

                                     DOC RIDING'S VOICE
                         Here I am --

                                     AD LIBS
                         Look out, men -- Let the Doc through. 
                         Etc.

               Doc riding comes through the crowd, kneels beside Pap Fossler. 
               He needs only a glance to know he can be of no use.

                                     DOC RIDING
                              (breaking the silence)
                         Somebody better fetch Harolday.

                                     CAP
                         Shorty's already gone for him.

                                     PAP FOSSLER
                              (getting up)
                         Better get Arly, too.

               A voice is heard from the hall.

                                     VOICE
                         She was at the hotel a while ago.

                                     PAP FOSSLER
                              (looking down at Clint 
                              and shaking his head)
                         He was only a kid.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Rocklin, still holding his gun as he stares down at Clint's 
               body o.s. Now he studies the faces of the mob.

               PANNING SHOT

               of the crowd. There is nothing but a sea of hostile faces.

                                     JACKSON'S VOICE
                         What's goin' on here -- gang way --

               The crowd parts to admit Jackson, who comes stalking in 
               followed by Judge Garvey.

                                     JACKSON
                         What's the trouble here --

               He stops abruptly as he sees Clint's body. Now he levels his 
               eyes on Rocklin.

                                     JACKSON
                              (with a bitter smile)
                         I warned you, didn't I? -- Well, I 
                         guess this is the last trouble you'll 
                         ever make in this town.
                              (extending his hand)
                         Hand over that gun.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Just a minute, now --

               He steps back so no one is behind him. And there is something 
               about his manner and tone that urges Jackson to use 
               discretion.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (to the crowd, 
                              generally)
                         I know it looks bad -- but I didn't 
                         kill the kid.

               The crowd stares in skeptical silence. Even Dave thinks 
               Rocklin is lying, and now does his best to protect his friend.

                                     DAVE
                         I believe you.
                              (to the others)
                         His gun was layin' over there on the 
                         floor when I come in and --

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (cutting in)
                         No it wasn't -- It was right in my 
                         hand -- like it is now.

               Dave winces.

                                     JACKSON
                         If you didn't know him -- then who 
                         did?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         I don't know --
                              (looks at garvey)
                         But I'm going to find out.

               INT. UPPER HALL - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT

               Harolday, followed by Shorty Davis, is making his way down 
               the hall from the inner stair landing. As he nears the crowd 
               gathered at Rocklin's door, Juan comes into view down the 
               hall, having just entered through the door leading out onto 
               the verandah.

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (as he nears Rocklin's 
                              door)
                         Where is he? -- Where's my boy?

               INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT

               Harolday enters, over the ad libs of the mob, followed by 
               Shorty Davis. During the following action, Juan enters and 
               stands near the door, silently taking in everything.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Harolday, as he sees Clint's body and stops dead in horror. 
               He turns to Rocklin.

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (with cold violence)
                         You murderer.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         I didn't do it, Mr. Harolday.

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (quickly)
                         Then who did?

                                     VOICE
                              (from crowd)
                         He had a gun in his hand when we 
                         come in.

                                     GARVEY
                              (smoothly)
                         And I'll bet it's the same one the 
                         bullet that killed Clint came out 
                         of.

               Rocklin gives Garvey a hard, slow look.

                                     HAROLDAY
                         Well, what do you say to that?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         He's right.

                                     GARVEY
                         You admit it.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Yeah -- but that still don't say I 
                         killed him.

                                     AD LIBS
                         Aw, take him away -- Liar -- Lock 
                         him up, Sheriff -- The yellow-bellied -- 
                         Etc.

               ON ARLY AS SHE PUSHES HER WAY THROUGH THE CROWD

               She stares down at Clint. An expression of pity comes over 
               her. Now she looks coldly at Rocklin.

                                     ARLY
                              (softly)
                         Why did you do it?

               MED. SHOT

               with Rocklin in f.g.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         I didn't.

                                     GARVEY
                         He admits it was his gun that shot 
                         him.

                                     ARLY
                              (whose eyes haven't 
                              left Rocklin's)
                         But you didn't fire it.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         That's right.

                                     ARLY
                         What happened?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (slowly)
                         Clint and me was having a bit of an 
                         argument.

                                     ARLY
                              (quickly)
                         What about?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (searching for words)
                         About whether he was going to help 
                         clear up a few things that's been 
                         bothering me and some others 'round 
                         these parts.
                              (looking at Garvey)
                         For instance -- who it was shot Red 
                         Caldwell.

                                     JACKSON
                         Caldwell!

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (still at Garvey)
                         And the K.C. foreman. And who took 
                         that shot at me up at Table-Top last 
                         night. And why certain people are so 
                         anxious to get rid of the Caldwell 
                         girl.

                                     PAP FOSSLER
                         How would Clint know about all that?

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (harshly)
                         He's lying. He's trying to cover up 
                         for killing my boy.

                                     JACKSON
                              (encouraged by the 
                              support)
                         Quit stalling, Rocklin.

               He makes a tentative movement toward Rocklin but Arly 
               intervenes.

                                     ARLY
                         Wait a minute -- he's get a right to 
                         be heard.
                              (to Rocklin)
                         Well, we're listenin'.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Well -- Clint was getting' all set 
                         to talk, when -- somebody snuck up 
                         along the verandah there and pulled 
                         the gun out o' my belt...
                              (indicating the belt 
                              on chair)
                         ... and let him have it.

               There is a moment's amazed silence. Then the crowd breaks 
               into derisive comment.

                                     AD LIBS
                         What a story! What an alibi! String 
                         him up, the heel! Etc.

                                     JACKSON
                              (grinning)
                         You'll have to think up something 
                         better than that Rocklin.

               MED. SHOT

               with Garvey in f.g.

                                     GARVEY
                              (smoothly)
                         Don't be a fool, Rocklin. You know 
                         you can't get away with a yarn like 
                         that. Why don't you save yourself 
                         and everyone else a lot of trouble 
                         by surrendering to the Sheriff? After 
                         all, it isn't such a crime in these 
                         parts to kill a man in self-defense.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Self-defense?

                                     GARVEY
                         Everyone knows what Clint was like. 
                         He probably lost his head and pulled 
                         a gun on you, like he did at the Sun-
                         Up that night. Wasn't that it?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (grimly; after a little 
                              pause)
                         No, that wasn't it. And till I do 
                         what I got to do, I ain't surrenderin' 
                         to anybody -- least of all to your 
                         pal here.
                              (indicates sheriff)
                         If I got to be shot for knowing too 
                         much, it ain't going to be in the 
                         back, in a framed-up jail-break.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Arly, who has been staring at Rocklin in frowning 
               bewilderment.

                                     ARLY
                         But if someone's trying to kill you, 
                         why didn't they do it just now? Why 
                         did they have to kill Clint?

               CLOSE SHOT

               Rocklin.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Guess they wanted to get Clint, too. 
                         Doin' it this way they get us both. 
                         Clint first -- an' me afterwards -- 
                         like I jus' said.

               MED. SHOT

               with Garvey in f.g. Close beside him are Pap and Dave, who 
               watches Garvey closely.

                                     PAP FOSSLER
                         Quit fancy talk. Who's "they?"

                                     ROCKLIN
                         I might be able to tell you that 
                         later.

                                     JACKSON
                              (quickly)
                         No you won't -- because you're comin' 
                         with me.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (raises his gun)
                         Am I?

               The crowd tenses. Rocklin eyes them grimly.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         The first one that moves -- gets it.

               He moves over to the open window, and with his gun leveled 
               on the mob, steps out onto the verandah. Once outside, he 
               suddenly lets the window fall and disappears. A shot from 
               Jackson's gun shatters a pane, during which time there has 
               been a rush to the window. It is Arly and Dave who reach it 
               first, and feigning an attempt to raise the window, they 
               momentarily delay pursuit.

               AT THE DOOR LEADING FROM THE ROOM

               There is the inevitable jam as the pushing, yelling crowd 
               all try to exit at once.

               EXT. REAR OF SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT

               Rocklin, as he picks himself off the ground, having dropped 
               from the verandah. He starts quickly away.

               EXT. WINDOW OF ROCKLIN'S ROOM - NIGHT

               SHOOTING INTO the room, we see Arly and Dave shoved to one 
               side by Jackson and Garvey. The window goes up and Jackson 
               steps out, followed by Garvey, Harolday, Arly, Dave, and 
               others.

               INT. UPPER HALL - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT

               The human jam has been broken, and now the mob dashes wildly 
               toward the stairway, and verandah exit in the b.g.

               EXT. SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT

               The hitching rail in front of the Sun-Up. There are a dozen 
               or so horses tied up to it and close to it is Dave's team 
               and wagon. Rocklin comes from around the corner of the 
               building and races to the hitching rail.

               TOP OF OUTSIDE STAIRS

               Jackson and Garvey come from around the corner of the porch 
               followed by Harolday, Arly, Dave, and others. At the stairs 
               they collide with some of the men who have raced down the 
               hall, only to reach the stairway at the same moment. There 
               is another jam on the landing as the mob all try to get down 
               at once.

               ROCKLIN AT THE HITCHING RAIL

               He has cut the lines of the horses tied to the rail. We see 
               him cutting the last line and fire into the air. The horses 
               rare and stampede.

               THE MOB - WITH JACKSON AND GARVEY LEADING - COME FROM AROUND 
               THE BUILDING

               And now there is a state of utter confusion as the mob and 
               horses rush in all directions as the men try to retrieve 
               their mounts. Rocklin is no where in evidence.

               GARVEY AND JACKSON - AS HAROLDAY JOINS THEM NEAR DAVE'S WAGON

                                     HAROLDAY
                              (sarcastically)
                         Well, Sheriff -- you certainly are 
                         to be congratulated.

                                     JACKSON
                              (harassed)
                         Look, Mr. Harolday -- you saw what 
                         happened --

                                     GARVEY
                              (deeply concerned)
                         Never mind that -- Let's get going 
                         for Garden City -- that's where he's 
                         headed for.

                                     HAROLDAY
                         You sure?

                                     GARVEY
                         I'm positive.

               Dave climbs into his wagon behind the group as Jackson exits 
               quickly.

               EXT. STAGE OFFICE - SANTA INEZ - NIGHT

               At hitching rail. There are four or five horses tied up here. 
               Arly and Juan enter and mount their horses, and almost 
               immediately Garvey and Harolday come hurrying into the scene 
               after two of the other horses.

                                     ARLY
                              (shouts from her horse)
                         Where do you think he's gone?

               Before either of the two men can answer, Jackson's voice is 
               heard shouting o.s.

                                     JACKSON'S VOICE
                         All right, men -- follow me --

               The CAMERA PANS AROUND, getting Jackson, now mounted, as 
               others come riding in. He rares his horse around and starts 
               away followed by the mob, including our principals. They do 
               not get very far when Dave's wagon comes into the shot, going 
               hell-bent in pursuit.

               EXT. ROAD NEAR EDGE OF SANTA INEZ - NIGHT

               The posse riding hard, with Dave's wagon following.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Dave, half standing as he urges his team on. Behind him are 
               the closed flaps of the wagon top.

               WIDER ANGLE

               as a hand reaches out from between the flaps and grasps the 
               reins. Dave takes it, and looks wildly around -- falls back 
               on the seat.

               ON ROCKLIN - AS HIS HEAD COMES FROM BETWEEN THE FLAPS

               CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Dave, smiling broadly. Rocklin 
               is pulling hard on the reins.

                                     DAVE
                         I mighta knowed you'd do somethin' 
                         like this.
                              (as Rocklin slows the 
                              team)
                         What are we doin'?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Headin' for the K.C.

               With that Rocklin starts swinging the team around.

               ON THE WAGON AS IT SWINGS AROUND AND BECOMES LOST IN THE 
               DISTANT NIGHT

                                                                       WIPE

               INT. HALL - CALDWELL HOUSE - NIGHT

               Sammy, the China-boy, is nervously knocking on Miss Martin's 
               door. It opens and Miss Martin is seen slipping a robe over 
               her long Mother Hubbard nightgown, with cap to match.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (impatiently)
                         Now -- what is it?

               Sammy points o.s. -- Miss Martin looks and freezes.

               As she moves down the hall, the CAMERA PANS WITH her until 
               it gets two men standing near the entrance door.

               Now the CAMERA MOVES IN TO A THREE SHOT and we recognize 
               George Clews and his brother, Bob. Bob, his wrist bandaged, 
               takes off his hat at Miss Martin's approach, and George 
               noticing, does likewise.

                                     GEORGE CLEWS
                         The name's Clews, ma'am -- Mr. Garvey 
                         sent us out --

                                     BOB CLEWS
                              (eagerly)
                         Said you were expectin' trouble with 
                         that Rocklin.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         I am.
                              (acidly to George)
                         -- But I'm wondering if you're up to 
                         it. I noticed you didn't fare so 
                         well with him yesterday.

                                     BOB CLEWS
                         He was drunk --

                                     GEORGE CLEWS
                              (quickly)
                         Yeah -- But I'm sober now.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Well, see that you stay that way.

                                     GEORGE CLEWS
                         Don't worry, ma'am -- I've jus' bin 
                         waitin' to get even with that saddle-
                         bum.

               He opens the door.

                                     BOB CLEWS
                              (with that oily smile)
                         We'll be close-by.

                                     GEORGE CLEWS
                              (confidently)
                         You bet.

               They start out.

               INT. CLARA'S BEDROOM - CALDWELL HOUSE - NIGHT

               Clara is seen in her nightgown, listening at the door to her 
               room. The sound of the outer door closing comes over the 
               scene and she hurries to her bed and feigns sleep, and just 
               in time, for the door opens and Miss Martin sticks her head 
               in, and satisfied that Clara is sleeping, exits.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. HIGHWAY - ROAD TO GARDEN CITY - NIGHT

               A raspy voice is heard coming out of the darkness singing a 
               ribald song of the periods. And now Old Zeke, riding his 
               burro, comes into view. As he passes close to the camera, we 
               PAN and get the posse coming out of the darkness in the 
               opposite direction Zeke is travelling.

               As the posse pulls up to Zeke, the CAMERA MOVES IN on a group 
               including Zeke, Jackson, Garvey, Harolday.

                                     JACKSON
                         Seen anybody ridin' hard for Garden 
                         City.

                         Bin on the road since sundown -- 
                         ain't seen a livin' soul -- be he 
                         man or beast.

                         He mighta taken the cutoff through 
                         Jaw Bone Canyon.

                                     HAROLDAY
                         After that storm? -- He'd never make 
                         it.

                                     GARVEY
                         There's only one other place he might 
                         have gone -- the K.C.

                                     JACKSON
                         You think so?

                                     GARVEY
                              (very definitely)
                         I'm positive.

                                     HAROLDAY
                         That's what you said before.

                                     JACKSON
                              (shouting to the posse 
                              milling around)
                         To the K.C., men.

               The posse swings around and starts back toward Santa Inez.

               ARLY AND JUAN

               Arly watches the posse, then turns to Juan.

                                     ARLY
                              (excitedly)
                         Take me through the canyon.

                                     JUAN
                         It is dangerous, senorita.

                                     ARLY
                         But if we get through we'll beat 
                         them to the K.C.

                                     JUAN
                         You would risk your life for Senor 
                         Rocklin?

               Arly does not answer in words. But Juan sees the answer in 
               her eyes. Now she tosses her head defiantly and swings her 
               horse off the road in the direction of the canyon. Juan 
               watches a moment, then spurs his mount after her, as we

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               INT. CLARA'S BEDROOM - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN

               On Clara, tossing fitfully in her bed. Suddenly she sits up 
               as an idea begins to take form in her mind. Now she hurries 
               out of bed, moves stealthily to the door and goes out, leaving 
               her door open.

               INT. HALL - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN

               ON door to Miss Martin's room. Clara comes down the hall to 
               the door. She puts her ear close and listens. Now she opens 
               it cautiously and peers inside. The door to her room is 
               slammed o.s. by a sporadic draft. It startles the girl and 
               she quickly closes Miss Martin's door and hurries away.

               EXT. HIGHWAY - DAWN

               ON the posse, riding hell-bent.

               EXT. JAW BONE CANYON - DAWN

               Arly and Julio, as they slowly pick their way along the 
               difficult trail, skirting a roaring torrent. Julio is leading 
               and close behind him Arly is having a time negotiating the 
               unsteady ground of a landslide.

               ARLY AND JULIO AS THEY STAND CLOSE TO A DANGEROUSLY FORBIDDING 
               PORTION OF JAW BONE CANYON

               She notices Julio staring o.s. and slowly shaking his head.

                                     ARLY
                         Afraid?

               Julio nods his head slowly, deliberately.

                                     JULIO
                         Only for you -- you must not do this -- 
                         I will go through from here alone.

               A faint smile of admiration brushes Arly's face.

                                     ARLY
                         No, -- we're going through together.

               Arly lashes her horse away. Julio realizes the futileness of 
               further pleading and now moves his horse out after Arly.

               EXT. ROAD NEAR KC RANCH - DAWN

               The wagon with Dave and Rocklin coming out of the night.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Dave is driving the team for all it is worth. Rocklin is 
               looking back. He turns to Dave.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         You can ease up now.

                                     DAVE
                         We're just about there.

                                                                   WIPE OUT

               WIPE IN

               EXT. ENTRANCE TO KC RANCH - DAWN

               A wooden gate is swung closed across the roadway. On the 
               gate is a crudely printed weather-beaten sign: K.C. RANCH. 
               Over the scene comes the SOUND of the wagon approaching.

               THE WAGON PULLS UP TO THE GATE

               Rocklin hops out, opens the gate. Dave drives the wagon 
               through. As Rocklin lets go the gate, it swings closed of 
               its own accord.

               EXT. SHED - KC RANCH - DAWN

               The shed is a short distance from the Caldwell house. Bob 
               Clews is standing at a corner of the shed looking o.s. Over 
               the scene comes the SOUND of the wagon.

                                     BOB CLEWS
                              (peering into shed)
                         Hey, George -- George, get up.

               EXT. KC RANCH - DAWN

               The wagon moving slowly through the cottonwoods, along the 
               drive not far from the house. It stops now, and the CAMERA 
               MOVES CLOSER to get Dave and Rocklin as they leave the team 
               and start stealthily toward the house seen in the moonlight 
               in the b.g.

               INT. CLARA'S BEDROOM - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN

               We pick up Clara in the act of nervously pinning on her hat 
               in the dim light of a small lamp. She is fully dressed, and 
               once the hat is on, she looks around anxiously for her top 
               coat which she finds in the closet. She takes the coat and 
               starts hurriedly toward the lamp, sitting on a small taboret 
               near the door. As she bends over to blow it out, her eyes 
               raise and she freezes.

               MISS MARTIN HAS JUST OPENED THE DOOR AND STANDS THERE STARING 
               ICILY FOR A LONG MOMENT

               Now she snaps the door closed without removing her eyes from 
               Clara, and starts forward.

               The CAMERA PULLS BACK to include the two. Clara stands as 
               one under an hypnotic spell.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (in a very low tone)
                         You vile, ungrateful strumpet -- 
                         running away in the night, like a 
                         deceitful sneak-thief --

                                     CLARA
                              (unrestrained)
                         Yes -- I'm running away -- and it's 
                         all your fault -- you're the one 
                         who's been deceitful and sneaking -- 
                         and don't think I don't know what 
                         you intend doing.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (very controlled)
                         -- And don't think I don't know what 
                         you intend doing.

                                     CLARA
                              (crying, as she moves 
                              away)
                         I don't care -- I'm not ashamed of 
                         it -- and nothing you can say or do 
                         is going to stop me.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (hardly above a whisper)
                         You little fool -- if you go to Garden 
                         City with that man -- you stand to 
                         lose everything.

                                     CLARA
                              (stops pacing)
                         But why? -- Why are you being so 
                         secretive? -- If you know something, 
                         why don't you tell me?

               ON DAVE AND ROCKLIN AT THE WINDOW LISTENING

                                     DAVE
                              (nods and mumbles to 
                              himself)
                         Yeah -- why don't you? --

               Rocklin quickly shushes Dave.

               ON MISS MARTIN AND CLARA

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (Unmindful of the 
                              presence of the men)
                         All right, I'll tell you -- Rocklin 
                         is a nephew of the late Mr. Caldwell. 
                         And, as nearest of kin, he stands to 
                         get everything -- according to the 
                         will. Because you are not the old 
                         man's niece, but only his grand-niece.

               DAVE AND ROCKLIN AT THE WINDOW LISTENING - ROCKLIN SOBERLY - 
               DAVE WILD-EYED

                                     MISS MARTIN'S VOICE
                         Rocklin turned up unexpectedly --

                                     CLARA'S VOICE
                         And you and Mr. Garvey knew the truth 
                         all the time?

                                     MISS MARTIN'S VOICE
                         Yes.

               If Dave keeps quiet any longer he'll burst. He spins Rocklin 
               around and speaks in his natural voice.

                                     DAVE
                         -- And you knew the truth all the 
                         time, too -- didn't you? -- No wonder 
                         you stuck around --

               From Rocklin's expression it is quite apparent to Dave that 
               he is right.

               CLARA AND MISS MARTIN

               Both women are staring dumbly toward the window. Now the 
               realization that she has been overheard staggers Miss Martin. 
               She utters a stifled scream and, seeing Rocklin starting 
               through the window, runs from the room.

               ROCKLIN - JUST INSIDE THE ROOM - TURNS TO DAVE

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Get in here and take care of her.

               Dave scrambles through the window and hurries in pursuit of 
               Miss Martin. Rocklin is at Clara's side.

               EXT. CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN

               Bushes near the house. George and Bob Clews are crouched, 
               watching.

                                     GEORGE CLEWS
                         Come on --

               They move out.

               EXT. ROAD BETWEEN SANTA INEZ AND THE KC RANCH - DAWN

               The posse riding hard.

               EXT. JAW BONE CANYON - DAWN

               We see Arly and Julio as they descend a steep embankment 
               toward the raging torrent. They both are riding Julio's horse.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Arly and Julio; Arly seated behind Julio, considerably 
               disheveled and sobbing.

                                     JULIO
                              (comfortingly)
                         You are crying, senorita --?

                                     ARLY
                              (lying bravely)
                         No.

                                     JULIO
                              (knows she is)
                         It is too bad we lose your horse. 
                         She was good horse, for sure.

                                     ARLY
                         If only we make it in time.

               As they move away into a longer shot, a huge boulder comes 
               crashing down the canyon side, across their path, and tumbles 
               with a great roar and splash into the torrent.

               INT. CLARA'S BEDROOM - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN

               Clara is talking feverishly to Rocklin.

                                     CLARA
                         -- And I heard one of them tell my 
                         aunt not to worry, that he was just 
                         as anxious as she was to get even 
                         with you.

               Dave enters from the hall carrying Miss Martin over his 
               shoulder. He has her wrapped in a sheet and bound up in 
               tassled curtain cord.

                                     DAVE
                              (as Clara and Rocklin 
                              react)
                         This is the only way I could handle 
                         her.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         The Clews are around here some place -- 
                         Garvey sent 'em out.

               CLOSE TWO SHOT

               George and Bob Clews at the window. George has his gun 
               leveled, and a dirty smile twists his face.

                                     GEORGE CLEWS
                         You bet we're around.

               The CAMERA PULLS BACK as George Clews climbs into the room, 
               followed by Bob. They disarm both Rocklin and Dave as Clara 
               watches helplessly, and Miss Martin struggles in her wrapping.

                                     GEORGE CLEWS
                              (to Bob)
                         Untie her.

                                     BOB CLEWS
                              (to Dave)
                         Untie her.

               Dave puts Miss Martin down and begins undoing her as Bob 
               covers him with his gun.

               The posse riding.

               EXT. MOUTH OF JAW BONE CANYON - FLAT COUNTRY - DAWN

               Arly and Juan leave the hazardous trail behind and now start 
               across the flat on a run.

               INT. CLARA'S BEDROOM - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN

               Dave has unwrapped Miss Martin and she gets to her feet 
               bristling.

                                     GEORGE CLEWS
                              (to Bob)
                         Now tie him up.
                              (indicates Dave)

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (quickly, as she picks 
                              up the tassled cord)
                         I'll take part in this -- you -- you 
                         hairy beast.

               Bob Clews tosses the sheet over Dave's head. And as Dave 
               struggles,

               ROCKLIN AND GEORGE CLEWS

               Rocklin thinks he has George off guard and makes a pass at 
               him. But George is on the alert and strikes Rocklin on the 
               head with his pistol.

               ON CLARA AS ROCKLIN GOES DOWN

               She utters a choked cry and falls to the floor in a faint.

               WIDER ANGLE

               as Miss Martin comes to Clara and kneels beside her.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Help me get her to the bed.

               FULL SHOT

               of the room. Bob Clews has Dave securely tied, and now assists 
               Miss Martin in getting Clara to the bed.

                                     GEORGE CLEWS
                              (indicating Rocklin 
                              on the floor)
                         What'll we do with 'em?

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Take them in to Mr. Garvey and tell 
                         him I must see him at once.

                                     BOB CLEWS
                              (triumphantly)
                         We'll dump them right in the Judge's 
                         lap.

               George Clews picks up the unconscious Rocklin.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (still administering 
                              to Clara)
                         Hadn't you better tie him, too?

                                     GEORGE CLEWS
                              (to Bob, after a 
                              second's pause)
                         Get some more rope.

               Bob hurries to do so.

               EXT. ROAD TO THE KC RANCH - DAWN

               The posse riding.

               EXT. KC RANCH - DAWN

               Dave's wagon. Bob Clews is seen dumping Dave into the rear 
               of the wagon. George Clews stands near him with Rocklin's 
               unconscious form over his shoulder. Now he puts Rocklin in.

                                     GEORGE CLEWS
                         Get our horses and meet me at the 
                         gate.

               Bob runs after the horses. George gets onto the wagon seat -- 
               swings the team around and heads for the gate.

               EXT. FLAT LAND NEAR THE KC RANCH - DAWN

               Arly and Juan riding hard.

               EXT. ENTRANCE TO THE KC RANCH -DAWN

               George Clews sits in the wagon waiting for Bob, who now comes 
               out of the darkness with their horses. He dismounts, ties 
               the horses to the back of the wagon, comes around in front 
               to the gate. He is about to swing it open when he looks past 
               the camera at Arly and Juan, who now pull up to the outside 
               of the gate. Arly dismounts quickly, her gun in her hand. 
               Bob Clews backs up toward the wagon as Arly walks through 
               gate.

               CLOSE SHOT

               of Arly.

               CLOSE SHOT

               George Clews on the wagon seat. He is smiling and is going 
               to try to bluff it out.

                                     GEORGE CLEWS
                              (to Arly)
                         What are you doin' with that gun, 
                         Arly?

               CLOSE SHOT

               Arly.

                                     ARLY
                         Get down from there before I show 
                         you.

               INT. OF WAGON - DAWN

               Rocklin has regained consciousness and listens.

                                     GEORGE CLEWS' VOICE
                         Now listen, Arly -- this ain't your 
                         wagon --

                                     ARLY'S VOICE
                         Neither is it yours -- Get down out 
                         of there -- before I knock you down.

               Rocklin recognizes Arly's voice. Now he raises himself up 
               over the tailboard and falls out.

               EXT. REAR OF WAGON - DAWN

               The horses tied in back shy as Rocklin falls to the ground.

               EXT. FRONT OF WAGON - DAWN

               Arly, as she takes it and starts toward the rear of the wagon.

               BOB CLEWS - STANDING CLOSE TO GEORGE - WHO IS STILL ON THE 
               SEAT - SEES HIS CHANCE TO GET ARLY AND SLOWLY REACHES FOR 
               HIS GUN

               He no more than gets it out when a knife whirls in from o.s., 
               getting him in the small of the back.

               JUAN

               He sits calmly astride his horse, his gun leveled on George 
               Clews.

               EXT. REAR OF WAGON - DAWN

               Arly is cutting the rope binding Rocklin.

                                     ARLY
                         -- And they're headed this way and 
                         should get here any minute --

               Rocklin gets to his feet. Arly notices something shining on 
               the ground where Rocklin lay. She picks it up. It is the 
               tobacco pouch with the steer's head of hammered silver.

                                     ARLY
                         Where'd you get this?

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (taking the pouch)
                         That belongs to the man who shot at 
                         me on Table-Top -- Dave found it.

               INT. OF WAGON - DAWN

               On Dave's Wrapped form, kicking the wagon tailboard. Arly's 
               head appears between the flaps above the tailboard and as 
               Dave groans and kicks, she takes her knife and slits the 
               rope binding him.

               EXT. FRONT OF WAGON - DAWN

               Rocklin has come to George clew and we see him wrest the gun 
               from his hand and yank George down from the wagon seat. Once 
               down, he lets him have a hard right that sends him sprawling.

               ON GEORGE CLEWS GETTING UP OFF THE GROUND AND ROCKLIN CLOSING 
               IN

               They start fighting viciously. Arly rushes in crying wildly.

                                     ARLY
                              (trying to stop Rocklin)
                         You've got to get away -- they'll be 
                         here -- they'll catch you --

               CLOSE SHOT

               Rocklin. There is but one thought in his enraged mind -- 
               Clews. He tears into him again.

               ON ARLY AS DAVE JOINS HER

                                     ARLY
                              (frantically)
                         You've got to stop him -- he's got 
                         to get away.

               THE FIGHT - AS DAVE AND ARLY FUTILELY ATTEMPT TO BREAK IT UP

               ON DAVE AS HE GETS IN THE WAY OF ONE THAT SITS HIM DOWN

               ON THE FIGHT AS ROCKLIN GETS IN A SUNDAY PUNCH THAT SENDS 
               GEORGE BACKWARD INTO A SHALLOW DITCH OUT OF SIGHT

               ON GEORGE CLEWS LYING UNCONSCIOUS IN THE DITCH

               The posse approaching.

               EXT. FRONT OF WAGON - DAWN

               Rocklin, Arly, Dave, Rocklin is about done in from the fight.

                                     DAVE
                              (anxiously)
                         Come on -- let's git goin' --

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (as he walks to wagon)
                         Where's the girl?

                                     DAVE
                         Back at the house --

                                     ROCKLIN
                         We've got to get her.

                                     ARLY
                         You haven't time -- they're coming -- 
                         don't you believe me? --

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (to Dave)
                         Come on --

               Arly's plea goes unheeded and he starts away toward the house 
               on the run.

                                     DAVE
                              (mutters)
                         Stubborn as an ole mule.
                              (shouts)
                         You're puttin' a rope around your 
                         neck --

               Dave runs after Rocklin.

               ARLY AND JUAN - ARLY CLIMBING HURRIEDLY UP ONTO THE WAGON 
               SEAT

                                     ARLY
                         Get him --
                              (indicates Bob Clews)
                         -- out of sight, and follow me.

               She takes up the reins now and swings the team around and 
               off the road into the thickness of the trees.

               EXT. CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN

               Rocklin and Dave. They are approaching the house warily.

                                     DAVE
                              (softly)
                         But what'll we do with the ole lady?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Anything you like.

                                     DAVE
                         I'd like to pizen her.

               EXT. GROVE OF COTTONWOODS NEAR GATE - DAWN

               Arly is seated on the wagon seat looking toward the gate as 
               Juan comes in on his horse.

                                     ARLY
                              (pointing o.s.)
                         Look.

               EXT. ENTRANCE TO KC RANCH - DAWN

               At gate. The posse rides up. The gate is swung open and they 
               ride through.

               EXT. GROVE OF COTTONWOODS NEAR GATE-DAWN

               At wagon. Arly jumps to the ground and speaks to Juan.

                                     ARLY
                         Come on.

               As she starts toward the house, Juan dismounts and follows.

               EXT. FRONT OF CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN

               The posse comes riding in. Jackson, Garvey, Harolday, and a 
               few others dismount and go toward the door.

               ARLY AND JUAN

               as they move stealthily into a spot shielded by undergrowth, 
               which gives them full view of the front and one side of the 
               house.

               INT. CLARA'S BEDROOM - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN

               Miss Martin is coming into the room with a glass and a pill 
               for Clara, who is still stretched on the bed.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         If you'll just take this -- you'll 
                         go to sleep --

               The sound of someone knocking on the front door comes over 
               the scene. Miss Martin exits hurriedly.

               EXT. FRONT OF CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN

               At front door. Miss Martin opens the door, confronting Jackson 
               and the group. She is bewildered.

                                     JACKSON
                         Evenin' ma'am -- hate to bother you 
                         like this, but --

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (seeing Garvey, 
                              interrupts)
                         I'm so glad you've come, Mr. Garvey, 
                         the most awful --
                              (as though seeing the 
                              crowd for the first 
                              time)
                         -- Why -- what are all these people 
                         doing here?

                                     GARVEY
                         We're after Rocklin -- has he been 
                         here?

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (smugly)
                         Oh yes -- here and gone.

                                     JACKSON
                         What!

                                     GARVEY
                              (astounded)
                         Gone --

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (triumphantly)
                         Yes -- the two men you sent out are 
                         taking him and that horrid old man 
                         back to town.

                                     GARVEY
                         The Clewses -- funny we didn't see 
                         them.

                                     JACKSON
                         Somethin' musta gone wrong -- We 
                         better fan out and see what's goin' 
                         on.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (quickly)
                         Don't leave, Mr. Garvey -- I've got 
                         to talk with you, privately --

               As all but Garvey and Harolday go back to their horses, Garvey 
               speaks.

                                     GARVEY
                         But, madam --

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         It's very important.

               Garvey looks at Harolday in a manner evidencing his distaste 
               and impatience.

                                     HAROLDAY
                         We'll go on and meet you in town.

                                     GARVEY
                         Perhaps you'd better.
                              (calls to Jackson 
                              o.s.)
                         I'll meet you in town, Jackson.

                                     JACKSON'S VOICE
                         Right -- come on, men.

               The sound of running horses comes over the scene as Harolday 
               hurries away and Garvey enters the house.

               ON HAROLDAY AS HE GOES TO HIS HORSE

               He starts to mount, but instead leads the horse into the 
               bushes close to where Juan and Arly are watching.

               ARLY AND JUAN - WATCHING

               INT. HALL - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN

               Miss Martin and Garvey have been talking. Garvey paces 
               nervously.

                                     GARVEY
                              (quickly, as he turns 
                              to Miss Martin)
                         -- And you're positive he knows 
                         everything?

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Absolutely everything -- He was 
                         standing at the window all the time -- 
                         the scoundrel.

               INT. CLARA'S BEDROOM - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN

               Rocklin has his ear glued to the door. He can't help but 
               smile at Miss Martin's reference to him. Dave is behind the 
               curtain at the window, watching the outside. Clara is close 
               to Rocklin.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (whispers)
                         You better get back on the bed -- in 
                         case they come in here.

               Clara tiptoes away.

               EXT. FRONT OF CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN

               Arly and Juan, as they watch Harolday approach the house and 
               go to the hall window.

               INT. HALL - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN

               Garvey and Miss Martin. Garvey is still pacing very nervously. 
               He is trying to think of his next move.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         If you were to ask me, I think the 
                         best thing to do is --

               Garvey stops and glares.

                                     GARVEY
                              (irritably)
                         I'm not asking you -- and don't bother 
                         me with your silly questions -- we've 
                         got to do something besides talk.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (drawing herself up)
                         You mean -- you have to do something.

               Garvey stops and looks at her again.

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         -- This was all your idea, remember.

                                     GARVEY
                              (tossing it off)
                         My idea -- that's all you know about 
                         it.

               THE DOOR TO CLARA'S BEDROOM

               It is open and Rocklin stands there looking o.s.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         If there's anybody else in on it -- 
                         speak up, Judge.

               ON GARVEY AS HE WHIPS AROUND AND STARES AT ROCKLIN

               ON MISS MARTIN - GAPING OPEN-MOUTHED

                                     MISS MARTIN
                         Well -- I do declare --

               She can say no more.

               FULL SHOT

               Rocklin steps away from the door, where Dave and Clara now 
               stand. He has Garvey covered. Dave is pointing his gun, and 
               grimacing at Miss Martin.

               EXT. FRONT OF CALDWELL HOUSE -DAWN

               At hall window -- on Harolday watching.

               INT. HALL - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN

               Garvey is stepping back, in a cold sweat, toward Miss Martin, 
               as Rocklin advances toward him.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (to Garvey, quite 
                              casually)
                         Talk.

               Miss Martin opens her mouth, about to speak.

               FLASH

               of Dave.

                                     DAVE
                              (blasting, to Miss 
                              Martin)
                         Not you.

               CLOSE SHOT

               Miss Martin. Her mouth snaps shut like a trap.

               THREE SHOT

               Garvey, Rocklin, Miss Martin. Rocklin takes the tobacco pouch 
               out of his pocket.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (to Garvey)
                         Ever see that before?

                                     GARVEY
                              (blanches)
                         No -- it's not mine.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Tell me whose it is.

                                     GARVEY
                              (shaking)
                         No -- no -- I don't know --

               EXT. FRONT OF CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN

               Harolday at hall window. He raises his gun -- he is about to 
               fire when a knife whirls out of nowhere and sticks in the 
               window frame, inches from Harolday's head. He spins around 
               and stares wildly here and there at the darkness.

               GROUNDS AND BUSHES NEAR THE FRONT DOOR - FROM HAROLDAY'S 
               ANGLE

               There is no one in evidence.

                                     ARLY'S VOICE
                         Drop that gun.

               ON HAROLDAY AT THE HALL WINDOW - STARING HARD - TRYING TO 
               LOCATE THE VOICE

               He drops the gun. Arly and Juan come in to him. Arly has him 
               covered.

               The CAMERA PULLS BACK to a WIDER ANGLE, getting the front 
               door as it is opened by Rocklin, who evidently heard Arly.

               AT FRONT DOOR

               Arly is prodding Harolday into the scene.

                                     ARLY
                              (to Rocklin)
                         He was just getting ready to finish 
                         you off, through that window.

               INT. HALL - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN

               Harolday is herded inside, close to Garvey and Miss Martin.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (almost enjoying this)
                         You seem to like to do business 
                         through windows, Mr. Harolday.

               In the pause Harolday remains sneeringly silent.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         You're not Clint's killer, by any 
                         chance --

                                     ARLY
                              (cutting in)
                         By one bad chance --
                              (glares at Harolday)
                         Juan saw you do it.

               Harolday looks at Juan, who slowly nods.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Well, now we're gettin' some place --

               He brings up the tobacco pouch. But before he can ask about 
               it, Arly speaks.

                                     ARLY
                         That pouch is his --
                              (indicates Harolday)
                         Juan made it for him a long time 
                         ago.
                              (to Juan)
                         Didn't you?

               Juan nods.

               Rocklin, with a sudden transition, speaks to Harolday in a 
               hard, threatening tone.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (to Harolday)
                         Why did you kill Caldwell?

               Harolday doesn't answer. He finally looks at Garvey in 
               desperation. Perspiration runs down Garvey's forehead. 
               Suddenly Harolday makes a mad dash for the door. Rocklin 
               shoots, but Arly pushes his arm and sends the shot wild. 
               Rocklin looks at her in amazement. Julio hurries out.

               EXT. FRONT OF CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN

               On Harolday as he rushes madly across the clearing toward 
               the bushes where his horse waits.

               The CAMERA SWINGS BACK to the porch in time to catch Julio 
               crossing it in pursuit of Harolday. Arly and Rocklin come 
               through the open door and stand on the porch watching.

               THE BUSHES WHERE HAROLDAY'S HORSE IS HIDDEN - ARLY AND 
               ROCKLIN'S ANGLE

               They see Julio disappear in the brush. For a moment nothing 
               happens; now Harolday's horse bolts out, riderless, and 
               gallops away. Now Julio comes slowly into view. He moves 
               slowly and deliberately back toward the house.

               AT PORCH

               Julio comes in to Rocklin and Arly. The three exchange 
               significant glances as we

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               INT. HALL - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN

               In the hall are Clara and Miss Martin, Rocklin, Arly and 
               Julio, Dave and Garvey. Garvey is seated and has evidently 
               been talking in the way of confession.

                                     GARVEY
                         -- Harolday wanted the K.C. like he 
                         wanted the Santee and the Hardman 
                         place, for his land scheme -- He 
                         planned on breaking up the ranches 
                         into small holdings and selling to 
                         dirt farmers. He pretended to be on 
                         the outs with me so I could get 
                         Caldwell's confidence. And when Red 
                         caught me with the crooked cards and 
                         threatened to expose me -- Harolday 
                         shot him.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Why did he kill Clint? An' not me?

                                     GARVEY
                         That shot was an accident -- it was 
                         meant for you. We planned on getting 
                         the women to let me handle their 
                         business --

                                     MISS MARTIN
                              (interrupting, furious)
                         -- And do us out of everything --
                              (moves close to Garvey)
                         You vile -- wicked -- despicable --

               She is beside herself in her anger -- and taking up a large 
               vase sitting nearby, she smashes it to pieces over Garvey's 
               head. Garvey goes down unconscious. Miss Martin rushes to 
               her room screaming. Clara follows her.

               ON DAVE GRINNING BROADLY - ROCKLIN COMES TO HIM

                                     ROCKLIN
                         When he wakes up -- we'll have him 
                         put everything on paper.

                                     DAVE
                         Well, you'll have to do the writin' -- 
                         'cause I don't know how to write.

               CLARA HURRIES BACK TO THE GROUP FROM UP THE HALL

                                     CLARA
                              (genuinely concerned)
                         Oh, Mr. Rocklin -- please -- I think 
                         Auntie is out of her mind -- she's 
                         in her room -- laughing.

                                     DAVE
                              (grimaces)
                         What that ole pelican needs is a 
                         good spankin'.

                                     ARLY
                              (who has been silently 
                              listening)
                         And I'll bet you're just the one who 
                         can do it.

                                     DAVE
                              (his eyes flash with 
                              an idea)
                         Yeah -- I believe I am.
                              (looks at the group)
                         I know I am.

               He starts away down the hall, rolling up his sleeves. 
               Rocklin's eyes wander to Clara, who seems quite at a loss. 
               Now he moves slowly toward her. In the b.g. Arly watches 
               Rocklin's every move.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         I guess there's no rush for you to 
                         get to Garden City, now --

               After a slight pause in which she becomes conscious of Arly, 
               Clara speaks.

                                     CLARA
                         No -- I don't suppose there's any -- 
                         rush --

               There is another short pause. Rocklin glances at Arly, and 
               Arly assuming they want to be alone, turns and goes out the 
               door, leaving Julio attending Garvey.

                                     CLARA
                              (after Arly goes)
                         If I was like her, I'd stay in the 
                         West.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         That means you're goin' back East -- 
                         Cousin Clara?

                                     CLARA
                              (smiles, nods)
                         It's where I belong -- I know that 
                         now --

                                     ROCKLIN
                         It's good to know where you Belong, 
                         I reckon -- Wish I knew.

                                     CLARA
                              (wistfully)
                         I can tell you -- you belong with 
                         her --

               Rocklin takes it -- a faint smile brushes his face. He turns 
               now and walks out.

                                                               DISSOLVE OUT

               DISSOLVE IN

               EXT. GROUNDS NEAR CALDWELL HOUSE - SUN-UP

               Arly is seated on the shaft of an old wagon. The first rays 
               of the morning sun streak through the trees across her as 
               she smiles wistfully down at the antics of a little woodchuck 
               cavorting on the ground close to her. In a moment Rocklin 
               comes into view in the b.g. He spots Arly, who has her back 
               to him, and walks over. His approach frightens the woodchuck 
               away, and turns Arly's head toward him. Neither has anything 
               to say. Now Rocklin sits beside Arly, but faces the other 
               way.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (after a pause)
                         Thanks.

                                     ARLY
                         For what?

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Everything.

               There is another stilted pause.

                                     ARLY
                              (her eyes sweeping 
                              the morning)
                         Beautiful day.

                                     ROCKLIN
                              (reflecting)
                         It didn't start out so beautiful.

                                     ARLY
                         That's true of lots of things.

                                     ROCKLIN
                         Fer instance?

                                     ARLY
                              (hesitantly)
                         Well -- you and -- me.

               There is another pause. But worlds are being said in the 
               language of eyes. Their heads move closer and now Rocklin's 
               arms sweep around the girl and they kiss.

          1 SUMMER. POSY DRAWING 1

                         

          2 EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 2

           Andy Cobb, early thirties, is digging an English garden in
           the hot sun. He is lean, naked to the waist. It's hard to
           tell which century he inhabits. Only when he stops to drink
           from a plastic bottle do we realise he is of our time.

           TESS (V.O.)
           And love slipped the bonds of
           restraint...
           At a table under a willow tree sits Tess - early fifties,
           funky specs - at a laptop. She pauses in her typing, staring
           at Andy.

           TESS (V.O.)(CONT'D)
           His touch was like a cosmic `yes'.
           Underneath a converted barn, cross-legged on a bench in a
           bikini top, sits Eustacia. She is hunched over a note pad,
           writing at tremendous speed, oblivious to all but her work.

           EUSTACIA (V.O.)
           `Fuck you,' screamed Kelly, `Fuck
           you to hell!' Scott stepped back
           from the cell door as the gob of
           spit flew.'

          1A INT. DAY. GLEN'S ROOM. 1A

           Sitting at a barn window is American academic Glen McCreavy ;
           a physically awkward man, more at home with his intellect
           than his body. He is surrounded by foolscap, post-it notes,
           books and markers - dominated by a poster of a dour Victorian
           - Thomas Hardy. He is writing. 

           GLEN (V.O.) 
           This complex contemporary matrix is 
           what Hardy meant by `the ache of 
           modernism.' 
           He regards it. 

                          GLEN
           Crap.
           He deletes it. He looks at his blank screen, breathing
           deeply. The only words left say `Chapter Six'.

           NICHOLAS (V.O.)
           Inchcombe had seen it all before.
           He'd seasoned it: the metallic
           smell of blood and gunshot;
           forensics hunched like vultures.
           The dreadful mundanity of murder,
           he thought.



                         

                         

                         

          3 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - NICHOLAS' SHED. 3

           Nicholas Hardiment writes fluidly with pencil and paper. A
           good-looking man of fifty. Dark hair, strong figure.

           NICHOLAS (V.O.)
           He approached Patel, who was
           stricken. She was one for whom a
           corpse was still an obscenity.
           Inchcombe realised a disturbing
           truth. His lack of feeling was
           almost...
           (He stops writing. Sighs)

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
           Pathological...

                         

          4 EXT. DAY. EWEDOWN - THE PLAYGROUND. 4

           A playground on the edge of an idyllic English village. Jody
           Long - fourteen, skinny, restless - is lying at the bottom of
           the slide gazing at the clouds. Casey Shaw, her shy, placid
           best friend, is sitting on a toddler toy, reading aloud from
           a magazine.

                          CASEY
           `I've been wearing the wrong size
           all my life,' said Katie. `I was
           always popping out. Turns out I'm a
           30GG,' she says. `Now my bras
           finally fit - though Simon prefers
           me without one.'
           Jody checks to see if her breasts have grown. She sighs.

                         

          4A INT. DAY. KITCHEN. 4A

           A woman in an upmarket apron is taking a tray of scones and
           biscuits out of the aga. It's Beth Hardiment. Once pretty,
           she's now mumsy and countrified.
           She examines her baking, satisfied with its perfection.
           Mary, the help, is doing the washing-up.

                          BETH
           Do you think I should be reminding
           them to drink enough? It's very hot
           out there...

                          MARY
           Beth - they're writers, not babies.
           You run round after `em too much.

           Glen walks outside, breathing in the fresh air. Beth
           approaches with her tray of scones and biscuits.

                          BETH
           Can I tempt you, Glen?

                          GLEN
           Wow, thanks.
           Glen picks up a scone.

                          BETH
           I often take something snacky down
           to Nicholas at this time of day. I
           know how the brain needs feeding.
           How are you settling in?

                          GLEN
           Great. The last writer's retreat I
           stayed at kind of froze my balls off,
           you know?

                          BETH
           Oh.

                          GLEN
           Screeching firedoors, curried
           lasagne and a needy poet - from whom
           I still bear the scars.

                          BETH
           We try to keep it peaceful here;
           far from the madding crowd.

                          GLEN
           Well, it's paradise.

                         

          6 EXT. DAY. EWEDOWN - VILLAGE STREET. TRIANGLE. 6

           The blight on this rural paradise is a vandalised bus shelter
           near the only T-junction in the village. A twee shop, hanging
           baskets and Grade II listed buildings make up the view. It's
           shatteringly dull.
           Casey and Jody walk up towards the bus shelter. Their boredom
           is epic.

           An open-topped BMW goes past and halts briefly by the
           junction. The tones of Classic FM blare out, much to the
           enjoyment of the middle aged couple within.

                          CASEY
           Frock horrors. This weeks top of
           the shocks goes to Katie Pound in
           an off the shoulder lime by
           Roberto.

           She looks like a bug.
           (Car hoots) Wankers!

                          CASEY
           You wanna sack your stylist girl.

                          JODY
           Bet they did that on purpose,
           dressed her up like an insect.
           Casey agrees. They zoom away.

                         

          7 EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD. THE GROUNDS. 7

           Glen lowers himself into a comfy garden chair, his mouth full
           of cream and jam. Behind him, Nicholas' shed.

           Nicholas is panicking down the phone.

           In Ewedown? Nadia, what the ffff
           are you doing there? I haven't told
           her yet.

           Nadia is walking up the road from the station in her high
           heels, carrying an overnight bag. She is weeping into her
           phone.

                          NADIA
           Why not? You keep saying you want
           to be with me.
           Jody and Casey are all ears.

                          NICHOLAS
           I can't tell her just like that.
           It's twenty five years; a marriage.

           NO, NO DON'T!

                          NADIA
           I want to be with you. I thought
           you'd be pleased...

                         

          8B POV. EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD / INT. DAY. NICHOLAS' SHED 8B

           Through the window Nicholas sees Beth leaving a scone by
           Diggory, a sleeping poet in a pretentious hat.

                          NICHOLAS
           Of course I'm pleased... Nadia, go
           to the pub and stay there. I'll come
           when I can.

                          NADIA
           Are you going to tell her?

                          NICHOLAS
           Just give me a couple of hours -
           He ends the call just as Beth is nearing the door - panicking
           the phone back on to its holder.

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
           Cock pie.
           Beth opens the door to see Nicholas apparently hard at it.

                          BETH
           How's the worker?

                          NICHOLAS
           Good actually. Just about to embark
           on forensics.

                          BETH
           Well give me your pages and I'll get
           started.
           Nicholas hands her several pages.

                          NICHOLAS
           Reckon I might pack it in a bit
           early today. Need to think about my
           blood smears. Might take a drive;
           have a pint. Stir the old grey
           matter up.

                          BETH
           Who were you talking to just then?

                          NICHOLAS
           Judy. She says the Impala contracts
           should be through in a day or two.

          Beth immediately knows he is lying. The lie pains her. She
          goes to the door.

           Beth decides to try and call his bluff.

                          BETH
           I could come with you.

                          NICHOLAS
           What?

                          BETH
           For a drive. I don't know when we
           last went out.
           Buying time by biting his scone:

                          NICHOLAS
           This is absolutely yummy.

                          BETH
           We could go into Hadditon, get a
           meal.

                          NICHOLAS
           Yes but. What about the guests?

                          BETH
           Mary's got Casey to help.

                          NICHOLAS
           But I'm supposed to be thinking,
           you know about the -

                          BETH
           You can run it by me. I'm good at
           forensics.
           Nicholas has run out of excuses.

                         

          9 EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 9

           Beth approaches Andy with her scones and biscuits. Nearby,
           Glen is sitting back in a sun-lounger. Diggory sleeps on.

                          BETH
           Can I tempt you, Andy?
           Andy takes a scone with a wide smile.

                          BETH (CONT'D)
           That's Glen, our new academic. Turns
           out he's working on Thomas Hardy.
           Said he might have some farming
           questions.

                          ANDY
           Needs an expert yokel, does he?

                          BETH
           Would you mind? And the writers are
           eating al fresco tonight; could you
           check there's no bird shit on the
           seats? Sorry.
          Beth looks distant, troubled.

                          ANDY
           You OK?

                          BETH
           Yes. Nicholas and I are going out
           to dinner.
           As she walks away, Andy glances at the shed, a look of
           puzzled dislike on his face.

                         

          9A INT. DAY. STONEFIELD. 9A

           Glen settles back in his chair.

                          GLEN
           It's paradise...

                         

          10 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - NICHOLAS' SHED. 10

           Nicholas, dreading his predicament, is staring out at a cow's
           arse. The cow starts to piss. He shuts his eyes in
           desperation.

          10A I/E. DAY. TAMARA'S CAR. 10A
           Shooting from inside the car, we pass the sign "Ewedown".

                         

          11 EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. EWEDOWN - HALFWAY DOWN THE STREET. 11

           The same car drives through the village. Jody and Casey
           appear from behind a wall and chuck eggs at it. They both
           land on the windscreen.

                          JODY
           Fucking bingo!
           Jody and Casey run away, laughing.

                         

          11A EXT. DAY. EWEDOWN. OUTSIDE THE PUB. 11A

           The driver brakes, swerves and comes to a halt. Tamara Drewe
           gets out. She's twenty eight, startlingly beautiful. She
           looks around shocked, for the culprit.
           The immaculate, picturesque street is deserted. Tamara takes
           it in, with an expression of such distaste that it might as
           well be a landfill site.

                          TAMARA
           What a dump.
           As she drives away, we see Nadia sitting outside the pub in
           her urban heels, anxiously smoking a cigarette.

          12 EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. WINNARDS FARM. 12

           Tamara drives up to an old farmhouse. She gets out of the car
           and stands at the gate. Air of neglect; dark windows. Tamara
           looks at the place as if it stirs memories. She doesn't move.

          14 EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. WINNARDS FARM. 14

           At the back of the house Tamara walks through an overgrown,
           neglected garden. She peers through the back door into the
           kitchen. A thin layer of dust on the surfaces; a sense of
           recent abandonment.
           Suddenly a pigeon flies out from the porch eaves - just over
           her head. Tamara startles. It completely spooks her. She
           backs away. She doesn't know what to do.

                         

          13 EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. EWEDOWN - BUS SHELTER. 13

           Jody and Casey are slouched on the bench at the bus stop.
           Three teenage boys are doing wheelies over the T-junction.
           One of them almost lands in the shop. An old lady comes out,
           shoo-ing them away.

                          JODY
           We could walk up the garage.

                          CASEY
           I'm supposed to be helping my mum
           up at Stonefield.

                          JODY
           They keep you busy.

                          CASEY
           Yeah.

                          JODY
           You never stop, you!
           Neither of them moves. The boys are yelling. Two try to put
           the third head first into the bin outside the shop. Jody and
           Casey are not impressed.

           The writers are sitting round a table lit with tea-lights in
           jars. Casey is helping her mum, Mary, an efficient local
           woman in her late thirties. She wobbles the heavy serving
           dishes dangerously.

           At an upstairs window we can see Beth hold a dress up to
           herself and then abandon the idea.

           Did it sell?

           What are you working on next?
           Upstairs, through a window, we see Beth is putting on a

           Beth is looking at herself in a cheval mirror. She's full of
           hope that Nicholas will take her out - and dread that he'll
           find some excuse.

           Excuse me but there is nothing dull

           The door to the garden is open, letting in the eveing air.
           Nicholas is waiting for Beth by the mirror. He is full of
           unease - but can't help finding himself handsome. His phone
           bleeps; a text. He reads it anxiously.

                          NICHOLAS

                          (CALLING)
           Beth, why don't I just pop out on
           my own?
           Beth, determined to force things, comes downstairs.

                          BETH
           But I'm ready. Come on.
           She's on her way to join him.

                          NICHOLAS
           Is that - I mean - are you wearing
           that?

                          BETH
           Oh.

                          NICHOLAS
           Just looks a bit... hot.
           Now Beth knows she is right. She takes her jacket off,
           gutted.

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
           You know, Haddition's always packed

           He's about to leave. Beth speaks calmly.

                          BETH
           Who is she?
           The question hangs in the air. Nicholas' smile is frozen.

                          NICHOLAS
           What?
           For a moment, he tries to find a lie.

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
           Oh come on, Beth.

           Look, it's nothing. It's been once
           or twice, that's all. Beth, it's
           not anything.
           Beth is raw with pain.

           Just a researcher with Radio 4.

           Patel? She's in your book.

                          NICHOLAS
           No, no I met her when I was on
           Desert Island Discs.

                          BETH
           You put her in your book!

                          NICHOLAS
           Just the name.

                          BETH
           And Desert Island Discs was a year
           ago.

           Beth utters an inchoate cry.

          19C EXT. EVENING. STONEFIELD. THE GROUNDS (PATIO) 19C

           Tess hears it.

                          TESS
           Shhh!...
           Beth's pained voice drifts out of the house.

           BETH (O.S.)
           You lying PIG!
           A hush falls over the table.

                         

          19D INT. EVENING. STONEFIELD - DOWNSTAIRS. 19D


                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
           Beth, I'm a ruin, I know - but I've
           been in a real state about this... I
           didn't want to hurt you.
           Another wounded cry from Beth.

                         

          19E INT. EVENING. STONEFIELD. KITCHEN. 19E

           In the kitchen, Andy picks up his plate and goes.

          19F INT. EVENING. STONEFIELD - DOWNSTAIRS. 19F

           Beth is incandescent.

                          BETH
           How can you lie to my face?

                          NICHOLAS
           Can we talk calmly about this?
           There are people out there -

                          BETH
           You look me in the face and LIE!

                          NICHOLAS
           For God's sake; we're surrounded by

                          NOVELISTS -

                          BETH
           You BASTARD!

                         

          19G EXT. EVENING. STONEFIELD. THE GROUNDS (PATIO) 19G

           A thrilled intake of breath goes round the table. The writers
           (with the exception of Glen, who is mortified) are poised
           like scavengers, waiting for more.

                         

          19H INT. EVENING. STONEFIELD - DOWNSTAIRS. 19H


                          NICHOLAS
           Beth, we're like a pair of
           compasses...

                          BETH
           Don't you dare -

                          NICHOLAS
           Joined solidly at the top but with
           the ends able to roam, in freedom -
           His phone beeps.

                          BETH
           That's from her isn't it? Are you
           keeping her waiting?
           Nicholas finally snaps.

                          NICHOLAS
           We've talked a lot about the 
           creative mind and we agreed that it 
           needs freedom to explore! 

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 12A.

                         

                         

                          BETH
           (leaving the house)
           Take your freedom. I can't live
           like this any more. It makes me
           feel WORTHLESS!

                         

          20 EXT. EVENING. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS (PATIO/PORCH). 20

           Casey gawps, fascinated.
           Nicholas is following Beth outside. Her agony travels through
           the quiet evening air. The writers are open-mouthed.

                          NICHOLAS
           Calm yourself down!

           BETH (O.S.)
           Go set up home with Patel. See if
           she does your tax return.

           NICHOLAS (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           Will you please -

           BETH (O.S.)
           Do you love her??
           Diggory's fork stays in mid-air. Glen is horribly fascinated.

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 13.

                         

                         

                          NICHOLAS

                          (FIRMLY)
           This is pointless.

                          BETH
           Is she young?

                          NICHOLAS
           For heaven's sake.

                          BETH

           IS SHE?

                          NICHOLAS

           YES!
           The guests are hanging on every word. Beth retreats back into
           the house.

           BETH (O.S.)
           If you leave here tonight to be with
           her... Don't come back.

                          NICHOLAS
           Beth...
           For a moment, she hopes he'll apologise.

                          NICHOLAS
           You're making fools of us both.
           Beth, tears stinging, picks a plant out of the tub by the
           door and hurls it, roots and all. It's a direct hit.

                          BETH
           Liar.
           Glen cringes. Beth slams the door.
           Nicholas wipes soil off his glasses; brushes it off his
           shirt. He realises with a sinking heart that he must pass the
           writers to get to his car.

                          DIGGORY
           I didn't know they provided material
           too.

                         

          20A INT. EVENING. STONEFIELD - DOWNSTAIRS. 20A

           Beth, her back to the door, is regretting her gesture.

                         

          20B EXT. EVENING. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS (PATIO/PORCH). 20B 


                          EUSTACIA

                          EUSTACIA (CONT'D)
           types his manuscripts, deals with 
           his agent, makes his female 
           characters convincing. 
           Nicholas still at the door, listening. 

                          EUSTACIA 
           She even came up with the name Dr 
           Inchcombe. 

                          DIGGORY 
           No wonder he's bored. 

                          EUSTACIA 
           I hope she takes him to the fucking 
           cleaners. 
           Nicholas walks to his car. Silence. He roars away. 

                         

          20C INT. EVENING. STONEFIELD - THE KITCHEN. 20C

           Beth comes into the kitchen. Her eyes flicker over pictures
           of her daughter and Nicholas. She is in shock.

                         

          20D EXT. EVENING. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS (PATIO). 20D 

           Glen is mortified. 

                          GLEN 
           At the end of the day, this is why 
           I'm glad to be single. 

                         

          20E INT. EVENING. STONEFIELD - THE KITCHEN. 20E

           Beth is going through agonies of self-criticism.

           BETH (V.O.)
           Nadia Patel. Gazelle eyes. Tantric
           sex.
           We see her thoughts: An exotic clinch. Nicholas in thrall to
           Nadia's confident passion.

                          BETH

                          (TO CAMERA)
           Why would he choose me?!

                         

          20F EXT. EVENING. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS (PATIO). 20F 

           The gossip flutters round the table. 

                          TESS 
           Will she take him back, that's the 
           question.

          I'd be torn. 

                          EUSTACIA 
          He's far too up himself. 

                          TESS 
          What about the farm though? 
          Splitting up all this? Must be 
          worth a fortune. I think she's 
          very rash, making him choose...

          22 EXT. NIGHT. EWEDOWN - OUTSIDE THE PUB. 22

           Nicholas is walking Nadia to his car. 

                          NADIA
           Thought you weren't going to come.

                          NICHOLAS
           I was busy. Rowing with my wife.

                          NADIA
           Where are we going?

                          NICHOLAS
           Home.

                          NADIA
           To your farm?
           A look of frustration crosses his face. He turns to her. 

                          NICHOLAS
           We could have gone on just as we
           were.

                          NADIA
           But you said you wanted to be with
           me...

                          NICHOLAS
           Yes. In London. Now and then.
           Nadia looks at him. The scales are beginning to fall. They
           get in the car. As they drive away, Tamara's car pulls up. 
           She gets out of the car and takes in the pub before entering. 

                         

          23 INT. NIGHT. EWEDOWN - THE PUB. 23

           Tamara enters. Zoe, a buxom Australian, is behind the bar. 

                          

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 15.

                         

                         

                          TAMARA
           Big glass of rioja please. And I
           need a room.

                          ZOE
           Sure, how many nights?

                          TAMARA
           Don't know. Just one.
          Zoe pours the wine. She's disarmingly friendly. 

                          ZOE
           You here on business?

                          TAMARA
           No. Business of a kind.

                          ZOE
           I don't mean to pry; I'm just
           really nosey.

                          TAMARA
           I'm from here. Sort of.

                          ZOE
           Nice place.
          Tamara smiles her disagreement.

                          ZOE (CONT'D)
           I keep meaning to leave but... Hard
           to get away.

                          TAMARA
           My mum's house is just up the road.

                          ZOE
           You're not staying with her?

                          TAMARA
           She's. She died.
          Zoe finishes pouring the wine.

                          ZOE
           Have that on me. And here's your
           key. Up the stairs, right in front.
           You can't miss it.
          Tamara utters her thanks, surprised at Zoe's kindness. She
          takes her drink and the key upstairs. Zoe remains, grinning.
          We see why.
          Andy Cobb has just walked in. Zoe pulls him a pint.

                          ZOE (CONT'D)
           Didn't think I'd see you tonight.

           Andy shakes his head. 

                          ANDY
           Marriage. Remind me never to try it.

                          ZOE
           Andy, you're just a sex object. No
           one'd have you.
           He grins back at her.

                         

          24 INT. NIGHT. EWEDOWN - THE PUB. TAMARA'S BATHROOM 24

           Tamara is in a deep bubble bath. She glances at herself in
           the mirror, scrutinising her beauty. She fingers her nose.
           Slowly a look of doubt steals over her - as if she's not
           quite comfortable in her own skin.

                         

          25 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE KITCHEN. 25

           Glen is eating his breakfast looking at all the Hardiment's
           family memorabilia in the kitchen. Andy is eating toast. 

                          GLEN
           So the Hardiments have lived here
           centuries, huh?

                          ANDY
           No, `bout twenty years. Still
           strangers by local standards.
           Beth comes in, tense, anxious and haggard.

                          BETH
           Andy, come and look at Ingrid. I
           think she's coming into heat.
           She goes out.

                          GLEN
           She's a nice lady.

                          ANDY
           Yeah, I owe her a lot.

                          ANDY
           We'd say prick here actually. Or 
           wanker. 

                          GLEN 
           That's good. We might even call him 
           a Fuck.

                          ANDY
           That's good too.

                         

          26 EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE CHICKEN RUN. 26

           Andy approaches Beth. She is cleaning out the hen coop with
           all the frenetic energy of an abandoned wife.

                          BETH
           This is going rotten underneath.

                          ANDY
           Shall we look at Ingrid?

                          BETH
           It's falling apart.

                          ANDY
           I can do that. Beth...
           Andy takes the shovel. Beth bites back tears.

                          ANDY (CONT'D)
           He won't last five minutes.
           Beth looks down embarrassed by (but grateful for) his
           support.

                         

          26A INT. DAY. STONEFIELD. 26A

           Glen wanders into Beth's office. The wall in front of him is 
           dominated by a framed newspaper profile of Nicholas, 
           surrounded by framed covers of Inchcombe books. The whole 
           room is a shrine to Nicholas' career. 
           Glen is in the hall looking at Beth's prints and pictures; 
           old maps, wildlife and framed letters from grateful writers 
           who have stayed at the retreat. He stares at a print of farm 
           workers in the nineteenth century. Glen sighs. 

           GLEN (V.O.)
           I know why I'm drawn to Thomas 
           Hardy. He writes about failure 
           better than anyone else. I need 
           this book to go well. I need a tiny 
           reward for my endeavours... 
           His stomach gurgles ominously.

           GLEN (V.O.) 
           I need a dump.

          28 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE HALL/DOWNSTAIRS CLOAKROOM 28

           Glen walks down the corridor by the kitchen, to the
           downstairs cloakroom; a marvellous Victorian toilet of
           reassuring size. He shuts the door in relief.

                         

          29 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE HALL/DOWNSTAIRS CLOAKROOM. 29

           Glen is on the loo. Even in this small room there are framed
           photographs of Nicholas receiving awards. He looks at them in
           wonder.

           NICHOLAS (O.S.)
           If that's the way you feel...
           Nadia, I'm devastated.
           Through the frosted window Glen sees Nicholas.

           NICHOLAS (O.S.)
           But if that's your decision, I'll
           have to learn to live with it.
           Beth comes in from the garden. Glen sees Nicholas quickly end
           the call. For Beth's benefit:

                          NICHOLAS
           (Into his phone)
           I told you. I love my wife. Don't
           ever phone me again.
           Glen is shocked by this duplicity.

                          NICHOLAS
           Beth...

                          BETH (CONT'D)
           No don't touch me, don't you dare.
           Glen panics, realising their reunion is going to be right by
           the door. He puts his hand on the flush, hoping to warn them
           - too late.

                          NICHOLAS
           I'm sorry.

                          BETH
           Not good enough. Not any more.

                          NICHOLAS
           I'm sorry.

                          BETH
           You do what you like and then you're
           sorry?

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 18A.

                         

                         

           NICHOLAS (O.S.)
           I hate myself. I hate myself.
          Glen opens the door a chink. They are feet away from him.
          Nicholas looks unshaven, shagged and guilty.

                          BETH
           Where were you?

                          NICHOLAS
           Drove her back to London. Took all
           night.

                          BETH
           You drove her home?

                          NICHOLAS
           She was in a state.

                          BETH
           Do you think she'll get over it?...
           Nicholas shrugs. To Glen's horror, he starts to cry.

                          NICHOLAS
           I'm sorry.
           Then Beth is sobbing too. They are in each other's arms,
           holding each other.

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
           I don't know why I'm like this. I
           couldn't do without you.
           Glen looks away from the clinch, horribly embarrassed. He
           opens the toilet window, puts the soap dish straight. Looks
           again - still hugging, sobbing, kissing - puts his hand on
           the flush - too awful to reveal himself - takes it off again.
           Straightens his hair, examines his teeth, sweating.
           He looks again. At last the emotion is abating. Nicholas
           releases Beth. She wipes her eyes.

                          BETH
           I've got to go to the bottle bank.

                          NICHOLAS
           OK... Let's talk later.

                          BETH
           Yes. The goat's come into heat.

                          NICHOLAS
           Has it?

                          BETH
           I love you so much.

                          NICHOLAS
           Me too.
           Beth goes. Nicholas is watching her; his expression strange.
           He walks away. At last Glen emerges, incredulous at Nicholas'
           lies.

           Glen flops into a sun-lounger near Diggory.

                          GLEN
           I've just seen the Hardiments kiss
           and make up.

                          DIGGORY

                          (IRRITATED)
           The hat is on.

                          GLEN
           Looks like she's taking him back.

                          DIGGORY
           When the hat is on, it means don't
           speak.

                          GLEN

                          (WITH IRONY)
           So... Peace is restored.
           The sound of a burglar alarm suddenly blares over the garden.
           Diggory sits up, infuriated.

                         

          32 EXT. DAY. THE FIELDS (LIMBURY). 32

           Glen is following Andy down the hill from Stonefield. The
           cows are too close for Glen's comfort. He hurries through.

                          GLEN
           I don't like cows. I mean really.
           They exude bovine malice.

                          ANDY
           Yeah, these girls are killing
           machines. They don't like Americans
           either.

                          GLEN
           Very funny.

                         

          32A EXT. DAY. FIELD AND COPSE. (LARKHAM) 32A

           Glen and Andy are in the valley between the two farms.

                          ANDY
           It's Winnards Farm. Lady there died
           a while back. Place is empty.

                          GLEN
           You think it's being robbed?

                          ANDY
           Prob'ly just kids. Nothing to do
           round here except make trouble.

                          GLEN
           What if it's bad guys? Don't you
           have a blunderbuss or a fowling
           piece or something?
           They climb up through a copse.

                          CUT TO:

          32B EXT. DAY. FIELDS (WINNARDS). 32B

           Glen and Andy are going up the hill towards Winnards.

                          ANDY
           Used to belong to my dad, this
           place.

                          GLEN
           Really?

                          ANDY
           But it all went tits-up. Land was
           flogged to a consortium and the house
           was sold to Londoners; the Drewes.

                          GLEN
           So this is your ancestral pile?

                          ANDY
           Was. Born in that room up there.
           He points up at the back bedroom window.

                          GLEN
           You must have been pretty resentful.

           An eighteen year old Andy jumps off a stile into the lane
           behind a slim, fifteen year old girl on a horse.

                          ANDY
           Hey.

          The girl turns. She has a huge nose.

                          ANDY
           This farm's mine, big nose.

           The girl kicks the horse into a trot, her nose in the air.

                         

          34 EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM. 34

           Andy and Glen turn the corner to the back of the house.
           Tamara is up a ladder wielding a hammer at the alarm box.

                          ANDY
           Hey, what're you doing?
           Tamara gives the alarm box a great whack.

                          ANDY (CONT'D)
           Who are you??

                          TAMARA
           Andy, you moron; it's me.
           Andy looks more closely. A disturbing spark of recognition.

                          ANDY
           Tam?... Hardly recognise you. 
           Another whack. The noise becomes a high-pitched squeal.

                          ANDY (CONT'D)
           You won't do it that way.

                          TAMARA
           Then help me!

                         

          35 INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE KITCHEN. 35

           Andy turns the alarm off. Tamara enters the dusty kitchen.

                          ANDY
           Used to do bits of work for your mum.
           Been keeping an eye on the place
           since she died.

                          TAMARA
           What sort of work, graphics?

                          ANDY
           I do horticulture now.

                          TAMARA
           You're a gardener?
           Andy says nothing. He stares at her nose. Glen has come in.

           This is a great old house.

                          TAMARA
           Would you like to buy it?

                          GLEN
           I'm not really the property-owning
           kind. Prefer my life to fit into hand 
           luggage. 

                          ANDY
           That's why you're back, to flog it?

                          TAMARA
           Yes.

                          ANDY
           Make a nice second home for some
           banker wankers.

                          TAMARA
           Andy if you want it, why don't you
           make me an offer?

                          ANDY
           Because sadly I'm still prey to the 
           economic forces that threw the
           peasant classes off the land.

                          TAMARA
           Unlucky.
           Tamara opens a cupboard. It's full of empty wine bottles. 

                          ANDY
           Tam.
           Their eyes meet.

                          ANDY (CONT'D)
           What the fuck have you done to
           yourself?
           Tamara's face falls.

                         

          36 EXT. DAY. THE FIELDS (LARKHAM). 36

           Glen and Andy are walking back. Andy is brooding.

                          ANDY 
           She's completely different. 

                          GLEN 
           How was she before? What's the

           Come on. 

                          ANDY 
           Was nothing. Decade ago. Just a 
           teenage thing. 

                         

          37 1996. INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - A SHED. 37 

           Tamara pulling down her pants; Andy unbuttoning his jeans.
           She jumps up on the worktable, pushing a stack of turnips out
           of the way. They kiss passionately.

                          ANDY
           You should find someone you're in
           love with.

                          TAMARA
           You stupid prick.
           Andy looks at her. She is sincere.

                          ANDY
           You saying you love me, frosty tits?

                          TAMARA
           You first.

                          ANDY
           You say it; You're the girl.

                          TAMARA
           Fuck off.
           She kisses him. As they start to make love:

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           I love you. Fuck off. I love you. 

                         

          37A EXT. DAY. A FIELD. 37A 

           Glen looks over at Andy, interrupting his thoughts. 

                          GLEN 
           Romeo and Juliet, huh? 
           Andy carries on down the hill, shaking his head. 

                         

          38 INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE KITCHEN. 38 

           Tamara is watching Andy walk away with Glen. Her eyes follow 
           him curiously - then she firmly turns her back.

           Tamara rips a bin liner off the roll and shakes it out.
           She takes a deep breath. She opens the cupboard and begins to
           bin the distressing mountain of empty wine bottles. 

                         

          39 EXT. NIGHT. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 39

           Beth is standing at the hedge looking down at the valley with
           Nicholas at her side.

                          BETH
           Thinking of the first time we saw
           this place...

           You've made it a wonderful home
           Beth.

                          BETH
           Not wonderful enough.
           She starts to walk away. Nicholas holds her back.

                          NICHOLAS
           If you can't put this behind you,
           then we're stuck.

                          BETH
           Well I'd better sort myself out then. 

                          NICHOLAS
           What has to happen? I am sorry -
           Beth brings her arm up to push him away. Nicholas catches it;
           draws her to him. He kisses her insistently. Beth's
           resistance diminishes. Soon it has gone. We begin to see the
           depth of Beth's physical love for him.
           At that moment, Glen walks round the corner. He tries to
           backtrack, mortified by his intrusion on their passion. Too
           late. They part. Nicholas turns away in frustration.

                          GLEN
           Just taking the air.
           Flustered, he knocks into a tub of lobelias. Beth and
           Nicholas remain. The moment between them is gone. Round the
           corner, Glen is cringing.

          41 EXT. DAY. EWEDOWN - BUS SHELTER. 41

           Jody and Casey are reading a celebrity magazine.

                          JODY
           Would you do him?

                          CASEY
           No.

                          JODY
           What about him?

                          CASEY
           He's gay, you dobbin.

                          JODY
           So?
           They turn to a big spread on a band called Swipe.

                          CASEY
           Swipe.

                          JODY
           Ben Sergeant...
           I'd walk through fire to do him.

                          CASEY
           The drummer?

                          JODY
           He's not just the drummer. He writes
           the lyrics; it's his band. He's the
           fucking genius, not Steve Culley or
           any of these wankers. It's Ben.

                          CASEY
           OK. I'd do Ben.

                          JODY
           I wanna be her, in that dress with
           him licking my teapot lids.

                          CASEY
           Yeah... me too.

                         

          42 EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 42

           Casey is still carrying this image as she serves a tray of
           nibbles on the patio. She stands among the writers, watching 
           a fly get caught in one of the vol-au-vents.

                          DIGGORY 
           People talk about the muscularity in 
           prose. I want a similar muscularity 
           in my verse. I don't want a poetry 
           that's flabby or obese - that's why I 
           adhere to the tightest rhyme schemes: 
           Diggory picks the vol-au-vent up and without looking, puts it 
           in his mouth. Casey moves over to Nicholas and Glen.

           ABB ACC DEE D. They give you the 
           armature, the beating heart, the

                          NICHOLAS
           So has the muse shone on you, Greg?

                          GLEN
           I've been pretty distracted. Most
           recently by those delicious cookie
           things that Beth brought round this
           afternoon.

                          NICHOLAS
           Oh yes. Of course we call them
           biscuits here.

                          GLEN
          And by the place itself, the people.

                          NICHOLAS
          Sometimes wish I could get
          distracted. Ten page a day man,
          rain or shine.

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 27.

                         

                         

                          GLEN
           Wow, that's scary. Ten pages; how 
           do you do that?

                          NICHOLAS
           Well, Greg -

                          GLEN

                          GLEN -

                          NICHOLAS
           I wouldn't presume to give an
           academic tips.

                          GLEN
           Matter of fact I read one of your
           books. Another distraction but I
           thought it was decent stuff.

                          NICHOLAS
           Well.
          He's offended.

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
           How do I do it? I just get on with
           it, Greg.
          Nicholas walks away leaving Glen smarting. The female writers
          surround Nicholas. He tops them up, full of charm. Under his
          breath, Glen impersonates:

                          GLEN
           `We call them biscuits, here.'
          Nicholas raises his glass for a toast.

                          NICHOLAS
           To the muse, however you find her.
          He is looking at Beth. She is gratified. Then his eye shifts,
          his glass still in the air.

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
           Who's that?
          Tamara Drewe is climbing the stile at the bottom of the
          garden in a low cut T-shirt, tiny pair of denim shorts and
          bare feet. The evening light bathes her in a golden sheen.

                          GLEN
           That's Tamara Drewe.

                          NICHOLAS
           No it isn't.

                          GLEN
           I met her with Andy.

                          NICHOLAS
           Good God. What's happened to her?

                          POPPY
           She's had a nose job, Dad.

                          NICHOLAS
           She's completely different.

                          GLEN
           That's what Andy said.

                          BETH
           Poor Tamara. Such a sad girl. She
           used to come and help you wash the
           car, didn't she Nicholas? I think
           she liked a bit of family after her
           dad left.

                          TESS
           Is that Tamara Drewe who writes the
           column in one of the Sundays?

                          BETH
           Used to. Writes for the Independent
           now.

                          TESS
           She spent weeks going on about her
           nose job. Smart way to pay for it I
           suppose. Was her old one an awful
           conk?

                          NICHOLAS
           Yes.

                          BETH
           She's poured herself into those
           shorts. I hope they don't give her
           thrush.

                          TESS
           What's the etiquette with nose
           jobs? Do we mention it, or...
          Tamara has arrived in earshot. Absolutely everyone, including
          a very curious Casey, is staring at her nose.

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 28A.

                         

                         

                          TAMARA
           Hello. Sorry to intrude.
          Her hand defensively brushes her nose. Poppy walks towards
          her, full of warmth.

                          POPPY
           Hey, Tamara.

                          TAMARA
           Poppy, how are you?

                          POPPY
           Love your new hooter.

                          TAMARA
           Thanks. It isn't actually new; just
           smaller...

           At last Beth remembers her manners.

                          BETH
           Tamara, so sorry about your mum.

                          TAMARA
           Thank you...

                          BETH
           Are you staying down for a while?

                          TAMARA
           I'll have to. There's so much to be
           done.

                          BETH
           You must let us know if we can help.

                          TAMARA
           Actually, I was going to ask if you
           could spare a pair of strong arms.
           I've got a skip coming tomorrow and -

                          BETH
           Nicholas? -
           Nicholas is opening another bottle of prosecco. It pops its
           cork over his trousers. He mutters a swear word.

                          GLEN
           I'm available. I do skips.

                          DIGGORY
           I... No.

                          TAMARA
           Well thank you. You're very kind...
           Is Andy around at all?
           Beth is helping Nicholas wipe his trousers.

                          BETH
           Oh, I can't spare Andy. He's making
           a new coop for my Buff Orpingtons.

                         

          43 EXT. NEXT DAY. WINNARDS FARM. 43

           Tamara and Glen are carrying junk out to a skip. Tamara is in
           big boots and a slightly more practical pair of shorts.

          44 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE KITCHEN. 44

           Beth is preparing lunch, talking to Poppy. Nicholas is going 
           through his typed-up manuscript; not really listening.

                          BETH
           She's had the writers down there 
           helping her all day. I hope she 
           realises they're here to work... 

                          POPPY
           Can't believe what a difference 
           her nose makes. 

                          BETH
           Well I think it's a mistake; taken
           away all her character.

                          POPPY
           Come on; she looks ten times
           better.

                          NICHOLAS
           Huh. 

                          BETH
           And she knows it. I found those
           shorts really irritating. Going
           around with half her bum hanging
           out. I mean, why?

                          POPPY 
           To annoy people like you. Might get a
           pair myself.

                          NICHOLAS
           Of course you won't.

                          POPPY
           Why not?

                          NICHOLAS
           Because you're not desperate, are
           you? Always something a bit
           desperate about Tamara Drewe.
           Beth looks at him puzzled as he works on.

                         

          45 EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM. 45

           Tamara and Glen are having a rest.

                          GLEN
           So why did you change your face?

                          TAMARA 
          Changing my face is the best thing I
          ever did. And I don't care what 
          anyone thinks. 

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 31.

                         

                         

                          GLEN
           Would it work for me? 

                          TAMARA
           Maybe; if you did the wrinkles too.

                          GLEN
           Oh, you're just coming on to me...
           Tamara laughs. She starts work again.

                          GLEN
           In your column, you write about 
           yourself... Does that come easily? 

                          TAMARA
           No... But it feels right. My first 
           novel's definitely going to be
           autobiographical.

                          GLEN
           Your first novel? You're going to
           dash one off just like that?

                          TAMARA
           Ideally, I'd like to make it into 
           fiction before I'm thirty.

                          GLEN
           And then maybe a swimwear collection,
           a chat show, a pasta sauce range?

                          TAMARA
           What? 

                          GLEN
           Life sure is easy for the beautiful.

                          TAMARA 
           You know before I got the nose job 
           I had no trouble getting taken 
           seriously. Maybe, when they removed 
           that bit of cartilage, they pulled 
           my brain out by mistake - what do 
           you think? 
           Glen smiles, won over. 

                         

          46 INT. LATE AFTERNOON. EWEDOWN - THE PUB. 46

           Glen is coming from the bar with a pint for Andy and a half
           for himself. He has just been served by Zoe.

                          GLEN
           She's single, man.
           Andy looks over at Zoe.

                          ANDY
          Well it's not exactly a
          relationship; we just have an
          occasional thing. Zoe doesn't want
          to be tied down and -

                          GLEN
          Not Zoe! Tamara... You should get
          in there. Marry the girl. Then you
          get to live back in your ancestral
          home.

                          ANDY
          No way. Not her type.

                          GLEN
          The trouble is Andy, you think like
          a loser. And I know that because
          I'm the loser that losers turn to
          for tips. I'm the losers loser.

                          ANDY
           I'm a pedigree loser. I had a
           graphics business; went bust. And
           then with my great business acumen
           I invested in a polytunnel full of
           ganja.

                          GLEN
           Wow. How'd that go?

                          ANDY
           Made a tit of myself. Spent about
           six years stoned out of my box and
           I'm only just getting it back
           together. Besides, even if I was
           the last man in the world, Tamara
           Drewe wouldn't have me.

                          GLEN
           Why not?

                          ANDY
           I dumped her.

                          GLEN
           Oh, you are a loser.

                          ANDY
           I was twenty. My mates thought I
           was cradle snatching... And they
           used to call her Beaky.

                         

          47 1996. EXT. DAY. OUTSIDE THE PUB. 47

           Tamara in her school uniform, is gutted.

                          TAMARA
           Beaky?...
           We see her stricken face as she turns away. Then she turns
           back and hits Andy. His nose streams blood.

                         

          48 INT. LATE AFTERNOON. EWEDOWN - THE PUB. 48

           Glen is preparing to leave.

                          GLEN
           You told her the truth... The time
           might come when she respects that.
           Andy, as your love guru, I suggest
           you ask Tamara for a date. But take a
           shower first, OK?

                          ANDY

                          (SMILING)
           Piss off, Glen.

          49 EXT. EVENING. WINNARDS FARM. 49

           Tamara is in her shorts and boots, chucking empty bottles and
           old saucepans into the skip, like an Amazon.

                         

          50 EXT. EVENING. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 50

           Nicholas is at the hedge, looking down the valley towards
           Winnards Farm. He is watching Tamara like a hawk - as if he
           can't quite believe what he is seeing.

                         

          51 1996. EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 51 

           Nicholas and Tamara are polishing Nicholas' car. 

                          TAMARA 
           Boys know nothing. 
           Nicholas looks up at her, smiles indulgently. Tamara stops 
           work. 

                          TAMARA (CONT'D) 
           I've been reading `Inchcombe's 
           Dose.' 

                          NICHOLAS 
           Have you? 

                          TAMARA 
           The bit where Doctor Inchcombe 
           finds himself having thoughts about 
           the dead guy's daughter. 
           Tamara walks around the car, bringing her polishing cloth 
           closer to his. 

                          TAMARA (CONT'D) 
           You describe her light smattering 
           of freckles and her striking 
           profile. So... 
           She turns her head. 

                          TAMARA (CONT'D) 
           Who did you base her on? 

                          NICHOLAS 
           What? 

                          TAMARA 
           Have you noticed me? 
           Nicholas looks at her in surprise. 

                          TAMARA (CONT'D) 
           Because I've noticed you... 

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 33A.

                         

                         
          She waits, hoping for a kiss, a hug, anything. She puts out a 
          hand - almost touches him. He steps back. 

                          NICHOLAS 
           Think it's time you went. 
          Tamara is mortified. 

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D) 
           You're making yourself ridiculous. 
          This really hurts. Tamara takes the bucket of soapy water and 
          throws it over the car - and Nicholas. 

                          TAMARA 
           Nicholarse. 

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D) 
           Oh, grow up.

          52 EXT. EVENING. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 52

           Nicholas is still staring at Tamara, who is jumping on the
           stuff in the skip. Glen is strolling up the hill from the
           pub. He follows Nicholas' gaze.

                          GLEN
           A man can dream, huh?
           Nicholas looks at him affronted - as if he doesn't know what
           he's talking about.

                         

          53 INT. EVENING. WINNARDS FARM. 53

           Tamara, hot and dirty, runs up the stairs with her roll of
           bin liners. She opens the door to her mother's bedroom.
           She is completely unprepared for it. A neat, womanly room
           covered in photographs of Tamara as a child, teen and young
           woman. On the dressing table is a lipstick; the lid lying
           next to it as if it has just been used. Tamara picks it up.
           She sits, suddenly exhausted. For the first time, she looks
           lost.

                         

          54 EXT. DAY. ANOTHER FARM - THE GOAT PEN. 54

           Tamara still looks slightly shaken as she walks up to Andy.
           He is watching Ingrid meet Darcy, a billy goat.

                          ANDY
           Go on Ingrid; have some kids.

                          TAMARA
           Pretty direct isn't he? He's not
           even bought her a coke.
           Andy turns. Sees her.

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           And he stinks.

                          ANDY
           She doesn't mind; it's like Lynx to
           her. If she's ready she'll stand for
           him, if not she won't.

                          TAMARA
           That's disturbing human.

                          ANDY
           Refreshing basic.
           Darcy is up and at it.

                          ANDY (CONT'D)
           Thought you'd have gone back to
           London by now.

                          TAMARA
           I wish. Looks like I'm stuck here for
           a while. Actually, I've got a
           proposition for you.
          Andy glances at the goats; bad idea.

                          ANDY
           We should go for a drink
           sometime, Tam. You know, for old
           times sake.

                          TAMARA
           So we can reminisce about how I
           smashed your nose?

                          ANDY
           You didn't smash it.

                          TAMARA
           Yes I did.

                          ANDY
           It just bled.
          The memory is between them.

                          TAMARA
           I've got to do the house up before I
           sell it. It looks like an eighties
           timewarp. Would you like the job?
          He just looks at her.

                          TAMARA
           Painting it and tidying the garden?
           Good hourly rate.

                          ANDY
           It can't be easy down there, Tam.

                          TAMARA
           What d'you mean?

                          ANDY
           All the memories and stuff. Your
           mum...

                          TAMARA
           I'm fine.

                          YOU IDEAS

                          ANDY
           OK it's bollocks -

                          TAMARA
           That's very sweet of you Andy -

                          ANDY
           Of course you wouldn't want to
           fraternise with your gardener.

                          TAMARA
           So... is that a yes?
           Andy doesn't reply.

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           Come on, goat whisperer - I thought
           I'd be doing you a favour. I thought
           you needed the work.
           It's all over with Ingrid and Darcy.

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           She's had a shit time but she'll
           still call him. He'll lose her
           number. He won't ring her back...
           Andy's face cracks into a smile. He is won over.

                         

          54A INT. DAY. STONEFIELD. GLEN'S ROOM. 54A 

           Glen types a sentence. He reads it. He deletes. He stares at 
           the blank page. It stares back at him. 

                          GLEN 
           No. 
           He stands. He paces. He sits. 

                          GLEN 
           Just write, you numbskull. You

          55 EXT./INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - BETH'S OFFICE. 55

           Glen is passing Beth's office. She's working through a stack
           of fan mail. She smiles when she sees him.

                          BETH

           Glen unburdens himself.

           I do a couple of sessions a week,
           to keep on top of it. Pretty good
           at forging Nick's signature.
           Glen looks awed - and defeated.

                          BETH 
           Would you like me to read it? 

                          GLEN 
           You'd do that?

           Be glad to. If you think it would 
           help. 
           Beth suddenly sees Andy out of the window. He's leaving.

                          BETH (CONT'D)
           Sorry Glen. Just need Andy -

           If you're going into Hadditon -
           we're really low on chicken feed.

           I'll get it tomorrow. I'm on my way
           down to Winnards. Doing one or two
           jobs for Tamara.

           She's got you helping her too?

                          ANDY
           Just painting, decorating, sorting
           the garden.
           Beth is quite put out.

                          BETH
           Andy, that sounds like a lot. I
           need you here.

                          ANDY
           I can easily do both.

           As long as you're not working for

          Without thinking, she has made Andy feel like a servant.

                          ANDY
           Sure, Beth. I won't rip you off.

           He walks on, leaving Beth feeling very uncomfortable - and
           somehow slightly bereft.

                         

          57 INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE GROUNDS / KITCHEN. 57

           Andy comes in. He shouts into the house.

                          ANDY
           Tam? Got some colour charts for you
           to see.
           He sets out all the colours charts and plans he has been 
           working on. Tamara appears. She is dressed to kill. 

                          TAMARA 
           What would you choose for in here? 

                          ANDY 
           Well... I'd have this one. And then 
           upstairs in the bedroom - 

                          TAMARA 

           OK. 
           She starts gathering her things. 

                          ANDY 
           So what d'you have to do to get a
           cup of tea round here?

                          TAMARA

           Tea bags. Sugar. Fridge.

                          (SHE GRINS)
           I'm off to work.
           Andy stares. Suddenly Tamara is no longer just a blast from
           the past. He sees a future - a future that he wants. He
           slowly smiles back - but she's already striding away.

                         

          58 EXT. DAY. A ROCK FESTIVAL - THE PERIMETER FENCE. 58

           Pounding rock music, slightly distorted by distance. Jody and
           Casey are trying to get in over the boundary fence. A
           security guard is already running towards them.

                          JODY
           This is our village. Our fucking
           field.

                          GUARD

           OUT!

           COME ON YOU BASTARD LET US IN!
           Jody is ready for a fight but Casey pulls her back.

          60 EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS 60

           Beth is tending to Ingrid - making sure she's not scared by
           the noise. Ingrid looks as if she couldn't give a damn. Over
           by the barn she sees Glen, unaware that he's being watched,
           breaking out of a mournful walk to groove to the music. She
           smiles.
           At the other end of the farm, Nicholas is staring over the
           hedge with tissue paper ear-plugs. He pretends his arm is a
           rifle, like a little boy. He aims at the cows. He fires.

                         

          61 EXT. DAY. A ROCK FESTIVAL - THE MAIN STAGE. 61

           Swipe are playing; bit like The Libertines in their prime.
           There is one girl in the band, bass guitarist Fran Redford.
           The drummer, Ben Sergeant, is also vocals. The lead singer,
           Steve Culley, is mixed-race; confident and charismatic.
           He is getting very up-close and personal with Fran. Ben is
           getting more and more furious.
           In the wings, we see Tamara talking to a publicist, trying to
           make herself heard above the roar of the music. She is
           pointing at Steve and Fran. The publicist nods.
           Suddenly Ben leaps up and takes hold of Steve, pulling him
           away from Fran. There is a scuffle, Fran trying to separate
           the boys. Ben takes a microphone.

                          BEN
           Sorry people. I resign. Swipe is no
           more. Steve Culley is a cunt.
           Ben storms off the stage. The audience are in uproar.

                          PUBLICIST
           Ben! Ben! What's happening?

                          BEN
           He's seeing Fran. I won't work with
           that tosser again.

                          FRAN
           Steve! Don't!
           Steve is coming into the wings. He punches Ben.

                          STEVE
           You fucking baby.
           Ben falls. He virtually lands on Tamara. They both hit the
           ground. Steve storms off - Fran following, calling his name.
           Ben is dazed. He looks up at Tamara.

                          TAMARA
           Hello. I'm Tamara Drewe.

                          BEN
           What?

                          TAMARA
           I'm supposed to be interviewing you
           - for the Independent.
           She smiles sweetly, smoothing his hair.

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           It was scheduled for later but
           maybe now's a better time...

                         

          62 EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. EWEDOWN - BUS SHELTER. 62

           Jody, Casey and the boys are sharing a bottle of cider.

                          JODY
           They should let us in free.

                          RYAN
           Too right. They come here, drink our
           water, use our fields, they leave
           all their crap in our drains -
           Tamara's car sweeps past with the roof down. It is closely
           followed by a bright yellow Porsche. Ben is driving and his
           boxer dog, Boss, is in the passenger seat. Jody clocks him.

                          JODY
           Ben! Ben!
           She jumps up and down in the road with both arms waving.

                          CASEY

           Jody and Casey scream with delight, chasing the car.

                         

          63 EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. WINNARDS FARM. 63

           Ben skids his Porsche to a halt right next to Tamara's car.
           He jumps out. Boss follows. Tamara is walking towards the
           door. The distant festival is still audible. Tamara backs
           towards the door, with Ben inches away.

                          BEN
           That's Boss.

                          TAMARA
           Hi Boss.

                          BEN
           You're not allergic are you?

                          TAMARA
           To indie drummers? Maybe. Who are
           your influences, Ben?

                          BEN
           Everyone asks that. This your place?

                          TAMARA
           I'm selling. D'you want it?

                          BEN
           No, I want something else.
           Tamara grins. Jody and Casey arrive at the brow of the hill,
           breathless. They see Ben pin Tamara against the door.

                          JODY
           Who the fuck's she?

                          CASEY
           I seen her up at Stonefield. She's
           got a nose made of plastic.

                          JODY
           How come she gets Ben? I've loved
           him since March.
           Just as Ben's about to kiss her, Tamara coolly opens the door
           and draws him into the house.

                          CASEY
           Wow...
           Jody is gutted; feeling the full injustice of her life.

          64 INT. LATE AFTERNOON. WINNARDS FARM - KITCHEN 64

           Tamara leads Ben to the kitchen. The hall has been stripped.

                          TAMARA
           Would you like a beer?

                          BEN
           Yep. Maureen Tucker.

                          TAMARA
           Who?
           Tamara opens the fridge. Ben is inches away. He still hasn't
           kissed her and he's just about to.

                          BEN
           Moe Tucker, with the Velvets. Five
           foot nothing. Used to stand up to
           play. Put the snare drum on its side
           and hit it with mallets. Mentalist.

                          TAMARA
           You write all the songs; that's
           pretty rare for a drummer.

                          BEN
           Everything you've ever heard about
           drummers is total shit.

                          TAMARA
           You mean you don't spontaneously
           combust?

                          BEN
           Only sometimes.
           She goes in to kiss him. But Ben grabs a pair of chopsticks
           from a utensils jar. He starts to play around Tamara, hitting
           the surfaces, the shelves and everything on them; a brilliant
           rhythm. He gets closer and closer. Tamara is utterly
           mesmerised. Ben stops. He still doesn't kiss her.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           Any more questions?
           Tamara is speechless. He kisses her.

                         

          65 EXT. DAY. THE FIELD AND THE COPSE - NEXT MORNING (LARKHAM).


                          65
           Andy is walking in the copse up to Tamara's. He spots a
           couple of wild mushrooms and picks them. In the distance he
           sees Glen bending and stretching. A cow is looking at him
           over the fence. Glen sees it and startles.

           The sight makes Andy smile. He carries on towards Winnards
           Farm in high spirits.

                         

          66 EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM. 66

           Andy comes up to the house. He sees the yellow Porsche; then
           a large boxer dog sitting by the front garden. It starts
           barking at him. Andy calms him right down.

                          ANDY
           Hey, hey - who are you, mate -
           lost, are you?
           Andy strokes Boss.

           Andy opens the kitchen door.

                          ANDY
           Tam? You want breakfast?
           Boss bounds inside and disappears.

                          ANDY

                          WOAH -
           Andy is puzzled. He steps into the hall.

                          ANDY
           Do you know about this dog, Tam -
           He notices two half-drunk beers. He wanders into the hall. He
           sees Ben's boots and most of Tamara's clothes, abandoned. The
           unmistakable moans of lovemaking are coming from Tamara's
           room.
           He turns on his heels, pained.

                         

          67 EXT. DAY. THE FIELD. (WINNARDS). 67

           Andy strides back across the field, chucking the mushrooms in
           the mud on his way.

           Postcard of Winnards Farm. The exterior is half-decorated. 
           Two cars parked - Tamara's and the yellow Porsche, which 
           looks more like a permanent fixture. The garden has been 
           cleared and dug, ready to plant. 
           Andy is stoking a bonfire. He is smouldering like the embers. 
           He gives the yellow Porsche an angry look.

           Nicholas and Glen are both walking in the field. They pass 
           each other, each managing a painful smile.

           Their smiles fade. Nicholas descending into deep gloom, Glen 
           into deep anxiety.

           Beth is mending the engine of her huge mower. Glen, now
           wearing a scarf, is sitting on the seat watching her work.

                          GLEN
           It's his most obscure novel `The Well-
           Beloved'. Most people have never even
           heard of it. About this guy of twenty
           who falls in love with a beautiful
           young woman. Then when he's forty, he
           meets the woman's daughter and he
           falls in love with her. And finally,
           when he's sixty he meets the

                          GRANDDAUGHTER -

                          BETH
           Oh he doesn't.

                          GLEN
           Yeah. Falls in mystical love. Hardy
           was like that in his life, too. Even
           as he aged, he only had eyes for
           young women. Like, in one essential
           way he never grew up.

                          BETH
           In his trousers.

                          GLEN
           He was still at it in his eighties.
           You know? Snow on the rooftop but
           fire in the cellar...

                          BETH
           Why won't it come for you Glen?
           The way you talk about it's so
           engaging.

                          GLEN
           Yeah but there's an academic style,
           you know?

                          BETH
           Who are you writing for? Who's your
           ideal reader?

           Glen can't answer.

                          BETH
           Because if you wrote the way you
           spoke... it would make me want to
           read Hardy.

                          GLEN
           Really?

                          BETH
           Yes. If you wrote like you were
           talking to a friend... Pass me that
           thing.
           Glen passes it, looking at Beth as she tightens a bolt.

                          BETH
           Try it now.
           Glen turns the key. The engine starts. Glen starts to drive
           the mower, delighted. Beth watches him, amused.

           I simply pander to popular taste.

           Oh your books are far more than that.

                          NICHOLAS
           Just airport fodder...
           Glen at the foot of the table, finds this modesty rich.

                          CAITLIN
           Your prose is so vivid. And Inchcombe
           - for all his flaws - is a man with
           total integrity.

                          GLEN
           Who did you base him on, Nicholas?

                          NICHOLAS

                          (IGNORING GLEN)
           My books don't say anything
           profound. I can't pretend to be an
           intellectual - not like Glen here,
           illuminating our ignorance with his
           critical glow - but I do love prose.
           And I think I can turn a reasonable
           story.
          Glen peers into the kitchen. Beth is serving desserts.

           Excuse me.
          He goes to help her, leaving the ladies around Nicholas like
          cups around a teapot.

                          GLEN
           Let me help.

                          BETH
           They need dusting with this.

                          GLEN
           I went to my room and I wrote for
           three hours. The time just
           vanished.

                          BETH
           That's great, that's brilliant.

                          GLEN
           I feel like a man who's just passed
           a gargantuan stool.

                          BETH
           Super. Sprig of mint on the top.
          Glen returns to the dining room with two desserts. He listens
          to Nicholas as he serves them.

                          NICHOLAS
           The real secret of being a writer
           is learning how to lie.
          A frisson of shock goes round the lady writers.

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
           Because that's what storytellers
           are. Thieves and liars...

           The room - her mother's - is empty except for a mattress on
           the floor, clothes rail, designer bean bag and desk.

           Tamara is sitting at it, tapping away on her PC, almost
           pained with concentration. Ben is bored.

                          BEN
           Are you done yet?

                          TAMARA
           I'm just starting something.

                          BEN
           That poxy column? Can't it wait?

                          TAMARA
           Not the column. Just stuff coming
           out. Don't want to stop it.

                          BEN
           Do it later. Play with me.
           Ben strums his guitar, determined to get her attention.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           She is such fun she's sexy
           And she lives on an old farm
           But something gnaws away at me
           It's causing me real harm.
           Tamara, what can you do with it?
           What can you do with her name?
           Its stands there lonely and
           rhymeless It's driving me nearly
           insane.
           Tamara the lovely, the ultimate,

          72 EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE GARDEN. 72

           Andy is planting a bed. Ben's boxer dog is digging up work
           he's just done. Andy swears at him under his breath.

           BEN (O.S.)
           Hey - Andy?
           Andy looks up. Ben is at the bedroom window, naked.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           Can you let my dog in? Thanks mate.
           Jody and Casey watch from behind the hedge as Andy angrily
           goes to let the dog in.

           He must like kissing plastic.

                          JODY
           He doesn't love her. He's just on
           the rebound from losing Fran;
           numbing his pain with loads of
           empty, rampant sex. What he really

           So? Stranger things happen. He's
           only ten years older and that's
           nothing. If he met me, if he just
           met me...

                          CASEY
           It'd be love, right?

                          JODY
           Yeah.

                          (SHE GRINS)
           But I'd settle for sex.

           Beth is feeding the hens.

                          BETH
           Coo-er... In your parents' bedroom?
           Still I suppose being an
           exhibitionist is part of his job -
           strutting about on stage.

                          ANDY
           He doesn't strut; he's a drummer.
           He sits on his arse.

                          BETH
           Very good-looking, isn't he? Poppy
           You-Tubed him and we both got quite
           hot and bothered. Is that his car -
           the yellow Porsche?

                          ANDY
           Yep.

                          BETH
           Bit brash, vrooming through the

           was such an ugly duckling. She must

          74 INT. DAY. EWEDOWN - THE PUB. 74

           Andy peers through the door. Zoe is setting tables. He
           knocks. Zoe let's him in.

                          ZOE
           We're not open for another hour.

           I'm going to move on soon, Andy.

           Don't know if I can stick a winter
           here. The way the light disappears;
           it's doing me in. I'm a blue sky
           girl. Got to have some warmth.
           Andy just looks up at her, smiling his understanding.

                          ANDY
           We all need a bit of that, don't we.

                         

          76AA EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM. 76AA 

           Boss is outside, sniffing round the front door. Sounds of the 
           end of an epic shag from the upstairs window. He sits, bored. 
           He hears the noise of crows in the field. 
           He is off like a shot. 

                         

          76A EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD. THE FIELD IN FRONT OF NICHOLAS' SHED.


                          76A
           Boss is having the time of his life chasing the cows. Penny
           Upminister, an uppercrust landowner in a horrible coat is
           trying to catch him.

           The whole herd is now on the rampage, Boss in pursuit, Penny 
           bringing up the rear. Nicholas sees them heading straight for 
           his shed. 

                          NICHOLAS

           Tamara is opening a Tiffany's box. There is a ring inside it.
           She looks at Ben, almost in disbelief. Boss can be heard,
           barks fading in the distance.

                          TAMARA
           What's this?

           Ben... For which finger?

                          BEN
           Whatever one you like. That's a
           nice one. Why not put it on that?
           He's pointing to her ring finger. Tamara is moved.

                          PENNY
           It beats me why you people want to
           live in the country. You've got no
           sense of responsibility.

                          BETH
           It's not our dog!

                          NICHOLAS
           Hello, Penny. How's tricks?
           Penny is suddenly all coy.

                          PENNY
           Oh - Nicholas...

                          NICHOLAS
           You're looking great. Terrific coat.

                          PENNY
           What, this old thing?

                          NICHOLAS
           You look like royalty.

                          PENNY
           (laughs, delighted)
           Well, I try... Can't wait for your
           next book. Inchcombe's such a sauce-
           pot. Giles is always says `What are
           you reading Penny? You've got steam
           coming out of your ears...'
           She laughs like a drain. Nicholas joins in. Beth is striding
           away with the dog, infuriated.

                         

          80 INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - TAMARA'S BEDROOM 80

           Ben has put a ring on Tamara's finger.

                          TAMARA
           So what's the ring saying, Ben?

                          BEN
           It's saying hello I'm a ring. Will
           you marry me?
           Tamara looks at him, searchingly.

           The ring says I'm platinum with a

           Tamara is grinning from ear to ear.

                          TAMARA
           You're the best fun in the world.
           I'd love to marry you.
           She throws her arms around his neck.

           Tamara holds him, profoundly affected. Something akin to fear
           flickers across Ben's eyes. The phone rings.

           Ben's Porsche skids to a halt, music blaring. Diggory is 
           looking on in irate astonishment. The hat is on. 

                          BETH
           Shhh! There are writers here, trying

           This is a Buff Orpington. She's 
           looking a bit peaky today. Not a

           decorative. 
           Beth puts down the hen. 

                          BETH

           Swipe's over. Thought the whole

                          NICHOLAS
           It wasn't on Newsnight, no.

           Ben is engaged to Tamara. Isn't
           that lovely? He'd just popped the
           question when I rang.

                          NICHOLAS
           She said yes?
          Nicholas can't hide his disbelief. Ben is insulted.

                          BETH
           We're delighted for you both.
          Boss leaps up, straining against a chain.

                          BEN
           Why's he on a chain?

                          BETH
           He was out of control.

                          BEN
           How'd you like to be chained up?

                          BETH
           He was chasing livestock. He
           could've got shot.

                          BEN
           They shoot him; I'll fucking shoot
           them. 
          He takes Boss. Beth and Nicholas are left alone.

                          NICHOLAS
           I think the word is gobshite.

                          BETH
           I hope he makes her happy. It's hard
           for girls when their dads walk out.
           Gives them bad taste in men.

                          BETH
           Just saying her father left when she
           was a girl and -

                          NICHOLAS
           That is ten pence psychology! You
           don't know what you're talking
           about, do you? 
           He walks away. Beth is completely taken aback.

                         

          82 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - NICHOLAS' SHED/ EXT. WINNARDS 82

           Nicholas, wearing a woolly hat and scarf, is writing.

           NICHOLAS (V.O.)
           Patel's eyes were open, eloquent in
           death...
           He looks up. In the distance, he can just see Tamara talking
           to Andy in the garden at Winnards Farm.
           Nicholas opens his desk. He finds a pair of old binoculars.
           He focuses them on Tamara. She holds out her hand with the
           ring on it. Andy has his arms wrapped around himself, his
           shoulders hunched. He nods, affecting congratulations.
           Nicholas tries to close in on Tamara. But she turns and goes
           indoors. Also the yellow Porsche arrives. Nicholas puts the
           binoculars down.

           NICHOLAS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           He knelt down - forensics be damned -
           and closed her eyes, forever.

                         

          83 INT. DAY. 10 MINUTES LATER. WINNARDS FARM - KITCHEN. 83

           Tamara is turning the ring around her finger.

                          BEN
           `Mai Buff Orpingtons. Oh, the
           written word. That's what the
           country does to you; turns you into
           one. What's up?

                          TAMARA
           It's a shame it doesn't fit. Perhaps
           you should have taken one of mine
           with you when you went to buy it.

                          BEN
           Yeah but I didn't know you then.

                          TAMARA
           So... when did you buy it?

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 54.

                         

                         
           Ben realises his mistake. Tamara laughs, shocked.

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           Was this for someone else?
           Ben shrugs, not wanting to admit. The truth dawns.

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           You gave it to Fran didn't you?

                          BEN
           So? It's yours now. She never wore
           it. She didn't want it.

                          TAMARA
           You asked her to marry you...?

                          BEN
           It was a gesture, OK, when she
           started seeing Steve. Backfired,
           anyway. Look, I love you now.
           Tamara doesn't believe him. She is devastated.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           It's not the ring that matters. I
           mean fuck the ring. It's just a
           consumerist piece of zinc. What
           matters is I want to marry you.

                          TAMARA
           Do you?

                          BEN
           Yeah. With my whole heart. And all
           the other stuff. Like my brain and my
           entrails and my whatever, pancreas.
           It all wants to marry you.
           He hugs her, starts kissing her but Tamara hardly responds.

                         

          84 INT. NIGHT. STONEFIELD - NICHOLAS' SHED./ EXT. WINNARDS 84

           Nicholas is staring out at the darkness. Beth is organising
           things around him.

                          BETH
           She wondered if you had a delivery
           date in mind. I told her Easterish.
           Mind that cocoa, it's hot.
           Across at Winnards, Tamara's bedroom light comes on. For a
           moment, she gazes out. Nicholas gazes back.

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 55.

                         

                         

                          BETH (CONT'D)
           There's a few invites; I'll pop them
           there. Just tick the ones you want
           to go to.
           Ben wraps his arms lovingly around Tamara. She draws the
           curtains as he pulls her away.

                          BETH (CONT'D)
           And Tim wants to know if you'll do
           your Christmas signing in Hadditon. I
           know he's always ungrateful but I
           think it's so important to keep these
           little bookshops open, don't you?

                          NICHOLAS
           Uh huh.
           Beth is on her way out. She turns and kisses him.

                          BETH
           Come in soon, my love.
           Nicholas stares out into the darkness. He isn't working. He
           isn't doing anything.

                         

          84A EXT. NIGHT. NICHOLAS' SHED. 84A


                         
           From the field, Nicholas is an ageing, isolated figure in a
           tiny pool of light.

          86 EXT. DAY. EWEDOWN - THE BUS SHELTER. 86

           Mud, frost and gloom add to the sense of neglect. Jody is
           smoking. Casey is eating Pringles. They share a magazine.

                          CASEY
           Look at that cellulite...

                          JODY
           She been sitting on a bead car-seat
           or what?
           Casey turns a page.

                          CASEY
           `Her latest tattoo count was nine,
           including a Sumatran tiger and
           `Eternity' written in Sanskrit.'

                          JODY
           She'll be getting a barcode done
           next. Right across there.

                          CASEY
          Nice baby though. I'd like one that
          colour.

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 56.

                         

                         
           Jody chucks her fag-end into the bin.

                         

          87 EXT. DAY. EWEDOWN - THE BUS SHELTER - FIVE MINUTES LATER. 87

           The bin is on fire. Casey chucks in the Pringles box. They
           warm their hands, watching one of the boys wheelie his bike
           and fall off right into a freezing puddle. Casey giggles.

                          CASEY
           That Ryan...

                          JODY
           What a dick.

                          CASEY
           I think he's cute.

                          JODY
           No you don't. Would you snog him?

                          CASEY
           Maybe.

                          JODY
           Be like having a slug in your mouth.
           Ben's yellow Porsche speeds right through the puddle, further
           soaking Ryan. Ben and Tamara are both wearing designer shades
           despite the gloom; Boss in the back.
           Jody and Casey are both on their feet in a second.

                          JODY (CONT'D)
           Ben! Ben!

                          CASEY

           BEN!!!

                          RYAN
           Wankers.
           Ben gives them a grin and a wave. Jody's heart soars.

                          JODY
           Come on.

           Jody is outside the back door. She lifts a flowerpot and
           takes the key from underneath.

                          JODY
           She keeps this here for Andy.

                          CASEY 
           What if she's got an alarm? 

                          JODY 
           Soon find out. 
          Jody opens the door. They go in. The alarm is hanging off the 
          wall, the wires pulled out. Jody grins at Casey, satisfied.

           What if they come back?

                          JODY
           If you're too chicken, go home.
           The girls wander in, awed. Jody turns and grins, her eyes
           like a cat's.

                         

          90 INT. NIGHT. HADDITON - A BOOK SHOP. 90

           Nicholas is doing a book signing. There's a good crowd.

                          NICHOLAS
           Is that Claire with an `i'?
           Beth has a tray of mince pies. Glen is at her side.

                          BETH
           What about you, Glen? Where will you
           be?

                          GLEN
           In London with a collection of spare
           academics. I guess we'll be decking
           the halls in our own erudite way.

                          BETH
           I'll miss our chats. 

                          GLEN
           I've been in a state of writerly
           bliss these last weeks. I hope I
           get to come back.

                          BETH
           Me too. We'd love to have you.
           Glen doesn't want Beth to move away.

                          GLEN (CONT'D)
           You know, this is the best mince pie
           I've ever had.

                          BETH
           Oh?

                          GLEN
           If it was possible to have an orgasm
           from mere food, this mince pie would
           do it.

                          BETH

                          (EMBARRASSED)
           Golly.
           She moves away. Glen heads for the wine, kicking himself.

          Tamara and Ben walk in. Ben looks at the country casuals in
          undisguised horror.

                          BEN
           What the fuck are we doing here?

                          TAMARA
           It's kind of research; I want to
           write about them. They're funny, Ben -
           come on.
          They move through the crowd.

                          VINTNER
           The 2001 was the best. Someone just

          Arriving at the mulled wine.

                          TAMARA
           Besides, I want to show you off.

                          BEN
           What am I - arm candy?

                          TAMARA
           More like arm fungus with that face
           on. Ben, meet Glen. Glen, meet Ben,
           my fiance.

                          GLEN
           You're getting married?

                          TAMARA
           Uh huh.

                          GLEN
           OK. Beautiful dress, magazine
           photoshoot - everything the
           aspiring novelist needs.

                          TAMARA
           I knew you'd be pleased.

                          GLEN
           Have a mince pie.

                          BEN
           Can we get out of here?

                          TAMARA

          She abandons him. Glen has turned away. Ben stands amid the
          nice chat, like a man being tortured.
          Meanwhile, Tamara is jumping the queue at Nicholas' desk.

                          ARMY GEEK
           In Field of Tares, you made Fred a
           corporal. But there's no such thing
           in the Royal Artillery. They call

           Oh, thank you for that...

           Sorry.
          She flashes a smile at the Army Geek and puts her copy down
          in front of Nicholas.

                          TAMARA
           Could you do it for Ben? He's my
           fiance. We're getting married in

           So I hear. You have my heartiest
           commiserations, Tara.
           He hands her the book dismissively. Tamara is smarting.

                          TAMARA
           Well merry Christmas. Nicholarse.
           She turns away.

                         

          91 INT. NIGHT. WINNARDS FARM - TAMARA'S BEDROOM. 91

           Jody sniffs Ben's aftershave, longingly. Casey plucks his 
           guitar. They listen to the note in hushed awe. 
           Jody puts her foot into one of Tamara's killer stilettos. She 
           picks up Ben's drumsticks and kisses them, reverently. 

                          JODY
           We gotta live the dream, Casey.
           Live the dream...
           Jody and Casey jump up and down on the unmade bed. Jody pulls 
           a black T-shirt from under a pillow. She holds it to her
           face.

                          JODY (CONT'D)
           Ben...
           Casey is looking out of the window. The yellow Porsche is
           heading up the lane.

                          CASEY
           Omigod!
           A wild panic. They put things back where they found them.

                          JODY
           Go! Go! Go!
           She nicks the T-shirt.

           They dive behind a bush as the car pulls in. They lie on the
           ground splitting their sides with hushed laughter, as Ben and
           Tamara disappear into the house.

           Why don't you sell it like you keep
           saying?

                          TAMARA
           Because... I've started writing.

                          BEN
           You can write anywhere.

                          TAMARA
           But this is proper. Not just stuff
           for the paper. 'It's about my teens -
           and is working for me here.

                          BEN
           Well it might be memory lane for you
           but it's doing my fucking head in. I
           want London. I want some Urban, OK?
           Are you with me or what? Cos I've had
           it with this place.
           Tamara is hurt - and deeply disappointed.

                          TAMARA
           Of course I'm with you...

                          BEN
           It's drab. It's depressing. And every 
           time I look out of the window I see
           Andy's arse - what's that about?

                         

          93 EXT. NEXT DAY. STONEFIELD - ANDY'S CORRUGATED SHACK. 93

           Andy is bending down, the top of his arse peeking out in the
           morning sun. Ben stares at it with distaste. Andy is plucking 
           a goose, putting all his frustration into it.

                          BEN
           We're leaving. Thank God. 
           Andy looks at him.

                          BEN
           Tamara says you sell Christmas geese.

                          ANDY
           Yep.

                          BEN
           Can I have one?

                          ANDY
           Right now?

                          BEN
           Yeah.
          Andy smirks, pointing at a big white duck.

                          ANDY
           That one's spare.

                          BEN
           Is that a goose?

                          ANDY
           You can take it now if you like.

                          BEN

                          (DISGUSTED)
           Oh come off it.

                          ANDY
           What?

                          BEN
           It's fucking alive.

                          ANDY
           Oh, you want it from Tesco, all
           plucked and headless sitting on a
           bandage.
          Ben's curiosity gets the better of him.

                          BEN
           How d'you do it then?
          Andy points towards an upturned traffic cone, held in place
          by a metal frame.

                          ANDY
           Gently put it's head down there; then
           quick in the skull with an air rifle. 
           Pluck it while it's warm, little pot 
           to catch all the blood -

                          BEN
           Do you enjoy doing that?

           No, but in my low wage economy, this
           flock's worth a lot.

                          BEN
           You're a sick fuck, Andy.
          Andy has had enough.

                          (SQUARING UP)
           What did you say?
           Andy stands. He's at least two inches taller than Ben.

                          ANDY
           I said grow up, little drummer boy.
           Ben thinks about it. He walks away. Glen appears with his
           suitcase on wheels containing most of his worldly goods.

                          ANDY
           Tamara rang me this morning. Said 
           to finish the house. It goes on the 
           market in the spring and that's it;
           over.

                          GLEN
           Why does the asshole always get the
           girl?
           He stands with Andy; comrades. Andy slaps him on the back.

                          ANDY
           Come on. Or you'll miss that train.

                         

          94 INT. SIX WEEKS LATER. WINNARDS FARM - TAMARA'S BEDROOM. 94 

           Snow falling outside. Jody and Casey are in school uniform.
           Jody curled up on the bed; Casey at Tamara's PC. The room has 
           been redecorated. 

                          JODY
           It won't be just a shag, Case. It'll
           be an event. I'll be wearing like a
           gossamer slip with a bra bit; Prada.
           Or like a filmy, linen shirt, and...
           We see Jody's thought bubble. Ben is leaning against the door 
           frame, giving her a smouldering look. 

           JODY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           He'll be wearing a black T-shirt all
           taut over his buff bod and underneath
           Calvin Klein Boxers, black.
           Jody moves towards Ben. He buries his face in her neck as if
           he's found the love of his life.

           JODY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          And he'll have like one tattoo of my
          name and lush pecs and we'll have
          candles and white sheets and I'll
          smell of Allure by Chanel.

           Ben lifts Jody on to the bed. They marvel at each other. He
           bends down to kiss her.

           JODY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           And he tries to stop himself but I'm
           a vision and he gets drawn into my
           power and it'll be like Uhhh... But
           also respectful. And my `V' plates
           will melt into nothing.
           She looks up. Casey is reading at the PC.

                          JODY (CONT'D)
           Are you listening?

                          CASEY
           I like this.

                          JODY
           What?

                          CASEY
           There's this bit right, where her dad
           takes her for dinner and she thinks
           it's some big treat but what he's
           doing, right, is telling her he's
           leaving them. And she, right, she's
           gutted and she yaks all her food into
           a napkin and puts it on his plate.

                          JODY
           So?

                          CASEY
           It's painful. But funny. It's about
           her; Plastic Fantastic. She's sad,
           Jode.

                          JODY
           Sad? She's a lucky cunt.

           Outside the farm the snow falls.

                         

          95 INT. DAY. LONDON - BEN'S WAREHOUSE FLAT. 95

           Tamara is trying to write. Ben is playing his drum kit, high
           as a kite. The noise is deafening. Tamara sits back, looking
           around the boyish pad. It feels alien. The phone rings.

                         

          96 EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM 96

           Andy is on the phone, examining the decrepit shed. Nothing 
           has changed in a decade.

          Hang on... 

                          ANDY

           FARM.
           Tamara takes the phone out onto the balcony to escape the
           noise. She slowly smiles, knowing what he's thinking. 

                          TAMARA
           I don't know; the shed... What do
           you think?

                          ANDY
           I recommend preserving it.

                          TAMARA
           Really?

                          ANDY
           Always useful, a good shed.

                          TAMARA
           Well then. Keep it...
           Andy puts the phone down, grinning. Tamara is grinning too,
           sharing the same memory.

           Beth is decorating a little pink valentine cake. She's on the

           Beth looks at the cake. It says To My Valentine in piped 
           lettering around the edge. She picks up her icing bag, full 
           of unease. 
           In the middle of the cake she ices a big question mark. Then 
           she quickly looks up a number and dials. 

                          BETH

           Oh - actually - don't worry - I've 
           just found it. 
           Beth puts the phone down, biting her lip. She is relieved, 
           ashamed and ultimately not reassured. She looks to camera. 

                          BETH 
           Nicholas has been telling the truth 
           a lot recently.

           Jody, dressed in Tamara's leopard skin coat, is admiring
           herself in Tamara's mirror, swigging from a bottle of wine.
           We hear Casey reading the card.

           You are so fit
           I wanna shag you.
           Love from Ben pfwoor!!!
           Jody takes another swig with a wicked grin, she sits at
           Tamara's PC.
           We hear Casey knock three times on the back door.

                          CASEY
           I sent you that.
           Jody takes another swig from the bottle of wine.

           Is that theirs?

                          JODY
           It's my mum's; they don't drink this
           shit.
           She hands it to Casey.

           I just did.
          Casey is appalled.

          Jody nods.

           Ben is reading the email looking angry and jealous.

           What the fuck is this?

           `Come to Winnards Farm.'

           Andy is on the public computer looking completely puzzled.

           Zoe is leaning over Andy's shoulder, reading the email.

           She must want a foursome. Or

           Ben is bashing away at his drums. Boss is barking. Tamara is
           trying to remonstrate with Ben over the din.

                          TAMARA
           How many times? I didn't send it!
           Are you listening to me? BEN! WILL

           He stops. He looks at her, betrayed.

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           Why don't you believe me? I didn't
           write that email.

                          BEN
           Explain it then.

                          TAMARA
           Is this about Fran?

                          BEN
           What's Fran got to do with it?

                          TAMARA
           She's the reason you don't trust me.
           Just because she fucked around on
           you it doesn't mean that I will.
           Ben, furious, starts drumming again. Tamara boiling with
           frustration, walks away.

           FIELD (LIMBURY) OUTSIDE ANDY'S SHED.
           Tamara is on the phone at the far end of the flat.

                          TAMARA
           I wasn't pissed, or depraved or

                          ANYTHING -
           Andy is outside his shed.

                          ANDY
           It's OK, it's OK...
           The drumming leads up to a massive crescendo and stops.

                          TAMARA
           Can you go to the farm? Just take a
           look, see if anyone's been in.

                          ANDY
           No problem.

                          TAMARA
           Thank you. Ben's really pissed off.
           He's massively got the hump -
           Ben appears from the other end of the large room.

                          BEN
           Have I?

                          TAMARA
           I've just asked him to go and check
           over the farm -

                          BEN
           Are you thick?

                          TAMARA
           What?

                          BEN
           Isn't it obvious who sent it? That
           tosser Andy Cobb.

                          TAMARA
           He wouldn't do that.

                          BEN
           Making himself all cosy in your
           house. Going through your stuff,
           prob'ly wearing your fucking pants -

           No way!

                          BEN
           Bet it was him that nicked my black
           T-shirt.

                          TAMARA
           There is no way Andy would do that!
          Ben pulls his jacket on.

                          BEN
           Well that says it all; the way you
           leap to his defence.

                          TAMARA
           He hasn't done anything.

                          BEN
           You know what? I know Fran fucked
           my best friend but at least she was
           straight with me.

                          TAMARA
           Ben - where are you going? Don't
           go!

           He pushes her away, harder than he meant to. She lands on the
           sofa, shocked.

                          BEN (CONT'D)

                          (WITHOUT APOLOGY)
           I'm taking the dog for a crap.
           He grabs the lead and opens the door. It slams shut. Tamara's
           dread overwhelms her.

                         

          106 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE KITCHEN. 106

           Poppy is reading a print-out of Tamara's email. Beth is
           folding sheets.

                          POPPY
           Oh come on mum. She's just stirring
           shit. Tamara's always done that.

                          BETH
           Why's your father on there - and
           poor Andy? It's so tasteless.

                          POPPY
           (helping with the sheets)
           You know how subversive she is. She
           once sent me a valentine from
           Prince Harry - and I believed it.
           It's her sense of humour; she likes
           causing trouble. At school she used
           to give us first years tips on how
           to shoplift.

                          BETH
           She taught you to shoplift?

                          POPPY
           Mum, she's marrying Ben Sergeant.
           Why would she look at an old git
           like dad?
           Nicholas is in the shadowy hall, listening with interest.
           Poppy helps Beth upstairs with the laundry. Nicholas steps
           into the kitchen. Poppy has left the email on the table.
           Nicholas picks it up, deeply curious.

           Tamara arrives outside her house. Depressed. She remains in 
           the car, reluctant to go in, to face her isolation. 
           She looks at herself in the mirror. The face that stares back 
           seems like that of a stranger.

           The mask drops. All her old insecurities come back. She gets 
           out of the car and slams the door, unable to stand the sight 
           of herself. She lets herself in. 

                         

          109C INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM. 109C 

           The inside of the house has been transformed by Andy. The 
           drab gloomy shades of her mother have gone, replaced by warm 
           tones which bring out the beauty of the house. 
           Tamara wanders through. She turns around taking it all in. 
           She never knew the house was so beautiful.

           Nicholas sees Tamara. He waits while she emerges from the

           reading about? 

                          TAMARA
           Oh fuck off.

                          NICHOLAS
           I liked your email. Very succint. 

                          TAMARA
           Well I didn't send it. And I wouldn't
           shag you if you were the last man
           left after a nuclear winter.

                          TAMARA
           Drop dead you smug prick.
           Nicholas watches her storm back up the copse.

                         

          113 EXT. DAY. EWEDOWN. THE VILLAGE PUB. 113

           Tamara's car pulls up. Jody and Casey wheel around closer on
           their bikes. Tamara tries the door. The pub is shut. She
           looks in through the glass and sees Zoe up on the bar,
           clinging to Andy in a long embrace. Tamara is frozen. Andy
           kisses Zoe, long and tender.
           Tamara turns.
           She gets back in her car, trying to hide her distress - which
           has taken her completely by surprise. Jody and Casey stare
           mutely as she drives away.

           Andy and Zoe finish their kiss.

           Still time to change your mind. Blue
           skies. Fun in the sun.

                          ANDY
           Just not a traveller, Zoe.

                          ZOE

                          (GENTLY)
           I know... you're like a big old
           tree. Stuck here.

                         

          115 EXT. NEXT DAY. A SECLUDED LANE. 115

           Nicholas parks his 4X4. As he gets out, he is on the phone.

                          NICHOLAS
           I'll probably stay on at the library
           for another hour or two. Yes... just
           checking some law reports.

          116 INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE KITCHEN / HALL. 116

           Tamara is playing with the ill-fitting ring that Ben gave
           her. She puts it a jar and closes the lid. There's a knock on 
           the front door. She startles, her face falling. She answers 
           it. Nicholas is on the threshold. 

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 75.

                         

                         

                          NICHOLAS
           Hello.

                          TAMARA
           So. Nicholas.
           She lets the door fall open. She backs into the hall.
           Nicholas walks in. He closes the door. They look at each
           other. Neither of them moves.

                          NICHOLAS
           You can tell me to leave.
           Tamara says nothing. 

                          NICHOLAS
           You can throw me right out.
           Nicholas slowly takes his red scarf and coat off. He hangs
           them on a coat hook, bringing himself closer to her.

                          NICHOLAS
           Just say and I'll go.
           She still can't speak. Nicholas takes her in his arms. He is 
           big and fatherly and comforting.
           Tamara feels a sense of relief, of not being alone. Her arms 
           go around him. When he kisses her, he's surprisingly real,
           vulnerable even, as if he's left his lordly persona at the
           door. Tamara closes her eyes.
           Their kisses become more urgent.

                         

          117 INT. DUSK. WINNARDS FARM - TAMARA'S BEDROOM. 117

           Tamara is lying in Nicholas' arms in the growing darkness. He
           looks blissfully post-coital. Tamara is gazing ahead. A tear
           rolls down her cheek. It lands on Nicholas' chest.

                          NICHOLAS
           Are you crying?

                          TAMARA
           No.
           Nicholas is taken aback. He instinctively holds her.

                          NICHOLAS
           Don't cry. Am I really that bad?
           Tamara shakes her head, glad of him.

                          TAMARA
           I'm just not myself. 

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 76.

                         

                         

                          NICHOLAS
           Yes you are.
           She looks up at him.

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
           You're relentlessly, rudely,
           uncompromisingly yourself.
           A smile appears on Tamara's face. 

                          TAMARA
           I used to watch you out of my window
           helping your daughter learn to
           skateboard up the lane. Bit of an
           obvious crush, wasn't it.

                          NICHOLAS
           Is that why you're crying?

                          TAMARA
           No.

                          NICHOLAS
           Am I here as revenge on your ex?

                          TAMARA
           I don't know why you're here. Why are
           you here, Nicholas?

                          NICHOLAS
           Because... since you climbed over
           that stile in the summer I haven't 
           thought about very much else.
           She doesn't believe him.

                          TAMARA
           You can use me in one of your books. 

                         

          118 INT. NIGHT. WINNARDS FARM - THE HALL. 118

           Nicholas is putting his coat on. Tamara is uneasy.

                          NICHOLAS
           When can we do this again?

                          TAMARA
           What about Beth?

                          NICHOLAS
           Look, Beth and I have this kind of

                          TAMARA
           Isn't life complicated enough?
           Nicholas shakes his head. He kisses her.

                         

          119 INT. NIGHT. STONEFIELD - THE KITCHEN. 119

           Nicholas strolls in. He's ecstatically happy. Beth is getting
           something out of the Aga.

                          BETH
           Oh poor you - was it awful?

                          NICHOLAS
           Bloody terrible. Didn't move till
           well past Chiswick. But look, I
           nipped into Fortnums...
           He hands her a package.

                          BETH
           All my favourite teas - Oh!
           He embraces her. He is affectionate, magnanimous in his
           bliss. Beth is taken aback by his warmth.

                          BETH
           My goodness. You feel like my buzzy
           toothbrush just after I've charged it
           up. You should go up to London more
           often.

                          NICHOLAS
           Maybe I will...
           Nicholas goes to the table. The writers greet him as he sits.

                          NICHOLAS
           Sorry everybody; traffic was a pig.
           Do carry on...

                          LUCETTA
           I'm trying this magic realist bit
           at the end of chapter three, where
           the characters slowly turn into

                          BIRDS -

                          NICHOLAS
           That sounds very innovative...

                          LUCETTA
           Do you think so? It's sort of the
           key to the structure, which I'm
           thinking of as a nest shape...

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 78.

                         

                         
           Nicholas listens benevolently as Lucetta shares. His good
           humour is so out of his recent character that Beth watches
           him with increasing unease. There is something in her eyes
           akin to suspicion.

           Beth is putting Glen's luggage into the boot.

                          GLEN
           So after two years of radio silence
           I contact my editor. And she loves -
           I mean loves the chapters I did in
           the fall.

                          BETH
           Oh Glen.

                          GLEN 
           I tried writing at the library but 
           I could feel that awful paralysis 
           descending again.

           GLEN (V.O.) 
           I missed everything that I've been, 
           you know, finding here. 
           (Seeing the view) 
           Oh my god - it's so beautiful! 
           They are now in the village driving down the main drag. 

                          BETH 
           I'm glad you've come back.

                          GLEN
           A few solid weeks should - holy cow!
           An egg hits the windscreen (shot the same way as the earlier
           scene). Casey and Jody hide. Beth gets out of the car to
           clean the window.

                          GLEN
           Idiots! Morons! Hey, writers! Let's

           There's this theory he gave his
           wife syphilis, right? No evidence
           but the symptoms fit. The poor
           woman gets kind of eccentric and
           moves her bed up to their attic -

           He gave his wife syphilis.

           Nicholas is reading, hunched over a computer. He glances 
           round. Tamara, wearing a robe, is awaiting his opinion. 

                          TAMARA 
           Is it any good? Because I keep - 

                          NICHOLAS 
           Shush. 
           (Points at the screen) 
           This is brutally candid. You lay 
           yourself completely bare. 

                          TAMARA 
           I'm well-known for it. 

                          NICHOLAS 
           Seriously. It's very moving. 
           Tamara knows this is praise indeed. She is deeply gratified. 

                          TAMARA
           Thank you.

                          NICHOLAS
           So... have I done my duty?

                          TAMARA
           Admirably.

                          NICHOLAS
           Now do I get my treat?
           Tamara, almost in his arms, is crestfallen.

                          TAMARA
           You are so cheesy.
           Tamara is staring at him with something akin to distaste.

           She should move on...

           She's probably topped herself. I

           Jode. Don't say that. What if she's

           We see Jody's thought bubble of Tamara luridly dead, her
           mouth coated with dried froth and vomit.

                          JODY
           D'you think she might be lying there
           all choked in vomit and drug froth?

                          CASEY
           That'd be dire.

          125A EXT. DAY. WINNARDS. DAY 125A 

           Andy is outside the farm beside his landrover. He walks up to 
           the front door. Hesitates. 
           Behind the railings, the girls arrive. 

                          CASEY 
           What's Uncle Andy doing here? 
           Andy knocks. 

                         

          126 INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM. TAMARA'S BEDROOM. 126 

           Hearing the knock, Tamara springs out of bed. Nicholas spins 
           into a panic.

           Casey and Jody are watching as Andy waits. 

                          CASEY 
           No answer... 

                          JODY 
           She could have been lying there 
           days. She could be like putrid now,

           Oh no, I'm gonna chuck - 

                          JODY 
           Like bloated and all greeny.

          127 I/E. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE HALL. 127
           Tamara opens the door in some deshabille. To her surprise, 
           she sees Andy on the threshold, looking spruced up and 
           handsome. The contrast with Nicholas couldn't be more 
           apparent. She finds herself genuinely pleased to see him. 

                          TAMARA
           Andy... 
           Behind the railings, the girls can't help their look of 
           disappointment at seeing her alive.

                          ANDY 
           Haven't seen you for a while. Thought
           you might be ill or something. Or
           depressed or -

                          TAMARA
           I've had my head down, writing.

                          ANDY
           Come for a drink. Let's lighten up. 

                          TAMARA 
           I'd love to, but... 

                          ANDY 
           Shake off the winter blues. Come 
           celebrate the spring. 

                          TAMARA
           I can't... I'm kind of on one with 
           my writing.
           Over her shoulder, Andy sees Nicholas' red scarf and coat
           hanging on the coat hook. He hides his shock. Tamara is 
           unaware that he has seen. 

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           Can we do it soon though? I'd 
           really like to; just not right now. 
           He nods at her in disbelief. 

                          ANDY 

                          (COOLLY) 
           Sure. 
           He turns on his heels and goes. Tamara closes the door. 
           Outside, Andy is leaning over his land-rover, sickened. 

                          JODY 
           D'you think he's in with a chance? 

                          CASEY 
           No way. 

                          JODY 
           Why not? He's fit. I'd do him. 

                          CASEY 
           Jody - he's my uncle. 

                          JODY 
           She'd be mad not to have him - I
           bet he goes a like a train.

                         

          128 INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE HALL. 128

           Nicholas is creeping down the stairs. Tamara is troubled. 

                          NICHOLAS 
           What's he doing here? 

                          TAMARA 
           He just came on the off-chance.

           Off-chance of what? 

                          TAMARA 
           He wants to know about roofing for

           Andy's Land Rover roars away.

                          CASEY
           Wait!!
           Casey is looking back at Tamara's door. Tamara is peering
           out. Nicholas joins her, putting his coat on. He kisses her
           passionately. He wants to stay. She's insisting he leaves.

                          JODY
           Oh. My. God.

                          CASEY
           It's him. From Stonefield.

          130 INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE KITCHEN. 130

           Tamara wanders in looking like she's trying to shake Nicholas
           out of her hair. She sits, full of apprehension.
           We see her fears: Beth, in her apron, pulling Tamara's hair
           back and coming at her face with an electric hand-held whisk.

                          BETH
           You fucking little slut.
           She puts her head in her hands.

                          BETH

           Nicholas is striding purposefully back to his car with a smug 
           post-coital grin. Then he sees that one of his tyres has been 
           let down. 

                          NICHOLAS
           Shit salad.
           He gets out his phone. Jody and Casey are in the trees
           watching, satisfied.

           Tamara is half-running down the track with a foot pump.

           Yes, it's a frightful bore.

           BETH (O.S.)
           Well I'll hold off on the paella.
           Tamara arrives, breathless. Nicholas signals her to keep
           quiet. She looks guilty, anxious.

                          NICHOLAS
           You're a marvel. See you soon.

           The line goes dead. Beth is disconcerted. Glen walks in.

           Beth, could I use your printer?

                          BETH

           She snaps out of it. But she knows.

           The tyres are done. Nicholas is about to get in the car.

                          TAMARA
           Nicholas, someone knows. Maybe we 

                          SHOULD -

                          NICHOLAS
           Who cares?
           He kisses her, passionately. She is troubled but eventually
           responds. Jody nudges Casey.

                          JODY
           Casey, pap them. Pap them!
           Casey holds out her mobile and takes a picture. Then Tamara
           extricates herself from his embrace. 
           Jody peers at Casey's photo. A close-up clinch.

                          JODY (CONT'D)

           Tamara, dressed for a walk, heads down the lane. She looks
           preoccupied.
           Jody appears from behind the hedge. She heads for the door,
           motioning Casey to follow.

           While I was sitting here. Look. An
           e-mail from Ben come in. Just like
           that, when I'm here.

                          (SHE READS:)
           `Tamara, Fran's baby has come.'

                         

          143 INT. DAY. LONDON - BEN'S WAREHOUSE FLAT. 143

           Ben is play-fighting with Boss.

           BEN (V.O.)
           And as it's a cute little brown girl
           with curly black hair I think we can
           safely say it's Steven Culley's and
           not mine. Truth is, I feel released.
           I am free! New band up and running.
           Done three songs about me and you.
           Ben throws a treat lovingly at Boss. Boss catches it.

           BEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Big favour to ask. We're recording in
           Paris. Would you have Boss?

           `Could drop him off next week. And
           when I'm back, maybe we could dot dot
           dot. Ben.'

                          CASEY
           He's coming back.

                          JODY
           Tamara doesn't deserve him, Case.

           into Casey's hand. Casey yowls. Jody presses send.

          145 INT. DAY. NICHOLAS' SHED. STONEFIELD. 145

           Nicholas is writing. Beth approaches.

                          BETH
           There's the festival brochure. You're
           on in the Lanson Marquee. I've marked
           a few bits in case you want to read.
           Beth hands him a hardback.

                          NICHOLAS
           You're a marvel. Cheers.
           He kisses her and prepares to leave. She is suspicious. 

                          BETH
           I could come with you.

                          NICHOLAS
           Oh, don't. You hate festivals. 

                          BETH
           But it's only Hadditon. I'll come. 

                          NICHOLAS
           It's completely boring. You'll hate
           it. Stay here.
           Her suspicion will stay silent no longer.

                          BETH
           Have you got anything to tell me,
           Nicholas?

                          NICHOLAS
           Like what?
           Nicholas attacks; the best form of defence.

                          NICHOLAS
           God, it's like living with the
           effing moral police. Are you ever
           going to trust me?
           He goes.

           Nicholas drives through a huge puddle in his 4X4, splashing
           Casey. He roars on, oblivious.

                          CASEY
           (getting her mobile out)
           Right. Wanker.

           Glen is admiring his finished manuscript. Beth is making
           sponge, preoccupied - but pleased at Glen's achievement.

           I'm doing this cake in celebration. 
           Well done.
          Glen holds up his mug of coffee.

                          GLEN
           To Hardy. 

                          BETH

                          (TOASTING HIM)
           Although I can't bear the man for
           what he did to his wife.
          Andy comes in with an armful of logs.

                          GLEN
           Well, things were different then.
           She had no choice. 
          Beth's mobile bleeps. She picks it up.

                          GLEN
           She couldn't just walk away. I mean
           who'd put up with that now?
          Beth drops the mixing bowl. She cannot speak.

                          GLEN (CONT'D)
           What is it?

                          BETH
           (Looking to Andy)
           How do I find out who sent this?
          Andy takes the phone, sees the photo.

                          ANDY
           It says number withheld.
          He returns the phone.

                          BETH 
           Did you know?
          Andy nods guiltily. Beth acknowledges what this means.

                          ANDY
           Couldn't tell you. I'm sorry Beth. 
          He leaves.

                          BETH
           Her...
          Glen looks at the photo; Nicholas and Tamara's clinch.

          Oh My God. This is just - this is
          horrible.

                          BETH
          Right under my nose. I feel sick.

                          GLEN
           It's so shitty, so insulting. You 
           do not deserve to be treated -

                          BETH
           If you're kind to me, I'll cry. I
           don't want to cry. I must be very
           clear.

                          GLEN
           If there is anything I can do...

                          BETH

                          (MOVING AWAY)
           I have to do it myself.
           Beth's face cracks into distress.

                          GLEN
           Hey, come on.

                          BETH
           I trod in the sponge mix.

                          GLEN
           It's OK. It's OK.

          150 EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD. ANDY'S CORRUGATED SHED. 150

           Tamara is out on a walk. She approaches the shed; sees Andy's
           landrover parked beside it.

                          TAMARA (CALLING)
           Andy?
           Andy emerges. Tamara smiles tentatively. 

                          TAMARA
           Hey. How are you? 
           Andy says nothing.

                          TAMARA
           Would you like to have that drink? I 
           could do with a friend / at the 
           moment and - 

                          ANDY 
           You and Nicholas Hardiment. That's a
           nice piece of work isn't it?

          Tamara is utterly dismayed.

                          ANDY
           I get it from his point of view. He's
           always been a cheating wanker. He
           loves having his cake and eating it - 
           But since when did your standards
           drop so low? You could have anyone.
           All you have to do is bat your eyes.

                          ANDY
           I care a lot about Beth. She helped
           me out when I was at rock bottom.

                          TAMARA
           I'm not going to split them up. It's

                          JUST -

                          ANDY

                          (WITH CONTEMPT)
           A bit of fun?
          Tamara is covered with shame. 

                          TAMARA 
           It's none of your bloody business. 

                          ANDY 
           I reckoned I could still see the 
           blazing girl you used to be. But now?

           No dogs, no way and that's final.
           Jody is devastated.

           I don't know. But he might. And I
           wouldn't blame him.

           Well, I suppose it has to come out 
           sometime.

                          TAMARA
           Does it? 

                          NICHOLAS
           It's a good thing. Feels like a 
           relief. Means you and I can start to 
           think about our plans. For the
           future...

                          TAMARA
           Nicholas?...

           I know it's been hard, sharing me 
           with Beth. But I'm yours now. I'm 
           going to leave her. I want a new 
           life - and I want it now. With you. 
           Tamara is appalled. A minder interrupts.

           During the interview, Tamara takes a seat at the end of the

                          NICHOLAS
           It all runs very smoothly. I start a
           book in the summer, publish it the
           following spring. Bit of a factory, 
           really. 

                          INTERVIEWER
           So you've just finished `Like The
           Night', Inchcombe's seventeenth
           adventure. Are you already planning
           the next?

                          NICHOLAS
           There won't be a next one. Frankly 
           I'm sick to death of Inchcombe. In 
           fact, I'm about to kill him off.
           There's a gust of dismay in the crowd, as though a real death
           has been announced.

                          INTERVIEWER
           That's a bombshell for your fans.

                          NICHOLAS
           (all for Tamara)
           Yes, but I'm moving on to fresh
           pastures.

           LADY IN THE CROWD
           No!

                          NICHOLAS
           Inchcombe will be meeting a very
           sticky end. And it's one murder I'm
           really looking forward to.

           LADY IN THE CROWD
           How could you?

                          INTERVIEWER
           This might be a good moment to take a
           few questions. Yes, the lady in the
           apron...

                          BETH
           You write a lot about adultery. Is
           that from personal experience?
           Tamara turns round. Nicholas' colour drains. Beth is with
           Glen, close by - glaring at him. He tries to make a joke.

                          NICHOLAS
           Madam, what a saucy question!

                          BETH
           Why do you cheat persistently on your
           wife?
           Nicholas considers whether he wants to be publicly
           humiliated. He decides not.

                          NICHOLAS
           Because she lets me.
           Beth takes this like a blow. Even Tamara is shocked by it.

                         

          156 EXT. DAY. HADDITON - THE GROUNDS BY THE MARQUEE. 156

           Tamara is striding away from the Marquee, red with shame.
           Nicholas is at her side almost jogging to keep up. 

                          TAMARA
           It's got to stop, Nicholas.

                          NICHOLAS
           You're right. I can't go on using 
           her, lying to her. Won't be fun but
           I've got to do it.

                          TAMARA

                          LISTEN -

                          NICHOLAS
           I don't feel alive with Beth! I
           haven't been living for years. She's 
           had me smothered in a comfy blanket - 

                          TAMARA
           Nicholas, listen to me.
          She makes him look at her.

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           We had fun. But it's wrong. And
           it's over. 

                          NICHOLAS
           But... I'm in love with you.

                          TAMARA
           I'm sorry. 
          Nicholas looks as if he's just been punched.

                          NICHOLAS
           No. You can't end it. Tamara - Fuck
           supper!

                          TAMARA
           Will you keep it down? 

                          NICHOLAS
           My God, you're cold hearted.

                          TAMARA 
           Please don't shout. 

                          NICHOLAS 
           You don't feel a thing, do you? 

                          TAMARA
           I do feel. I feel like I'm blazing
           away inside all the time. Why do I do
           these things? What am I doing with
           you?
          The question hangs between them.

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 97.

                         

                         

                          NICHOLAS
           There's someone else isn't there...

                          TAMARA
           Oh for God's sake. 

                          NICHOLAS
           Not that narcissist drummer? 

                          TAMARA
           Goodbye.

                          NICHOLAS
           It's that ignorant lunk isn't it?
           That muscle-bound wastrel Andy Cobb.

                          TAMARA
           Andy Cobb is a far better man than
           you!
           In saying it, Tamara realises it's true. She walks away.
           Nicholas bends almost double in pain, letting out a great
           moan from the soul. A fan has been waiting at a respectful
           distance. He approaches.
           Nicholas numbly takes his book. Instead of signing, he tears
           it to pieces. He hands the tatters back to the fan.

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
           Thank you.

                         

          157 I/E. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - HALL / TAMARA'S BEDROOM 157
           Jody knocks on the door. It's open. She pushes it.

                          JODY (CALLING)
           Hello? It's Jody Long. About the
           dog?
           She looks around.

                          JODY (CONT'D)
           Ben?
           She heads up the stairs.

          Jody enters Tamara's bedroom. She stares at the bed. She runs
          her hand over the cotton percale. She puts on Tamara's slip
          and looks at herself in the mirror.

                          BEN
           Hello Jody...
          Jody spins round.
          The door closes. Ben is standing behind it. He is wearing a
          tight black T-shirt; the man of her dreams.

                          BEN
           Dog minder? I guessed you might be
           the somebody who's been getting in
           here, pissing about, sending e-mails
           and fucking people up. D'you know 
           what I'm saying? You've been breaking
           in.

                          JODY
           I didn't break in. Used the key.

                          BEN
           What key?

                          JODY
           Found it under a pot.

                          BEN
           Well for fuck's sake. Did you nick
           my T-shirt?

                          JODY
           Took it as a souvenir. I'm sorry!
          Jody is very scared. She is crying.

                          BEN
           Creeping about in our stuff? What
           gives you the right?

                          JODY
           I just... like I always wanted to
           meet you...just once...just to tell
           you stuff...

                          BEN
           What stuff?

                          JODY
           Like... I love you.

                          BEN
           So that's nice. Least someone does.

                          



                         

                         

                          JODY
           I used to lie awake thinking about
           you being here... in Ewedown, the
           bumhole of nowhere. It was the
           best thing to happen ever. I've
           been so in love with you. And when
           you left I couldn't bear it. I
           thought the valentine would make
           you come back...

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           D'you still love me, Jody? Even
           though I wanna lock you up in a
           young offenders institution?
           Jody nods, unsure.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           What would you do for me then?
           Would you do anything, like a
           proper fan?
           Jody looks at him, scared. She manages a nod. Ben approaches
           her.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           Let's see then shall we?
           We see Jody's phone flashing on the bed. 

           CASEY (V.O.) 
           Jody! What are you doing not
           fucking answering?

                         

          158 EXT. DAY. EWEDOWN. 158

           Casey is at the triangle leaving a message on Jody's phone. 
           Boss is running round and round it.

                          CASEY
           Ben's dog. It's here. Means Ben
           must be - 
           Casey suddenly realises where Jody is. The dog runs off up 
           the street. Casey sets off towards Winnards, full of 
           apprehension.

                         

          159 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - DOWNSTAIRS. 159

           Beth is taking Nicholas' awards down and chucking them in a
           box. Glen is trying to save them from smashing.

                          BETH
           I bet that bitch wants a baby. Well
           she'll find out; Nicholas doesn't
           do children.

          She is brandishing a diamond dagger award.

                          BETH (CONT'D)
           He'll leave it all up to her.
           That'll age her.

           They do, these men, second time
           round. They get all nappy-happy.
           I was barely twenty when I got
           pregnant. I've never done
           anything! Oh God! God!

                          GLEN
           Yes you have. Look at this place!

                          BETH
           I hate him - I've wasted my life! 

                          GLEN
           No... What about all the work you do
           here?

                          BETH
           Breeding goats? Baking fucking
           biscuits? It's meaningless!
          Beth bawls. Glen holds her.

                          GLEN 
           Beth... When I was lost with my
           book you helped me more than you
           know. You asked who I was writing
           it for...
          He starts to really hold her. The sobbing subsides.

                          GLEN
           You.
          He kisses her. Beth looks at Glen; a revelation. The future
          opens up. She kisses him back.

                          NICHOLAS
           Excuse me.
          Nicholas is standing in the doorway, looking grey.

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
           May I speak with my wife?
          Glen releases Beth.

                          BETH
           No. You may not.
          She walks away.

           Beth walks outside towards the chicken coup. Nicholas pursues
           her. She sees Boss running across the grounds chasing birds.

                          NICHOLAS
           It's over.

                          BETH
           That's Ben Sergeant's dog. Perhaps 
           he's come to beat the shit out of 
           you - good! 

                          NICHOLAS
           Beth - I finished it. She's been 
           chasing me; this wild crush - 

                          BETH 

                          LIAR - 

                          NICHOLAS 
           There's something desperate about 
           her, something almost unhinged - 

                          BETH
           Good God, even when you try and 
           tell the truth you lie. YOU LIE!!
           Nicholas is falling apart.

                          BETH
           I want you to leave. I want a
           divorce. I want Stonefield.

                          NICHOLAS
           Beth...Don't. You can't.

                          BETH
           I will.

                          (TO BOSS)
           And you - Go home! Bugger Off!!
           She throws a handful of chicken feed at him. Boss runs away.
           Beth storms off.
           Nicholas looks profoundly shocked; like a man who has just
           realised he's in danger of drowning.

           Right. Now put two sugars in and
           stir it. OK. That's a decent cup.
           Which is lucky Jody cos if it had
           been shit, I'd be on the phone to

           Going to work in Vegas - as a

          162 EXT. DAY. A FIELD. 162

           Boss is lolloping round. He stops. The whole herd of cows is
           staring at him. Boss regards the animals with curiosity. He
           wags his tail. Will they play? He starts to bark.

                         

          163 EXT. DAY. THE FIELDS. 163

           Nicholas sees Glen sitting on the edge of an old rusting
           trough. Fury overwhelms him. 

                          NICHOLAS
           Oy! Greg! I want a a word with you.

                          GLEN
           It's Glen, asshole.
           Nicholas is stomping through the mud and cowshit. 

                          NICHOLAS
           You fucking devious bastard.

                          GLEN 
           I'm devious? I'm a bastard? 

                          NICHOLAS
           You think I haven't noticed how
           you've been worming your way in? 
           You keep your hands off my wife, 
           you low-rent pedant. 

                          GLEN
           You've abused her long enough / 
           with your goddamn lies - 

                          NICHOLAS 
           I want you out of my house.

                          GLEN 
           It's Beth's. She made this place - 

                          NICHOLAS
           And I fucking pay for it. I've 
           given Beth all this. What can you 
           give her? 

                          GLE 
           I can give her / integrity! 

                          NICHOLAS 
           Obscure literary shit not worth ten 

                          PENCE - 

                          GLEN
           You know if I made my pile
           fantasizing rapes and homicides I
           wouldn't be so proud.

                          NICHOLAS

                          (SHOVING HIM)
           You cunt.

                          GLEN
           Fuck you.
          Glen grabs him round the middle. They struggle like overgrown
          schoolboys.

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
           Beth'll come to her senses. You
           need an income to run Stonefield.
           And mine's bigger than yours!
          Glen nuts him. Nicholas slips backwards in the mud. He whacks
          his skull on the sharp, rusting corner of the trough. He
          falls to the ground. Glen is astonished at his own prowess.

                          GLEN
           Now... get up, Nicholas. Let's talk
           about this like grown men.
          Blood trickles from the wound on Nicholas' head. He moans.

                          GLEN (CONT'D)
           Oh my God. Nicholas...
          Glen becomes aware of a sound like a drumbeat, the drumming
          of hooves. The herd of cows come over the brow of the hill
          and down towards them. Boss is chasing them, barking. The
          beasts are terrified, stampeding.

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 104.

                         

                         
           They are heading straight for the trough. Nicholas is trying
           to get up on his knees.

                          GLEN (CONT'D)
           Nicholas! Get up! Run!
           Glen puts out a hand to help him. But before Nicholas
           notices, he instinctively retrieves it.
           Glen turns on his heels and runs, terrified. He throws
           himself into the hedge as the cows thunder past. They
           disappear down the hill, Boss still behind them.
           Glen looks back towards the water trough. Nicholas is lying
           on his front, his face pressed into the mud, unmoving.
           Glen walks over. He gingerly peers at him. The back of
           Nicholas' skull is broken open. Blood is pooling in the mud
           and shit. Glen panics. He looks all around. Has the accident
           been seen?
           No human is visible. Has his part in it been noticed? He
           bends down as if to turn the body over, in case by some
           miracle Nicholas still lives. He cannot bring himself to
           touch him. Fear overwhelms him. He runs away.

                         

          164 EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE KITCHEN / HALL. 164

           Tamara is looking at Jody, stunned.

                          TAMARA
           It was you?
           Jody can't look her in the eye.

                          BEN
           Jody has explained that she did it
           out of deep love for me.
           To Ben's astonishment, Tamara smiles. He grabs his moment. 

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           Tamara... 
           It's an apology. Tamara takes Ben's hand and leads him 
           through to a dresser in the hall. She opens it.

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           Ben. 
           She takes the ring out of the jar and puts it in his hand. 

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           I'm in love with someone else.
           At that moment, Casey appears at the back door.

          165 EXT. DAY. THE FIELDS. 165

           Boss is still worrying the herd. He's got them against a
           gate. The animals are very distressed. Behind them we see
           Andy's Landrover appear.

          165A EXT. DAY. THE FIELDS (LARKHAM) 165A

           Andy gets out of his Landrover, takes out his rifle, comes
           through the gate. Loads his rifle while watching the dog.

           As his finger tightens on the trigger.
           Bang. A shot rings out. He looks round, off right.

                         

          165F EXT. DAY. THE FIELDS (LARKHAM). 165F

           Up on the ridge of the hill, Penny Upminster is standing in a
           straw hat and flowery wellies, with a smoking gun.

           Beth is coming down the field where Nicholas lies. She sees a
           figure in the distance. She squints, the sun in her eyes.

                         

          168D EXT. DAY. COPSE (LARKHAM'S) 168D

           Opposite her she sees Tamara descending through the copse.

                         

          169 EXT. DAY. FIELD. (LARKHAMS) 169

           Tamara, walking down by the trough, discovers Nicholas' body.
           She drops to her knees, light-headed with shock.

                         

          170 EXT. DAY. FIELD. 170

           Beth walks into the field. She sees Tamara kneeling, looking
           at something on the other side of the trough.

                          BETH
           Bitch.
           Tamara looks up.

                          TAMARA
           Beth - no -

                          BETH
           Brazen. That is brazen.
           Beth carries on walking towards her.

                          TAMARA
           Beth. Don't.
           Tamara is running towards Beth. She cannot bear her to see.
           She throws her arms around her, protecting her.

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           Don't look. Don't look...
           It is too late. Beth is seeing the corpse. A great wave of
           shock hits her. Tamara holds her tight, trying to contain it.
           Another great wave of shock.

           Her cries of grief soar over the valley.

                         

          171 EXT. DAY. THE FIELD - LATER. 171

           Tamara, ashen, is on the phone to emergency services. 

                          TAMARA 
           You'll get to it through Byley farm. 
           His skull is broken. It's smashed. No 
           I haven't but... it's obvious. His 
           wife. Yes she is. Thank you. Thank 
           you. I will. 
           Beth has turned Nicholas over. She is washing the mud from 
           his face with water from the trough.

                          TAMARA 
           They're on their way... 
           Beth seems totally closed off. Tamara gingerly approaches. 
           She touches Beth's shoulder.

                          TAMARA
           Beth? Help is coming - 
           Beth cannot bear to be touched. Her hand involuntarily flies
           out. It slams into Tamara's face.
           Tamara steps back. Her nose is broken, pouring blood.

                          TAMARA 
           It's broken! - 
           She gasps, riding the pain, knowing she deserves it. It's the 
           biggest wake-up call of her life.
           Beth stares at her, at first astonished at what she has done -
           then satisfied. Tamara stumbles away.

                         

          171A EXT. DAY. IN THE COPSE. LATER. 171A 

           Tamara sits beside a dewpond, gingerly washing the blood off
           her face.

                          ANDY
           Tamara...
           Andy is watching. She turns away from him. He approaches. 

                          TAMARA 
           I'm sorry. 
           She starts crying bitter tears.

          Still Tamara cries. He comforts her. She lets him. He holds 
          her for some time. 

                          ANDY
           I'd better get up to Stonefield. Come
           with me. We'll get this sorted.

           Tamara shakes her head. She separates herself from him and
           stands.

                          ANDY
           Then get Ben to take you to London. 
           Make sure he looks after you.
           Tamara walks a few paces away. She stares straight ahead.

                          TAMARA
           I don't want to be with Ben. 
           She looks back at Andy. He begins to understand. She walks 
           off.

           Glen, sick with dread, is drying his face with a towel. He 
           picks up his muddy shoes and clothes, wraps them in a bag and 
           shoves them in his case. 
           His eyes alight on his poster of Thomas Hardy. He pulls it 
           down.

           Ben and the girls have dug a grave for Boss. Casey is putting
           flowers on the top. Ben starts to cry like a broken-hearted 
           little boy. Jody instinctively puts her arms round him. The
           girls are immensely moved. Jody looks over at Casey. She

                          MOUTHS:

                          JODY
           Pap me! Pap me!
           Casey waits until Ben is not looking. Then she takes pictures
           with her mobile phone. Jody cradles Ben in her arms, doing
           her best moved-but-sultry pose. Casey tries not to laugh.
           Jody is ecstatic. The man of her dreams is in her arms. Her
           wish has come true.

           An ambulance and two police cars are in the courtyard. The
           police are carrying the corpse, covered in blankets. Andy
           crosses the yard to the barn. He bumps into Glen furtively
           coming out of the door. Glen's case is packed.

           I shooed him away! The police said
           it was an accident but...

                          GLEN 
           It wasn't your fault! 

                          BETH 
           What I don't understand is why was
           he in that field anyway? He hated
           cows. And when they were coming,
           why didn't he get out of their way?

           For a moment, confession and silence hang in the balance.
           Glen opens his mouth to speak.

                          GLEN (CONT'D)
           You live in the country. You share
           it with those dangerous beasts. And
           when they're scared, they run. Like
           we do...
           Glen is full of horror at his lie.
           But Beth is only grateful.

                          BETH
           Glen. Stay with me.
           Her eyes, still red with grief, are full of their future
           together.
           Glen nods. He will stay. He wants it all.
           Beth leans into him, seeking comfort. He puts his arms around
           her, his face ashen with the weight of his secret.
           As he holds her, he looks around the room. Nicholas is
           everywhere, glaring down at him from photographs.

                         

          176 EXT. EVENING. WINNARDS FARM - THE GARDEN. 176

           Tamara is in the garden, a strip on her nose. She sees Andy
           in the dusk. He's leaning against the gate watching her.

                          TAMARA
           Don't say anything.

                          ANDY
           Kind of suits you. And I always did
           like the old one.
           They are in each others arms. The embrace lasts and lasts.
           Tamara is leading Andy up to the house.

                          TAMARA
           You did it on purpose, didn't you?

                          ANDY
           What?

                          TAMARA
           Made it so beautiful I'd never be
           able to leave.

                          ANDY
           Been dying to get rid of you. This
           is my house. I was born in that
           room.

           So you were.
          They are at the threshold. They kiss.

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           Welcome home.

                             TERMINATOR



A1      TITLE SEQUENCE - SLITSCAN EFFECT                       A1

1       EXT. SCHOOLYARD - NIGHT                                1

        Silence.  Gradually the sound of distant traffic becomes
        audible.  A LOW ANGLE bounded on one side by a chain-link
        fence and on the other by the one-story public school build-
        ings.  Spray-can hieroglyphics and distant streetlight sha-
        dows.  This is a Los Angeles public school in a blue collar
        neighborhood.

        ANGLE BETWEEN SCHOOL BUILDINGS, where a trash dumpster looms
        in a LOW ANGLE, part of the clutter behind the gymnasium.
        A CAT enters FRAME.  CAMERA DOLLIES FORWARD, prowling with
        him through the landscape of trash receptacles and shadows.

        CLOSE ON CAT, which freezes, alert, sensing something just
        beyond human perception.

        A sourceless wind rises, and with it a keening WHINE.
        Papers blow across the pavement.
        The cat YOWLS and hides under the dumpster.
        Windows rattle in their frames.
        The WHINE intensifies, accompanied now by a wash of frigid
        PURPLE LIGHT.  A CONCUSSION like a thunderclap right over-
        head blows in all the windows facing the yard.

        C.U. - CAT, its eyes are wide as the glare dies.


1A/FX   ANGLE - DUMPSTER                                       1A/FX

        ELECTRICAL DISCHARGES arc from the dumpster to a water
        faucet and climb a drain pipe like a Jacob's Ladder.

                                              CUT TO:


2       EXT. SCHOOLYARD - NIGHT                                2

        SLOW PAN as the sound of stray electrical CRACKLING subsides.
        FRAME comes to rest on the figure of a NAKED MAN kneeling,
        faced away, in the previously empty yard.
        He stands, slowly.
        The man is in his late thirties, tall and powerfully built,
        moving with graceful precision.

        C.U. - MAN, his facial features reiterate the power of his
        body and are dominated by the eyes, which are intense, blue
        and depthless.  His hair is military short.

        This man is the TERMINATOR.

        He glances down, taking calm inventory of himself, and
        notices that a fine white ash covers his skin.  He brushes
        at it unconcernedly as he walks toward the fence, scanning
        his surroundings.

                                              CUT TO:


2A/FX   CRANE SHOT - SCHOOLYARD/CITY - NIGHT                   2A/FX

        CAMERA MOVES UP as Terminator approaches the schoolyard fence
        beyond which is an embankment rolling down in darkness to the
        cityscape below.  The school is perched at the edge of a pro-
        montory offering a respectable view of the urban sprawl teem-
        ing and glistening under a sullen sky.  The night clouds are
        shot through with occasional flashes of LIGHTNING, presaging
        a thunderstorm.

        Terminator stands, hands on hips in prefect symmetry, gazing
        down at the city as the CAMERA REACHES FULL HEIGHT.

                                              CUT TO:


3       EXT. PLAYGROUND - NIGHT                               3

        A beer bottle SMASHES on the ground.  PULL BACK to include
        its ex-owner and his two compatriots, YOUTH GANG MEMBERS,
        lounging on the jungle gym of a deserted playground.  They
        sport nondescript PUNK REGALIA...torn T-shirts, fatigue
        pants, combat boots or high-top sneakers, leather jackets.

        The leader notices something and sits up.

                                LEADER
                           (pointing)
                     Hey, hey...what's wrong with
                     this picture?

        ANGLE - REVERSE, seen past the lounging toughs, Terminator
        walks naked into a pool of streetlight, striding purpose-
        fully toward them.

        ANGLE - OVER TERMINATOR'S SHOULDER, as he approaches them.
        They slide from their perches and drop easily to the ground
        liquid shadows.

                                LEADER
                     Nice night for a walk, eh?

        Terminator stops right in front of them.

                                TERMINATOR
                           (without inflec-
                           tion)
                      Nice night for a walk.

        They surround him, all swagger and malign good humor.

                                SECOND PUNK
                      Washday tomorrow, huh?  Nothing
                      clean, right?

        Terminator eyes them without expression, unhurried.
        Reptilian.

                                TERMINATOR
                      Nothing clean.  Right.

                                LEADER
                      This guy's a couple bricks
                      short.

        Terminator turn to the second punk, ignoring the
        others.

                                TERMINATOR
                      Your clothes.  Give them to me.

        The punks exchange glances, dismayed.

                                TERMINATOR
                           (coldly)
                      Now.

                                SECOND PUNK
                           (bracing)
                      Fuck you, asshole.


        Without warning Terminator hammer-punches him in the temple
        with blinding speed.  The blow flings him with a CLANG into
        the jungle gym.  He drops to the ground in a still heap,
        eyes open, twitching.

        The leader whips out his SWITCHBLADE and slashes in one
        motion.  Terminator ducks back and catches the knife-
        wielder's wrist in an inhuman grip.  Then he punches the
        leader with piledriver force just below the breastbone.

        ANGLE - PAVEMENT, as the knife clatters down.  The punk's
        combat boots are on tiptoe, barely touching the ground.

        ANGLE - TWO SHOT, Terminator and the leader are close
        together as if dancing, but motionless.  Their bodies are in
        total shadow.  The punk's eyes are wide, his veins distended
        with an agonizing pressure.  Terminator jerks his fist back
        with a WET SOUND and the other drops OUT OF FRAME.

        The last tough is stumbling away, gaping with terror.  He
        backs into a chainlink fence, turns to run along it, finds
        he is in a corner.

        Terminator takes a step toward him, his gaze ominous.

        The punk begins shakily stripping off his clothes.
        Thunder peals overhead.

                                               CUT TO:

4       EXT. STREET/NEARBY - NIGHT                             4

        A light RAIN begins to fall.
        Terminator emerges onto the street from the playground,
        pausing in the pool of light under a streetlight to hike
        the collar of the punk's jacket.
               The rain streams down over his face, running into
        and over his eyes.  They do not blink.

                                               CUT TO:

5       EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET/ALLEY - NIGHT                     5

        Another part of the city.  Seedy apartments and storefronts.
        The streets glisten, hissing with sporadic late night traffic.
        SLOW PAN AND DOLLY into the mouth of a narrow alley lined
        with trash containers and fire escapes.  From a recessed
        doorway, two filthy legs sprawl out onto the wet pavement.
        An angry, inarticulate DRUNKARD'S MONOLOGUE rises occasionally
        above the rain sounds.

        ANGLE - DOORWAY,  The derelict rouses from his bitter stupor
        as a brilliant purple glare lights up the wet brickwork
        around him.  A shockwave hurls trash into the air.
        Painted over windows shatter.
        Rat scurry, blinded.

        A FIGURE drops INTO FRAME as if out of the sky and smacks
        the pavement with a muddy splash.

        C.U. - DERELICT, as he blinks at the fading glare, amazed.

        A NAKED MAN, compact and muscular, rises in a defensive
        crouch.  KYLE REESE is 22, but his face has been aged by
        ordeal, the mouth hard, eyes grim.  A crinkled burn scar
        traverses one side of his face from chin to forehead.  Other
        scars, from burns and bullets, mar his hard-muscled body.

        The rain washes a fine coating of white ash from his skin
        as electrical ARCS lace back and forth between the fire
        escapes behind him, HISSING and SPUTTERING.  The sound
        fades, then stops altogether, to be replaced by a rising
        scream of animal agony.

        Reese lurches to his feet and sprints across the alley.

                                               CUT TO:

7       EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT                               7

        CAMERA MOVES WITH REESE as he leaps to the fire escape and
        clambers up to the first landing to crouch beside another
        NAKED MAN who appears to be entangled in the ironwork.  The
        man is contorted with pain as his screams die to a shivering
        gasp.  CLOSER ANGLE reveals that he has been skewered through
        the abdomen by the horizontal iron slats and through the
        shoulder by a railing.  He has materialized in the same
        space occupied by the fire escape structure.  The figure
        slumps, motionless.

        Reese quickly checks for signs of life.  The man is dead.

        Reese descend to the alley floor and crosses to the drunk
        huddled in the doorway.

        A pair of flamboyantly dressed women, obviously working
        girls, passes by the alley mouth.  They do a double take
        when they see Reese, but walk on without breaking stride,
        completely jaded.  He's certainly not a potential customer.

        Reese crouches down as if to speak to the drunk.

                                DERELICT
                      Say, buddy...did you see a
                      real bright light?

                                               CUT TO:

8       EXT. ALLEY/SAME - NIGHT                                8

        A brilliant white glare stabs into the alley mouth as an
        LAPD cruiser glides slowly by on the street.  The search-
        light illuminates the figure of Reese, crouching over the
        sprawled drunk, just pulling on the other's trousers.

        The cruiser chirps to a stop.  The doors fly open and two
        cops leap out.

                                FIRST COP
                      Hold it, right there!

        Reese hitches his pants and bolt like a shot.  The cops
        draw their guns and race into the alley after him.

        HANDHELD CAMERA or PANAGLIDE, rushing with Reese along the
        narrow alley.  He vaults a pile of tumbled trashcans.
        Whips around a corner.  Leaps the hood of a parked car in
        the cross alley.

        PANAGLIDE PRECEDING COPS, as they snake through the night
        maze.

        dead run and scrambles over it.

10      EXT. ALLEY JUNCTION - NIGHT                            10

        WHIP PAN ON COPS, skidding to a stop at the corner in time
        to see Reese vault the fence.  They separate.

        DOLLY WITH SECOND COP, as he runs to the gate.

11      EXT. ALLEY/NEARBY - NIGHT                              11

        LOW PANAGLIDE WITH REESE, running full tilt, displaying
        incredible agility.

        REESE'S POV, the alley walls blur by.  The view of a hot-
        wired rat in an urban maze.

        C.U. - REESE, CAMERA hugging him as he sprints and turns,
        alternately front-lit, side-lit and silhouetted as the
        electric glare of the city wheels about him.

        ANGLE - ALLEY MOUTH, Reese flashes though intermittent
        cross-lighting in the B.G.

        Another unit arrives out front and Reese melts back into
        the alley, only to see a cop round the corner behind him.
        Sandwiched.  Reese crashes into a steel door, rending the
        lock, and vanishes into the darkness within.

        The newly arrived cops are a K-9 unit.  They open the back
        door of the squad car to release a large black Doberman.

                                               CUT TO:


12      INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT                          12

        Reese finds himself among the display racks of a discount
        department store.  A searchlight stabs in the front
        window as he dashes into the maze of aisles.

        Three cops enter behind him through the shattered door.

        FAST PANAGLIDE WITH REESE, as he crab-runs low among the
        moving shadows where flashlights quarter the darkness.  He
        bolts the open space behind a display window.  Sees the
        outside searchlight sweep toward him.  Freezes.

        ANGLE - REESE, his feral face frozen among the smooth-
        featured, smiling mannequins.  As the light passes, Reese
        silently moves on.

        ANGLE - COP, passing the end of a long aisle B.G. while in
        the F.G. a hand ENTERS FRAME, removing a knit shirt from a
        hanger.  Reese slips the shirt on quietly and does a fast
        crab-walk across the aisles to melt into the other racks
        and shadows, CAMERA MOVING LOW with him.

                                               CUT TO:


13      INT. DEPARTMENT STORE/AISLE - NIGHT                    13

        With a shocking GROWL the police dog hurtles out of the
        shadows, LEAPING RIGHT AT CAMERA.

        ANGLE - REESE AND DOG, a dark blur with teeth, extremely
        Doberman, flies toward Reese.  He spins.  Catches it by
        the throat in mid-air. Arcs it to the floor with unflinching
        precision.

        C.U. - DOBERMAN, suddenly on its back and held by the throat,
        THE DOG YELPS and stares at Reese, who leans very close.
        Inches from its eyes he fixes it with a gaze of uncompromis-

        between the two.

        Reese releases the animal and turns his back on it, selecting
        a long overcoat from a rack.  The dog backs away from him,
        stiff-legged and confused.

        TRACKING WITH REESE as he rounds a corner on the run, still
        shrugging into his long coat.
        Running smack at him is another cop, gun aimed.

        Without slowing, Reese leaps toward him, twisting in mid-air
        like a cat.  The cop FIRES. Misses.  Goes down under Reese's
        tackle and they slide together on the polished floor.

        Before they even come to rest Reese snatches the cop's gun,
        aiming it at the other's face two-handed.

        A SHOT whines off the metal side of an escalator behind
        Reese's head.  He vaults the escalator rail, leaving the
        amazed cop lying on the floor.

        Reese bounds up the frozen steps, pocketing the .38 Police
        Special in his coat.

        Cops dash through the maze of aisles, converging at the
        escalators.

        Too small.  Another.  Holding the shoes he runs on.

        Cautiously, he opens the door of the cruiser, removes the
        RIOT GUN, an Ithaca pump model, from the dash rack and slips
        it under his coat.  Cradled in a vertical position, the
        shortened weapon is virtually invisible.

        He walks out onto the street and away,  unhurriedly, an
        innocuous pedestrian soon lost in the rain.

        she walks in, but you'd like to get to know her.  Her vulner-
        able quality masks a strength even she doesn't know exists.

        Sarah maneuvers nimbly, apparently in a hurry.

        She runs the gauntlet between tables, precariously balancing
        two full dinner plates on one arm and hand-carrying a
        third.  A customer tugs on her apron for attention and she

                      Does mine come with fires?

                      He's got the Barbecue Beef,
                      I've got a Chili-Beef Deluxe.

                                SARAH
                      Okay, who gets the Burly Beef?

                                CUSTOMER AT NEXT TABLE
                      Miss, we're ready to order.


        In the process of setting down all the plates Sarah knocks
        over someone's water glass.

                      Oh, sorry.  That's not real
                      leather, is it?

        As she cleans up the spill, a kid at the next booth reaches
        over and dumps a scoop of ice cream into the top pouch of
        Sarah's apron

        She stares down at the mess melting over her hard-earned
        and sags with defeat.  NANCY, a plump, gum-chewing waitress,
        stops beside her to whisper.

                                NANCY
                      Look at it this way: in a

        ANGLE on a standard-issue L.A. suburban street with kids
        racing Big Wheels B.G.

        LOW ANGLE with the FRAME comprising a single house, toy-
        littered lawn and mailbox.  EXTREME F.G., by the curb, is
        a CHILD'S PLASTIC TRUCK.

        There is the sound of a CAR ENGINE approaching, and the
        front of the yellow Maverick appears, stopping at the curb.
        Its front tire  CRUSHES the toy.

        PANAGLIDE ON TERMINATOR, preceding him as he steps out of the
        car, pauses by the mailbox to check the name, and strides
        toward the house.

        A YOUNG BOY, playing in the driveway, watches him pass.  The
        boy's DOG, a small Terrier, growls low and mean, crouching
        back from Terminator.

        He rings the doorbell and waits, motionless.
        The door opens a few inches, held by a security chain,
        revealing a frail MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN in apron and rubber
        cleaning gloves.

        amazement as the good-looking, intense-eyed man in the
        strange clothes raises a pistol.

        And aims it at her face.

        It all seems less real than "GENERAL HOSPITAL" in that
        half-second before he FIRES.

        Terminator stands at the head of the stairs.
        His hand is bloody where he grasped the dead woman's
        shoulder.

        He starts down the stairs.
        The mother stands paralyzed, unable to breathe.
        He reaches the main floor and walks toward her.
        She edges into a corner, eyes wide.
        He reaches out.

        And wipes his hands clean on her apron.

        Terminator walks out, without expression, leaving the

        strokes with a hacksaw to sever the wooden stock from

        of people walking across a grating in the sidewalk above
        him flicker past.  They can't see him in the darkness below
        their feet as he checks the gun's action carefully.  He
        slips it under his overcoat where it hangs from a jerry-

        his overcoat done up to the top button.
        He walks through the sparse morning crowd on the cluttered,
        overbuilt commercial street.
        He is out of sync.
        A stranger in a strange land.
        He holds himself tightly reined, cautious and feral as he
        moves among the unconcerned pedestrians.
        His eyes flick rapidly about.
        He is seeing this Babylon for the first time.

        Reese stops at a hole-in-the-wall take-out stand.  He
        watches people walk away with food.  Moves closer.
        Scrutinizes the next man as he orders.

                      you a favor.

                                SARAH
                      I'll do the same for you
                      sometime.

        Sarah laughs and claps her friend on the back.  They turn
        in at a door marked WEIGHT ROOM.

                                               CUT TO:

41      INT. WEIGHT ROOM                                       41

        SEVERAL ANGLES, on glistening arms, legs, torsos merging
        into bio-mechanical kinetic sculptures with the chrome-steel
        levers and tubes.  The CRASH and SQUEAL of metal against
        metal.

        In F.G., two Conan-esque arms thrust upward, glistening.
        Ginger's boyfriend, MATT McCALLISTER, the assistant manager
        of the club, strains out his last reps, bench-pressing
        enormous weight on the Nautilus machine.
        Despite his imposing appearance, Matt is one of the warmest
        people you'd ever want to meet.
        His face is contorted, muscles knotted for the last push.
        He heaves it up with a guttural cry.
        Lowering his weights with a CLANG, Matt lies panting, arms
        dangling at his side, eyes closed.
        A pair of female legs appear.

                                GINGER (V.O.)
                           What's this? Sleep therapy?

        Matt opens his eyes.

                                GINGER
                           (continuing)
                      You think somebody's gonna
                      do this for you?  Look at
                      those shriveled bi's.  And
                      you haven't worked lat's or
                      ab's since Wednesday.

                                MATT
                           (smiling)
                      Hello, sweetheart.  Had a
                      rough day?

                                GINGER
                           (softening)
                      Come here, wimp.

        She leans down as he sits up and they meet in a kiss that's
        bad for the other guys' discipline.

        Sarah waits until they break the clinch to speak.

                                SARAH
                      Hi, Matt.

        Matt look backwards over the bench, and replies, upside-down.

                                MATT
                           (grinning broadly)
                      Heeey!  It's my favorite
                      Sarah.  Hi, babe.

        Ginger pulls the pin on Mat's weights and re-inserts it
        beneath the entire stack, the maximum weight.

                                GINGER
                      Alright, warm-ups are over.
                      Back to work, Bunky.

        Ginger readadjusts her headphones as the two girls walk away.

                                MATT
                      'Bye beautiful.  You too,
                      Ginger.

        Two weightlifters nearby look at each other, than at Matt.

                                WEIGHTLIFTER
                      Bunky?

        Sarah lurches away from the curb on her moped, almost
        spilling Ginger who is attempting to ride double.  They
        swing out onto a main thoroughfare and careen through
        the bumper-to-bumper traffic.
        Sarah maneuvers deftly though overloaded and unstable.
        Ginger doesn't know whether to laugh of scream at the
        near-misses.
        She does both.

                                               CUT TO:

44      EXT. STREET/CONSTRUCTION SIGHT - DUSK

        On a side street the girls pass an excavation site  between
        high-rises.  They pass OUT OF FRAME as CAMERA HOLDS on the
        construction area and Ginger's shrieks fade.

        In the F.G., under an overpass, Reese sits is a car watching
        the powerful machines moving earth.
        He's in a late-model non-descript GREY SEDAN, one of a row
        of cars gathering dirt beside the construction site.
        Crab-armed back-hoes and massive caterpillars ROAR through
        a curtain of dust, under intense floodlights.  A power-shovel
        moves its great arm, lighting its own way with an arc-light.

        Reese sits motionless in the dark.  Waiting.  The clock in
        the dash ticks quietly.
        He flips on the radio.  A fatuous POP ROCK STATION.
        Reese fishes a magazine off the dirty floor.  His over-
        coat is off, draped over the shotgun on the seat beside
        him.
        His bare arms are sinewy and scarred.

        Reese flips the page of COSMOPOLITAN.
        He look at the glossy photos, the glossy women.
        Fantasy women.  Svelte and seamless.
        The ads fascinate him too: Caribbean vacations and blended
        whiskeys.
        His head sags against the door.
        He gazes dully at the tracks of a passing CATERPILLAR as they
        chew through the dirt.
        The ROAD and CLATTER of treads intensifies as his eyes close.

                                               CUT TO:


46      EXT. MELTED RUINS - NIGHT                              46

        TIGHT ON A GLEAMING STEEL TREAD as it grinds through debris.
        The debris is ferroconcrete, girders, and jackstraw heaps of
        HUMAN BONES, burned black.

        There is the sound of EXPLOSIONS, distant, and an intermittent
        electronic WHINE.  Incredibly bright searchlights play over
        the ground.  PANNING with the moving treads through twisted
        wreckage, F.G.
        The screen WHITES OUT with a BLAST, very close.  As the
        debris clatters down, a helmetted head snaps up into FRAME,
        EXTREME F.G.

        The visor of the HIGH-TECH HELMET is shattered, presumably
        by the explosion.  The wearer rips it off, revealing a
        younger Reese, minus his burn scar.
        His face is bathed in sweat, lit by the glow from a CRT
        SCOPE-SIGHT on a strange-looking rifle.
        The sound of SCREAMS and HOARSE SHOUTS not far off, and a
        continuous low murmuring of RADIO CHATTER, grid coordinates,
        casualties, unit placements, medic requests.

        Reese looks over his shoulder at his teammate, a GIRL
        of about sixteen, gaunt, dirty, heavily armed like himself.
        DOLLYING as they start to belly crawl through the bones
        and wreckage.
        Reese looks up.
        Through spires of a collapsed building a terrifying
        SPHINX-LIKE SHAPE moves against the sky...obscured by dust
        and blinding sweeps of its searchlights.
        Though we see little, this is an H-K,Hunter-Killer
        mobile ground-unit.

        Reese crawls, pacing the H-K, under and through, on elbows
        and knees, past mounds of charred skulls.  They
        pass the BODY OF A CHILD, a boy of about 10, center-
        punched with a smoking hole.  The boy clutches a rifle.
        More bodies.  Some in rags, some in uniforms like theirs.
        WOMEN. OLD MEN. CHILDREN.  They're all dirty and gaunt,
        scabrous.  And still bleeding.  Reese scrabbles past a
        dark rat-hole and there are human rats in it.  Some of them
        are sobbing, or screaming.

        Another EXPLOSION.
        The GLARE lights the huddled few.
        Human vermin with mud-caked weapons that haven't been
        invented yet.  Soldiers in a nightmare war.

        Reese and his teammate stop behind a blasted wall, having
        outflanked the massive H-K.  Its flashing blue lights flick
        across the walls, its searchlights sear through the
        debris.

        WIDER, showing the H-K more clearly...a blast-scarred
        CHROME LEVIATHON, with hydraulic arms folded mantis-like
        against its 'torso', and huge underslung GUN TURRETS.

        Reese leaps up and straight-arms a satchel-charge into its
        path.  One tread rolls over the explosive.
        Guns and searchlights swivel.  The head turns ponderously.
        Reese's partner rises, poised to throw hers.
        A POWER-BOLT catches her at the top of her arc, BLOWING
        HER INTO RED MIST.

        Reese is knocked down by the concussion.  Gets up, running,
        as the charges blow.
        The H-K's tread carriers are RIPPED APART.
        It lurches to a stop, burning.

        The following SEQUENCE is extremely FORESHORTENED.
        CUT FAST.  IMPRESSIONS ONLY.
        Running.
        Explosions light the ruins like flashbulbs.
        ENERGY WEAPONS criss-cross the night like tracers.
        LOW ANGLE, up past the burning H-K as its flying counter-
        part, an AERIAL H-K, arcs into view with a TURBOJET WHINE.

        Reese hauls two survivors of his unit into a PERSONNEL
        CARRIER, a CHEVY CAMARO with steel plate welded over it and
        the roof cut away to access the 50 CALIBER MACHINE GUN.
        It's stripped and rusted and bullet-riddled, glassless.
        The TIRES are OFF-ROAD and very gnarly.

        They're driving through the ruins, up and over and through.
        Reese drives like a demon.  Under other circumstances it
        would be considered insane.  Here it is merely very good.

        The machine gun CHATTERS.
        A BLACK SHAPE descends, a demon with searchlights.
        A BOLT OF LIGHT.

        Reese's car flips like a kicked beer can, rolling and
        crumpling.  He's pinned in the wreck, bloody, screaming
        despite his training.  The only other survivor, an
        emaciated BOY of twelve, is pulling for all he's worth
        to drag Reese out before it burns.

        a blue plastic DODGERS HELMET.  He reaches through the
        window of the sedan.

        Reese's eyes open in a split-second, and suddenly there
        is a SHOTGUN MUZZLE AIMED RIGHT AT US.
        Reese quivers with a curious spasm, similar to the tremors
        of his arrival, and blinks at the boy.

        The boy is white-faced, staring down the bore.  He backs
        away.  We see that he is straddling a bicycle.

                      Robbins.

        The boy rides past her list a shot.

                                BOY
                           (urgently)

        INSERT - MACRO, Reese's finger on the trigger is white
        with pressure.  He slips the safety to the OFF position.
        The gun can now be fired.

        He sets it on the seat and reaches for the dangling ignition
        wires, starting the car.

53      INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT/BATHROOM/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT    53

        Sarah and Ginger are crammed into the tiny bathroom,
        becoming inextricably tangled in each other's cords as
        they blow-dry, curl hair, and apply make-up.  Ginger
        has her headphones inverted under her chin but in place,
        and is bouncing to music as she dries her hair.  She is
        wearing a short terry-cloth bathrobe that reveals the
        greater part of her legs.  Sarah is in a skirt and bra.

        The phone rings and Sarah goes out into the living room
        to get it.

                                SARAH
                           (answering the
                           phone)
                      Hello?

                                VOICE (V.O.)
                           (on phone, deep
                           and breathy)
                      First I'm going to rip the
                      buttons off your blouse, one
                      by one...then run my tongue
                      along your neck, down to your
                      bare, gleaming breasts...

        Sarah cups her hand over the mouthpiece and calls out
        matter-of-factly:

                                SARAH
                      Ginger!  It's Matt.

        She resumes listening.

                                MATT (V.O.)
                      ...and then slowly pull your
                      jeans off inch by inch and
                      lick your belly in circles,
                      further and further down...
                      then I'll pull off your panties
                      with my teeth...

        Sarah is repressing laughter.

                                SARAH
                           (crossly)
                      Who is this?

        Silence.  Then Matt realizes to his horror who he's been
        talking to.

                                MATT (V.O.)
                      Oh my God!  Sarah!  Oh, shit.
                      Jesus, I'm sorry.  I thought
                      you were...Can I talk to Ginger?

                                SARAH
                      Sure, Bunky.

        As Ginger approaches, Sarah hands her the receiver and
        goes into the bedroom.

                                GINGER
                      Hello?

                                MATT (V.O.)
                      First I'm gonna rip the buttons
                      off your blouse...

        Sarah picks up four blouses on hanger lying on the bed
        and goes back into the hallway.

55      INT. LIVING ROOM

        Ginger is still listening to Matt, nodding, as Sarah enters
        and starts holding the blouses against herself one by one
        for Ginger's inspection.

                                SARAH
                      What do you think?

        Sarah hold up another one.

        Sarah gathers up the blouses and walks out.

                                SARAH (V.O.)
                      This guy's probably a schmuck
                      and I don't care what I wear.

        A couple of BEATS, and she's back in the doorway with
        a concerned expression.

56      EXT. VENICE STREET - NIGHT

        An unmarked car with a clamp-on light and siren blaring
        screeches to the curb behind two marked black-and-whites
        in front of a funky Venice apartment building.  A small
        crowd  is gathered around the front steps.  LIEUTENANT
        ED VUKOVICH, Homicide Division, gets out of the car and
        strides through the crowd.  He's fiftyish, short, but
        square and solid, a human bulldog gone a little to paunch.
        He chews Juicy Fruit gum like a maniac: a chain-chewer.
        He's homely as an old boot.  And he's not a smart cop, he's
        a wise one; rarer still.  The onlookers, gathered patiently
        for their ten second glimpse of something under a sheet,
        separate for him to pass.

        CAMERA PANAGLIDES AHEAD OF VUKOVICH, as he climbs the switch-
        back staircase two steps at a time.  He passes TWO UNIFORMED
        COPS at the doorway of a second-floor apartment, and enters
        to find a quiet flurry of activity.  Several DETECTIVES and
        a PHOTOGRAPHER prowl around, taking evidence, taking pictures.

        In the center of the living room floor is the body of a
        young woman, crumpled face down in a small lake of blood.
        Two bags of groceries lie split open on the floor in front
        of her.

        Vukovich glances up as he is joined by DETECTIVE SGT.
        TRAXLER.  Traxler is black, lean and very jaded.

                                VUKOVICH
                      Give me the short version.

                                TRAXLER
                      Six shots at less than ten
                      feet.  Weapon was a large
                      caliber--

        Vukovich is looking at the body.

                                VUKOVICH
                      No shit.

        Traxler turns to a passing DETECTIVE.

                                TRAXLER
                      Come on. man.  Don't track
                      it all over.  It's un-
                      professional.

        He turn back to Vukovich, gesturing at the body.

                                TRAXLER
                           (continuing)
                      Okay, let's see...Got a pos-

                           (interrupting)
                      That can't be right.  That's
                      the name of the one Valley
                      Division mopped up this after-
                      noon.

        Traxler slips something off his clipboard and hands
        it to the Lieutenant.

                                TRAXLER
                      Here's her driver's license.

                      You gotta be kidding me.  The
                      new guys'll be short-stroking
                      it over this one.  A one-day

                           (calling)
                      Ginger, have you seen Pugsley?

        Ginger enters, stopping beside their phone answering machine.

                                GINGER
                      Not lately.  Did you check
                      messages?

        She checks under the couch, then behind the drapes.  She
        bends down.

        C.U. - PUGSLEY, as the GREEN IGUANA cocks its head, blinking
        vapidly.

        RESUME WIDE, Sarah lifts the three foot long lizard from his
        perch on the windowsill.  She gives the complacent reptile
        a kiss on its blunt snout.

                           (groaning)
                      Totally nauseating.

        Sarah drapes the lizard across her shoulders where it sits
        contentedly as she looks for her purse.  Ginger has been
        rewinding the message tape.  She punches PLAY and a MALE
        VOICE is heard.

                                VOICE
                           (recorded)

                      Uh, something's come up and
                      it looks like I won't be able
                      to make it tonight.  I'm really
                      sorry.  Call you in a day or so.
                      Sorry.  'Bye.

        Sarah stands still, crestfallen.

                      That bum.  So what if he has
                      a Porsche, he can't treat you
                      like that...it's Friday night

                      I'll break his kneecaps.

        Sarah resignedly slips Pugsley off her shoulders.

                      Like shit, boss.

        Vukovich goes out and the Minicam light hits him as the
        door closes.

67      INT. PIZZA PARLOR - NIGHT                              67

        TIGHT ON A TV SCREEN, a news cast in progress.

                                ANCHORMAN (V.O.)
                      ...police had no further comment
                      on the apparent similarity between
                      the shooting death of an Encino
                      woman earlier today...

        CUT WIDE to show Sarah watching the TV which is suspended
        over the bar.  The place is a crowded, post-movie hangout,
        raucous with laughter and videogames.  The newscast
        continues, ignored by all except Sarah.

                                ANCHORMAN (V.O.)
                           (continuing)

                      Venice resident with virtually
                      the same name.  Sarah Ann Connor,
                      a 24 year old legal secretary, was
                      pronounced dead at the scene in
                      her beachfront apartment...

        A customer gestures for the bartender's attention.

                                CUSTOMER
                      Hey, can we change this and
                      catch the ball scores.

                                BARTENDER

                           knob)
                      Sure.

        Sarah leaps half over the bar, startling everyone.

                                SARAH
                           (shouting)
                      Leave it where it is!

                      cause for celebration at the
                      L.A. Zoo today, as...

        Sarah leaves her half-finished pizza and beer, getting up
        in a daze.  Followed by puzzles glances, she makes her way
        through the crowd.

        In the crowded hallway by the restrooms, Sarah goes to the
        single payphone and seizes the directory.  She flips rapidly
        through it, then stops, looking down.
        She sees that her name is next on the list.
        The book slips out of her fingers.
        Sarah turns and scans the crowd.
        She's getting looks, covert and otherwise, like any unaccom-
        panied girl on a Friday night.  But is that all they mean?

        Sarah back into the women's restroom.

        Sarah stumbles numbly to the sink.
        She splashes her face with cold water.  In the mirror
        her terrified reflection looks back.  Why me?
        She hears a loud clatter and spins around.
        It's just a drunken woman fumbling with a toilet stall door.
        Sarah edges back out into the corridor.

        It's OUT OF ORDER.

        Sarah exits the pizza place into the sparse crowd on the
        sidewalk.  As she passes a figure leaning against the wall
        just outside, the man turns his head to watch her.
        It is Reese, his gaze impassive.
        Streetlight catches the burn scar on his cheek.
        He is motionless, sinister in his long coat.
        Sarah shudders.
        She walks on.

        POV - SARAH, ON CROWD, moving toward and through approaching
        groups of pedestrians.  They seem to be glancing at her.
        Was it always like that and she just never noticed?

        C.U. - SARAH as she look over her shoulder.

        POV - SARAH, ON PIZZA PARLOR DOORWAY.  Reese is gone.
        She resists the urge to run.
        On the opposite side of the street an  LAPD cruiser glides
        slowly by.  Sarah is about to call out but a bus blocks
        her view and when it had passed, the car is turning away
        down a side street.

        She passes a large window with STOKER'S written on it, and
        ducks quickly through the door.

        ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW, SARAH F.G., as Reese approaches.
        Her knuckles clench white as he reaches the entrance and
        walks by, unhurriedly, without a glance inside.
        She turns and scan the gloomy interior, which reveals itself
        to be less than savory.  Pool tables and upper-middle lowlife
        in submarine depths of smoky haze.

        Sarah draws stares, menacing in their own right, as she
        weaves between the pool tables to the back of the bar.
        her hands are trembling as she drops a dime in the pay
        phone and dials.

                                VOICE (V.O./RECORDED)

                      stay on the line...

        Sarah holds the receiver pressed to her ear, glancing
        around, fear feeding on frustration.

        An LAPD black-and-white sits at the curb in front of Sarah's
        building with two cops inside, drinking coffee.  Through
        the open window we hear the dispatcher's voice on the
        radio.

                                DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                      ...two eleven in progress at

                      Tamarac.  One suspect believed
                      to be armed...

        The car pulls out with lights and siren on.
        A moment later, Terminator rounds the corner of the building
        and climbs the stairs to the entryway.
        He surveys the bank of call buttons, then turns to consider
        the barred security gate.

74      INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                         74

        PANAGLIDE WITH GINGER as she ties her terry-cloth robe and,
        leaving Matt in a dead sleep, pads through the dark apartment.
        Down the hall, past the phone with Traxler's message.
        Through the dark living room.
        She has her Walkman in the pocket of her robe and bops to
        herself in the silent gloom as she enters the kitchen.

        When she opens the refrigerator to remove snack fixings, the
        light briefly illuminates the kitchen and in that moment,
        SOMETHING MOVES in the F.G.

        TIGHT ON GINGER, MOVING WITH HER as she backs toward the
        counter with her arms full of snack stuff.

        A SUDDEN CRASH.  A flurry of motion behind her.
        She spins, dropping half her load.
        Ginger fumbles for the lightswitch.

        Revealing Pugsley, sitting there blinking innocently among
        overturned spice bottles on the counter-top.

                                GINGER
                      Shoo.  Go on.  I'll make a
                      belt out of you.

        Pugsley disappears into a large fern by the window and Ginger
        sets about her task, slathering crunchy peanut butter on
        stalks of celery.

        MEDIUM ON MATT, as rustling curtains play patterns of street-
        light over his sleeping face.
        The sound of a faint breeze.
        In the B.G. is the balcony, empty.  The sliding door is open.

        TIGHT ON MATT, as his eyes open at the sound of a quiet,
        repeated CLICKING.

        UP ANGLE - PAST MATT, as the five-inch blade of an industrial
        razor-knife reaches full extension in Terminator's hand,
        right above him.
        It slashes viciously downward.
        Matt rolls and the pillow is SLIT OPEN where his throat had
        been.

                                MATT
                      Whoah!

        Terminator catches him by the hair and slashed down again.
        Matt grabs the wrist in both hands.
        The enormous muscles of his arms, which seem capable of bench
        pressing a Chrysler, strain and knot against the pressure of
        the killer's single arm...
        And still the blade moves closer to his throat.

        With a final heave Matt deflects the down-pressure sideways
        and the blade snaps with a CLINK against the headboard.

        HANDHELD WITH MATT as he rolls off the bed, spins and slams
        his fists together into Terminator's temple.  He picks up a
        brass deco lamp and brings it down with piledriver force.

        Unperturbed, Terminator knocks the lamp away and hurls Matt
        over the bed.

        Oblivious to the noise, Ginger croons in rock-and-roll
        ecstasy, singing to a celery stalk as if it were a micro-
        phone.

        Matt heaves himself up, powerful body gleaming with sweat
        and hurls himself upon the intruder.
        The titans CRASH INTO A DRESSER, reducing it to kindling.
        Then into the closet door, EXPLODING THE FULL-LENGTH MIRROR.

        Terminator places one hand on either side of Matt's barrel
        chest.  SINKS HIS FINGERS INTO THE FLESH.  An inhuman grip.
        Matt is raised off the floor, contorted with agony, above
        the other's head.

        DOLLY PRECEDING GINGER as she returns from the kitchen with
        a plate full of celery stalks and a glass of milk.  CAMERA
        passes the closed bedroom door and STOPS, as Ginger pauses
        to set the plate on top of the glass, freeing one hand to
        open the door.

        AN EXPLOSION OF SPLINTERS in close F.G. as a shape smashes
        through the door right in front of her...Matt's body
        propelled halfway through the door by enormous force.
        Ginger shrieks and leaps back, flinging milk and all into
        the air.

        The door begins to open the pressure of Matt's body
        creates resistance.
        Ginger SCREAMS and back away.

        The door is wrenched open and Terminator steps through with
        the massive .45 drawn.

        HANDHELD WITH GINGER, the walls blur by as she runs.

        TIGHT ON TERMINATOR as the pistol RISES INTO FRAME, aligning
        with his eyes.  BOOM!

        LOW FAST DOLLY WITH GINGER as the bullet punches into her
        shoulder, pitching her on her face outside the bathroom door.

        LOW WIDE ANGLE as she crawls forward, gasping, drowning.
        The implacable figure looms behind her.
        Her expression is agony and reeling, nauseating terror.
        And incomprehension: Why am I suddenly dying?
        Her eyes roll, showing the whites, like a horse tethered in
        a burning stable.

        as she pulls herself into the bathroom.
        She clutches the rim of the toilet.

        LOW ANGLE PAST HER, ON TERMINATOR, as he stands behind her.
        PAN UP, off her.  He takes aim.
        And empties the clip.
        He calmly reloads.

        ensuing silence.
        Terminator spins, drawing an instantaneous bead on the source
        of the sound, but doesn't fire.

                      Machines need love too...

        Terminator turns abruptly back to Ginger's body.  He turns
        it over, assuring himself that she is dead.

                                GINGER'S VOICE
                           (continuing, recorded)

                      me, or Sarah will get back to you.
                      Wait for the beep.

        There is a loud tone and the incoming call is heard.

                      Ginger, this is Sarah...

        Terminator's head snaps back and he freezes, listening.
        He rises slowly as Sarah's voice continues.

        TIGHT ON HIS UNBLINKING EYES.

                      It's Stoker's on Pico. Bye.

        Terminator is rapidly and methodically rifling the contents
        of Sarah's small desk.  SIREN'S WAIL, approaching.
        He picks up a small card.

        E.C.U. - CARD. It is Sarah's college I.D. card, complete with
        color photo of her.

        MACRO ON PICTURE.

        E.C.U. - TERMINATOR'S EYES as he tosses the card down,
        after a fraction of a second's scan.  Picks up something else.

        TIGHT ON SARAH'S ADDRESS BOOK, Terminator pockets this and
        slips out the balcony door.  Climbing over the railing, he
        is gone.

        He hangs up and grabs his coat, motioning to Traxler.

        Sarah takes a seat at a booth near the bar, and picks up
        a dog-eared menu, but can't concentrate on it.  She looks

        CLOSER ANGLE as streetlight glare slashes across Terminator's

        The waitress set a cup of coffee in front of Sarah.

                                WAITRESS
                      Anything else?

        Sarah shakes her head "No" and contemplates her trembling
        hands.  She half-turns, catching a glimpse of herself in
        the mirror behind the bar.

        TIGHT ON SARAH, reflected in the mirror.  In the F.G. a
        man at the bar looks up from his beer, straight into her eyes.
        It is Reese.
        He gazes at her coolly for a moment, then glances away.

        C.U. - SARAH, feeling trapped, frantic.

        ANGLE ON FRONT DOOR as it opens and a figure stands silhou-
        etted briefly against a streetlight.

        Reese turns, his eyes flickering to the mirror, the figure.

        C.U. - REESE as he mechanically raises his beer.  His knuckles
        are white.  He slowly undoes the top button of his overcoat.
        There is a glint of metal in the shadows within.
        Reese turns slowly on his barstool as the figure brushes past
        him, out-of-focus F.G.
        Sarah looks up.

        E.C.U. - REESE'S HAND sliding slowly along polished steel,
        a caress.  His finger slips through the triggerguard of the
        riot gun.

        MEDIUM ON SARAH, as the man stops in front of her in close F.G.
        He sits slowly in the booth opposite her.  The angle is OVER
        HIS SHOULDER.

                                SARAH
                           (uncertainly)
                     Lieutenant Vukovich?

        REVERSE ANGLE - It is not Lt. Vukovich.
        Terminator sits motionless for a BEAT.
        Blue eyes so pure and deep.  The eyes of a saint, perhaps.

        The .45 is out and cocked and AIMED DIRECTLY AT CAMERA, almost
        in one motion.
        The bore seems enormous.

        BACK ON SARAH, over the gun barrel, her eyes go wide.  We hold
        a BEAT, like a frozen slice of nightmare.

        MEDIUM ON REESE as he whips the riot-gun to a hip-firing posi-
        tion, his overcoat falling back with a snap.  HE FIRES.

        ON TERMINATOR, as the shotgun blast hits his arm and he FIRES,
        simultaneously.  Sarah screams as the .45 round blows stuffing
        out of the booth seat inches from her face.  Her hair is
        singed by burning gunpowder.  An involuntary cry is punched
        out of her by the double concussions.

        Reese is stroking up another shell as Terminator half-rises
        from booth.

        OVER REESE'S SHOULDER, as he fires, cocks the slide, fires
        again, advancing on Sarah's booth.
        Terminator is blown backward over the center divider,
        crashing through the glasses and pitchers of beer on the
        table opposite, and onto the floor.

        Sarah is screaming, scrunched down in the booth.

        Terminator is lying on his back at the feet of a table-
        full of drunk patrons.
        He has two rifled 12 gauge slugs in his chest and one
        in the arm.

        The bar customers are frozen in the weird tableau, cowering,
        gaping.
        Sarah stops screaming.
        Reese stand motionless, gun aimed.
        In the sudden silence, the sound of him cocking the shotgun
        is abnormally loud.

        ON TERMINATOR, very still.
        Then he smoothly rolls to a crouch and slips the UZI machine
        pistol from beneath his overcoat, where it has been hang-
        ing on a shoulder strap.
        He doesn't seem too impaired as he swings around to fire.

        Reese rolls like a cat and comes up firing.
        A burst from the UZI rakes the bar where he stood.
        An orgy of shattering glass.
        Total pandemonium.

        SEVERAL ANGLES  as patrons of the bar run, scream or dive
        for cover, depending upon their level of intelligence.

        Reese slides through the glass to Sarah's booth and seizes
        her wrists.

        ON TERMINATOR, kneeling amid the chaos, raising the UZI
        one-handed.

        Reese tugs viciously on Sarah's arm and she sprawls across
        the booth seat a moment before the divider and seat cushion
        erupt with hits from the UZI.

        ANGLE ON A RUNNING PATRON as a burst of 9mm fire catches
        him in the chest.  He pitches into Sarah's booth, pinning
        her.

        Reese fires, ducks, fires again.
        Tables crash over.
        A window is blown out.
        A table candle rolls into a pool of high-proof alcohol
        behind the bar.
        It ignites with a WHOOSH.

        Reese feed two shells into the riot-gun.

        TIGHT ON TERMINATOR, an island of slow, precise movement
        amid the confusion.  He drops a spent clip.  Reaches for
        another with his bloody hand.

        MOVING WITH REESE as he vaults the row of booths and starts
        firing.  At point blank range he unloads the shotgun into
        Terminator's belly.

        The roaring fire behind the bar is spreading very quickly.
        The air is thick with smoke.
        Reese tosses the UZI, for which he has no ammo, into the
        fire.  He hauls the dead man off Sarah and reaches for her.

        TIGHT ON SARAH, shrinking away from Reese, hysterical.
        When he grabs her wrist she struggles, eyes wide.

        C.U. - REESE, very intense.

                                REESE
                     Come with me if you want
                     to live.

        She looks where he is pointing.

        glass rains from him, except where it sticks to his blood-
        drenched shirt and coat.

        C.U. - TERMINATOR, as he slowly look up, his blue eyes
        riveting STRAIGHT INTO THE CAMERA.

        than she could ever imagine as the cold gaze fixes on her.

        wreckage in the swirling smoke, hurling burning tables out

        through the cluttered kitchen, then down a narrow back
        hallway.  Sarah stumbles and Reese brutally pulls her to
        her feet without slowing.

        He hits a closed door, which crashes open.
        Hauls Sarah through, into another corridor.
        Slams and blot-latches it.
        An instant later an impact from the far side tears the
        latch-screws half out of the wall.

        down the narrow hallway.  He clears the outer door an
        instant before the tongue of flame roars out into the alley.

        TWO LAPD UNITS arrive behind them.  He motions to the
        nearest one.

        dark alley.  Sarah stumbles over trashcans.
        Reese pulls her along mercilessly.

        WHIP-PANNING as they clear a corner.
        The B.G. is a blur.
        The night-maze is a blur in all of these shots.
        No static angles.
        Relentless forward motion.

        bounding like a panther, leaping trash cans and other
        obstacles.

        TRACKING C.U. - TERMINATOR, catching the faintest glimpse
        of a red glow in the pupils of his eyes as he passes through
        total shadow.

        We know this is Terminator's POV because Sarah and Reese
        are just ahead of us.  But the image is bizarre, alien.
        Bright and hyper-real.  There is a hint of digitization,
        and the fleeing figures ahead are more luminous than the
        background, suggesting infra-red.
        The margins of the FRAME are crammed with columns of CRT-
        type characters: columns of numbers and acronyms.  The
        data changes more rapidly than any human eye could follow.
        There is no doubt that we are seeing as a machine would see.
        The sound effects are bright and clear, as if they are
        digitized and enhanced as well.

107     EXT. ADJOINING ALLEY - NIGHT                           107

        Reese and Sarah turn a corner by caroming off the wall
        without slowing and pelt down a narrower alley.  This
        one is lined with a row of parked cars and connects to
        the street.  There is little room to run.
        Reese is reloading on the run, dropping shells.

        Behind them Terminator enters the alley, gaining.

        LOW ANGLE, FAST PANAGLIDE ahead of the fleeing pair.
        As they breast the last car Reese shoves Sarah hard,
        pitching her on her face to the pavement.
        He flings open the car door...a shield.
        Drops to the ground.
        Fires into the gas tank of a car further back in the row
        just before Terminator reaches it.

        The car EXPLODES, filling the alley with fire.  An inferno
        funneled between the enclosing walls.

        ANGLE ON REESE AND SARAH behind the car door as flames
        roar over the hood.

        ON TERMINATOR, as he slides to a stop, cut off by the
        wall of flame.

        Reese doesn't waste any time stuffing Sarah into the car.
        Climbing in after and over her he twists two wires together
        and we recognize it as his stolen GREY SEDAN.
        The engine catches.

        A SILHOUETTE rockets out of the flames.
        Terminator, leaping from the roof of the blazing car ahead,
        impacts on the hood of Reese's car.  His hair and coat are
        burning.

        Reese jams reverse and nail the throttle.
        The car backs down the alley.
        Terminator draws back his fist.
        Punches into the windshield.
        Inside, Sarah is sprayed with glass as the killer's fist
        shoots through.
        The lacerated fingers grope for her.

        WIDE as the car shoots backwards out of the alley onto the
        street, narrowly missing an arriving LAPD CRUISER.

        Sarah plasters herself tightly into the seat as the
        fingers grasp her blouse and pull.
        Reese cranks the wheel hard.

        Terminator rolls down off onto the pavement.
        Reese's car shoots forward.

        PANNING WITH SEDAN as it roars past Vukovich, the gathering
        minions of the burning building, an arriving fire
        truck...shoots through a red light and continues to accel-
        erate.

        Terminator gets to a kneeling position, then slowly stands.
        He pats out his smoldering clothing as he watches his quarry
        escape.

        Reese drives with total, nerveless absorption.  His eyes
        flick to the mirror, to the road, over his shoulder, back
        ...and the world spins outside.
        With occasional glances to Sarah, he speaks to her in a

        No response.
        He reaches over and runs his hands over her arms, legs,
        chest.  Sarah flinches.
        She feels the BLIND PANIC BOILING UP WITHIN HER.
        She pushes his hand away and opens the door.
        Reese slams her back in the seat and slaps her.  Hard.

        The walls of a narrow alley, inky black, frame a police
        cruiser parked on the street beyond.  Firelight from the
        back of Stoker's lights the street garishly.
        A young cop  stands beside the car talking via radio with
        the mike cord pulled through the side window.  He speaks

        Terminator's silhouette emerges from the blackness and
        strides purposefully toward the cop, CAMERA following.

        The officer whirls and reaches for his gun but Terminator
        flings him brutally into the side of the car, steps over
        him and opens the door.
        Before getting in he notes the unit number on the roof: 143.
        Then he slides behind the wheel, slips the squad car into
        gear, and pulls out.

        Sarah's eyes are alert as well, and her tone becomes a bit
        too cool.

                                SARAH
                      So, it's from the future, is
                      that right?

                                REESE
                      One possible future.  Four your
                      point of view.  I don't know the
                      tech stuff.

                                SARAH
                      And you're from the future too?

                                REESE
                      Right.

        They come to a red light and Reese stops.

                                SARAH
                           (patronizingly)
                      Right...

        Like a shot she unlatches the seatbelt, pulls the door lock
        and has the door half open before Reese can react.  He catches
        her arm and hauls her struggling back into the car.

        Sarah sinks her teeth into his hand with all her strength.
        His grip doesn't slacken.
        Slowly, without releasing her, he reaches across with his
        other hand and shuts the door.  His face shows no reaction.

        Sarah draws back and stares at the blood running down his
        arm from the bite, that at his grim, scarred face.  The
        light turns green and Reese drives on.
        Sarah tastes blood and wipes her mouth.

                                REESE

                      do.  Don't...do that...again.

        He wipes his hand on his pants.

                                SARAH
                           (weakly, plead-

                      Listen.  Understand.  That

                      be bargained with...it doesn't
                      feel pity of remorse or fear...
                      and it absolutely will not stop.
                      Ever.  Until you are dead.

        Sarah slump in utter resignation.

                                SARAH
                           (quietly)
                      Can you stop it?

        Reese doesn't look at her.

                                REESE
                      Maybe.  With these weapons...

        acres of pavement dotted with sporadic parked cars.

        and forth.  DOWN ANGLE, past the chopper, as the circle of
        light moves across a row of parked cars.
        It passes a grey sedan with a shattered windshield.
        Flicks back.  Holds.

        TIGHTER ON CAR, GROUND LEVEL, in the glare and propwash.

        He has firm hold of her arm but she seems to be cooperating.
        In the B.G., the chopper hovers, on the far side of the lot.
        Reese approaches the door of a late model brown Buick which
        has been left with its window partway down.
        He unlocks it and they slip inside.

        Reese uses the butt of the shotgun to smash loose the
        ignition assembly.  He begins working on the wires.  A
        police cruiser appears, moving slowly between the rows of
        cars.

        Reese grabs Sarah and pulls her down to huddle below dash
        level.  A moment later a spotlight flashes across the seats
        above them.  They hear the helicopter circling closer.

                                SARAH
                      Reese...why me?  Why does
                      it want me?

        They are lying very close, a forced intimacy.  Reese's voice
        is an urgent whisper, almost in her ear.  A cruiser passes
        so close they can hear its radio clearly.

                                REESE

                      beginning.

        Reese musters his thoughts.  And starts.

                      There was a war.  A few years

        Reese pauses, and when he continues it's less like a military
        briefing, quieter.

        The helicopter moves overhead.  Its searchlight illum-

        sound fads, Reese starts the car.

        Transmission fluid pours out of the car like blood.
        An instant later they are surrounded by an assortment of
        LAPD, SHERIFF'S DEPT., and CHP CARS.
        The helicopter hovers overhead.

        MEDIUM ON SARAH AND REESE, he raises his hands, through
        the side window, in plain sight. A phalanx of cops, guns
        drawn, approaches the car warily.

        Sarah looks at Reese.  Then at the cops.  She opens the door
        and runs, staggering, toward them.  Vukovich steps forward
        and pulls her away to safety.

        Sarah, huddles in a blanket, is siting on a bench opposite
        Vukovich's desk.  Motionless.  Her eyes are fixed on the
        middle distance.  She's been crying.  Now she's emptied out.

        The door opens.
        At the sound of the latch Sarah jerks as if struck, and cringes
        involuntarily.  Vukovich enters with Traxler and DR. PETER
        SILBERMAN, a criminal psychologist.  Silberman is smooth
        of skin and manner, young, ambitious and...fat.  He is
        enthusiastic about the workings of the human psyche, as
        emotionally involved as someone pulling the wings off a fly.

        Vukovich sits beside Sarah and hands her a cup of coffee.
        He puts a paternal arm around her shoulders.

                                VUKOVICH

                     fied.  There's no doubt.

        Sarah  begins to cry again, slowly and very quickly.

        Vukovich takes the coffee cup from her as her arms sag and
        it starts to spill.

        The room costs five dollars a night and that's steep, but
        the FIRE ESCAPE outside the window adds an element of
        strategic value.
        A silhouette slips in through the window and click on the
        single BARE LIGHT BULB.
        It's Terminator, and he's a mess.
        A bloody scarecrow with bullet wounds in stomach, chest,
        shoulder and right wrist.

        MEDIUM ON TERMINATOR as he sits at a ratty folding table
        under the light.
        His eyebrows are singed off.
        Hair a charred stubble.
        Left eyes glistening with imbedded glass shards.

        Before him on the table is an array of SMALL TOOLS.
        He removes the charred remains of his jacket and props.
        one elbow on the table.

        ANGLE PAST HIS NON-FUNCTIONAL RIGHT ARM, F.G., as he exam-
        ines it.  He picks up an X-ACTO KNIFE and cuts deeply into
        the skin of his forearm.
        His expression is one of mild concentration.

        E.C.U. - FOREARM, as he pulls back a large flap of skin to
        reveal a complex trunk of SHEATHED CABLES AND HYDRAULICS.
        They slide as he moves his fingers.

        RESUME MEDIUM, as Terminator uses a rag to wipe away the
        blood.  With small screwdrivers he begins to patiently dis-
        assemble the damaged mechanism around the 12-guage hit.

                      lost in the war.  The computer
                      knew almost nothing about
                      Connor's mother.  Her name.
                      Where she lived, just the city.

        Vukovich hands her something that looks like umpire's
        padding.

                                VUKOVICH
                      Sarah, this is body armor.
                      Out TAC guys wear it.  It'll
                      stop a 12 gauge round.  This
                      other individual must've had
                      one under his coat.

        Sarah want to believe him.  God help her if he's wrong.

                                SARAH
                      But what about him punching
                      through the windshield?

                      guy once that...

        Vukovich cuts him off with a gesture and sits beside Sarah
        on the bench.

                                VUKOVICH
                      Why don't you just stretch out
                      here and get some sleep.  It'll
                      take your mom a good hour to get
                      here from Redlands.

                                SARAH
                      I can't sleep.

                                VUKOVICH
                      Go ahead.  You're safe.  There're
                      thirty cops in this building.

                                SARAH

        Silberman can be seen through a glass partition next to
        the bullet-proof glass booth enclosing the NIGHT DESK
        SERGEANT'S counter.  The Sergeant hits a button and there
        is a loud BULL-CLACK.  The electric bolt on the security
        door opens and Silberman steps out.

        As he exits the station, he passes Terminator just coming in
        the front door.  He glances at the pale apparition in cap
        and dark wrap-arounds, but goes on.
        Terminator approaches the Desk Sergeant who barely glances
        up when he speaks.

                                TERMINATOR
                      I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.
                      I was told she is here.  Can
                      I see her, please?

                                SERGEANT
                      You can't see here.  She's
                      making a statement.

                                TERMINATOR
                      Where is she?

                                SERGEANT
                           (laconically)
                      Look.  It's gonna be a while.
                      You wanna wait.  There's a
                      bench.

        Terminator steps back, scanning the booth, the electric
        door, the rooms beyond.

                                TERMINATOR
                      I'll come back.

        He turns and walks out through the front doors.

        ANGLE PAST DESK SERGEANT, F.G. - ON FRONT DOORS, the officer
        is absorbed in paperwork, not watching as a pair of lights
        get BRIGHTER outside the doors.  RAPIDLY.  He glances up
        at the last second as the glare falls fully on him.  CRASH!
        Several cops and late night loiterers scatter as a car
        smashes into the foyer.  It blasts through the sergeant's
        booth, crushing him in the wreckage.

        leap out of the car.
        He vaults the hood and smashes through the debris of the
        wall.
        Leaps to the corridor floor in a shower of plaster fragments.
        He brandishes the AR-180 like a pistol in one hand, the
        .38 in the other.
        The shotgun dangles at his side on a shoulder sling.

        LOW ANGLE DOLLY, preceding him as he starts down the

        All down the corridor the overhead fluorescent units
        explode, showering sparks and glass.

                                REESE (V.O.)
                      Sarah?

        FULL SHOT - She scrambles out from beneath the desk and runs
        to him in the thickening smoke.

        corridor and move through a series of offices, doubling back
        toward the main entrance.

        Sarah and Reese move rapidly through the smoke.
        Gunfire sounds nearby.  They pass bodies.

                                VUKOVICH (V.O.)
                           (weakly)
                     Reese!

        They find the Lieutenant propped in a corner, dying.
        Reese bends toward him.
        Vukovich holds out his custom Colt Python .357.

                                VUKOVICH
                           (continuing)
                     You just keep her alive.  Do
                     what you have to.

        Reese snatches the gun and the keys and runs on.

        C.U. - VUKOVICH watching them go.

        FAST PANAGLIDE PRECEDING TERMINATOR as he runs through
        the smoky rooms.  A fire is burning, lighting everything
        a flickering orange.
        He emerges onto a landing through a side entrance.  PAN
        to follow his line of sight as he snaps the AR-180 to
        his shoulder.  B.G. a BLUE VOLKSWAGEN RABBIT is roaring
        away across the parking lot.

        TIGHT ON TERMINATOR aiming carefully.  He pulls the trigger.
        It clicks...empty.  Slowly he lowers the scope-sight from
        his eye and watches them go.

        Terminator limps down the steps from the landing and walks
        away as the fire spreads behind the windows of Division
        Headquarters.

181     EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT                                   181

        The Rabbit is stopped on the shoulder of a two lane
        secondary road winding through the hills north of L.A.
        Reese is fishing objects out of the car's trunk and
        handing them to Sarah, who holds a flashlight.
        He hands her a blanket, some road flares, and a first
        aid kit.  Then he slams the trunk.  Reaching through the
        side window, he turns the wheel and pushes the car off
        the shoulder, over the embankment.

        DOWN ANGLE INTO RAVINE, past Sarah and Reese, as the car
        trundles down crashing through the underbrush to dis-
        appear among the trees.

        Reese looks out across the valley and the lights of L.A.
        A helicopter circles in the distance, searchlight on.

                                REESE
                     Let's get off the road.

182     INT./EXT. DRAINAGE CULVERT - NIGHT                     182

        ANGLE LOOKING OUT from the mouth of an enclosed concrete
        storm drain that passes under the road.  Reese, followed
        by Sarah, trudges down the slope and ducks inside.
        The floor is wet but he doesn't seem to mind.
        They both hunker down with their backs to the concrete,
        facing each other.
        They look beaten, grimy, exhausted.
        She huddles under the blanket, waif-like.

                                REESE
                      You cold?

                                SARAH
                      Freezing.

                                REESE
                      Come here.

        She sits beside him and they wrap their arms around each
        other with the blanket covering both of them.

                                SARAH
                      Reese...you got a first name?

                                REESE
                      Kyle.

                                SARAH
                      Kyle, what's it like when you
                      go through time?

                                REESE
                      White light.  Pain.  Like
                      being ripped inside out...
                      slowly.  Like being born,
                      maybe.

        Sarah scowls and draws her hand out from under his jacket.

                                SARAH
                      You're wet.  Oh my god.

        In the beam of the flashlight her hand is glistening
        with blood.

                                REESE
                      I caught one, back there.

                                SARAH
                           (incredulous)
                      Caught one?  You mean you
                      got shot?

        Reese shrugs.

                                REESE
                      It's not bad.

        Sarah sits up and turns toward him.

                                SARAH
                      We gotta get you to a doctor.

                                REESE
                      It's okay.  Forget it.

                                SARAH
                      Forget it?  Are you crazy?
                      Let me see it.

        Sarah opens his jacket and the flashlight beam shows his
        shirt bloodsoaked at the shoulder.

                                SARAH
                           (continuing)
                      Jeez.  You idiot.  Take
                      this off.

        She cradles the flashlight between her knees and opens
        the first aid kit as he removes his jacket.

                                REESE
                           (looking at the
                           wound)
                      See.  Missed everything.
                      Passed through the meat.

        Sarah starts swabbing the flesh wound.

                                SARAH
                      This is gonna make me puke.
                      Talk about something.

                                REESE
                      What?

                                SARAH
                      Just talk.  Tell me about
                      my son.  Is he tall?

        She places a gauze pad in place and starts to wrap it.

                                REESE
                      About my height.  He
                      has your--
                           (winces)
                      ...damn...he has your
                      eyes.

        Sarah glances at his face for a second and then goes back
        to work.

                                SARAH
                      What's he like?

                                REESE
                           (thoughtful)
                      You trust him.  He's got that
                      strength.  You'd die in a
                      second for John.

                                SARAH
                      Well, at least I know what
                      to name him.  I don't suppose
                      you'd know who the father is?
                      So I don't tell him to get
                      lost when I meet him.

                                REESE
                      John never said much about
                      him.  He dies.  Even before
                      the war...

                                SARAH
                           (interrupting)
                      Stop!  I don't want to know.
                      Hold still.  So...it was John
                      that ordered you here?

                                REESE
                      I volunteered.

                                SARAH
                      You volunteered?

                                REESE
                      It was an honor.  A chance
                      to meet the legend.  Sarah
                      Connor.  Who taught her son
                      to fight...organize, prepare.
                      From when he was a kid.  When
                      you were in hiding, before
                      the war.

        She stops taping.  She seems lost, her bravado dissipated.

                                SARAH
                      You talk about things I haven't
                      done yet in the past tense.  It's
                      making me crazy.  I can't think.
                           (pause)
                      Are you sure you've got the
                      right person?

        Reese appraises her coldly.

                                REESE
                      I'm sure.

                                SARAH
                      Come on, me? The mother
                      of the future?  Am I tough?
                      Organized?  I can't even balance
                      my checkbook.  I cry when I see
                      a cat that's been run over...
                      and I don't even like cats.

        She pulls the bandage tight with a knot.

                                REESE
                      Ow!  No, it's okay.  It's
                      better tight.

                                SARAH
                      And anyway, what do I know
                      about guerrilla warfare?

                                REESE
                      You'll learn.

                                SARAH
                           (angry)
                      Look, Reese, I didn't ask for
                      this honor and I don't want it.
                      Any of it.

                                REESE
                      John gave me a message for
                      you.  Made me memorize it.
                      'Sarah"...this is the message...
                      'Sarah, thank you.  For your
                      courage through the dark years.
                      I can't help you with what you
                      must soon face, except to tell
                      you that the future is not set...
                      there is no such thing as Fate,
                      but what we make for ourselves
                      by our own will.  You must be
                      stronger than you imagine you
                      can be.  You must survive, or I
                      will never exist.'  That's all.

        Sarah stares at him as the enormity of it all becomes real
        to her.  Reese moves his arm, testing the bandage.

                                REESE
                           (continuing)
                      Good field-dressing.

                                SARAH
                           (brightening)
                      You like it?  It's my first.

        He rebuttons his shirt and they return to the warmth-
        conserving embrace.  Sarah gazes out the entrance, into
        the night.

                                REESE
                      Sleep.  It'll be light soon.

                                SARAH
                           (closing her
                           eyes)
                      Okay.  Talk some more.

                                REESE
                      About what?

                           (murmuring)
                      About where you're from.

        Kyle watches the helicopter circling far in the distance.

                                REESE
                      Alright.
                           (pause)
                      You stay down by day, but at
                      night you can move around.
                      The H-K's use infra-red so you
                      still have to watch out.
                      But they're not too bright.
                      John taught us ways to dust them
                      them.  That's when the infiltra-
                      tors started to appear.  The
                      Terminators were the newest,
                      the worst...

        During his monologue we have PANNED into the darkness outside
        and to the helicopter, which flies OUT OF FRAME, leaving
        black.  A ROTOR ROAR fades up.

        Black sky.  Stars.
        With a roar an AERIAL PATROL CRAFT enters close overhead.
        It has flashing red and blue lights and powerful search-
        lights which stab down.

        TILT DOWN

        to a vista of moonlit devastation.
        White ash blows in drifts among fire-gutted ruins.
        Blackened bones lie everywhere in heaps.
        Searchlights sweep the night.
        Another aerial unit hovers several blocks away, firing
        tracers into the ruins.

        LOW ANGLE

        as a gleaming chrome H-K grinds through the debris of the
        shattered street on its tank-like tracks, crushing burnt
        skulls.
        Its head turns slowly, playing high-intensity lights over the
        buildings.
        Its hydraulic arms are folded, mantis-like, against its

        from shadow to shadow, B.G.

185     INT. TUNNELS - NIGHT                                   185

        Reese is among a SQUAD OF MEN in black fatigues, carrying
        equipment and energy rifles, who enter a debris-littered
        tunnel.

        PANAGLIDE WITH THEM as they trot through a labyrinth of
        tunnels, pass several guard-posts.  Reese has a GERMAN
        SHEPHERD on a short leash.

186     INT. PARKING STRUCTURE - NIGHT                         186

        The platoon enters a cavernous chamber, an old parking
        structure, in which a large group is gathering.
        As the entrance, ARMED SENTRIES with dogs are passing in
        new arrivals: men wearing mismatched uniforms or rags and
        carrying all types of weapons from lasers to shotguns.
        Weapons are left at the sentry post.

        FOLLOWING REESE as he patrols the perimeter.
        He walks along a row of CARS, models from the eighties and
        nineties, now stripped, rusty and modified to carry weapons.
        There are conventional military vehicles as well.
        He passes several family groups.
        Gaunt kids are huddles around an old TV SET.
        Its glow bathes them.

        REVERSE ANGLE reveals that the set has been gutted and a
        small cookfire crackles inside the shell.
        Nearby a kid has a LARGE RAT cornered and is whacking it
        with a stick.

        Reese pauses at the end of the row of vehicles and unsnaps
        a pocket in his tunic, removing a small paper rectangle,
        a worn photograph.

        C.U. - REESE, gazing down.  His head snaps around at the
        sudden sound of BARKING.

        ANGLE ON SENTRY POST as the dogs go crazy.

                                SENTRY
                           (shouting)
                      Terminator!

        An innocuous, RAG-DRESSED MAN flips back his poncho to
        reveal a powerful PLASMA-RIFLE.  He opens FIRE, running
        forward.  ENERGY BOLTS rip into the crowd.

        MOVING WITH REESE, running toward the Terminator.

        RAPID CUTS:

        POWERBOLTS EXPLODE among the fleeing people.
        Beams sear the darkness.
        A running CHILD is BURST by a plasma hit.

        ANGLE ON REESE running.  He levels his energy-rifle and
        starts firing.  A powerbolt grazes his cheek, EXPLODING
        a support column behind him.  Part of the ROOF COLLAPSES
        as Reese tumbles.

        Everything is lit as if by lightning.

        C.U. - REESE, semi-conscious.  Burned.  Bleeding.
        Impressions implode on him: running feet, flashes, energy
        beams raking the ground leaving molten worm-tracks, scream-
        ing, a burning dog howling.

        DETAIL - The picture Reese has been looking at has fallen,
        forgotten.  It catches fire and starts to curl.  Before
        the image vanishes we see that it is a picture of Sarah.

        Reese looks up.
        A figure looms above, a silhouette in the smoky, hellish
        glare.  THE TERMINATOR.  Its  eyes glow red.

        A brilliant EXPLOSION WHITES OUT THE SCREEN.

        C.U. - SARAH, brightly lit by daylight.  Asleep.  She grimaces
        and groans.
        In the distance a dog is barking.

        Reese, still holding her, lightly lifts her hair from her
        face.  An uncharacteristically tender gesture.  He gently
        caresses her cheek with the backs of his fingers.  When
        she awakens suddenly he snaps his hand away.

        Sarah looks around, momentarily disoriented.  Looks up at
        Reese.

                                SARAH
                      I was dreaming about dogs.

        Reese extricates himself from her and steps out of the
        culvert.

                                REESE
                      We used them to spot Terminators.

        Sarah groans as she straightens her legs.

                                SARAH
                      Your world...it's pretty
                      terrifying.

        stop an approaching car.  She pulls his gun hand down with
        both of hers.

                                SARAH
                      Put that away.  I'll get one.

        She hold out her thumb to passing traffic.
        Reese watches this incomprehensible ceremony skeptically.

                                SARAH

        Reese and Sarah are crammed into the cab of a beat-to-hell
        PICKUP TRUCK with the DRIVER, obviously a surfer.  Laid-
        back, long-haired and well-tanned.
        Reese glowers and watches the scenery through slitted eyes.

                      ...and when it breaks right

        They pull off the highway toward a gas station/rest area.

        The gas station is like an oasis of clutter in a rolling
        stretch of meadows and woods.  It consists of a bunker-
        like building with restrooms and a flanking PICNIC AREA,
        beyond which are WOODS.
        People sit under the trees, enjoying the beautiful day
        while children tear around after the forced inactivity of
        a long trip.

        The three of them get out on unsteady legs.

                      Let's get cleaned up, Kyle.

        She heads for the WOMEN'S RESTROOM and Kyle follows her
        inside.

                                REESE
                           (pushing him out)
                      Yours is over there.

        Instead of following her directions to the Men's Room,
        Kyle wanders toward the drinking fountain.  A bunch of
        kids are running around and throwing water at each other
        with paper cups.

        Reese shambles through them like a zombie.
        He stands among the children, an alien in this land without
        fear.  He watches people at picnic tables laughing and
        listening to portable music.  Kids squeal.  Dogs bark.

                                LITTLE GIRL (V.O.)
                      Can you get my balloon?

        DOWN ANGLE on an achingly beautiful LITTLE GIRL of about
        four.  She points above his head.

        Reese looks up to see a helium-filled mylar balloon stuck in
        the foliage of a tree just above him.  He pulls it down by
        the string and holds it, turning it over dully.

        He crouches down to her eye-level.  She smiles.

                                REESE
                      Aren't you afraid to be out in

                      Huh?

        Reese whirls reflexively at a SCREAM behind him.  The
        mylar balloon bursts in his tense hands.  A teenage girl
        is being doused with water by the boys with plastic jugs.

        The little girl looks at the broken balloon, then glares
        at Reese.  She punches him soundly on the shoulder and
        storms off.

        At this moment she is bowled over by an IRISH SETTER that
        licks her face while she shrieks with laughter.
        Reese seems about to smile but doesn't quite know how to
        go about it.

        Sarah has been idly leafing through the DIRECTORY.  On
        a whim she looks up something.

        Reese reacts instinctively, leaping back in a defensive
        crouch.  Sarah freezes when she sees the .357 in his
        hand.

                                SARAH
                           (continuing,
                           scared, but
                           angry)
                      Oh, that's real smart.
                      Go on, shoot me. That's
                      brilliant.

        Reese is trembling as he lowers the gun.
        Sarah too is shaking with emotion.  Tears roll down her
        cheeks and her voice cracks.

                                SARAH
                           (continuing)
                      Jesus Christ, Reese.  Can't
                      you see I'm scared?

        He straightens up and his arms go limp at his sides.
        He turns away.

                                SARAH
                           (continuing)
                      I can't spend my life waiting
                      for that thing to catch up
                      with me...always looking over
                      my shoulder, wondering if I
                      left some tiny clue behind...

        Reese doesn't respond.
        The gun slips from his fingers.
        His will seems to drain from him and he sags to his knees.
        The moment stretches.
        There is only the sunlight moving in shafts through the
        leaves, the sound of a small stream nearby, birds chirping.

                                SARAH
                      Reese?

        She crawls over to him.

        C.U. - REESE

        in profile, with Sarah in B.G.
        His eyes are closed.
        A tear meanders down his cheek.

        He touches the grass, the trunk of a tree.

                      than death.

        He looks are her beseechingly.

                                REESE
                           (continuing)
                      Don't you understand...it's
                      all gone!

        Sarah puts her arm around him.
        She sniffs and wipes at her nose with the back of her hand.

                                SARAH
                      We can change it, Kyle.  We
                      have to try.

        She takes his shoulder in her hands.

                                SARAH
                           (continuing)
                      There's no fate but what we
                      make for ourselves. Right?
                      Come on.  Let's go, kiddo.
                      Whaddya say?

        He picks up her sign and they look at each other for a
        second, then get up.

        He is scanning Sarah's address book, turning a page every
        two seconds.

        heading back to the Interstate.  The driver answers her wave
        out the side window.  Reese stops for a moment outside the
        motel office to pet a GERMAN SHEPHERD sitting on the porch.
        The dog wags its tail and licks his hand.

        Reese opens the door and they go in.

        She takes it without thinking as he leaves then realizes
        that she has A LOADED GUN IN HER HAND, without the slightest
        idea of how to use it.  She lays it gently on the dresser.
        As an afterthought, she turns it with one finger so that it
        is pointing the other way.

                      It's mind boggling, the pos-
                      sibilities...Disneyland, the
                      beach, movies...matinees with
                      popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...

                                REESE
                      Hot dogs?

                                SARAH
                      I want to buy you a hot dog so
                      bad,Kyle...all the things you've
                      never seen and done.  You're here,
                      but wherever you go, and whatever
                      you touch, you bring the war with
                      you.

                                REESE
                      My whole life has been combat.

                                SARAH
                      I want it to be over for you.

                                REESE
                      Not possible.

                                SARAH
                      I want it to be over for me too.
                      I feel like I slipped over some
                      invisible line, that I'm in your
                      world now.  Everything's the same,
                      but I see it differently.
                      It's like, there's you and me,
                      and him...but nobody else can
                      understand or help or even touch
                      us.

        Reese looks up and finally catches her gaze.  He reaches
        out for her hand and it seems he may be taking it to
        comfort her.
        But he turns her wrist to read her watch.

                                REESE
                      We'll head out at 0200.
                      That gives you four hours
                      to sleep if you want.  I'll
                      finish.

211     INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                                211

        ANGLE ON TABLE - The bombs are neatly ranked, finished.
        A nylon satchel lies nearby.  The mess is cleaned up.

        WIDE SHOT reveals Reese sitting in silent vigil at the
        window.  The room is dark, lit only by a streetlight
        outside.
        Sarah is asleep on the bed.

        Reese sits cross-legged, shirtless, his body held rigid.
        The image of discipline.  The .357 is held loosely in one
        hand on his lap.  There is a fresh bandage on his shoulder.

        Sarah wakes up and goes to him in the darkness.  He looks
        at her for a moment as she sits beside him, then back outside.

                                SARAH
                      He'll find us, won't he?

                                REESE
                      Probably.  Sarah, if I get
                      zeroed...

                                SARAH
                      Don't say that.

                                REESE
                      If I do, you have to get away,
                      disappear without a trace.
                      Different country, different
                      name, everything.  In case they
                      send another one.

                                SARAH
                      It'll never be over, will it?
                      Look at me, I'm shaking.
                      Some legend, huh?  You must
                      be pretty disappointed.

                                REESE
                      No.  I'm not.

        Several beats before Sarah speaks again.  Her eyes seem
        luminous in the dark.

                                SARAH
                           (softly)
                      Kyle, the women in your
                      time...what were they like?

                                REESE
                      Good fighters.

                                SARAH
                      That's not what I meant.
                      Was there someone special?

                                REESE
                      Someone?

                                SARAH
                      A girl.  You know.

                           (mechanically)

                           (pause)
                      Never.

        He looks away, outside the window

                                SARAH
                           (softly)
                      I'm sorry.

        Sarah studies him for a moment.
        She's sitting slightly behind him and she puts her hands
        on his shoulders and back, tracing the lines of his scars
        with her fingertips.

                                SARAH
                      So much pain.

                                REESE
                      Pain can be controlled.
                      You disconnect it.

                                SARAH
                      And so you feel nothing.

                                REESE
                      It's better that way.

                                SARAH
                           (with great
                           sympathy)
                      Oh, Kyle.

        Reese takes a long, slow breath before he answers, and when
        he does his voice has a new quality, an unfamiliar tenderness.

                                REESE
                      John Connor gave me a picture
                      of you once.  I never knew
                      why.  It was very old. Torn.
                      Faded.  You were young, like
                      you are now.  You weren't
                      smiling...just a little sad...
                      I always wondered what you
                      were thinking at that second.

        He closes his eyes, reaches toward her.  His fingertips
        trace the contour of her nose, chin, cheeks.

                                REESE
                           (continuing)
                      I memorized every line, every
                      curve...

        He opens his eyes, looking right at hers.

                                REESE
                           (continuing)
                      Sarah, I came across time
                      for you.  I love you.
                      I always have.

        Sarah is quietly overwhelmed.
        Reese looks away.

                                REESE
                           (continuing)
                      I'm sorry.  I shouldn't
                      have said...

                                SARAH
                      Kyle...


        She leans forward and kisses him.
        His face is frozen.  A mask.
        She continues, tenderly.
        He begins to respond.
        The dam breaks and he holds her in a tight, trembling
        embrace, clinging to her like life itself.

        Kyle picks her up and carries her to the bed.
        She kisses his neck and chest, tracing his scars with
        her lips.

        He unbuttons her blouse very slowly.
        Sarah guides his powerful hands over her.

        A SEQUENCE OF CUTS.  DETAILS.  IMPRESSIONS.

        Sarah, a very close angle, as she grimaces in divine agony.
        Reese, his face rapt.
        His hand, clutching the pillow as if to kill it.
        It is explosive, torrential.  A confluence of fate and will.

        TIGHT ON SARAH AND REESE in each other's arms.  Lying
        across his chest, she surveys his face as his eyes close
        drowsily.

                                SARAH
                      I bet you're ticklish.

                      Ticklish?

        Sarah's hand moves OUT OF FRAME.  After a moment Reese
        looks down, puzzled.

                                REESE
                      What are you doing?

                                SARAH
                           (continuing
                           doggedly)
                      You'll beg for mercy in
                      a second.

        Reese seems unperturbed.  Finally he begins to squirm.

                                REESE
                      I don't think I like this.

                                SARAH
                      You're not supposed to.

        Now Reese is becoming desperate.  A grimace spreads across
        his face.  It becomes a grin.  Then he's laughing, trying
        to escape but she won't let him, and they collapse, laughing
        together.
        Sarah gazes at his grin, a glimpse of the Reese that might
        have been, in another life.

        A moment later the grin vanishes at the sound of dogs barking
        outside.
        Reese is off the bed in an instant, crouched tense, eyes
        alert.  Feral as ever.

                                REESE

        It is WIDE ANGLE and the barrel of the AR-180 is visible at

        The nearest vehicle parked in front is a LARGE PICKUP TRUCK
        WITH TWO DIRT BIKES lashed in the bed, seen prominently as

        The POV approaches a door.  Number 14.

        The door is KICKED OPEN.
        Moving inside.
        The assault rifle sprays the room, exploding the indistinct
        forms on the bed.  Staccato glare.  Approaching the bed.
        Nothing there put the shredded remain of sheets and pillows.

        The POV shifts to the BACK DOOR, which is ajar, and moves
        toward it.  Through the door.  Revealing an EMPTY YARD.

        Sarah lies on the seat, clutching the nylon satchel, which
        bulges with the explosive charges.  She has dressed hastily

        the wires and the engine starts to turn over.

        Whips the AR to his shoulder.

        The truck is BACKING WILDLY across the lot B.G.
        Terminator turns, looking into CAMERA as a SIZZLING SOUND
        becomes audible.

        DETAIL - PIPE CHARGE, lying just inside the door, in the
        shadows.  The fuse is burning.

        WIDE SHOT - On doorway, from the parking lot, as Terminator
        takes two leaping strides forward and the CHARGE EXPLODES.
        The front of the building is BLOWN TO KINDLING.
        Terminator is flung forward by the blast.

        They flicker rapidly through pools of light and shadow.

        ANGLE OVER REESE'S SHOULDER as they hurtle forward.  An

        WIDE ANGLE, following close to Terminator, as he closes on
        the pickup, B.G.  The truck swerves suddenly, diving around
        a TRACTOR-TRAILER.  Terminator leans hard to follow.

        LOW WIDE ANGLE preceding the pickup and Terminator as they
        swerve as high speed.  Reese uses the slow semis as static
        obstacles.  He misses them by inches, TIRES SQUEALING.

        ANGLE OVER SARAH'S SHOULDER, through the front window as
        the back of a SEMI-TRAILER hurtles toward them, straight ahead.

        HIGH ANGLE, following both vehicles as Reese feints RIGHT
        and then skids LEFT.  He slides toward the trailer in a
        FOUR-WHEEL DRIFT as Terminator commits to the right.

        M.C.U. - TERMINATOR, over the barrel of the AR, as he FIRES.

        SIDE ANGLE - PASSING TRUCK-TRAILER, bullets strafe across
        it as the pickup vanishes behind.  Terminator skids the
        bike, barely missing an abutment, and is forced onto an
        OFF-RAMP.

        LOW SIDE ANGLE preceding Terminator as he roars down the
        off-ramp without slowing.  Runs the red light at the bottom
        as a hundred miles an hour.  Climbs the ON-RAMP.

        Sarah is buffeted as Reese fights to control the skidding
        truck.  The angle is past Reese, F.G., on Sarah.
        Terminator appears B.G., converging rapidly as the on-ramp
        joins the freeway.

                                REESE
                      Switch places with me.

        She slides over him while he keeps the hammer down.

        Reese is out the window to the waist, aiming double-
        handed.  He FIRES.  ONCE.  TWICE.  AGAIN.

        They enter an interchange.  Ahead lies a LONG, SWEEPING
        CURVE, two lanes wide and elevated.

        Terminator rocks back from a round between the eyes that
        bares metal, the FIRES.

        Bullets rake the pickup.
        The windows are blown out.
        The side mirror explodes.
        Reese is hit.  Drops the .357.
        Sarah screams and weaves, barely in control.

        inside.  He slumps on the seat, moaning.  Stunned.

                                SARAH
                      Kyle...oh God...

        He has a bullet in the chest.  Another has broken his arm.
        Sarah feels all hope recede.

        He FIRES.
        Sarah shrieks as the doorpost next to her head CLANGS WITH
        HITS.

        The short burst EMPTIES THE GUN.
        It CLATTERS TO THE PAVEMENT a moment later, discarded.
        Terminator draws the .38.  Takes aim.

        Sarah SCREAMS.  HITS THE BREAKS HARD.  CRANKS THE WHEEL.
        GLASS behind her EXPLODES with gunfire.

        SWERVING VICIOUSLY the truck SLAMS THE BIKE, sending it
        FLYING INTO A GUARDRAIL.  Terminator goes over the handle
        bars at a hundred miles per hour.

        with a CHATTERING SCREECH and spraying sheets of SPARKS
        as flesh strips away and steel screams on concrete.

        Terminator hits the guardrail, bounces up, tumbles along the
        top and then pitches OUT INTO SPACE.

        LOW ANGLE as he rises into FRAME, a mass of blood.  Clothing

        him down and under with a METALLIC CRASH.

        ANGLE UNDER TANKER as Terminator rolls, clattering, and the

        the speeding undercarriage until a stray bounce flings him

        a body falls beside it, rolling.
        The truck swings in a slow arc.
        TEARS THROUGH THE DIVIDING FENCE.
        Heads back toward her on the wrong side of the freeway.

        She stares in numb horror.
        The nightmare refuses to end.
        She runs to the crippled pickup and sees a front tire flat,
        shredded by a crumpled fender.

        She searches the cab frantically for the KEYS TO THE
        MOTORCYCLES.  Finds them above the sun visor.

        Sarah leaps into the bed of the pickup and attacks the
        motorcycle strap-downs frantically.
        Panting with terror she rolls the bike off the truck.
        It crashes on its side and she falls on it painfully.

        Straining until she CRIES OUT INVOLUNTARILY, she lifts
        it upright.
        KICKS the engine over.

        LOW ANGLE

        as the tanker crashes back through the divider and starts
        UP THE OVERPASS.  Sarah is trapped in that concrete corridor.
        She kicks for her life.
        The bike catches for a moment.  Dies.

        The truck BELLOWS, down-shifting on the curving grade.
        Sarah kicks again and again, crying out with each stroke.
        Again and again, furiously.
        The engine CATCHES.

        The bike runs with a healthy roar.

        LOW ANGLE

        up the face of the tractor-trailer, the retaining wall blur-
        ring by.  Terminator's red eye can be seen through the wind-
        shield.

        Sarah drags Reese, stumbling,to the bike, props him on the
        seat behind her.  He clutches the satchel weakly.

                     Hold on real tight, okay?

        She guns the engine and roars off.

        HIGH ANGLE - MOVING WITH BOTH VEHICLES as Sarah starts to

        The truck roars past, hitting the air-brakes.
        The trailers force her closer and closer  to the guardrail
        as Terminator tries to sandwich her.
        The bike slides to a stop.
        The rearmost set of trailer wheels slams into the guardrail
        right in front of Sarah.

        Sarah emerges from a cloud of tire smoke, cutting across

        a row of trees at a chainlink retaining fence.  She crawls

        cars and FLATTENING A PRE-FAB STORAGE BUILDING.

        They enter an alley-like space between two buildings.
        Kyle is fumbling to open the satchel.

        They hold the embrace, silhouetted by the diminishing flames.
        It would be a wonderful final image.
        Except...TERMINATOR STAGGERS OUT OF THE BLAZE BEHIND THEM.

        M.C.U. - TERMINATOR, the last flakes of flesh are falling
        from him like burning leaves.  His gleaming structure is
        revealed in all its intricacy.  No longer a 'He', but an 'It'.
        It looks like Death rendered in steel.
        A CHROME SKELETON with HYDRAULIC MUSCLES and TENDONS OF
        FLEXIBLE CABLE.  In the sockets of the metal skull, the
        eyeball swivels with a WHIR of tiny servos, both glowing
        red now.

        It turns slowly and fixes its gaze directly INTO CAMERA.

        C.U. - SARAH - She chokes on a scream, crams knuckles in
        her mouth.

        FULL SHOT (FX), as the machine takes a step toward them,
        dragging one MALFUNCTIONING LEG.

        PANAGLIDE WITH KYLE AND SARAH as they stagger to their feet
        and run to the nearest building.  They come to a glass door.
        Kyle kicks it in.  Unlatches it.  They enter dark OFFICES
        to the sound of ALARMS and DISTANT SIRENS.

                                               CUT TO:


252     INT. CORRIDORS - NIGHT                                 252

        Sarah and Kyle run down a corridor.
        Through a door, which they close and lock.
        They move off down a cross-corridor.
        The Terminator BLASTS THE DOOR OFF ITS HINGES, F.G., and
        staggers through.  It starts after their receding figures
        as they round the corner at the end of the hall.

                                               CUT TO:


253     INT. OPEN OFFICES - NIGHT                              253

        The Terminator catches sight of them through a floor-to-
        ceiling window.  It makes an unhesitating right turn through
        the glass.

                                               CUT TO:


255     INT. OPEN OFFICES - NIGHT                              255

        Sarah and Kyle look back at the sound of SHATTERING GLASS.

        PANAGLIDE PRECEDING THE TERMINATOR as it crashes forward,
        line-of-sight, through the maze.  It splinters partitions.
        Flings desks out of the way.

        FOLLOWING SARAH AND KYLE as they reach a heavy FIREDOOR and
        go through.

                                               CUT TO:


256     INT. MANUFACTURING AREA - NIGHT                        256

        Kyle slides the bolts on the metal firedoor.  Behind them
        are acres of machinery in darkness.  Silence.
        CRASH!  The Terminator hits the door from the far side.
        Hinges SQUEAL.

        Kyle goes to a LARGE BREAKER PANEL and opens it.  Starts
        throwing switches.  Behind them, machines START UP ONE BY ONE.

                                SARAH
                           (panting)
                      What are you doing?

                                REESE
                           (weakly)
                      Cover...our footsteps...

        He sags, sliding down the wall.  She pulls him up.
        Half-carries him into the maze of machines.
        The dark gallery is filled with WHIRRING, CLANKING SHAPES,
        SHATTERING CONVEYER BELTS and improbable mechanisms lashing
        mindlessly.

        Reese slips to the floor and Sarah is no longer able to
        support him.

                                REESE
                           (faintly)
                      Leave me here.

        Sarah crouches beside him.
        Grabs his shirt front.
        Yells over the machines.

                                SARAH
                      I'm not leaving you anywhere
                      you jerk.  Haven't you figured
                      it out?  Kyle, John is our
                      son.

        Reese's eyes refocus.

                                SARAH
                           (continuing)
                      There isn't going to be
                      anybody else...I don't want
                      anybody else.  Listen to
                      me!

        She pauses, then resumes in a commanding, military shout.

                                SARAH
                           (continuing)
                      Move!  Reese! Let's go.
                      Move you ass!

        She drags him to his feet and he staggers on.

        Hinges SHATTER and the firedoor is hurled inward.
        The Terminator scans the darkness.

        ANGLE - PANNING WITH SARAH AND KYLE as they move through
        the machines.

        The cyborg steps forward, scanning methodically.

        Sarah and Kyle move in a crouch through the treacherous
        tangle of pipes and machinery.  Kyle picks up a length of
        pipe to use as a weapon.  As they climb out onto a cat-
        walk between the two huge mechanisms, Sarah clambers over
        an innocuous CONTROL PANEL.
        Her knee inadvertently hits a RED PUSH BUTTON.
        With a ROAR the stamping-plate of a HYDRAULIC PRESS slams
        down an inch from her hand.
        Startled, she tumbles to the catwalk.

        The Terminator's eyes swivel as he hears the single non-
        rhythmic sound.

        Kyle and Sarah run to the end of the catwalk, but find the
        door there locked.

                                SARAH
                      Come on!

        They double back to escape the cul-de-sac.  The Terminator
        steps in front of them, cutting them off.

                                REESE
                           (shouting)
                      Run!

        He pushes Sarah roughly and she stumbles away.
        Kyle raises the pipe with his good arm as the Terminator
        advances.

                                REESE
                           (over his
                           shoulder)
                     Run, damn it!

        She hesitates, backing away.
        The cyborg swings at Reese
        STEEL CLANGS ON STEEL.
        Kyle strikes and parries but is sledgehammered back.

        ANGLE ON CATWALK as Kyle lands in a heap, smashed against
        a stanchion of the railing which prevented him falling to
        the factory floor twenty feet below.

        Sarah turns and runs.

        LOW ANGLE PAST REESE, F.G., as the cyborg approaches him.

        E.C.U. - A FUSE BURNING.

        C.U. - KYLE'S FACE streaked with blood, pressed to the
        floor as a metal foot CLANGS DOWN, F.G.   His eyes snap open.

        Sarah falls, gets up, runs on.
        The Terminator draws back for a death blow.
        And Kyle rolls with the last of his strength, raising
        the pipe bomb he has been cradling.  He jams it between two
        hydraulic cylinders just beneath the cyborg's armored  rib-
        cage.  Then rolls off the catwalk.  Terminator has an instant
        to react, reaching for the bomb, before it EXPLODES.

        Sarah is pitched forward by the blast and slides on the
        floor.
        Slams up against one wall.
        A withering spray of shrapnel strafes the walls around her.
        Pieces of scrap metal clatter throughout the factory, rain-
        ing down.

        C.U. - SARAH, very still.  She winces and opens her eyes.
        Slowly looks up.

        POV - SARAH, as the smoke clears.  The Terminator is GONE.
        Unrecognizable clumps of BURNING DEBRIS lie scattered about.
        Looking down through the grating floor she sees Kyle's
        body.
        LOW ANGLE ON KYLE F.G., Sarah on catwalk above.  Kyle's eyes
        are half-open.  Still.  His face peaceful.
        ANGLE ON ONE OF THE FIRES climbing some plastic tubing and
        triggering a SPRINKLER HEAD.  It begins to rain.
        C.U. - SARAH sitting up as the water runs over her.
        She looks down.  Protruding from her right thigh is a TWISTED
        PIECE OF METAL.  Shrapnel.  Part of the cyborg.  She pulls
        it out, grimacing.  Her leg is broken.

        It is a long time before she can gather the will to move.

        SARAH'S POV - She sees a WALL PHONE several yards away,
        beyond the debris from the explosion.
        She starts to crawl toward it.
        She passes A LARGE CLUMP OF DEBRIS, F.G.

        ANGLE ON DEBRIS (FX) as it rolls over suddenly!
        Now recognizable as the TERMINATOR'S HEAD AND ARMS, with
        half of the scattered torso trailing wires and twisted
        metal.

        IT LUNGES FOR HER!

        Sarah wants to scream this time, from the depths of her
        soul, but there is no scream, only a dry shivering sob.

        The Terminator drags itself SCRAPING over the floor, steel
        fingers clutching.

        Sarah is shaking and whimpering as she scrabbles away,
        crawling in agony.

        ANGLE ON CONVEYOR BELT as Sarah flops from the catwalk
        onto the MOVING STRIP.  She is carried into the intricate
        lattice of equipment.  Sarah rolls off weakly before going
        under a set of sorting rollers.

        ANGLE THROUGH MACHINERY - ON THE TERMINATOR (FX) as it crawls
        after her, dragging its body.  It tracks her unerringly,
        EYES GLOWING.

        Sarah moves deeper into the DARK, CLASHING JUNGLE of machinery.
        Around her is a rain-drenched tangle of CABLES, PIPES and
        unforgiving mechanisms of steel.

        The Terminator clambers through after her.

        C.U. - SARAH - Water pours into her eyes as she catches
        sight of something.  A familiar CONTROL BOX.
        She drags herself toward it.

        C.U. - THE TERMINATOR (FX) - It spots her wedged in a tiny
        crawl space.  No way out.

        It crawls the last few feet,EYES RED IN THE DARK.
        Hypnotized, Sarah watches the Terminator REACHING TOWARD HER.
        She is jammed in a corner.
        Sarah's hand claws around to the front of the control panel,
        seeking the RED BUTTON.

        E.C.U. - HER WET FINGERTIPS FEEL THE BUTTON.

        ANGLE ON THE TERMINATOR (FX), his steel hand reaching out.

        E.C.U. - SARAH, her face inexplicably calm, eyes steady in
        that infinite instant.  She clenches her teeth to keep
        from screaming as she WAITS.

        The Terminator's hand reaches for her throat to crush
        the life out of her and end its long mission.

                                SARAH
                           (voice icy)
                      You're...terminated...fucker!

        E.C.U. - BUTTON, as her bloody finger stabs it down.

        FULL SHOT, showing how the cyborg has been led into the
        MAW OF THE HYDRAULIC PRESS.
        THE STAMPING PLATE THUNDERS DOWN!
        Tons of mechanical pressure flatten the Terminator's head
        and body like tin-foil.  The PRESS SCREAMS, jamming solid.
        Lightning snaps out in one brief blaze, leaping to surround-
        ing machinery, arcing to Sarah's wristwatch.  All the
        Terminator's energy is released in one second.

        ANGLE on the narrow gap between the upper and lower plates:
        a pinpoint of red light DWINDLES AND GOES OUT.
        TIGHT ON SARAH, shivering uncontrollably.  The steel fingers
        are frozen an inch from her throat.  She can only stare as
        water runs over her.

                                               CUT TO:


257     INT. FACTORY - DAWN                                    257

        CLOSE ON the side rail of an ambulance gurney SNAPPING UP
        into position.  Sarah's eyes are closed and she is moved
        OUT OF FRAME.

        WIDE SHOT, showing the gurney being rolled by TWO ATTENDANTS
        past the site of the last explosion.
        SEVERAL POLICE OFFICERS are picking through the debris.

        PANNING WITH THE GURNEY as it is wheeled out, holding on
        TWO FACTORY EMPLOYEES, F.G.
        One, the PLANT MANAGER, bends to examine a piece of the
        cyborg lying at the base of the hydraulic press.
        A COP, B.G., notices this.

                                COP
                      Look, I told you not to
                      touch anything until we're
                      done.  You got that?

                                MANAGER
                      Sure thing, officer.

        He stands and palms a small object to HIS ASSISTANT.  They
        step around the corner.

                                ASSISTANT
                      What is it?

                                MANAGER
                      Microcomputer chassis.  But
                      I've never seen stuff like
                      this anywhere.

                                ASSISTANT
                      Weird.  Jap stuff, maybe?

                                MANAGER
                      Keep it out of sight and
                      get it down to R and D
                      Monday, first thing.

                                ASSISTANT
                      Good idea.

        Sarah is being lifted into the ambulance.  She looks
        up as the doors are latched shut.

        TILT UP to follow her gaze.
        The sign above the entrance of the building reads:

        CYBER DYNAMICS CORPORATION

                                               SLOW DISSOLVE TO:


259     INT./EXT. LANDROVER - LATE AFTERNOON                   259

        MACRO ON CASSETTE RECORDER, the center capstans of a
        tape turning.

                                SARAH (V.O.)
                      ...and the hardest thing is
                      deciding what I should tell
                      you and what not to.  Well,
                      anyway, I've got a while yet
                      before you're old enough to
                      understand the tapes.  They're
                      more for me at this point...
                      to help get it all straight.

        COVER SHOT reveals Sarah as the wheel of a dusty landrover
        parked at the pump island of a tiny gas station.  All of
        its signs are in hand-lettered Spanish.  Beyond lies an
        expanse of scrub desert.  The sky scowls with an impending
        storm.

        Sarah speaks quietly into a hand microphone as a dark-
        complected attendant laconically fills her tank.  She
        cradles the cassette recorder in her lap, in the lee of
        her SWOLLEN BELLY.
        She looks to be about SIX MONTHS ALONG.
        Under her down vest she wears a leather shoulder holster
        and the butt of a .357 REVOLVER presses against her
        breast.  She tugs the vest closed as the attendant glances
        her way.  A German Shepherd sits in the back among taped
        boxes and suitcases.

                                SARAH
                           (continuing)
                      Should I tell you about your
                      father?  That's a tough one.
                      Will it change your decision
                      to send him here...knowing?
                      But if you don't send Kyle,
                      you could never be.  God,
                      you can go crazy thinking
                      about all this...I suppose
                      I'll tell you...I owe him that.
                      And maybe it'll be enough if
                      you know that in the few hours
                      we had together we loved a
                      lifetime's worth...

        CLICK.  WHIR.  Sarah jumps at a sound nearby, breaking
        her reverie.  A small MEXICAN BOY has snapped her picture
        with a beat-up Polaroid camera.  He holds it out to her,
        speaking rapid Spanish.

                                ATTENDANT
                      He says you are very beautiful,
                      Senora, and he is ashamed to ask
                      five American dollars for this
                      picture, but if he does not,
                      his father will beat him.

                                SARAH
                      That's a pretty good hustle,
                      kid.  Four.  Quatro.

        The boy takes her four dollars and she watches the
        snapshot develop.  It is a good photograph of her,
        the wind lightly ruffling her hair, expression thought-
        ful, slightly sad.

        We recognize it as the one Reese carried in 2029.
        She slips it into her short pocket.

                                ATTENDANT
                      Mil trescientos...fifteen dollars
                      American.

        As she pays him, distant thunder rolls.
        The boy yells something in Spanish as he runs off.

                                SARAH
                      What did he say?

                                ATTENDANT
                           (accented)
                      There is a storm coming in.

        Sarah gazes at the thunderheads building up out over the
        desert.  Heat lightning pulses in their depths.

                                SARAH
                           (quietly)
                      I know.

        CAMERA CRANES UP as she pulls away, driving across the
        flat desert on a ribbon of highway.  A brilliant flash
        crescendos from horizon to horizon out at the rim of the
        world.

                                                       FADE IN:

EXT. CUMBERLAND, RHODE ISLAND HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING

It's the early 1980's and everyone is arriving at school. We push
through the parking lot crowd to a nervous, lanky kid, TED
PELOQUIN.

                        MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
           When I was sixteen years old I fell in
           love...

CLOSE ON - RENISE, a tough girl with stringy brown hair and a
shiny forehead, as she turns toward the camera.

                        TED
           Hey, Renise.

She barely looks at him as he approaches, just drags on her smoke.

                        RENISE
           Hey.

                        TED
           So what's up?

                        RENISE
           Eh.

                        TED
           Great. Great.
                 (beat)
           So listen, uh, I was wondering if maybe you
           wanted to go to the prom you know, with
           me.

Renise looks unenthused.

                        TED (cont'd)
           It's no big deal, whatever I mean, if you
           want.

                        RENISE
           See, the thing is, I heard a rumor that
           this guy I like was gonna ask me.

                        TED
           Uh-huh.

                        RENISE
           Yeah, so...I'm gonna wait and see what
           happens there...But that sounds great,
           yeah.

Ted nods, confused.

                        TED
           Okay.
                 (beat)
           So is that a yes or a no?

                        RENISE
           I think I was very clear, Ted. If
           everything else falls apart, maybe.

Renise throws down her butt and storms off.

                        TED
           I'm gonna hold you to that.

                                                        CUT TO:

EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE SCHOOL PARKING LOT

ANGLE ON - a pretty girl, MARY, climbing off a ten-speed in the
school parking lot. She's athletic and tanned and doesn't have a
bad bone in her body.

                        MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
           Her name was Mary. She'd moved to our
           little Rhode Island town from Minnesota two
           years earlier.

She locks up the bike and starts walking toward the school.

                        MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
           Mary was very smart, and very cool, and she
           had a faceful of eyes that promised you a
           better life if you could only know her.

As she approaches the camera, we PAN to see Ted watching her. He's
sitting on a picnic table with two FRIENDS.

                        FRIEND #1
           Hey, dirtbud, who you going to the prom
           with?

Finally Ted takes his eyes off Mary.

                        TED
           Ah, I don't know if I'm even gonna. You
           know, not my style.

                        FRIEND #2
           You have a style?

                        FRIEND #1
           Why don't you be a gentleman and ask Rosey?

                        TED
                 (perks up)
           Who?

Friend #1 makes a jerk-off motion.

                        FRIEND #1
           Rosey Palm, your girlfriend. God knows you
           spend enough fucking time with her.

The guys LAUGH.

                        TED
                 (out of ammo but doesn't
                  know it)
           Yeah, and who are you gonna take, your own
           palm?

His friends stare at him.

                        FRIEND #1
           Clever. I like the way you just spun that
           around on me.

Friend #2 notices Mary talking to her FRIENDS.

                        FRIEND #2
           I wonder who she's going with.

                        FRIEND #1
           Some guy named Woogie.

                        TED
           Who?

                        FRIEND #1
           Big guy--goes to Barrington high school.

This irks Ted.

                        TED
           Woogie from Borrington high? Sounds like
           a loser.

                        FRIEND #1
           Loser? Woogie was all-state football and
           and basketball and valedictorian of his
           class.

                        FRIEND #2
           I heard he got a scholarship to Princeton
           but he's going to Europe first to model.

This takes the wind out of Ted's sails.

                        FRIEND #3
           Yeah and he's got a huge cock.

Everyone looks at him.

                        FRIEND #3 (cont'd)
           I heard.

Suddenly Friend #1 NOTICES something.

                        FRIEND #1
           Hey, check it out.

THEIR POV - A large, goofy YOUNG MAN with an unfashionable
crewcut comes walking up the street. He's in his early twenties
and though the weather is mild he's WEARING EARMUFFS. He
approaches a GROUP OF KIDS sitting on a car hood.

                        EAR-MUFF GUY
           You seen my baseball?

                        CAR HOOD KID #2
           No.

The kids watch as the Ear-Muff Guy approaches another group.

                        EAR-MUFF GUY
           You seen my baseball?

ON CAR HOOD KIDS 
                        CAR HOOD KID #1
                 (to his buddies)
           This guy must be in the 'tard squad.
                 (to Ear-Muff Guy)
           Hey, buddy, come here, I think I know where
           your ball is.

The Ear-Muff Guy heads back to the car.

                        EAR-MUFF GUY
           You seen my baseball?

                        CAR HOOD KID #1
           Yeah, I seen it. That girl over there, she
           has it.

Car Hood Kid #1 points to a BUSTY GIRL leaning against another car
talking to her large BOYFRIEND.

                        CAR HOOD KID #2 (cont'd)
           'Cept she doesn't call it a baseball. She
           has another name for it...

                                                       CUT TO:

ON BUSTY GIRL - The Ear-Muff Guy marches up to her and her
boyfriend.

                        EAR-MUFF GUY
           You seen my pecker?

                        GIRL
           What?!

                        EAR-MUFF GUY
           You seen my pecker?

The Boyfriend grabs him by the collar.

                        BOYFRIEND
           You son-of-a-bitch, I'll kick your ass!

The Boyfriend throws the Ear-Muff Guy to the ground and is about
to pummel him when Ted intervenes.

                        TED
           Take it easy, Smokey.

                        BOYFRIEND/SMOKEY
           This fucking pervert just came on to Nance!

                        TED
           All right, just be cool.
                 (under breath)
           He looks like he's not all there, you know
           what I mean?

A crowd starts to gather which only incites Smokey more.

                        BOYFRIEND/SMOKEY
           Get the fuck out of my way, man!

Smokey tosses Ted out of the way and moves toward the Ear-Muff
Guy. Just then Mary shows up and steps between them.

                        MARY
           What's going on here?

She bends down and helps the Ear-Muff Guy off the ground.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           Are you all right?

                        EAR-MUFF GUY
           Mary, you seen my baseball?

                        MARY
           No, I haven't seen your baseball. Jeez,
           Warren, you know you're not supposed to
           leave the yard by yourself.

                        BOYFRIEND/SMOKEY
                 (to Mary)
           You know him?

                        MARY
           He's my brother.

                        BOYFRIEND/SMOKEY
           Oh.
                 (beat)
           I didn't realize he was...you know...

At this, Smokey and his girlfriend reluctantly head toward the
school, along with most of the crowd.

Mary turns her attention in the direction Ted was thrown.

                        MARY
           You okay?

HER POV - Ted is sitting in a mud puddle. He stands and brushes
himself off.

                        TED
           Oh yeah. Fine.

                        MARY
           Thanks a lot, Ted.

CLOSE ON - Ted. He can't believe what he's just heard. As Mary
helps him up, she turns her attention to Warren.

                        MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
           That she knew my name blew my mind. Some of
           my best friends didn't know my name.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING

Mary and a muddied Ted are walking Warren home. Warren lags
behind, mumbling to himself. Mary notices that Ted is limping.

                        MARY
           Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt
           yourself?

                        TED
           No, it's an old football injury.

                        MARY
           Oh, are you on the team?

                        TED
           No, a couple of the players and me were
           joking around and, uh, I fell off the
           school.

Warren approaches and motions for Ted to hop on his back.

                        WARREN
           Piggyback ride?

                        MARY
           Warren, come on, leave Ted alone.

Warren pats his back again.

                        WARREN
           Piggyback ride.

                        TED
                 (to Mary)
           I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.

                        MARY
           Oh he can hold you. He weighs
           two-hundred-and-thirty pounds.

                        TED
           A real Clydesdale, huh Warren?

Ted hops onto Warren's back.

                        TED (cont'd)
           Giddy-up.

Warren walks about five feet and stops.

                        WARREN
           My turn now.

Off Ted's reaction, we

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT . MARY'S HOUSE - DAY

Muddy sweat is running down Ted's face as he struggles up a hill
with Warren on his back.

                        TED
                 (straining)
           We're here, Warren. You wanna get off?

                        WARREN
           Giddy-up.

Ted rolls his eyes and continues toward the front door. Mary looks
on, amused.

                        MARY
           So who you taking to the prom?

                        TED
           Huh?

                        MARY
           The prom--you going?

                        TED
           Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty
           dumb.

                        MARY
           'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go
           if you weren't already taking someone.

                        TED
           I mean dumb in the sense that they only
           happen once a year.

She smiles at this.

                        MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
           From that moment on the guys at school
           looked at me in a whole new light.

                                                       CUT TO:

CLOSE ON FRIEND #1 
                        FRIEND #1
           You're a fucking liar!

EXT. CUMBERLAND HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

PULLBACK TO REVEAL - Ted is leaning against his locker
surrounded by a group of guys.

                        FRIEND #2
           You expect us to believe you're going to
           the prom with Mary? What about Woogie?

                        TED
           They broke up. She said he started getting
           weird on her.

                        FRIEND #1
           I got twenty bucks says you're full of
           shit.

                        TED
           Oh come on, why would I lie?

                        FRIEND #1
           Because you're a loser, and in some warped
           way this gives you a momentary sense of
           worth.

                        FRIEND #2
           Put me down for fifty.

                        FRIEND #3
           I'm in.

As the others join in, we

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. MARY'S HOUSE - TWILIGHT

A tuxedoed and smiling Ted drives up in his parent's station
wagon.

EXT. MARY' S FRONT DOOR - TWILIGHT

Ted knocks on the door and Mary's gruff DAD answers.

                        MARY'S DAD
           Yeah? What do you want?

                        TED
           Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take
           Mary to the prom.

                        MARY'S DAD
           Prom? You're about twenty minutes late. She
           just left for the prom with her boyfriend
           Woogie.

Ted looks devastated. Suddenly the door swings open revealing
MARY'S MOM.

                        MARY'S MOM
           Charlie, that's mean. Come on in, Ted.
           Don't listen to Mr. Wise Guy here. He's a
           joke a minute.

                        TED
           Oh.
                 (relieved)
           Oh, that's a good one.

INT. MARY'S HOUSE - TWILIGHT
Ted nervously enters and sees Warren watching T.V. in the den.

                        TED
           Hey, Warren.

Warren doesn't look his way.

Just then Mary comes down the stairs looking as if the directors
had really taken their time casting this role. Ted can't believe
his eyes.

                        MARY
           Hi, Ted.

                        TED
           Hi, Mary.

                        MARY'S MOM
           Poor Teddy--he's been getting it both
           barrels from the Wisenheimer here.

                        MARY
           Dad, have you been busting Ted's chops?

Mary's Dad shrugs.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           Warren, did you say hi to Ted?

                        WARREN
                 (not looking up)
           'Bout ten times.

                        TED
           Hey, Warren, I think I know where your
           baseball is.

This finally gets Warren's attention.

                        WARREN
           You seen my baseball?

We see Ted discreetly pull a BRAND NEW BASEBALL out of his pocket
and palm it in his hand.

                        TED
           Well, if it's a big white one with red
           stitching, I think I saw it right behind
           your ear ..

Ted is reaching behind Warren's ear when suddenly Warren TAKES A
SWIPE AT HIM, knocking him to the ground.

                        MARY
           Warren!!!

Ted HITS HIS HEAD on the coffee table.

ON THE BASEBALL - as it rolls under the couch, stopping right
next to the OTHER MISSING BALL.

BACK TO SCENE - In a split second, Warren is up like a cat and
DIVES ONTO TED. As MARY AND HER PARENTS SCREAM, Ted manages to
free himself from the disabled man's clutches and GETS WARREN IN A
HEADLOCK.

                        MARY'S DAD
                 (to Ted)
           What the hell are you doing?!

                        MARY'S MOM
           Teddy, let him go!

                        TED
                 (out of breath)
           I'm trying...tell him to...calm down.

The family jumps on Warren and finally break it up.

                        MARY'S DAD (cont'd)
                 (to Ted)
           Jesus Christ, guy, what the hell were you
           doing?!

                        TED
           I was playing a trick. I-I-I had a
           baseball.

                        MARY'S MOM
           What baseball? Where's a baseball?

Ted looks around but there's no ball in sight.

                        TED
           There was a ball I had a honest.

As Mary helps Ted up, we see that his shirttail is out and his tie
is hanging off. Mary's parents lead the frothing Warren back to
the couch.

                        MARY (to Ted)
           I'm sorry. I should've told you, he's got a
           thing about his ears.

                        TED
           Oh. Okay. I gotcha.

                        MARY
           Are you all right?

                        TED
           Oh yeah.

                        MARY'S MOM
                 (to Mary)
           Honey, now you're all wrinkled.

Mary looks down and frowns.

                        MARY
           Ted, will you just give me one more minute?
           I have to iron this thing.

Ted starts to tuck his pants in as Mary and her mother head back
up the stairs. Mary's Dad and Ted are left alone. And Warren.

Ted rubs his head, sees a spot of blood.

                        TED
                 (to Mary's Dad)
           May I use your bathroom?

INT. BATHROOM - TWILIGHT

Ted dabs his head with a tissue, then moves to the toilet. As he
TAKES A LEAK he glances out the window to his left.

TED'S POV - two LOVEBIRDS are perched on a branch.

Ted smiles...

...at the SOUND of these beautiful tweeties singing their love
song for themselves, for the spring, for Ted and Mary, and
suddenly they fly away and we...

SNAP FOCUS 
...to reveal Mary in the bedroom window DIRECTLY BEHIND WHERE THE
BIRDS WERE, in just a bra and panties, and just then her mother
glances Ted's way and MAKES EYE-CONTACT with what she can only
presume to be a leering Peeping Tom.

ON TED...

...he loses the smile and ducks his head back into the bathroom,
HORRIFIED.

PANICKING NOW, he hastily zips up his fly and

                        TED
           YEEEOOOOOWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!

TED GETS HIS DICK STUCK IN THE ZIPPER!

EXT. BATHROOM DOOR - NIGHT

A concerned Mary, her Mom, Dad, and Warren are huddled outside the
bathroom.

                        MARY
                 (knocking gently)
           Ted, are you okay?

                        TED (O.S.)
                 (pained)
           Just a minute.

                        MARY'S MOM
           He's been in there over half an hour.
                 (whispering)
           Charlie, I think he's masturbating.

                        MARY
           Mom!

                        MARY'S MOM
           Well he was watching you undress with a
           silly grin on his face.

                        TED (O.S.)
                 (pained)
           I was watching the birds!

They all look at one another.

                        MARY'S MOM
           Charlie, do something.

                        MARY'S DAD
           All right, kid, that's it, I'm coming in.

INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

A whimpering Ted huddles in the corner as Mary's Dad enters.

                        MARY'S DAD (cont'd)
           What seems to be the situation here? You
           shit yourself or something?

                        TED
           I wish.

Ted motions for him to close the door and Mary's Dad obliges.

                        TED (cont'd)
           I, uh...I got it stuck.

                        MARY'S DAD
           You got what stuck?

                        TED
           It.

                        MARY'S DAD
           It?
                 (beat)
           Oh it. All right, these things happen,
           let me have a look. It's not the end of the
           world.

Mary's Dad moves closer and puts his reading glasses on.

EXT. BATHROOM DOOR - CONTINUOUS

As Mary, her Mom, and Warren listen in...

                        MARY'S DAD (O.S.)
           OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!

                        TED (O.S.)
           Shhhhhh!

INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

                        MARY'S DAD
                 (CALLS OUT)
           Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!

                        TED
           What?! No please, sir--

                        MARY'S DAD
           She's a dental hygienist. She'll know what
           to do.

Mary's Mom comes in and closes the door behind her.

                        MARY'S MOM
           Teddy, hon, are you okay?
                 (moving closer, seeing the situation)
           OH HEAVENS TO PETE!

                        TED
           Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.

                        MARY'S MOM
           Just relax, dear. Now, um...what exactly
           are we looking at here?

                        TED
                 (dizzy)
           What do you mean?

                        MARY'S MOM
                 (delicate)
           I mean is it...is it...?

                        MARY'S DAD
                 (gruff)
           Is it the frank or the beans?

                        TED
           I think a little of both.

Suddenly we hear Warren from outside the door:

                        WARREN (O.S.)
           Franks and beans!

Ted hangs his head.

EXT. BATHROOM DOOR - CONTINUOUS

Mary and Warren are huddled outside the door.

                        MARY
                 (to Warren)
           Shhhh.

                        MARY'S DAD (O.S.)
           What the hell's that bubble?

Mary REACTS to this.

INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

                        TED
           One guess.

                        MARY'S DAD
           How the hell'd you get the beans all the
           way up top like that?

                        TED
           I don't know. It's not like it was a well
           thought-out plan.

                        MARY'S MOM
           Oh my, there sure is a lot of skin coming
           through there.

                        MARY'S DAD
           I'm guessing that's what the soprano shriek
           was about, pumpkin.

                        MARY'S MOM
           I'm going to get some Bactine.

                        TED
           No, please!

Suddenly a POLICE OFFICER sticks his head in the bathroom window.

                        POLICE OFFICER
           Ho there.

                        TED
                 (humiliated)
           Oh God.

                        POLICE OFFICER
           Everything okay here? Neighbors said they
           heard a lady scream.

                        MARY'S DAD
           You're looking at him. C'mere and take a
           look at this beauty.

                        TED
           No, that's really unneces--

But the Officer's already climbing in the window. Once inside, he
turns his flashlight on Ted and WHISTLES.

                        POLICE OFFICER
           Now I've seen it all. What the hell were
           you thinking?

                        TED
                 (frustrated)
           I wasn't trying--

                        POLICE OFFICER
           Is that bubble what I think it is? 

Mary's parents nod.

                        POLICE OFFICER (cont'd)
           But...how...how'd you get the zipper all
           the way to the top?

                        MARY'S DAD
           Let's just say the kid's limber.

The Officer makes a face, then rolls up his sleeves.

                        POLICE OFFICER
           Well, there's only one thing to do.

                        TED
           No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my
           shirttail out and work on it in the
           morning.

                        POLICE OFFICER
           Look, son, this'll only hurt for a second.

The Officer reaches down and takes hold of the zipper.

                        TED
           No, no, please!

                        MARY'S MOM
           Teddy, be brave.

                        WARREN (O.S.)
           Beans and franks!

                        MARY (O.S.)
           Warren, shhh.

Defeated, Ted holds his breath and braces for the worst.

                        POLICE OFFICER
           It's just like pulling off a Band-aid.
           A-one and a-two and...

                                                       CUT TO:

           We got a bleeder!

EXT. MARY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

TWO PARAMEDICS rush Ted out the front door on a stretcher. Mary
runs alongside him holding a towel on his crotch. while a THIRD
PARAMEDIC dabs at his crotch with a towel. Mary's Mom and Dad are
out front along with two FIRETRUCKS, four POLICE CARS, and a crowd
of about thirty NEIGHBORS.

                        PARAMEDIC
                 (to Mary)
           Keep pressure on it!

Mary does as she's told.

                        MARY
                 (running along)
           Ted, I'm so sorry. Are you going to be
           okay?

                        TED

He gives her two thumbs up as they slide him into the ambulance.

INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - PRESENT DAY

Ted, now in his 30's, lays on his therapist's couch.

                        TED
           ...Anyway, school ended a few days later
           and that July her father got transferred to
           Florida.

The CAMERA PANS up to reveal that the CHAIR BEHIND HIM IS EMPTY.
Ted has been telling all this to no one.

                        TED (cont'd)
           It took me half the summer to pay off all
           those bets.
                 (sighs)
           I never did see Mary again. That was about
           twelve years ago.

Just then the door quietly opens and Ted's PSYCHIATRIST tip-toes
back into the room and takes his seat. (He has a dab of mustard on
his chin and has forgotten about the cloth napkin tucked into his
collar.)

                        PSYCHIATRIST
           Uh-huh. Interesting.

The Psychiatrist notices the napkin and quickly wipes his chin,
then tosses it aside.

                        TED
           Anyway, it's not something you exactly
           forget about, but I guess I must've blocked
           it out of my head. Then about a week ago
           I'm driving on the highway and I got to
           thinking about Mary and suddenly I couldn't
           breathe...I couldn't keep up with the flow
           of traffic anymore I felt like I was
           going to die. I pulled into a rest area,
           parked the car, and just started shaking.

The Psychiatrist scratches his chin.

                        PSYCHIATRIST
           You know...rest areas are homosexual
           hang-outs.

                        TED
           Huh?

                        PSYCHIATRIST
           Highway rest areas--they're the bathhouses
           of the nineties for some gay men.

Ted thinks about this, then glances back at the shrink.

                        TED
           What are you saying?

                        PSYCHIATRIST
                 (checking wristwatch)
           Oops, time's up. We'll have to delve into
           that next week.

EXT. DRIVING RANGE - DAY

Ted and his friend DOM are blasting a couple buckets.

                        DOM
           Gay? He said you were gay?

                        TED
           He implied it.

                        DOM
           Well you're a writer, and a lot of
           writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.

                        TED
           Yeah, but he was successful.

                        DOM
           Let me ask you this: When you smoke a
           cigar, do you ever pretend it has balls?

Ted appears to think about this.

                        TED
           Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.

                        DOM
           I'm going to fix you up with my new
           assistant.

                        TED
           What's he like?

Dom LAUGHS, then watches as Ted hits a ball.

                        DOM
           You're leaving it out. Finish your swing.
                 (beat)
           You're going to like this one--she's half
           Asian, half American.

                        TED
           Good-looking?

                        DOM
           I just told you, she's half Asian. half
           American. They're all good looking. You
           could mate Don Rickles and Yoko Ono and
           they're going to have a gorgeous kid. It's
           a foolproof combo.

Ted thinks about it.

                        TED
           What's the point? Let's face it, Dom, I'm
           in a slump.
                 (SIGHS)
           Lately I've been feeling like...well...like
           a loser.

                        DOM
           Loser? You?

Ted shrugs.

                        DOM (cont'd)
           Give me a break. Remember five years ago,
           when your kidneys failed? If you were a
           loser would they have been able to find a
           donor with an exact tissue match? What are
           the odds of that, one in a million?

                        TED
           Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got
           killed in an explosion?

                        DOM
           I never said that. I'm saying your lucky
           those kids found his kidneys.
                 (beat)
           Besides, your brother Jimmy never gave a
           shit about you.

Ted gives him a look.

                        DOM (cont'd)
           You know, you're a real glass-is-half-empty
           guy. You got a fucking guardian angel, man.

Ted manages a small smile. Just then, Ted's cell phone RINGS.

                        TED
           I gotta take this, it might be my boss.
                 (flips phone open)
           Ted here.

                        GARBLED VOICE
                 (on phone)
           You're a cocksucking motherfucking piece of
           puke!

Whoever it is HANGS UP. Without reacting, Ted closes the phone and
puts it back in his pocket.

           Yep.

EXT. DOM'S HOUSE - DAY

Dom and Ted are drinking beer while sitting on Dom's front steps.
We see signs of kids everywhere: a tricycle, six-foot basketball
hoop, dolls, etc.

DOM'S WIFE comes out and hands them each a cigar.

                        DOM'S WIFE
           I thought you guys might like these with
           your beers.

                        DOM
           Thanks, baby.

She goes back inside.

                        TED
           See, that's what I want. I don't need these
           bimbettes you got me chasing. I want what
           you have. A family....Someone to...you
           know...love.

These guys don't usually talk about this crap, and Ted gets a
little embarrassed.

                        TED (cont'd)
           It must be great with a wife like that.

                        DOM
           Each day is better than the next.
                 (beat)
           Have you ever been, you know...in love with
           someone?

                        TED
           Nah.

                        DOM
           Never?

                        TED
           Well once. Mary.

Dom SIGHS.

                        DOM
           Mary again.

                        TED
           Look, I admit it was brief, but it was
           definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve
           years.

                        DOM
           Whatever happened to Mary?

                        TED
           I told you, her family moved to Miami.

                        DOM
           I mean since then.

                        TED
           I don't know.

                        DOM
           Well why don't you look her up?

                        TED
                 (sarcastic)
           Yeah, right.

                        DOM
           Why not?

                        TED
           Because I guarantee she's married and has a
           couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay
           single.

                        DOM
           What if you're wrong? You just said she's
           the only girl you ever loved, what have you
           got to lose by calling her?

                        TED
           I did try calling her.
                 (sheepish)
           A few years ago. She wasn't listed.

                        DOM
           So that was it? One bump in the road and
           you gave up?

                        TED
           I also called Unsolved Mysteries.

                        DOM
           You're kidding? What did they say?

                        TED
           They told me they don't help out stalkers.
                 (beat)
           Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long
           time.

                        DOM
           I got it--you hire a private eye, fly him
           out there, he follows her around a couple
           days, she'll never know a thing.

Ted considers this.

                        TED
           No. No fucking way. That's too creepy.

Dom thinks a moment, then SNAPS his fingers.

                        DOM
           Wait a second. There's a guy named Healy in
           my office who might be able to help you
           out. He's a claims investigator and he goes
           to Miami every couple weeks.

As Ted thinks about this, we

ESTABLISHING SHOT of a big insurance company - MORNING

INT. PROVIDENCE UNION INSURANCE COMPANY - HALLWAY - MORNING

Ted and Dom are walking down a hallway.

                        TED
           I don't know about this, Dom.

                        DOM
           Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple
           years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston
           office; some bullshit about padding his
           resume--like we haven't all done that.
           Anyway, they were going to let him go but
           his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that
           ended up on my desk.

                        TED
           His mother?

                        DOM
           Yeah, I guess he still lives with her.
           Seemed like a sweet lady--got diabetes or
           something--so I went out on a limb and got
           him transferred down to Providence.

                        TED
           And you think he could find out her number
           for me?

                        DOM
           He'll do better than that. I'll send him
           down to Miami on business, you throw him a
           couple bucks on the side, and he'll track
           her down.

Ted thinks about this.

                        DOM (cont'd)

INT. HEALY'S CUBICLE - MORNING

Ted is seated inside a small cubicle across the desk from PATRICK
HEALY, a shaggy-looking guy in a mis-matched three-piece suit.
Healy looks more like a used-car salesman than an insurance
investigator.

                        HEALY
           So, Dom tells me you're looking for some
           lady-friend you knew in high school.

                        TED
           Uh-huh.

                        HEALY
           Any idea where I might start looking?

                        TED
           She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago.
           I checked directory assistance down there
           and she's not listed. She might've moved
           ten times since then.

                        HEALY
                 (skeptical)
           All you want is a phone number?

                        TED
           Well, I know you're busy

                        HEALY
           Don't play games with me, Ted.

                        TED
           I don't know, maybe you could poke around
           for a half day and see if she has five kids
           and a Labrador.

                        HEALY
           I don't buy it.

                        TED
           You don't buy what?

Suddenly Healy is in his face.

                        HEALY
           Ted, I'm the kind of guy who shoots from
           the hip. Now I want you to level with me:
           Did you knock this skirt up?

                        TED
                 (indignant)
           No.

                        HEALY
           She's blackmailing you, right?

                        TED
                 (more indignant)
           No.

                        HEALY
           You want her dead, don't you?

                        TED
           You can't be serious.

                        HEALY
           Do you really expect me to believe this is
           a straight stalker case?

                        TED
           I'm not a stalker ! She's a friend of mine.

                        HEALY
           Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted
           number and you haven't heard squat from her
           in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted.
           You're a real piece of work.

           I get one hundred a day plus expenses.

                        TED
                 (LAUGHS at Healy's nerve)
           You get fifty a day, period. It's a
           business trip, they'll pay for your
           expenses.

Healy thinks about it. 

                        HEALY
           Okay, Ted, I'll do it. But if this chick
           turns up with a toe tag, I'm rolling over
           on you.

DANE in the back SCREECHES to a halt in front of him. The driver,
SULLY, is a muscular, well-groomed man in his thirties.

The dog is catching wind in the backseat and Sully hands Healy a
packet.

                        SULLY
           Here's the info you asked for.

                        HEALY
           Thanks.

                        SULLY
           You should thank me--that girl was not easy
           to find. What'd she scam you out of-some
           insurance dough?

                        HEALY
           Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track
           down his high school girlfriend.

                        SULLY
           Stalker, huh?

           Big time.

INT. SULLY'S APARTMENT - DAY

This place is modest and clean but it has a direct view of South
Beach. Healy puts his bags down and looks around.

                        HEALY
           Very nice.

                        SULLY
           I'm doing okay.
                 (checks watch)
           I gotta get ready for work.

Sully ducks into the bedroom and Healy looks around the apartment.

                        HEALY
           Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels?
           Looks like you really cleaned up your act.

                        SULLY (O.S.)
           What can I tell you? It's a healthier
           lifestyle down here, and it's easier to
           succeed when your head's clear. Those guys
           I worked with back in Boston, they were a
           bad influence.

                        HEALY
           Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go
           grab a couple drinks.

                        SULLY (O.S.)
           Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.

                        HEALY
           Yeah, and you don't drink any less, right?

Suddenly a huge Boa Constrictor slithers up on Healy's lap.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           What the...?!

Sully comes back in the room wearing a police uniform.

                        SULLY
           Take it easy, that's Bill.

                        HEALY
           Tell Bill to get the fuck off!

                        SULLY
                 (smiling)
           Relax, he just ate.

Healy just stares at his friend.

                 (proudly)
           Nineteen months I been sober.

           What are you talking about? You were never
           an alky, you were a cokehead.

                        SULLY
           Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta
           quit the booze, too.

                        HEALY
           Is that right? Well good for you, Sull, I'm
           proud of you.

Healy pops open one of his beers and hands it to Sully.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           Here, just have one of these then.

                        SULLY
           Healy, what I just tell you?

                        HEALY
           This is a light beer. You can't have a
           light beer?

                        SULLY
           No I can't.

Healy stares at him, baffled.

                        HEALY
           Sully, it's one fuckin' beer for Christ
           sakes.
                 (holds up beer)
           Ooh, the big bad beer's gonna get ya.

Sully stares at the beer, weakening.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           I'm worried about you, man. You better
           learn to have a pop once in a while or
           you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're
           being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.

                        SULLY
           Am I?

                        HEALY
           Bet your ass you are. Now I don't want to
           hear anymore of your happy horseshit. You
           gotta learn how to bend a little or believe
           me...you're gonna break.

Finally, Sully takes the beer. He stares at it a moment and then
sips.

                        SULLY
           Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't
           even taste good to me anymore.

                        HEALY
           Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are
           you, spotting?

Healy takes the beer from Sully and as he chugs it, we

INT. CHRYSLER LEBARON - DAWN

Healy is on a stakeout. He's dozing. He's been here for hours,
food wrappers litter Sully's car. He's wearing Walkman-type
HEADPHONES which are connected to a RADIO SURVEILLANCE MICROPHONE
attached to a pair of BINOCULARS.

Suddenly MUSIC explodes through his headphones--Healy's jolted
awake. Who threw the grenade? Recovering, Healy aims the
binoculars toward...

HEALY'S POV - MARY'S APARTMENT ACROSS THE STREET

Healy has a clear, unobstructed view into Mary's apartment. The
music is coming from Mary's clock radio. MARY sits up in bed and
shakes herself awake, like someone's just poured cold water over
her. She cranks the music even LOUDER. Mary hops out of bed,
wearing only her panties, and though she's a little older now, she
still looks well cast.

CLOSE UP - ON HEALY - he's become extremely interested in his
work. As much as Healy's enjoying the show, he's got a job to
do--he speaks into a MICRO-CASSETTE RECORDER:

                        HEALY
                 (into recorder)
           Okay, Ted, I found your Mary. Her current
           address, two-niner-eight Euclid Avenue,
           Miami Beach. Husband, negative. Children
           and Labrador, negative. Extremely nice ass,
           affirmative.

INT. MARY'S APT. - DAY

Mary walks into the living room where we see an old woman, MAGDA,
sitting on the couch LISTENING to a stack of RADIO SCANNERS.

                        MARY
           Have you been up all night again?

                        MAGDA
           Bet your ass I have. It's an important job,
           Neighborhood Watch is.

                        MARY
           Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call
           listening in on stranger's phone
           conversations?

                        MAGDA
           These ain't strangers, they're neighbors.
           This only picks up signals in a half-mile
           radius.

                        MARY
           Meaning?

                        MAGDA
           Meaning these are the people you live
           amongst, you got a right to know if they're
           creeps. For instance, did you know there's
           a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?

                 (feigning shock)
           You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta
           move.

                        MAGDA 
           I confirmed it on the scanner. I knew
           something was up because Puffy used to bark
           like hell whenever he saw him and you know
           Puffy only barks at bad people.

Magda pats her little dog PUFFY on the head.

                        MARY
           Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.

                        MAGDA
           That's because there's a lot of bad people
           out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you
           about that Steve guy you was seeing--he was
           a fucking asswipe--but you had to find out
           for yourself, didn't you?

                        MARY
           Okay, you win. Now try to get some sleep,
           huh.

Mary gives Magda a kiss and heads to her bedroom.

                                                       CUT TO:

MUSIC MONTAGE - as Healy follows Mary around town.

EXT. EUCLID AVENUE - MORNING

Mary exits her apartment and bounces out into the world. There is
a HOMELESS MAN sitting on the sidewalk. Mary flips him an apple,
then jumps in her Honda Civic and drives off.

EXT. DRIVING RANGE - MORNING

Mary is at the range HITTING a couple buckets of balls.

ON HEALY - watching from the parking lot.

                        HEALY
                 (into mic)
           Looks like we got an athlete on our hands.

EXT. MACDONALD'S DRIVE-THRU WINDOW - MORNING

Mary waits in the drive-thru lane reading the SPORTS PAGE. Finally
the window opens and she is handed a HUGE BAG OF FOOD.

PAN TO Healy watching from his car.

                        HEALY
                 (into mic)
           Well, from her figure and her appetite, I'm
           guessing she's either got a bowel disorder
           or we've got a hurler on our hands.

EXT. SPECIAL ED. CENTER - MORNING

Mary's brother Warren is wearing a walkman as he plays catch out
front with a SPECIAL ED TEACHER while several other
MENTALLY-DISABLED PATIENTS entertain themselves.

Mary pulls up, gets out, and starts handing out Egg McMuffins.

                        MARY
           Get in line. One at a time.

A fat patient, GARY, approaches.

                        GARY
           Can I have two, Mary?

                        MARY
           Yeah, you can have two halves, just like
           everyone else.

                        GARY
           Thanks.

Gary takes his and walks off. A couple more patients and then
bucktoothed FREDDIE steps up to her.

                        FREDDIE
           Will you marry me, Mary?

                        MARY
           Oh yeah, pretty boy? And what about
           Dolores?

Mary points to another PATIENT staring bashfully at Freddie.

                        FREDDIE
           Would you marry us both, Mary?

                        MARY
           Yeah, that'd be a good deal for you,
           wouldn't it?

Freddie moves off and fat Gary is back, trying to be
inconspicuous.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           Wow, this is weird. There was somebody who
           looked just like you here a minute ago.

Mary smiles and hands Gary another McMuffin.

CLOSE ON Healy.

                        HEALY
                 (into mic)
           Ixnay on the big appetite.
                 (beat)
           She's just got a big heart.

EXT. BEACH BAR - DAY

Neighborhood restaurant and bar. After-work crowd. Mary and her
friends, BRENDA, LISA, and JOANIE are sitting at a table under an
umbrella. Lisa reads from the PERSONALS COLUMN in South Beach
Magazine.

                        LISA
           Listen to this one--'Seeking sensitive Wasp
           doctor to share candlelit dinners, long
           walks in Coconut Grove, marriage.'

                        BRENDA
           What does this girl want, a corpse? You
           gotta be more specific: 'Seeking deaf mute
           with three pound cock and trust fund.'

                        JOANIE
           No, it should be 'a hockey player with
           great pecs.'

                        MARY
           Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those
           guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana
           hammock.

PAN TO the bar where we see Healy eavesdropping on their
conversation.

                        BRENDA (O.S.)
                 (to Mary)
           I suppose you wouldn't like someone with a
           washboard stomach like Brad Pitt?

BACK ON Mary and friends.

                        MARY
           I'm just saying I don't mind a guy with a
           bit of a beer belly. It means he's a guy.
           You can have those pretty boys who hang out
           in a gym all day staring at their
           reflections.

ON HEALY 
                        HEALY
                 (quietly into mic)
           A girl after your own heart, Ted.

BACK ON Mary and friends.

                        JOANIE
           I can live with those reflections.

                        MARY 
           I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies.
           Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer
           and playing thirty-six holes and still has
           enough energy to take me and Warren out to
           a ballgame.

                        JOANIE
                 (sarcastic)
           Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going
           to find a guy like that.

                        MARY
           But here's the rub. The guy I'm talking
           about has got to be self-employed.

                        LISA
           You mean, like an architect or something?

                        MARY
           Architect, yeah.

BRENDA You mean creative, but not poor.

                        MARY
           No, it's not the money. Creative, yeah,
           that's good, but it's the freedom I'm
           talking about. See, this guy has to have a
           job he could do anywhere. That way we could
           just up and leave at the drop of a hat.

                        LISA
           And where would you and your beer-bellied
           architect be leaving to?

                        MARY
           I don't know. The Super Bowl, New Orleans
           Jazz Festival...maybe a couple months in
           Nepal.

                        JOANIE
           Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy
           halfway to Katmandu.

                        MARY
           What's that supposed to mean?

                        JOANIE
           It means you're too hard on guys.

                        MARY
           No I'm not.

                        JOANIE
           Oh come off it, Mare. What about
           what's-his-name...Steverino? You could've
           at least passed the baton on that one.

The girls LAUGH.

                        MARY
           Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for
           awhile.

                        JOANIE
           All right for awhile? The guy's
           good-looking, rich, witty. He was a god.

                        LISA
           At one point you were talking about
           marrying him. Come on, why'd you dump him?

Mary thinks about this.

                        MARY
           I don't know, it was complicated. He's in
           San Francisco, I'm in Miami.
                 (dodging question)
           Besides, Magda's psychic dog hated him.

                        JOANIE
           Is that old crab still with you? Mary, you
           said you were putting her up for a
           month--it's been a year and a half.

                        MARY
           Ah, she's okay.

                        LISA
           Mary, cut the crap, what really happened
           with Steve?

                        MARY
           Nothing. I mean, you know my brother.
                 (sighs)
           Warren.

                        JOANIE
           What? Steve seemed to put up with Warren.

                        MARY
           I don't want someone who'll put up with
           him. I want someone who will enjoy him, the
           way I do. Do you know what he told my
           friend Tucker? He said he would've popped
           the question a lot earlier if Warren wasn't
           in my life.
                 (beat)
           Well he is in my life and I'm goddamn
           lucky to have him. The hell with Steve.

Everyone is touched by this. Then:

                        BRENDA
           Well, that's the last time I blow him
           behind your back.

As the girls LAUGH, we

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. MARY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Healy sits out front in his car again waiting for Mary to get
home. He picks up the phone, dials a number, and someone answers
but doesn't speak.

                        HEALY
           Hello...? Sully...?
                 (beat)
           Sully, that you?

                        SULLY (V.O.)
                 (over phone)
           Who the fuck is it to you?

                        HEALY
           Sully, it's Healy. What's going on over
           there?

INT. SULLY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Sully is sitting on the kitchen floor in his police uniform, a
ring of white around his nostrils. The room is littered with beer
cans, he has another one in his hand, there's a pile of cocaine
and a rolled-up bill on the breakfast table. The dog and the snake
are in the doorway looking at him with concern.

                        SULLY
                 (into phone, sloshed)
           Fuckin' Patrick Healy, you think your shit
           don't stink. Well I got news for
           you--you're goddamn right it don't! How the
           hell are ya?!

INT. HEALY'S CAR - NIGHT

Healy looks at the phone, concerned.

                        HEALY
           Uh, I'm fine. Just wanted to let you know
           I'll have your car back in a couple hours,
           I'm still staking out this girl's
           apartment.

                        SULLY (V.O.)
           You found my car?!

Just then Healy notices Mary pull up and park. He slides down in
his seat.

ON MARY - she gets out carrying a bag and approaches the
Homeless Man, who is still sitting on the sidewalk. She hands him
the bag.

                        HOMELESS MAN
           Thanks, Mary.

                        MARY
           You watch out for yourself, Herb.

As Mary bounds up the steps of her building, we

HOLD ON the Homeless Man as he happily takes a sandwich and soda
out of the bag.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

As Mary rushes into the apartment, Magda is glued to her radio
scanner, listening intently.

                        MAGDA
           Jesus, Mary, you gotta hear this--some
           cop's staking out this broad's apartment.

                        MARY
           No time, Magda, my show's starting.

BACK ON HEALY...

... he can hear the conversation through the SURVEILLANCE EQUIPMENT
pointed at Mary's place.

                        MAGDA (V.O.)
           This is a good one, Mare. Sounds like his
           partner's all lubed up.

                        HEALY
                 (quietly into phone)
           Call you back.

                        SULLY
                 (over phone)
           God, I miss ya, ya fuck-

Healy hangs up abruptly.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

                        MAGDA
           Ah, Christ, I lost 'em.

Mary runs into her bedroom, shuts the door and flips on the tube
just as ESPN Sportscenter's OPENING THEME SONG is playing.
Relieved, Mary lays back on her bed and starts watching.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MARY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Mary is now watching Andy Griffith while SMOKING A JOINT and
GIGGLING away in bed.

ON HEALY - he's sitting in his car, GIGGLING, too.

                        HEALY
           Fucking Barney...he never learns...

INT. MARY'S ROOM - NIGHT

As the show's end credits start to WHISTLE AWAY, Mary stands and
starts to UNDRESS for bed.

BACK ON HEALY - he sits up, very interested now.

                        HEALY
                 (into mic)
           Here we go, Teddo. Here comes the money
           shot.

Healy quickly reaches in the back seat and pulls out a bigger,
MORE POWERFUL PAIR OF BINOCULARS.

HEALY'S BINOCULAR POV - we're CLOSE ON the wrinkliest,
saggiest, droopiest set of milkbags on the planet.

ON HEALY - he cringes.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           Oooof. First chink in the armor, Teddy
           Boy....

HEALY'S BINOCULAR POV - He moves his view up from the tits to
reveal...MAGDA UNDRESSING for bed.

ON HEALY - He flinches, sickened by his mistake, then
repositions the binoculars dead left to the next window.

HEALY'S BINOCULAR POV - moving over to the next window we see...
Mary as she just finishes putting on some sexy t-shirt.

ON HEALY - as he starts to drool.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           Oh sweet Jesus

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. PROVIDENCE - THE HOT CLUB - DAY

Ted is sitting alone having a beer when a smiling Healy
approaches.

                        HEALY
           I've got some very, very good news for you,
           my friend.

                        TED
           Really?
                 (perking up)
           Very, very?

Healy sits down and motions for a beer.

                        HEALY
           I think your life's about to change.

                        TED
           So you found Mary?

                        HEALY
           Right there in Liberty City. And you were
           right, she's really something.

                        TED
                 (smiles)
           So she hasn't changed?

                        HEALY
           That I couldn't. say. Let me ask you
           something: Was she a little big-boned
           in high school?

                        TED
           No, not at all.

                        HEALY
           Well she must've packed on a few pounds
           over the years.

This doesn't dampen Ted's enthusiasm.

                        TED
           Mary's a little chubby, huh?

                        HEALY
           I'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half.
           Not bad.

Ted's smile starts to fade.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           But you know, you shit out a bunch of kids,
           you're going to put on a few pounds.

                        TED
           So she's married?

                        HEALY
           Nope. Never been.

                        TED
           Huh?

                        HEALY
           Four kids, three different guys.

                        TED
           Three different guys?

                        HEALY
           Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two
           whites, and a midget.

                        TED
           Oh my.

                        HEALY
           Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to
           keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.

                        TED
           She's in a wheelchair?!

Ted looks completely drained.

                        HEALY
           Don't look so shocked, it's been a long
           time. I bet you've changed a lot over the
           last twelve years, haven't you?

                        TED
                 (shrugs)
           It's just that...Mary. I wouldn't have
           thought...

                        HEALY
           Anyway, the good news is I have all the
           information you need. Got it from her
           bookie--nice guy. You should definitely
           call her, Ted. I mean she's a real
           sparkplug, that one. She seems determined
           to get those rugrats off welfare and with
           your help I'll bet she does it.

Ted stands and starts moping away.

                        TED
           Thanks, Healy. Good work.

                        HEALY
           Ted? Don't you want the name of the
           housing project?

                        TED
           Uh, that's okay.

                        HEALY
           You sure, big guy? I'll bet she'd love to
           hear from you before her mastectomy!

As Ted leaves, Healy puts his feet up on the table and sits back.

INT. TED'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

We PAN across the room of unopened boxes to Ted laying awake in
bed. We hear HEAD-BANGER MUSIC coming from the apartment next
door. Finally Ted gets up and walks over to his dresser. As he
flips on a small light we see loose change, a balled-up Kleenex, a
few golf tees, and Ted's wallet. Ted picks up the wallet and opens
it.

TED'S POV - Inside is an an old high school photo of a smiling
Mary.

As Ted looks at it, he can't help but smile, too.

INT. PROVIDENCE UNION INSURANCE COMPANY - DAY

ON HEALY'S CUBICLE - Healy's taking his last boxload of crap out
of his cubicle when he spots Ted. He tries to duck back in but
Ted sees him. Healy forces a smile as Ted approaches.

                        TED
           What are you doing?

                        HEALY
           Oh, uh, I resigned.

Ted picks up a plane ticket off the desk.

                        TED
           Miami?

                        HEALY
           Yeah, this insurance business is too slow
           for me. I'm going to go down and try my
           hand at jai alai.

                        TED
           Jai alai?

                        HEALY
           Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at
           home in the fronton.

Healy starts walking out of the office and Ted follows. Healy is
having a hard time looking him in the eye. So he doesn't.

                        TED
           Look, uh, I've been thinking about
           everything you told me. 

                        HEALY
           Good good.

                        TED
           Well I think you're right, I should look 
           her up.

           Rollerpig? Are you nuts?

           But you said she was a sparkplug...?

                        HEALY
           I said buttplug. She's heinous.

Ted SIGHS and follows Healy out the front door.

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

They walk across the lot toward Healy's car.

                        TED
           All the same, I still want to call her. I
           know it sounds crazy--Mary sure has a lot
           of troubles in her life--but, I don't know,
           maybe I can help her out.
                 (sighs)
           The poor thing's had it tough--she's in a
           wheelchair for Godsakes.

                        HEALY
           It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal.

                        TED
           Oh. I thought
                 (beat)
           That's not it anyway. I know this doesn't
           make any sense to you, but I just can't
           turn it off that fast. I still feel
           something for her.

Healy comes to his car and puts his stuff in the trunk.

                        HEALY
           Okay, tell you what: I'll get her number
           for you just as soon as she gets back from
           Japan.

                        TED
           Japan? What's she doing in Japan?

                        HEALY
           You've heard of mail-order brides? Well
           they go that way, too.

Ted is devastated. 

                        TED
           Mary's a mail-order bride?

                        HEALY
           Fetched a pretty penny, too. Don't forget,
           it's the Sumo culture, they pay by the
           pound there. Sort of like tuna.

Off Ted's look, we

EXT. THE HOT CLUB - DAY

Ted and Dom are having a beer and a dog.

                        TED
           That's it, I'm making an oath. I'll never
           procrastinate about anything again. Life is
           too fucking short. 

                        DOM
           Hey, look on the bright side--

                        TED
                 (interrupting)
           What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?

                        DOM
           Well...at least now you know.

                        TED
           I think it was better when I didn't. It was
           kind of inspiring to know there was someone
           so pure in the world.

As Ted dwells on this, Dom bursts out LAUGHING.

                        TED
           What's so funny?

                        DOM
           I'm sorry, it's just that you're taking
           this all wrong, pal. Don't you see? You're
           liberated. I feel liberated. I mean here
           you've been in therapy thinking you blew it
           with the greatest girl ever, and it turns
           out that getting your dick stuck in your
           zipper was the best thing that ever
           happened to you! 

Ted flinches at this.

                        TED
           Wait a second, I never told you that.

                        DOM
           Christ, Ted, I was only four towns away. 

Ted thinks it over.

                        TED
           Maybe you're right. I should look on the
           bright side. I mean, I've still got my
           health...

           I'm out of here. I've got to get up at six

           What? On your day off? Do you even know
           the guy?

                        TED
           Never met him.

                        DOM
           Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn
           novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.

EXT. MIAMI - DRIVING RANGE - DAY

Healy pays for a bucket of balls, then takes his clubs and strolls
jauntily to...

A GOLF TEE NEXT TO MARY'S 
Healy places a ball on the tee and takes a swing. He tops the ball
and it dribbles about ten yards.

                        HEALY
           Hit a house! Bite bite!
                 (to Mary)
           Haven't swung the wrenches in a while.

Mary nods. Healy takes another swing and duck-hooks one about
fifty yards. Mary addresses her ball, takes a smooth backswing,
and

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           Hey, can you give me some tips here?

She cracks her shot long and straight.

                        MARY
           Yeah, don't talk in someone's backswing.

                        HEALY
           Thanks.

Mary tees up another ball and Healy puts down his club.

                        HEALY (cont'd) 
           I'm gonna get a soda, you want one?

                        MARY
                 (annoyed)
           No thanks.

Healy pulls out a huge wad of change from his pocket.

                        HEALY
           Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar?
           All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins.

                        MARY
                 (interested)
           Nepal? Have you been?

                        HEALY
           Not in months. I don't even know why I
           bought the damn place.

                        MARY
           You own a home there?

                        HEALY
           Well...it's just a condo really. Right
           outside Katmandu.

                        MARY
           Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to
           go. Is it true the mountains are so tall
           you can't see the tops?

                        HEALY
           Not 'til you get about three hundred yards
           from the summit. That's been my experience
           anyway.

She looks impressed. Healy looks at his watch. 

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           You know, I should just get going. I'll
           work on my game next week.

He flips her a coin.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           Here. Spend it on your trip to Katmandu.

                        MARY
                 (smiles)
           Thanks.

Healy starts to walk off. Mary doesn't know what to do. Will she
ever see this guy again?

                        MARY (cont'd)
                 (CALLS after him)
           It was nice meeting you!

Healy doesn't answer or turn around. He just raises his hand and
gives her a little wave.

Mary shrugs her shoulders. Oh well...

EXT. DRIVING RANGE PARKING LOT - DAY

Healy is sitting in Sully's Chrysler LeBaron, right next to Mary's
Honda Civic.

He watches the rear-view mirror, and the moment he sees Mary
coming out from the driving range, he swings his legs out the door
and starts changing out of his golf shoes. As Mary tosses her
golf bag into the trunk, she notices Healy tying his shoes. A
second chance.

                        MARY
           Well, it was nice meeting you, again.

                        HEALY
           Same here again.

                        MARY
           By the way, what's your name?

                        HEALY
           Pat Healy.

There's an uncomfortable pause...Why doesn't this guy ask the
usual questions?

                        MARY
           Don't you want to know my name?

                        HEALY
           I already know it, Mary.

                        MARY
                 (surprised)
           How'd you know that?

                        HEALY
           It's right there on your golf bag.

Healy opens the back door to put away his golf shoes. Suddenly,
rolls and rolls of paper come tumbling out. Mary bends over to
help Healy pick them up.

                        MARY
           What are you doing with all these
           blueprints?

                        HEALY
           Some buildings I'm working on.

                        MARY
           Are you...an architect?

                        HEALY
           Well, just until I get my PGA Tour card.

Mary stares at him, mouth agape.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           I'm kidding. Yeah, I guess you could call
           me an architect--it's just a job really, a
           way to keep me moving. My real passion is
           my hobby.

                        MARY
           What's that?

                        HEALY

           clothesline runners for the backyard. He's
           got plenty of room out there to dig. The

           From high school Mary? Yeah, I saw her
           about six months ago at a convention in Las
           Vegas.

Ted sits up.

                        TED
           A convention? How'd you see her at a
           convention?

           I'm an orthopedic surgeon, she's an

The Doc SIGHS, still able to recall the feeling.

A buckled-over Ted limps into Dom's office with a crazed look on
his face.

                        TED
           Mary's a babe!

                        DOM
           What?

                        TED
           My Mary--she's not in Japan, she's single,
           and she's got no rugrats. She does have a
           little gambling problem, she plays the
           football cards a bit too much, but she's a
           babe, a surgeon babe!

                        DOM
           Huh? But why did Healy?

                        TED
           Well think about it.

Ted folds his arms.

Dom shakes his head. Then:

           Well then you've got to call her, man.

                        TED

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

While Mary gets ready for her date, Magda sits in front of the
radio scanner in her bathrobe with her little dog Puffy on her
lap.

                        MAGDA
           So who's the lucky guy?

                        MARY
           Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving
           range.

                        MAGDA
           Good lookin'?

                        MARY
           He's no Steve Young.

INT. HEALY'S CAR - NIGHT 69

Healy, listening through his headphones, reacts to this.

                        MAGDA (V.O.)
           What's he like?

                        MARY (V.O.)
           I don't know. He's kind of a mook.

                        MAGDA (V.O.)
           What's a mook?

                        MARY (V.O.)
           You know, a mookalone, a schlep.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

                        MAGDA
           Then why you going out with him if he's a
           schlep?

                        MARY
           Come on, Magda
                 (SIGHS)
           It's like that movie Harold and Maude.

                        MAGDA
           I don't watch the new ones.

                        MARY
           This one's almost thirty years old. It's
           about a young kid and an old lady who fall
           in love.

                        MAGDA
           That's exactly why I don't watch 'em
           anymore--it's bullshit! Why the hell would
           an old lady go for a young kid?

Mary smiles at this.

                        MARY
           The point is, love isn't about money or
           social standing or age, it's about
           connecting with someone, having things in
           common kindred spirits.

                        MAGDA
           Fuck kindred spirits. My little Puffy
           here's gonna tell you all you need to know
           about this guy in about two seconds flat.
           If he starts yapping, he's a loser; if
           Puffy's relaxed...well, you got yourself a
           keeper.

INT. HEALY'S CAR - NIGHT

As Healy thinks about this, we

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. MARY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Healy enters the building.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Healy tiptoes up to Mary's apartment door. He peeks through the
mail slot.

HEALY'S POV - Puffy is staring at him and GROWLING.

Healy reaches in his pocket, pulls out a VALIUM and a DOGGY TREAT.
Healy shoves the pill into the treat's soft center, examines it,
then thinks what the hell and SHOVES IN ANOTHER ONE.

Puffy GROWLS LOUDER. Healy pops the treat through the mail slot
and listens as the dog DEVOURS IT. Healy looks at his watch, then
sneaks back outside to wait a few minutes for the drugs to kick
in.

                                                       CUT TO:

INT. MARY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Healy is sitting on Mary's couch with Puffy spread-eagled
upside-down on his lap, KNOCKED OUT COLD. Mary and Magda look on
in amazement.

                        HEALY
                 (baby talk)
           Oh, Pufferball likes his little tum-tum
           rubbed, doesn't he now?

                        MARY
           Wow, I've never seen him like this. He
           doesn't usually like guys.

                        MAGDA
           You mean he doesn't like bad guys.

                        HEALY
           'That right?

                        MAGDA
           He can tell you're an animal nut. You are,
           aren't ya?

                        HEALY
           Truth is I usually get along better with
           animals than with people. In Nepal the
           villagers call me 'Kin-tan-tee', which
           means 'man who is loved by many animals...
                 (babbling)
           ...who love him a lot, too...and so on.'

Magda stares dreamily at Healy, smitten.

                        MAGDA
           Would you like a glass of tea or something?

                        HEALY
           You got a brew?

                        MARY
           Sure.
                 (noticing Magda's trance)
           Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more
           cheese and crackers...?

                        MAGDA
           Oh, yeah, of course, dear.

The two women go into the kitchen and Healy is left to pet the
MOTIONLESS DOG. Suddenly Healy notices that the dog is A LITTLE
TOO MOTIONLESS. Healy checks Puffy's pulse. He looks at his watch
to time the rate.

                        MARY (O.S.)
                 (CALLING out)
           Sorry, Pat, out of beer. You like vodka?

                        HEALY
                 (CALLING out)
           Great.

He starts SHAKING THE DOG, but Puffy doesn't move. Healy goes into
action. He starts pressing on his heart, PERFORMING DOGGIE CPR.
One-and-two-and-three, he continues trying to revive him.

                        MAGDA (O.S.)
                 (CALLING out)
           Would you like a little clam-dip, honey?

                        HEALY
                 (CALLING out)
           No, thanks.
                 (panicking)
           Love a little bundt cake if you have some!

INT. MARY'S KITCHEN - SAME

Magda and Mary are on their way out the door when they stop.

                        MAGDA
           Bundt cake?

                        MARY
                 (shrugs)
           Must have a sweet tooth. See if you can
           find some cookies.

As Magda starts to go through the cupboards...

INT. MARY'S FAMILY ROOM - SAME

A panicked Healy is giving the little mutt MOUTH-TO-MOUTH now.
Then back to the heart, the mouth, the heart, the mouth....

                        HEALY
                 (quietly, desperately, to Puffy)
           Come on, man, stay away from the light!

Healy resumes blowing into the dog's snout, pumping his chest,
with no results. Desperate, he picks up the cheese knife and
quickly SLICES THE WIRES ON TWO TABLE LAMPS.

Healy grabs the two wires and TOUCHES THEM TOGETHER LIKE A
DEFIBRILLATOR on the little pooch's chest.

ZZZZZTTTTTT - the dog BOUNCES a couple feet off the couch as
SPARKS FLY.

Healy takes his pulse again. Nothing. He ZAPS him once more with
the LIVE WIRES.

ZZZZZTTTTT - Still nothing. Healy gets to his feet and peeks
into the kitchen. When he turns his back, we see PUFFY IGNITE IN
FLAMES.

When Healy turns back, he's horrified at what he sees. He grabs a
vase of flowers and POURS THE WATER ON THE BURNING DOG.

With this, Puffy flinches and comes to, GASPING FOR AIR!

                        MAGDA
           All I had was some Funny Bones--how does
           that sound, honey?

Healy picks up the stunned pooch and swaddles it in a blanket as
Magda ENTERS the room followed by Mary.

                        HEALY
                 (petting dog)
           Fine. Fine.

                        MARY
           Here you go.
                 (sniffs)
           What's that smell?

Mary hands Healy his vodka and as he downs it, we

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. MIAMI MUSEUM - NIGHT

Healy looks slightly disoriented as Mary leads the way into the
courtyard area by the main building.

                        HEALY
           The museum? I thought we were going out to
           dinner?

                        MARY
           We will, but first I have a surprise.

                        HEALY
           A surprise?

                        MARY
           The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker
           is going to be here. He's an architect,
           too. You guys will have tons to talk about.

CLOSE ON HEALY'S FACE as he starts to panic.

INT. ARCHITECTURE EXHIBIT

Mary and Healy walk through the exhibit area. Mary scans the room
for her friend. Healy's face is ashen.

                        MARY
           I know he's around here someplace.

                        HEALY
                 (chipper)
           What say we get outta here and go crush a
           bucket?

                        MARY
           We just got here thirty seconds ago. Isn't
           this stuff great?

Mary points to an architectural model.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           Is this one art deco or art nouveau?

                        HEALY
           Deco.

                        MARY
           Would you call that a portico or a
           vestibule?

                        HEALY
           That...? Vestibule.

                        MARY
           How about--?

                        HEALY
           When you look at architecture, try not to
           concern yourself with the pieces--look at
           the building in its totalitarianism.

Mary gives him a look. Suddenly, Healy draws a couple of invisible
sixshooters at her.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           Stone crab time! Come on, let's get outta
           here, goofy.

He turns to go but Mary notices something O.S.

                        MARY
           Tucker!

Mary leads Healy over to her friend TUCKER, a
distinguished-looking man in his fifties. Healy looks like a dog
that's being dragged to the vet. Mary and Tucker embrace.

                        TUCKER
                 (still hugging)
           Come on, like you mean it.

Mary LAUGHS and hugs Tucker tighter. Then:

                        MARY
           Tucker, this is my friend Pat Healy.
           Healy and Tucker shake hands.

                        TUCKER
           Pleasure to meet you, Patrick.

                        HEALY
           Same here.

                        MARY
           Pat's an architect, too.

                        TUCKER
           Hey, no kidding? Where are your offices?

                        HEALY
                 (keeping cool)
           Mainly I work out of Boston. 

                        TUCKER
           Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up
           there?

                        HEALY
           Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.

                        TUCKER
           Harvard?

                        HEALY
           You bet.

                        TUCKER
                 (pleased)
           Did you study under Kim Greene?

                        HEALY 
           Among others.

                        TUCKER
           Kim and I are close friends!

                        HEALY
           Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.

                        TUCKER
           You mean him.

BEAT.

                        HEALY
           Well...that's debatable.

Healy makes a hand-gesture to imply that Kim's sexuality is in
doubt.

                        TUCKER
           Really? But he's been married for twenty
           years--they've got six kids.

                        HEALY
           Nice smokescreen, isn't it?

Tucker can hardly believe his ears.

                        MARY
           Pat does projects all over the world.

                        TUCKER
                 (impressed)
           Where would I have seen your work?

                        HEALY
           Have you been to
                 (thinking hard)
           Let's see--Santiago, Chile?

                        TUCKER
           Absolutely! I was there twice last year.
           Which building is yours?

                        HEALY
           Do you know the...soccer stadium?

                        TUCKER
           Did you build the Estadio Olympico?

                        HEALY
           No...just down the street, the Amigo Tower.

                        TUCKER
           I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What
           style?

                        HEALY
           Uh, sort of nouveau deco...with a big
           vestibule. Check it out next time you're up
           there.

Tucker starts to look a little suspicious.

                        TUCKER
           You know, I really should take your card.

                        HEALY
                 (noticing something)
           Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a
           minute, Tucker?

Healy drags Mary across the room toward a MAN who's looking at an
exhibit.

                        HEALY
                 (to Man)
           Dooby, you old sheep-fucker! How the hell
           are ya?

                        MAN
           My name's Mel.

                        HEALY
           Oh, sorry. Anyone ever tell you you look
           just like Jim Dubois?

                        MAN
           The sheepfucker?

Healy shrugs and the man walks away angrily.

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

A two-door Toyota Tercel flies by the camera.

INT. TOYOTA TERCEL

A determined Ted is cruising along the highway in his rent-a-car.
He has a cup of coffee in his hand and a HITCHHIKER in the seat
beside him. The Hitchhiker sits with a LARGE RED DUFFEL BAG
between his legs.

                        HITCHHIKER
           Thanks for picking me up. 

                        TED
           No prob, I could use the company. I've been
           on the road going on fifteen hours
           straight.

                        HITCHHIKER
           I know how you feel--I been standing in the
           same spot for the last five hours. You know
           it's against the law to pick up a
           hitchhiker in this state.

                        TED
           That must make it tough.

                        HITCHHIKER
           Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of
           salesman or something?

                        TED
           Nah. I'm...I'm nothing.

                        HITCHHIKER
           Oh. Well I am.

                        TED
           Hm?

                        HITCHHIKER
           A salesman--that's what I am. I mean, I'm
           gonna be anyway. I'm starting my own
           company--video sales--just as soon as I get
           enough seed money.

                        TED
           'That right? Good for you.

                        HITCHHIKER
           Yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea--it's a
           home run. You ever hear of Eight-Minute
           Abs?

                        TED
           The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on
           T.V.

                        HITCHHIKER
           Two million copies it sold last year. Two
           million, man. But not next year--my idea's
           gonna blow them outta the water. Get this:
                 (dramatic pause)
           Seven-Minute Abs.

BEAT.

                        TED
           I see where you're going.

                        HITCHHIKER
                 (big smile)
           Think about it. You walk into a video
           store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and
           right next to it you see Seven-Minute
           Abs--which one you gonna spring for?

                        TED
           I'd go with the seven.

                        HITCHHIKER
           Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll
           get every bit as good a work-out.

                        TED
           How do you guarantee that?

                        HITCHHIKER
           Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't
           happy we'll send you the extra minute.'

                        TED
           Huh. That sounds great.
                 (beat)
           Unless someone else comes out with
           Six-Minute Abs.

Ted CHUCKLES, but the Hitchhiker just GLARES at him, unamused.

                        TED (cont'd)
                 (unaware)
           I'm gonna pull over. I gotta take a leak.

EXT. REST AREA - NIGHT

The Toyota Tercel pulls in and parks. Ted gets out and walks into
the bushes to whiz.

ON TED - as he steps into the dark brush UNZIPPING his fly he
TRIPS over something and FALLS TO THE GROUND.

                        TED
           What the--?

Suddenly WHOOSH, WHOOSH, WHOOSH--several huge SPOTLIGHTS
illuminate the area revealing

TWO DOZEN FRIGHTENED MEN scurrying to pull their pants up all
around him.

                        POLICE OFFICER (O.S.)
           THIS IS A RAID!

ANGLE ON a startled Ted ON HIS KNEES directly in front of
ANOTHER MAN, making it appear that he's been BLOWING THE GUY.

REVERSE ANGLE reveals a DOZEN POLICE OFFICERS holding the
spotlights and moving in for the arrests followed by a CAMERA
CREW.

                        TED
                 (deer caught in headlights)
           Wait a second, it's not what you think.

A GUY with his pants at his ankles jumps on the bandwagon.

                        PANTS AT ANKLES GUY
           That's right! I-I-I was just pissing!

Ted glares at him.

                        TED
           No! I was pissing!

                        POLICE OFFICER
           Yeah, I'll bet you all were. Come on, in
           the truck.

As they grab Ted and the others and hustle them away, we

PAN TO the Hitchhiker sitting in the Toyota watching the raid
unfold.

The Hitchhiker is clearly PANICKY at the sight of all the cops.

Quietly he OPENS THE CAR DOOR, ducks down, and then SPRINTS AWAY
INTO THE WOODS UNSEEN, LEAVING HIS BIG RED BAG BEHIND.

                                                       CUT TO:

CLOSE UP OF TELEVISION SCREEN as the bust continues. Each of the
men COVER THEIR FACES as they pass by the camera, EXCEPT FOR TED
who is extremely visible. 

                        TED
                 (to Cop)
           Okay, take it easy, you don't have to push.

REVERSE ANGLE REVEALS a shocked Dom and his wife watching this
on their television.

                        DOM
           Oh my God. Is that...?

                 (matter-of-fact)
           Told you he was gay.

BACK ON THE TELEVISION - The COPS struggle to get the feisty Ted
into a police van.

                        TED
           I was taking a leak!

EXT. MIAMI STREET - NIGHT

Healy and Mary are walking home at the end of their date. Healy is
eating a big, wild cone of COTTON CANDY and drinking a beer.

                        HEALY
           That grandmother of yours--she's really
           something.

                        MARY
           Magda? She's not my grandmother--actually
           she rents the apartment right next to mine.
           Her husband passed away a couple years ago
           so she doesn't like to be alone.

                        HEALY
           And it doesn't cramp your style?

                    MARY
               Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.

                        HEALY
           Lint?

                        MARY
           Yeah, I think it's that dog of hers running
           around on the rug all day--just makes for a
           lot of lint. Look at this...

Mary lifts her shirt, revealing a BIG CLUMP OF COTTON CANDY
STICKING OUT OF HER BELLY-BUTTON.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           See? That's just one day.

Healy CRACKS UP and then gazes at her. What a babe.

                        HEALY
           You know, sometimes I wish I could be like
           Magda and not go home. I'd like to just
           bounce around for awhile, do a little
           traveling...

                        MARY
           Why bounce when you have your own condo in
           Nepal to go to?

It's clear Healy forgot about that one.

                        HEALY
           Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new
           place, quit the architect game, slow things
           down, read more books, see more movies...

                        MARY
           You're a movie buff?

                        HEALY
           Try to be. It's tough going with the crap
           they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the
           best they've got to offer I say thanks but
           no thanks.

                        MARY
           Have you seen it?

                        HEALY
           No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr
           hated it.

                        MARY
           A fucking moron.

                        HEALY
           Huh. I guess I just wish they made them
           like they used to. You know, something like
           The Heartbreak Kid...or Harold and
           Maude.

Mary can't believe her ears.

                        MARY
           Harold and Maude is my all-time favorite
           movie.

                        HEALY
           Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know
           it's corny, but I do love it.

                        MARY
           Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's
           the greatest--

                        HEALY
           --Love story of our time.

Mary smiles. Is this guy for real?

                        MARY
           Yeah.

                        HEALY
           Wow. I thought I was the only one.

They come to her apartment building and stop. It gets a little
awkward.

                        MARY
           So...

                        HEALY
           Yeah...I guess this is it, huh?

                        MARY
           I guess.

                        HEALY
           Well, I'll see ya.

Healy turns to go but stops.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           Mary ah, forget it.

                        MARY
           What?

                        HEALY
           No, forget it, it was stupid.

                        MARY
           Come on, what were you going to say?

                        HEALY
           Nah, really, it was moronic.

She grabs him by the shirt playfully.

                        MARY
           Just say it.

Healy takes a deep breath.

                        HEALY
           Could I feel your bosoms before I go?

Mary just stares at him.

                        MARY (beat)
           Knock yourself out.

Healy reaches out and cups her breasts. He doesn't kiss her, she
doesn't kiss him, he just fondles her breasts. Then:

                        HEALY
           Okey-dokey, so tomorrow night?

She smiles and as Healy walks away we

                                                       CUT TO:

INT. SOUTH CAROLINA PRISON - DAY

Ted is sitting alone at a table in a small interrogation room.

PULLBACK to reveal that he is being observed through a two-way
mirror by two detectives, FRANEK and CAVALLO.

                        DETECTIVE FRANEK
           Man, they never look like you'd expect.

                        DETECTIVE CAVALLO
           That's probably how he got the victim to
           drop his guard. 

                        DETECTIVE FRANEK
           Where'd they find the body?

                        DETECTIVE CAVALLO
           In a big red bag on the front passenger
           seat. All hacked up--fucking gruesome--a
           real psycho, this one.

The Detectives ENTER the room.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

Ted stands as the Detectives take a seat across from him.

                        TED
                 (agitated)
           I'm telling you, I did not solicit sex! I
           was just stopping to go the bathroom, next
           thing I know I tripped over something--well
           someone--and, POOF, there's cops and
           lights and--

                        DETECTIVE FRANEK
           Okay, calm down, Ted, we believe you.
                 (beat)
           The problem is we found your friend in
           the car.

As Ted sits back down the Detectives just stare at him. Finally
Ted thinks he gets it.

                        TED
           Oh. The hitchhiker.
                 (CHUCKLES)
           That's what this is all about.

Ted puts his head in his hands and smiles.

                        TED (cont'd)
           Isn't that just my luck--I get caught for
           everything.

                        DETECTIVE CAVALLO
           So you admit it?

                        TED
           Guilty as charged. I'm not gonna play games
           with you. I could give you a song and dance
           but what's the point? I did it and we all
           know it.
                 (laughs)
           The hitcher himself told me it's
           illegal The irony.

The Detectives are surprised by his forthrightness.

                        DETECTIVE CAVALLO
           Well, uh, can you tell us his name?

                        TED
           Jeez, I didn't catch it.

The Detectives flinch at his glib demeanor.

                        DETECTIVE FRANEK
           So he was a stranger? It was totally
           random?

                        TED
                 (confused)
           He was the first hitcher I saw, what can I
           tell you? Now cut to the chase, how much
           trouble am I in? 

The Detectives look at one another. 

                        DETECTIVE FRANEK
           First tell us why you did it.

                        TED
           Why I did it?
                 (scoffs)
           I don't know. Boredom? I thought I was
           doing the guy a favor.

The Detectives look at each other.

                        DETECTIVE CAVALLO
           This wasn't your first time, was it, Ted?
           How many we talking?

                        TED
           Hitchhikers? I don't know--fifty...a
           hundred maybe--Who keeps track?

Finally Detective Cavallo EXPLODES across the table and starts
WAILING on a shocked Ted.

                        DETECTIVE CAVALLO
           You sonofabitch! You're gonna fry!!!!

EXT. MARY'S OFFICE - MORNING

Mary pulls up in her Honda Civic. She parks out front and enters
the building.

PAN ACROSS THE STREET TO REVEAL - Healy is parked in his car.
His surveillance equipment is pointed toward Mary's office.

INT. MARY'S OFFICE - MORNING

Mary walks into the office and sees a MEDICAL ASSISTANT standing
near the coffee maker.

                        MARY
           Mornin', Jane.

                        MEDICAL ASSISTANT #1
           Good morning, Doctor. Your friend Tucker's
           in your office to see you. 

Mary nods and heads toward her office. 

INT. MARY'S OFFICE - SAME

Mary walks into her office and sees Tucker seated at her desk.
(SHOT FROM behind Tucker so we only see the back of his head.)

                        TUCKER
           What's up, Doc?

                        MARY
           Tucker, you look different some how. Did
           you do something with your hair?

MARY'S POV - Tucker's got two TONGUE DEPRESSORS under his upper
lip making him look like a walrus.

                        TUCKER
           The teeth, the teeth. I got 'em capped.

ON MARY - smiles.

                        MARY
           Oh yeah, they look great.

INT. HEALY'S CAR - SAME

He's got his listening gun fixed on Mary's office.

                        TUCKER (V.O.)
           You don't think they're too big?

                        MARY (V.O.)
           No no, the bigger the better.
                 (beat)
           But I must say, they could be a little
           brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful
           of pearly whites.

Healy looks at his teeth in the mirror. Not exactly pearly.

INT. MARY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Tucker pulls the tongue depressors out of his teeth and laughs. He
stands up, and when Mary tries to squeeze past him he gives her a
kiss on the cheek.

                        TUCKER
           You ever been laid in this office?

Mary pushes past him.

                        MARY
           Behave yourself, Tucker.
                 (smiles)
           Come on, what are you doing here?

She sits in her chair and leans against her desk.

                        TUCKER
           I wanted to talk to you about your friend
           Patrick.

EXT. HEALY'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Healy almost flies out of his seat.

                        MARY (O.S.)
           He's a nice guy, isn't he?

                        TUCKER (O.S.)
           Well that's what I'm trying to figure
           out. How long have you known him?

INT. MARY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Tucker has a look of concern.

                        MARY
           Not long at all, but I really like him.
                 (off Tucker's look)
           Okay, I know he's a little different,
           Tucker, but that's what I like about him.
           He's a guy. A real guy. He dresses like a
           dork and eats corndogs and he isn't always
           politically correct and he probably farts,
           too. And that's okay with me.

                        TUCKER
           That's what you've been looking for--a
           farter?

                        MARY
           I've been looking for a guy--not one of
           these South Beach pussies.

                        TUCKER
                 (SIGHS)
           Look, it's just that something about him
           struck me as odd last night. He gave me
           this funny vibe. Anyway, I called some
           friends back east. They don't know of any
           architect named Patrick Healy and he's not
           listed as a Harvard alumnus.

INT. HEALY'S CAR - SAME

Healy SLAMS his hand on the steering wheel.

                        HEALY
           Fuck!!

                        MARY (O.S.)
           Huh...that's strange.

INT. MARY'S OFFICE - SAME

                        TUCKER
           I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't
           think I'm being meddlesome. I just think
           you should be careful with this guy.

                        MARY
                 (concerned)
           No no no, Tucker, thank you.

                        TUCKER
           I mean let's face it, Mary, you're
           beautiful, you've got money, you trust
           people--I'm just saying, there's a lot of
           psychos out there.

                        MARY
                 (small smile)
           I appreciate you looking out for me.

INT. SOUTH CAROLINA PRISON - DAY

CLOSE ON - Detective Franek as he SPEAKS, sheepishly. His
remorseful- looking partner Cavallo stands behind him.

                        DETECTIVE FRANEK
           On behalf of the entire South Carolina law
           enforcement community, I would like to
           offer our heartfelt apologies for any pain
           or temporary inconvenience we may have
           caused you, Mr. Peloquin.

REVERSE ANGLE - reveals that Ted is lying on his prison bed
being spooned by a 300-pound SLEEPING INMATE.

INT. PRISON HALLWAY

The two Detectives and an apoplectic Ted walk down the hallway.

                        DETECTIVE FRANEK
           At exactly 10:48 this morning a man was
           apprehended not far from where you were
           arrested. He was identified as an escaped
           mental patient and subsequently confessed
           to the murder that you were being held for.
           Lab tests confirmed a fingerprint match on
           the bag.

                        TED
                 (fragile)
           So...I'm free to go?

Detective Cavallo stops and holds out his hand.

                        DETECTIVE CAVALLO
           No harm, no foul?

                        TED
                 (stunned)
           I guess.

Still traumatized, Ted shakes the man's hand, then mopes toward
the door.

                        DETECTIVE FRANEK
           By the way, there's somebody here to see
           you.

INT. TED'S CAR - DAY

Dom is driving; a bruised and somber Ted is in the passenger seat.

                        DOM
           You are one lucky sonofabitch, you know
           that?

                        TED
           I am?

                        DOM
           Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just
           about to cut your throat when you stopped
           to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe
           up your ass, man.

                        TED
           Yeah feels like it.

Ted grimaces and shifts in his seat.

                        TED (cont'd)
           How the hell did you get here anyway?

                        DOM
           Flew.
                 (beat)
           Told my wife I was going to a Promise

Ted gives him a look.

           I hate to ruin your day, Ted, but I have
           some bad news for you.

Ted SIGHS.

           Shoot.

                        DOM
           Remember our friend Healy? Well, I didn't
           know where to mail his last paycheck so I
           sent my assistant by his mother's
           apartment. Turns out there is no diabetic
           mom. Landlord said she's been dead for ten
           years.

                        TED
           And this adversely affects me how...?

                        DOM
           Don't you see?--Healy lied to us about
           everything! The landlord said when he got
           back from Miami he kept talking about
           falling for some doctor named Mary!

Ted is stunned.

                        TED
           Huh? What? No...My Mary? Mary wouldn't go
           for him....would she?

Dom hands Ted a SLIP OF PAPER.

                        DOM
           His address in Miami. You know, when you
           think about it, we really don't know the
           first thing about this guy.

Finally the implications of this dawn on Ted.

                        TED
           Jesus Christ what have I done?

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - EVENING

A confused Mary and her girlfriends are in the apartment while
Magda listens to the radio scanner in the b.g.

                        LISA
           You're not seriously thinking about going
           out with this guy again?

                        JOANNIE
           Mary, he sounds like a psycho!

                        MAGDA
           Would you hens quit ya cackling and let her
           do what she wants to do. Puffy liked him
           and Puffy's never wrong.

The girlfriends roll their eyes.

                        BRENDA
           Mary, the guy's full of shit.

                        MARY
           What if he's not? What if Tucker just made
           an honest mistake?

                        LISA
           What if he didn't?

It's clear that Mary is torn.

                        MARY
           I don't know how I can bail now, he's going
           to be here any minute.

                        JOANNIE
           Well then blow him off when he gets here.

                        MARY
           But you didn't meet him. He seems so I
           don't know...perfect...kind of.

                        BRENDA
           He has a big cock, doesn't he?

Mary shoots Brenda a look. 

                        MAGDA
           Hey hey, what did you say Pat's last name
           was?

                        MARY
           Healy.

Magda's eyes almost come out of her head.

                        MAGDA
           I think you better listen to this.

Magda turns up the volume on her scanner and we can clearly hear
Healy TALKING ON HIS CELLULAR PHONE. Mary and her girlfriends
gather around.

                        SULLY (V.O.)
           So where the hell are you, Healy?

                        HEALY (V.O.)
           Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary
           girl I told you about.

                        SULLY (V.O.)
           The sawbones?

                        HEALY (V.O.)
           Yep.

The girls all look at one another.

                        BRENDA
           We hit the motherlode.

                        MARY
           We shouldn't be listening to this.

                        LISA AND JOANNIE
           Shhh.

                        SULLY (V.O.)
           She still think you're a fucking architect?

                        HEALY (V.O.)
           Oh yeah.

                        SULLY (V.O.)
           Dumbshit.

                        LISA
           Mr. Perfect, huh?

Mary starts to feel like a fool.

                        MARY
                 (edgy)
           Turn it up, Magda.

                        HEALY (V.O.)
           Hey, watch your mouth--she's a great gal.
           I'm the dumbshit for lying to her.

                        SULLY (V.O.)
           Why didn't you just tell her the truth?

                        HEALY (V.O.)
           I don't know. I guess...it just seems that
           women today are more impressed by the
           mighty buck than by some schmo who spent
           the last seventeen years scraping by on
           Peace Corp wages.

The girls all seem moved by this.

INT. HEALY'S CAR - NIGHT

Healy is parked out front, the phone in one hand, a SCRIPT in the
other, as he listens to Sully read the following words:

                        SULLY (V.O.)
           But Jesus, Pat, if she's as special as you
           say, she's going to want to hear about
           the things you did. 

                        HEALY
                 (dismissing this)
           Ahh.

INT. SULLY'S APARTMENT - SAME

A disheveled and wired-looking Sully is sitting on the couch in
his underwear READING FROM THE SAME SCRIPT. There's COKE on the
table, DOG SHIT on the floor, and FLIES everywhere.

In the B.G. we see the Great Dane SNIFFING at his empty bowl and
the Boa Constrictor sprawled out on the floor, barely moving.

                        SULLY
                 (reading)
           Come on, you could tell her about the
           irrigation ditches you dug in Sudan, the
           orphan babies who cried in your arms in
           Romania...
                 (does a line of blow)
           ...the hope you gave Freddie the leper in
           Calcutta...

Suddenly the dog snatches the page out of his hand and STARTS TO
EAT IT.

BACK ON Mary and friends.

                        JOANNIE
                 (welling up)
           I love this man.

Magda folds her arms and gloats.

INT. HEALY'S CAR - NIGHT

                        HEALY
           Look, I did all those things for myself.
           I'll be honest with you, I'm a selfish
           prick. I get a high from helping all of
           God's creatures. An honest to goodness
           high.

Just then, Healy sees a bug on the car window and instinctively
squashes it.

ON SULLY - he has the phone wedged between his cheek and
shoulder as he STRUGGLES with the dog to get the script.

Sully still can't retrieve the script, nor his next line.

                 (winging it)
           That's bullshit, man you, uh, you were on
           the front line. Remember the, uh,
           malaria the, uh, typhoon fever that
           vicious strain of genital herpes?

ON MARY AND FRIENDS - they flinch at this.

ON HEALY - he stares at the phone, horrified.

                        HEALY (V.O.)
           Uh, sure. I cured a lot of nasty
           illnesses in third-world countries.

ON MARY AND FRIENDS - as they let out a sigh.

                        HEALY (V.O.) (cont'd)
           The bottom line is, I'm not going to use my
           philanthropy as some form of
           currency...especially after what I did.
                 (SIGHS)
           I lied to this poor girl. Lied. man. She
           deserved better.

                        SULLY (V.O.)
           Hey, love will make you do fucked-up
           things.

                        HEALY (V.O.)
           You said it, mister.
                 (choking up)
           I gotta go.

ON SULLY - as he HANGS UP the phone and does another line, we

PAN TO the Great Dane Hal as he looks around for something,
anything to eat. He SNIFFS at a sock, then a beer bottle, before
finally setting his sights on the Boa Constrictor Bill. Bill
glances the dog's way nervously, SENSES TROUBLE, and wiggles his
way into another room. As Hal TAKES OFF after the snake, we

MONTAGE OF MARY AND HEALY COURTING 
--As Mary watches, Healy plays TOUCH FOOTBALL with Warren and a
few of his friends. Healy catches a pass then, trying a little too
hard to impress Mary, he delivers a forearm shiver to his defender
and gives Warren a vicious STRAIGHT-ARM. When Healy gets into the
end zone he spikes the ball and starts talking trash to another
defender.

--Healy shows up at Mary's door sporting a set of OVERSIZED
INCREDIBLY-WHITE CAPPED TEETH. He gives her a big horse smile and
she reacts uncertainly.

--Healy is in Mary's apartment as Mary finishes dressing for a
night on the town.

           Hey, Mare, do I have a rip in the back of
           these pants?

When she puts her head close to inspect his pants, he lets fly a
THUNDEROUS FART. She pulls her head away, repulsed, but Healy just
LAUGHS.

--Mary and and the horse-toothed Healy are having dinner in a
romantic restaurant. As he eats he tells an animated story but
he's having trouble with the new choppers and chunks of food are
spraying out of his mouth with every word. Mary has to BOB AND
WEAVE to avoid being covered with debris.

--Healy and Warren are playing monopoly. When Warren isn't
looking, Healy cheats and puts a couple hotels on Boardwalk. In
the b.g. we see one of Warren's buddies fall out of a palm tree.

has to break it off.

Healy LAUGHS.

           Aw, leave him alone, he's just got a big
           appetite.

           Am I right?

Healy winks at Mary.

                        WARREN
           Huh?

Healy reaches over and lifts a headphone off Warren's ear.

           I said you've got a big app--

Suddenly Warren SUCKER-PUNCHES HEALY IN THE THROAT.

           Well? What are you waiting for?

                        TED
           I don't know what to say.

                        DOM
           Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the
           schmuck out of the water.

                        TED
           Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on
           her. She's gonna be fucking pissed.
                 (stares at Mary)
           She's even more beautiful than I remember.

THEIR POV - Mary and Warren start to go in the apartment.

                        DOM
           Get over there, you pussy! She's leaving!

Suddenly Dom HONKS THE HORN, then ducks down. Mary turns around
and sees Ted.

                        TED
           You asshole, what are you--
                 (CALLING OUT CHEERILY)
           Mary! Is that you?

                        MARY
                 (squinting)
           Who's that?

Ted gets out of the car and hustles across the street toward Mary.

                        TED
           It is you! It's me...Ted. From Rhode
           Island Ted.

Finally she recognizes him.

                        MARY
           Oh my God...Ted.
                 (big smile)
           What are you...? I can't believe this. I
           haven't seen you since-- 

                        TED
           Yup, that's right. Junior prom...kinda.

                        MARY
           And did everything--?

                        TED
           Oh yeah, healed right up. No visible scars.

Mary LAUGHS.

                        TED (cont'd)
           How are you doing, Warren?

                        WARREN
           Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?

                        TED
           I'm gonna take a rain check.

Mary is stunned.

                        MARY
           I can't believe he remembered you. He never
           remembers anybody.
                 (beat)
           You know I tried to call you for weeks
           after that.

                        TED
           Really? I never got a message.

                        MARY
           That's weird. I talked to your brother
           Jimmy five or six times.

Ted is devastated to hear this.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           By the way, how's he doing?

                        TED
           He's dead.

                        MARY
                 (taken aback)
           Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.

                        TED
                 (bitter)
           No, it was a good thing.
                 (off her look)
           I mean, good in that it was very quick.

Ted pantomimes an explosion.

                        MARY
           Oh. So...what brings you down here?

                        TED
           Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of
           mine decided to...ah...you know...just
           ...drive down.

She stares at him.

                        MARY
           Well you look great. Are you married, do
           you have kids?

                        TED
           Nope, nope--dodged a few bullets.
                 (smiles)
           God, I cannot believe I'm standing here
           with Mary Jenson.

                        MARY
           Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.

                        TED
                 (taken aback)
           Oh...are you...?

                        MARY
           Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.
                 (off his look)
           There was this guy back in college who was
           bothering me...got kind of ugly--a
           restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway,
           when I got out of Princeton I changed my
           name as a precaution.

                        TED
           Jeez...that sounds awful. Hey, what do you
           say we go out to dinner tonight, catch up
           on old times?

BEAT.

                        MARY
           Didn't we just do that?

Ted doesn't know how to respond to this and then she smiles.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but
           the thing is I already have plans. How
           about tomorrow night?

                        TED
           Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve
           years.
                 (beat)
           Don't make me wait another day.

Mary seems touched by this.

                        MARY
           Tell me where you're staying. I'll pick you
           up at eight.

Ted finally smiles and we

                                                       CUT TO:

INT. HEALY'S CAR - TWILIGHT

A content Healy is parked out front of Mary's apartment, absently
listening to her spill her guts to Magda while he reads the
newspaper.

                        MAGDA (V.O.)
           I'm buying bananas tonight.

                        MARY (V.O.)
           Why?

                        MAGDA (V.O.)
           Back when I was your age I always used to
           make myself a big banana split after sex. I
           think you're gonna need one tonight.

                        MARY (V.O.)
           Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll
           probably need it before I will.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - SAME

Mary is skipping around the apartment while Magda sits on the
couch.

                        MAGDA
           Don't bet on it. Last time I had a pap
           smear the guy needed leather gloves and an
           oyster shucker.

                        MARY
           So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to
           take you to the movies.

                        MAGDA
           Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're
           in love doesn't mean everyone else has to
           be.

                        MARY
           Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.

                        MAGDA
           Oh no? I ain't seen you beaming like this
           since you broke ninety on the Blue Monster.

BACK ON HEALY - he's reveling in it all.

                        MARY (V.O. )
           Well I am pretty psyched. I ran into a
           guy today I hadn't seen since high school.

Healy loses the smile and sits up.

                        MAGDA (V.O.)
           An old flame?

                        MARY (V.O.)
           Kind of. Ted Peloquin--one of the sweetest
           guys in the world.

Healy TURNS UP THE VOLUME.

ON MARY 
                        MARY (cont'd)
           He was so shy and clumsy...I had a major
           crush on him.

BACK ON HEALY as he nearly puts his head through the roof. He
grabs hold of the steering wheel and pounds his head on it.

                        HEALY
           No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

                        MARY (V.O.) (cont'd)
           We're gonna go out tonight. Oh, that
           reminds me, I've got to call
           what's-his-face and cancel.

ON MARY 
                        MAGDA
           Do I sense a chill in the air?

Mary sits down.

                        MARY
           Oh, Magda, I let my head get in the way of
           my love life. I always pick guys on what I
           feel in here.
                 (pats heart)
           But with this Pat guy my head kept saying
           "Grow up, Mary. You have a lot in common
           with this one, you'll grow to feel
           something for him." But it never happened.

ON HEALY - he couldn't look more crushed. Suddenly his cellular
phone RINGS. He stares at it for TWO, THREE, FOUR RINGS.
Panic-stricken. Then he answers it.

                        HEALY
                 (jovial voice)
           Hey, Patty-boy here. Sorry I missed ya, but
           I'm out rustling up some champagne and
           roses in preparation for the greatest
           birthday of my life. Hope you and yours are
           having a good day, too.

Healy makes a BEEP sound and then holds his breath.

ON MARY - she stares at the phone, feeling cornered.

                        MARY
           Uh, hi Pat, it's me, Mary. Just wanted to
           say I'm...looking forward to tonight.

She hangs up.

                        MAGDA
           You vicious bitch, how do you sleep at
           night?

                        MARY
           I can't do it--I just found out it's his
           birthday.
                 (sighs)
           I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.

ON HEALY - he blows imaginary smoke off an imaginary gun. Then
he sits back and smugly listens to her DIAL THE PHONE. But then he
hears something that concerns him--a KNOCK on the door and the dog
YAPPING.

ON MARY - she puts down the phone and answers the door. It's
Tucker, the architect.

                        MARY
                 (surprised)
           Tucker...come on in.

BACK ON HEALY pulling his hair out. He's on an emotional roller
coaster heading downhill.

                        MAGDA (V.O.)
           Well look who's here.

BACK TO MARY'S APARTMENT - Tucker is carrying an unopened BOTTLE
OF SCOTCH and absently flicking the YAPPING pooch off his ankles.

                        TUCKER
           There she is--I brought you a little
           thirst-quencher, Mag.

                        MAGDA
           Oh, you are sweet.

                        TUCKER
           No, I'm not. I just want to get you-drunk
           so you'll pass out and I can have my way
           with Mary.

Everyone LAUGHS.

                        MARY
           Can I pour you one?

                        TUCKER
           Thanks, but I've got to be going.
           Unfortunately, Doc, this isn't a social
           visit.

Tucker's tone shifts and Mary grows concerned.

                        MARY
           What's up?

                        TUCKER
           Well...I've got a little more news about
           your friend Healy.

Mary seems relieved.

                        MARY
           I know what you're going to say, but he
           already told me everything. I know he's not
           an architect.

Tucker pulls out a piece of paper.

                        TUCKER (cont'd)
           I think you'd better sit down.

                        MARY
           Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this,
           but I'm really strapped for time here and--

                        TUCKER
           Mary, the man's a killer.

ON HEALY - he can't believe his ears.

BACK ON MARY - as she lowers herself onto the couch.

                        MARY
                 (stunned)
           What...?

                        TUCKER
           I've got a friend in the Boston police
           department. He faxed me this this morning.
           I'll just give you the highlights.
                 (reading from rap sheet)
           After a short stint as a petty thief,
           Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery
           by the age of fourteen. At sixteen he
           committed his first murder--a pretty
           teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove. He
           was incarcerated until age twenty-two when,
           despite a grim psychological profile, the
           state was forced to release him. In his
           mid-twenties and again in his early
           thirties he was suspected of homicides in
           the states of Utah and Washington.
           Unfortunately, the bodies were so badly
           decomposed that there wasn't enough
           evidence to hold him, and on and on and so
           forth and so on.

Mary looks like she's going to throw up.

ON HEALY - he listens intently, his face ashen.

                        MARY (V.O.)
           Holy shit...

                        MAGDA (V.O.)
           Puffy, get over here.

We hear the PITTER-PATTER of the dog's nails on the floor, then a
LOUD THUMP followed by a YELP.

ON MARY 
                        MARY
           Magda!

                        MAGDA
           The little shit lied to me about that guy!

Mary picks up the startled dog and pets him.

                        MARY
                 (growing emotional)
           I can't believe this is happening. I'm
           supposed to be meeting him in an hour.

                        TUCKER
           Okay, just calm down. It's going to be
           okay.

Tucker puts his arms around her.

                        MAGDA
           Why you two never hooked up is beyond me.

Mary looks fondly at Tucker.

                        MARY
           Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in
           my life.

                        TUCKER
           Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give
           me a big head.
                 (smiles)
           The important thing, Doctor, is you've got
           to distance yourself as much as possible
           without pissing this psycho off.

                        MARY
           Yeah, yeah. Okay, I think I know what to
           do. I'll call him right now.

BACK ON HEALY - he looks stunned. His cellular PHONE RINGS. He
stares at it, then picks it up.

                        HEALY
           Hi, I'm out drinking champagne and
           roses...and I'm really happy. Leave a
           message. BEEP.

                        MARY (V.O.)
                 (nervous)
           Uh, hey buddy. Oh boy, am I pissed. You're
           not going to believe this--well, you'll
           believe it, there's no reason not to--but I
           just got beeped for emergency surgery.
           Well, um, sorry, but I'm going to have to
           bail on you.

As we hear a CLICK, Healy stares at the cell phone, seething.

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. MARY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER

Tucker comes out the front door, looks around, then walks off down
the sidewalk.

ANGLE ACROSS THE STREET - on Healy, his steely gaze fixed on
Tucker.

                        HEALY
                 (under breath)
           You're gonna pay, fucker.

Healy discreetly pulls out and slowly follows Tucker in his car.

BACK ON TUCKER - He continues down the sidewalk, looking back
once or twice, apprehensive. He rounds a corner, then stops next
to an OLD FORD PINTO. He looks around nervously again. Then Tucker
DUCKS INTO THE DRIVER'S SEAT and DRIVES OFF. Healy pulls into
traffic and follows.

                                                       CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 

Dom's mixing a drink while Ted paces nervously.

                        TED
           Oh God, I'm fucking nervous. I don't know
           if I'm ready for this, man.

                        DOM
           Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?

                        TED
                 (pats his back pocket)
           Got cash.

                        DOM
           Car clean? Plenty of gas?

                        TED
           Check.

                        DOM
           Mints?

                        TED
           Copped a tin of Altoids at the car wash.

Dom nods, satisfied.

                        DOM
           Okay, sounds like you're all set. Just
           clean the pipes and it's a go.

                        TED
           Hm?

                        DOM
           You know, clean the pipes.

                        TED
           Pipes? What are you talking about?

                        DOM
           You jerk off before all big dates, right?
           Tell me you jerk off before your big dates.

Ted just stares at him.

                 (incredulous)
           You don't jerk off before--?! Are you
           crazy?! That's like going out there with a
           loaded gun. No wonder you're nervous!

Ted considers this.

                        DOM (cont'd)
           Think about it: After you've had sex with a
           girl and the two of you are laying in bed,
           are you nervous?

                        TED
           No.

Dom shrugs...Duh.

                        DOM
           Why's that?

                        TED
           I'm usually too tired to be.

Dom makes a game-show BUZZER sound.

                        DOM
           Wrong. It's because you ain't got the baby
           batter in your brain any more. That'll fuck
           with your head, that stuff will.

           Huh.

           The most honest moment in a man's life is
           the five minutes after he's blown a load.
           That's a medical fact. And it's because
           you're no longer trying to get laid. You're
           actually thinking like a girl. They love
           that.

           Jesus Christ you're right.

EXT. HOTEL - EVENING

Dom walks out of the lobby just as another cab arrives and Mary
gets out. He sees and her and ducks behind a bush as she walks
past him.

INT. TED'S HOTEL BATHROOM - SAME

Ted has a newspaper splayed out on the counter (open to the bra
ads) as he furiously FLOGS THE DOLPHIN (chest-high side view.) We
see some balled-up tissue nearby. After several frantic strokes,
he takes a deep breath and slowly and loudly EXHALES, clearly
having COMPLETED HIS MISSION.

He draws a few more breaths, picks up a face cloth, and goes to
clean up.

But something's missing: The Load. Ted looks down, checks his
hands, pants, shoes, looks in the sink, finally glances at the
ceiling, with no luck.

The Load IS MISSING!!!!

That's when the doorbell RINGS. Ted couldn't look more HORRIFIED.
As he buckles his pants, he makes a last, panicky reconnaissance
of the area. The doorbell RINGS AGAIN and Ted reluctantly goes to
answer it.

Ted opens the door and Mary is standing there looking as lovely as
ever.

                        MARY
           On your ear, you've got something.

MARY'S POV - a HUGE LOAD is hanging off of Ted's earlobe like a
drop earring.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           It looks like a gob of...

Mary leans forward for a closer look. Ted is terrified.

Before Ted can stop her, Mary grabs The Load off his ear and WIPES

Healy is still following Tucker in his car. Finally Tucker stops
in front of a lavish Victorian home and gets out carrying a pizza

Tucker drops the pizza as Healy SLAMS HIM into a tree.

Healy SLAMS HIM AGAINST THE TREE AGAIN.

           Whoa, whoa--I don't know what you're talking
           about.

Healy SLAPS him across the face.

           I'll give you a hint--it's got something to
           do with me being a murderer.

Healy raises his arm again and Tucker tries to shield himself.

                        TUCKER
           Okay, okay, I might've gotten some bad
           information.

Healy grabs him by the collar.

           working for him, aren't you, you little
           shit?

                        TUCKER
           Who?

Healy throws Tucker to the ground and takes off his sport coat.

                        HEALY
           This is your last chance, you fuck. Now
           either you come clean or I'm going to kick
           your ass from here to Tallahassee.

Healy grabs Tucker by the hair and cocks his arm.

                        TUCKER
           I LOVE HER, OKAY?!

Tucker suddenly gets emotional. Healy stops and looks at him.

           You what?

                        TUCKER
           You heard me, goddamnit. I...I love her.

Healy slowly lets go.

           I'm a phony--just like you, man.

           Santiago twice in a year?

           I'm ahead.

Mary looks a little disappointed.

                        MARY
           Ted...you're not that far ahead.

                        TED
           Look, Mary, the truth is...I'll be in town
           for a while now but I don't think we should
           see each other for a few weeks.

                        MARY
                 (alarmed)
           Why not?

                        TED
           Well...to be honest....I'm really crazy
           about you and it's making me nervous and
           when I get nervous I'm not myself and I'm
           afraid I'm going to doing something really
           dumb before we get started so I think I
           should just lay back until I regain my
           composure.

Mary sort of smiles.

                        MARY
           That's really sweet, Ted, but you should
           save it for one of your books.

                        TED
           All right, let's go.

Ted jumps up and starts up the stairs two at a time.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

As Ted and Mary ENTER, we see Magda HOLDING UP THE COUCH with one
hand and VACUUMING WITH THE OTHER.

Mary doesn't know what to make of it.

                        MARY
           Magda, what are you doing?

Magda turns off the vacuum and we hear a BANGING SOUND coupled
with the O.S. MUFFLED YAPPING of Puffy.

                        MAGDA
           Oh, hi hon. Just straightening up.

                        MARY
           Where's Puffy?

                        MAGDA
           Ah, he was being a pest so I put him in the
           bathroom.

As the O.S. YAPPING AND BANGING continues, Magda PICKS UP THE
TELEVISION and starts DUSTING the TV stand.

                        MARY
                 (to Ted, concerned)
           Um, Ted, I need a moment with Magda--would
           you let the dog out of the bathroom.

                        TED
           Yeah, sure.

Ted walks down the hall, following the YAPPING AND BANGING SOUND
until he comes to the bathroom door. The YAPPING is MUCH LOUDER
now and he NOTICES SOMETHING THAT MAKES HIM HESITATE.

TED'S POV - the bottom part of the door is being DENTED OUTWARD
from the force of something BATTERING IT FROM WITHIN.

                        TED
                 (CALLING out)
           Uh, Mare, what kind of dog is Puffy?

                        MARY (O.S.)
                 (CALLING out)
           Toy poodle!

Ted thinks about this, shrugs, and opens the door.

BARING HIS TEETH like a Rottweiler, Puffy SPRINGS at Ted's
jugular!

INT. MARY'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Ted stumbles back into the living room with the hopped-up dog ON
HIS FACE. He KNOCKS OVER A LAMP, tumbles onto the floor, and
fights for his life.

Mary and Magda SCREAM as Ted and Puffy mix it up on the floor. Ted
tries to CRAWL TOWARD THE DOOR but Puffy GRABS THE CUFF OF HIS
PANTS.

DOOR POV of Ted's anguished face as he gets pulled back into the
room.

Ted manages to GET THE DOG IN A HEADLOCK.

                        MAGDA
           Stop it, you're hurting him!

                        TED
                 (out of breath)
           Tell him...to calm down.

Puffy gets a piece of Ted's wrist and Ted SCREAMS and drops him.
Both man and toy poodle SPRING TO THEIR FEET.

They start CIRCLING ONE ANOTHER. Puffy leaps at Ted and Ted SMACKS
HIM into a wall. Unfazed, the dog gets a running start and LEAPS
AT TED'S NECK.

Ted manages to duck and PUFFY FLIES OUT THE OPEN WINDOW!

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

EXT MIAMI STREET - DAY

MONTAGE OF TED AND MARY FALLING IN LOVE 
--Ted and Warren are at the top of a giant WATER SLIDE
Warren motions that he has decided this is not for him.
Ted shoots him a look that makes Warren feel like a
sissy. Convinced it's not too dangerous, Warren
decides to go for it and Ted follows.

--At the bottom of the slide Ted splashes into the huge
pool of water, laughing, having a blast. Then he looks

around...no sign of Warren. Concerned, Ted dives
underwater and a moment later Resurfaces clutching a
GASPING Warren.

EXT. MIAMI STREET - DAY

--Mary pumps Warren's stomach as he coughs water out of
his mouth. Ted looks on sheepishly.

EXT. MIAMI STREET - DAY

Ted and Warren walk down a city sidewalk. As they pass
a shop Warren points to the window excitedly.

THEIR POV

In the window there is a mannequin dressed in a Super-
hero outfit, i.e. a generic superman.

Warren then pulls Ted into the store.

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. MIAMI STREET - DAY

Ted comes out followed by a beaming Warren dressed in
the Super-Hero outfit. They continue walking again and
a few steps later Warren excitedly points to another
shop window.

THEIR POV

In the window is a mannequin dressed in a cowboy
outfit, i.e. Lone Ranger (hat, badge, holster, chaps,
vest, boots, spurs, etc.)

Again, Warren pulls Ted into the store.

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. MIAMI STREET - DAY

Mary is window shopping with a few bags in hand. She
turns and reacts amused.

HER POV

Warren is now dressed in the cowboy outfit and a
humiliated Ted follows dressed in the loose fitting
Super-hero outfit.

EXT. SCENIC PIER - MIAMI - DAY

--Ted and Mary are walking arm and arm on a SCENIC PIER
where PEOPLE ARE FISHING. Right behind them are Magda
and Herb (the Homeless guy) enjoying one another's
company. Ted is on top of the world, feeling good,
looking good-right up until he gets the HOOK IN HIS
MOUTH. Suddenly he gets YANKED OUT OF FRAME.

EXT. SCENIC PIER - MIAMI - DAY

--Ted is FLOPPING AROUND on the pavement and a FISHERMAN
has his FOOT ON HIS FACE as he STRUGGLES TO REMOVE THE
HOOK. Mary looks on, concerned.

EXT. GROCERY STORE - MIAMI - DAY

--Ted and Mary come out of the grocery store each
HOLDING A COUPLE BAGS. Ted also is CARRYING PUFFY, IN A
BODYCAST. Ted PUTS PUFFY ON THE ROOF, then starts
putting the groceries in the back seat.

EXT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY

--Mary pulls her car up in front of her apartment. AS
Ted gets out of the passenger's side, he notices that
PUFFY IS STILL ON THE ROOF. He quickly GRABS PUFFY
before Mary notices.

EXT. BATTING CAGE - MIAMI - DAY

--Warren is futilely taking swings in a BATTING CAGE
while Mary looks on helplessly. Finally Ted goes into
the cage, SIGNALS THE GUY TO STOP THE PITCHING MACHINE,
and MOVES WARREN A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE PLATE.

--A distraught Ted SITS SOMBERLY on a bench. Beside him, Mary
comforts Warren whose LEFT EYE IS BLACK AND BLUE AND COMPLETELY
CLOSED.

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Ted shows up at Mary's apartment door carrying a BOUQUET OF
FLOWERS and a BASEBALL. When he KNOCKS, the door opens.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Ted peeks around the corner and sees a SOMBER Mary sitting on the
couch.

                        TED
                 (chipper)
           Hey.

Mary doesn't look up. Ted ENTERS, revealing his gifts.

                        TED (cont'd)
           The flowers are for you and the ball's for
           Warren. I had a friend of mine Fedex it to
           me--it's signed by Tony Conigliaro.

Mary finally looks up but doesn't smile.

                        MARY
           Did you hire Pat Healy to follow me around?

Ted tries to hide his horror.

                        TED
                 (lamely)
           What do you mean?

Mary picks up a letter off the coffee table and hands it to him.
Ted takes a quick look and then drops it on the table.

                        MARY
           It's not true...right, Ted?

Ted CLEARS HIS THROAT.

                        TED
           Well, funny story there. You see, uh, it
           started out as a uh...yeah...it's true. =

Mary stands up.

                        MARY
           Get out.

                        TED
           Wait, hold on, Mary--it's not as bad as it
           sounds. I certainly didn't know--

                        MARY
           That you put a murderer on my trail?

                        TED
           Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I
           just thought--

                        MARY
           What did you think, Ted? That you could spy
           on me and trick me into thinking you were
           someone I could...really go for?

Mary starts to get emotional.

                        TED
           Mary, I swear I wasn't trying to trick you.

                        MARY
           Then what the fuck did you do it for?

                        TED
           I did it because because I'd never
           stopped thinking about you and if I didn't
           find you I knew my life would never be good
           again.

Mary looks away.

                        MARY
                 (softly)
           Please leave.

                        TED
                 (devastated)
           Mary, come on...

                        MARY
           Go!

                        TED
                 (beat)
           Okay.

And so Ted does.

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. MARY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Ted comes out of the building, a broken man. He paces back and
forth on the sidewalk, manic with despair. Then he seems to grow
angry. He rifles through his pockets until he finds a SLIP OF
PAPER.

TED'S POV - the paper reads: 'Healy's Miami address--229 Court
Street, apt. 43.'

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Ted walks down a rather dark hallway until he comes to apartment
43. He KNOCKS on the door but no one answers. He tries the handle
and THE DOOR OPENS.

INT. SULLY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 

Ted ENTERS and immediately reacts to the STENCH.

REVERSE ANGLE reveals that the place is a fucking PIG-STY. DOG
SHIT is everywhere, FLIES fill the room, a MOUSE scampers across
the carpet.

                        TED
           Hello...?

No answer. Suddenly he HEARS SOMEONE out in the hall, so he ducks
behind the door.

Healy and Tucker ENTER the apartment and stop in their tracks when
they see the MESS.

                        HEALY
           Ho-ly shit.

                        TUCKER
           Hey, this is a pretty nice place.

                        HEALY
           Sully...! What the fuck happened here?!

Again, no answer. Suddenly Ted SLAMS THE DOOR shut and grabs Healy
by the collar.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
                 (alarmed)
           Hey, hey, hey!

                        TED
           Surprised?

                        TUCKER
           Hey, buddy, don't do anything rash now.

                        TED
                 (to Tucker)
           Who the fuck are you?

                        HEALY
           He's in love with Mary, too.

Ted releases Healy and glares at him.

                        TED
           You fucked me, man? Why would you do that?

                        HEALY
                 (righteous)
           What do you mean 'why'?

                        TED
           Answer the question, shitball.

                        TUCKER
           I think everybody could use a drink.

Tucker goes into the kitchen.

                        HEALY
           Look, you asked me to follow your girl
           around, and I did and I started to like
           her, and then I realized I just couldn't in
           good conscience do it.

                        TED
                 (amazed)
           Do what?

                        HEALY
           Turn her over to a stalker.

                        TED
           What?! You're calling me a stalker?

                        HEALY
           That's right--if you weren't you would've
           looked for her yourself!

Suddenly they hear a SOUND and turn to see Bill the Boa slithering
into the room with A HUGE, GREAT-DANE-SIZE LUMP in his midsection.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
                 (sickened)
           Oh Christ...poor dog.

                        TED
           You're a sick man, you know that?

                        HEALY
           Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand
           the fact that it was my turn.

                        TED
           Your turn?

                        HEALY
                 (getting emotional)
           That's right, hot shot! My turn. What's
           the matter with me, huh? Why can't I ever
           get the great girl? Give the big pig with
           the B.O. to Healy, right? Well I was sick
           of it, man! No more--it was my turn. It was
           time for me...time for me...to be happy.

This is so pathetic that it actually gets to Ted. He sits down,
runs his fingers through his hair.

                        TED
           Well you didn't have to blow us both out of
           the water. Jesus Christ, just because she
           found out about you, why'd you have to take
           me down with you?

                        HEALY
           I don't know what you're talking about.

                        TED
           I'm talking about the letter, asshole.

                        HEALY
           What? 

Ted stares at him.

                        TED
           Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a
           letter outlining our deal?

                        HEALY
           Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be
           screwing myself.

The guys stare at one another, then Tucker comes out the kitchen
with a drink. They turn their attention to him.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           You little fuck.

                        TUCKER
           What?

                        HEALY
           You fucking prick, we had a deal--you said
           you wouldn't fuck me and I wouldn't fuck
           you until we had this fuck out of the
           fucking picture.
                 (moves in on Tucker)
           You crossed the line, man.

Tucker backs away nervously. 

                        TUCKER
           Whoa, whoa, you're getting crazy now. Why
           would I cross the line--what do you think I
           got no pride?

Healy grabs Tucker by the neck.

                        TUCKER (cont'd)
           I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You
           probably did it yourself, you piece of
           shit.

                        HEALY
           Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I
           rat myself out?

                        TUCKER
           Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy
           who's idea of courting is blowing farts in
           the chick's face

                        HEALY
           You were following us?

                        TUCKER
           Don't flatter yourself--I was following
           her, I always do. How the hell you think
           I got rid of Mary's boyfriend Steve?

This gets Ted's attention.

                        TED
           You mean...Steve didn't say all that stuff
           about Warren?

                        TUCKER
           Are you shitting me--Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes?
           He was like a fucking eagle scout. You two
           should be kissing my balls--if it wasn't
           for me, she might've married that schmuck!

Ted thinks about this.

                        TED
           The hell with you both--I'm out of here.

Ted walks out the door leaving Healy and Tucker to stare each
other down. Just then Hal the Great Dane walks out of the bedroom
with a CEREAL BOX stuck on his head. Healy does a double-take,
then looks back at the snake.

                        HEALY
                 (sadly)
           Oh...Sully.

                        TUCKER
           Look, if it wasn't you who sent the letter,
           and it wasn't me who sent it?

                                                       CUT TO:

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY

CLOSE ON an alarmed Mary.

                        MARY
           Woogie? What are what are you doing here?

REVERSE ANGLE reveals Dom sitting on her bed.

                        DOM
           Did you get my letter, Mare? The one about 
           Ted?

                        MARY
           You sent that?

                        DOM
           Uh-huh. I was worried about you.

                        MARY
           Well...thank you. But...you know you're not
           supposed to be within four hundred yards of
           me.

                        DOM
                 (excited)
           That's what I want to tell ya. I've been
           through two years of extensive
           psychotherapy and you know what? You were
           right--I needed help.

                        MARY
                 (cautious)
           That's great, Woogie, I'm happy you're
           better--you seem...good--but...you put me
           through quite an ordeal, you know.

Dom nods aggressively.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           I had to move, go to court, change my last
           name--you stole all my shoes!

Dom stands up.

                        DOM
           Look at me.

Mary turns her head.

                        DOM (cont'd)
           Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on
           God above, on everything that is holy to
           me, I did not steal your shoes.

                        MARY
           Woogie, I caught you red-handed.

                        DOM
           All right, I did, but I was in a weird
           place then.

He approaches her.

                        DOM (cont'd)
           Give me a break, Mare, I was nuts!

Mary backs into the living room.

                                                       CUT TO:

INT. HEALY'S CAR - DAY

Healy and Tucker are parked right out front LISTENING TO THIS
CONVERSATION. They seem concerned.

                        MARY (V.O.)
           Woogie, please, you're starting to scare me.

                        HEALY
           Who the hell's Woogie?

Tucker just shrugs.

BACK ON Mary and Dom. =~

                        MARY
           I'm asking you to leave.

                        DOM
                 (gentle)
           Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all
           wrong.
                 (beat)
           I'm not leaving...

BACK IN HEALY'S CAR 
                        DOM (cont'd) (V.O.)
           ...Not until I get a little something to
           remember you by.

                        MARY (V. O . )
                 (clearly struggling)
           Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!!

Healy and Tucker jump out of the car and RUN INTO THE BUILDING.

                                                       CUT TO:

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Healy and Tucker STORM INTO THE ROOM and freeze at what they see.

THEIR POV - Dom is cradling SEVERAL PAIRS OF SHOES in his arms
and trying to crawl to the door while Mary holds him back.

                        MARY
           Stop it!

                        DOM
           Just one pair! You owe me that much, you
           heartless bitch!

Healy and Tucker grab Dom and throw him down on the couch.

                        HEALY
           Dom, you're pathetic, fucking over your
           friend Ted like that.

                        DOM
           What? You fucked him over, too.

                        HEALY
           He's no friend of mine.

Suddenly Magda ENTERS from her bedroom. She's holding a half-eaten
BANANA SPLIT. Herb, the Homeless Man, follows after her, sporting
a Tom Jones and buttoning up his shirt.

                        MAGDA
           What the hell's going on here?

At first no one knows what to say. Then:

                        HEALY
           We're in love with your roommate.

                        MAGDA
           Aw, Christ, I can't take it anymore. I'm
           gonna pack my bags and go back to my own
           place.

Magda heads back into her bedroom and Herb follows.

                        MARY
           Tucker, where are your crutches?

Tucker is stumped for a second, then:

                        TUCKER
                 (British accent)
           Interesting query, Mary...

Healy slaps Tucker in the back of the head.

                        HEALY
           Shut the fuck up and tell her the truth.

Before he can respond, Ted ENTERS.

                        TUCKER
           Well isn't this nice--now we've got the
           whole gang together.

Ted can hardly believe Dom is there.

                        TED
           Dom? What are you?

                        DOM
           You stole her from me. Now I want her back.

                        MARY
                 (rolling eyes)
           Woogie and I went out for awhile in high
           school.

                        TED
                 (stunned)
           You're Woogie?

                        DOM
           Dom Wooganowski. Duh.

                        TED
           But but you're married. You have kids a
           great wife.

                        DOM
           If you're so happy with them, please, be my
           guest.

                        HEALY
           If I may I have a proposal.

Everyone turns to Healy.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           I say none of us leave this room until our
           young Mary here stops jerking us around and
           decides once and for all who she wants. Now
           Mary, I know this is difficult but you
           really will be doing them all a favor to
           tell them the truth about us.

                        MARY
           Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're
           a murderer.

Healy glares at Tucker.

                        TUCKER
           Uh, well...not exactly. You see, I
           exaggerated a little there.

                        MARY
           You mean he's not a criminal?

                        HEALY
           God no!
                 (pleased)
           I'm just a pathological liar!

Mary looks at Tucker, confused.

                        MARY
           Tucker...not you, too?

Tucker lowers his head and reluctantly nods.

                        TUCKER
           Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my
           folks.

                        MARY
           Oh Jesus...

Just then the door opens and BRETT FAVRE, the Packers quarterback
ENTERS, with Warren (wearing a walkman) beside him. Everyone is
stunned.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           Brett...?

                        BRETT FAVRE
           Hi, Mary.

                        HEALY
           What the hell is Brett Favre doing here?

                        BRETT FAVRE
           We're in town to play the Dolphins.

                        TED
           I called him. I told him to pick up Warren
           and get over here.

everyone turns their attention to Ted.

                        TED (cont'd)
           Mary, I found out that your buddy Tucker
           there lied to you about Brett.

Tucker lowers his head.

                        TED (cont'd)
           Brett never said anything bad about Warren.
           He loves Warren...and from what he just
           told me on the phone, he loves you, too.
                 (beat)
           He's the guy you should be with.

                        BRETT FAVRE
           That's right, Mare. And you know I'll
           always be true to you.

                        DOM
           Aw shit, this isn't fair.

Mary manages a smile.

                        TED
                 (to Mary)
           I realized something tonight. I'm no better
           than any of these guys. None of them really
           love you...they just fixated on you because
           of how you made them feel. But that's not
           real love...Thank you for letting me see
           that. Now I can get on with the rest of my
           life.

Tucker, Healy, and Dom scoff.

                        TUCKER
           Oh please...

                        DOM
           Don't listen to him, Mary. It's a ploy.

                        HEALY
           You are so full of shit, Strohman. Are you
           going to stand here and tell us that you
           aren't in love with this girl?

Ted looks into Mary's eyes. She looks vulnerable.

                        TED
           Yeah...that's what I'm telling you.
                 (winks)
           See you, Mare.

Ted looks Mary in the eye, then starts for the door.

                        TED (cont'd)
                 (as he passes Warren)
           See you, Warren.

                        WARREN
           Huh...?

Ted lifts the earphones off Warren's ear.

                        TED
           See you, Warren.

                        WARREN
           Bye, Ted.

Ted then WALKS OUT OF THE ROOM. They all stand there in silence
for a moment, then Dom turns to Brett Favre.

                        DOM
           Hey, Brett, any chance I can get you to
           autograph one of these pumps for me?

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. MIAMI STREET - DAY

Ted is walking down the street BLUBBERING LIKE A SCHOOLGIRL.
Everyone he passes stares at him. Suddenly Mary comes running down
the OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET.

                        MARY
           Ted!

Ted stops and looks across the street at her. He wipes his eyes,
hopeful.

                        TED
           What what are you doing here?

                        MARY
           You forgot your keys!

She holds up a RABBIT FOOT KEY-CHAIN.

                        TED
                 (deflated)
           Oh. Thanks.

They remain across the street from one another.

                        MARY
           Did you mean what you said back there, Ted?

Ted starts to well up again.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           Ted...?

                        TED
                 (looking down)
           I...I just want you to be happy, Mary.

                        MARY
           But I think I'd be happiest...with you.

Ted just stares at her.

                        TED
           You're fucking with me, right?

Mary smiles.

                        TED (cont'd)
                 (wiping eyes)
           But but what about Steve?

                        MARY
           Oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun--the guy
           doesn't even drink beer or gamble.

Now Ted smiles.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           Get over here.

                        TED
           Really?

                        MARY
           Really.

The BEAMING Ted starts walking across the street. Suddenly a BUS
WHIZZES BY AND SMACKS TED BROADSIDE. He bounces around under the
bus like a rag doll, then finally squirts out the back end and
TUMBLES TO A LIMP STOP.

Mary SCREAMS and runs toward the body as a CROWD begins to gather.

                        MARY
           Ted, no, no....!

She starts giving him CPR. Somebody covers him with a blanket.

Just then, another CAR WHIZZES OVER HIS FEET like speedbumps. The
crowd winces.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           Somebody hold up traffic!
                 (beat)
           Come on, Ted. Come on. Tell me you're going
           to be okay.

Then Ted takes a deep breath and his eyes flutter open.

                        TED
           Mary....Oh Mary, I love you.

Mary's smile is as bright as the light from heaven.

                        MARY
           I love you too, Ted.
                 (beat)
           I think I always have.

As the two lovebirds kiss, a LADY CALLS OUT:

                        LADY
           Over here! I found his foot! It was in the
           storm drain!

ON THE LADY as she holds up a SEVERED FOOT in a cloth.

                        MARY
           All right, everyone, let's fan out and look
           for the penis!

As Ted REACTS to this, we pull UP, UP, UP, and

                                                       FADE OUT.

FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT OCTOBER 21, 1997
FADE IN:

EXT. CUMBERLAND, RHODE ISLAND HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING

It's the early 1980's and everyone is arriving at school. We push
through the parking lot crowd to a nervous, lanky kid, TED
PELOQUIN.

                        MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
           When I was sixteen years old I fell in
           love...

CLOSE ON - RENISE, a tough girl with stringy brown hair and a
shiny forehead, as she turns toward the camera.

                        TED
           Hey, Renise.

She barely looks at him as he approaches, just drags on her smoke.

                        RENISE
           Hey.

                        TED
           So what's up?

                        RENISE
           Eh.

                        TED
           Great. Great.
                 (beat)
           So listen, uh, I was wondering if maybe you
           wanted to go to the prom you know, with
           me.

Renise looks unenthused.

                        TED (cont'd)
           It's no big deal, whatever I mean, if you
           want.

                        RENISE
           See, the thing is, I heard a rumor that
           this guy I like was gonna ask me.

                        TED
           Uh-huh.

                        RENISE
           Yeah, so...I'm gonna wait and see what
           happens there...But that sounds great,
           yeah.

Ted nods, confused.

                        TED
           Okay.
                 (beat)
           So is that a yes or a no?

                        RENISE
           I think I was very clear, Ted. If
           everything else falls apart, maybe.

Renise throws down her butt and storms off.

                        TED
           I'm gonna hold you to that.

                                                        CUT TO:

EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE SCHOOL PARKING LOT

ANGLE ON - a pretty girl, MARY, climbing off a ten-speed in the
school parking lot. She's athletic and tanned and doesn't have a
bad bone in her body.

                        MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
           Her name was Mary. She'd moved to our
           little Rhode Island town from Minnesota two
           years earlier.

She locks up the bike and starts walking toward the school.

                        MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
           Mary was very smart, and very cool, and she
           had a faceful of eyes that promised you a
           better life if you could only know her.

As she approaches the camera, we PAN to see Ted watching her. He's
sitting on a picnic table with two FRIENDS.

                        FRIEND #1
           Hey, dirtbud, who you going to the prom
           with?

Finally Ted takes his eyes off Mary.

                        TED
           Ah, I don't know if I'm even gonna. You
           know, not my style.

                        FRIEND #2
           You have a style?

                        FRIEND #1
           Why don't you be a gentleman and ask Rosey?

                        TED
                 (perks up)
           Who?

Friend #1 makes a jerk-off motion.

                        FRIEND #1
           Rosey Palm, your girlfriend. God knows you
           spend enough fucking time with her.

The guys LAUGH.

                        TED
                 (out of ammo but doesn't
                  know it)
           Yeah, and who are you gonna take, your own
           palm?

His friends stare at him.

                        FRIEND #1
           Clever. I like the way you just spun that
           around on me.

Friend #2 notices Mary talking to her FRIENDS.

                        FRIEND #2
           I wonder who she's going with.

                        FRIEND #1
           Some guy named Woogie.

                        TED
           Who?

                        FRIEND #1
           Big guy--goes to Barrington high school.

This irks Ted.

                        TED
           Woogie from Borrington high? Sounds like
           a loser.

                        FRIEND #1
           Loser? Woogie was all-state football and
           and basketball and valedictorian of his
           class.

                        FRIEND #2
           I heard he got a scholarship to Princeton
           but he's going to Europe first to model.

This takes the wind out of Ted's sails.

                        FRIEND #3
           Yeah and he's got a huge cock.

Everyone looks at him.

                        FRIEND #3 (cont'd)
           I heard.

Suddenly Friend #1 NOTICES something.

                        FRIEND #1
           Hey, check it out.

THEIR POV - A large, goofy YOUNG MAN with an unfashionable
crewcut comes walking up the street. He's in his early twenties
and though the weather is mild he's WEARING EARMUFFS. He
approaches a GROUP OF KIDS sitting on a car hood.

                        EAR-MUFF GUY
           You seen my baseball?

                        CAR HOOD KID #2
           No.

The kids watch as the Ear-Muff Guy approaches another group.

                        EAR-MUFF GUY
           You seen my baseball?

           This guy must be in the 'tard squad.
                 (to Ear-Muff Guy)
           Hey, buddy, come here, I think I know where
           your ball is.

The Ear-Muff Guy heads back to the car.

                        EAR-MUFF GUY
           You seen my baseball?

                        CAR HOOD KID #1
           Yeah, I seen it. That girl over there, she
           has it.

Car Hood Kid #1 points to a BUSTY GIRL leaning against another car
talking to her large BOYFRIEND.

                        CAR HOOD KID #2 (cont'd)
           'Cept she doesn't call it a baseball. She
           has another name for it...

boyfriend.

                        EAR-MUFF GUY
           You seen my pecker?

                        GIRL
           What?!

                        EAR-MUFF GUY
           You seen my pecker?

The Boyfriend grabs him by the collar.

                        BOYFRIEND
           You son-of-a-bitch, I'll kick your ass!

The Boyfriend throws the Ear-Muff Guy to the ground and is about
to pummel him when Ted intervenes.

                        TED
           Take it easy, Smokey.

                        BOYFRIEND/SMOKEY
           This fucking pervert just came on to Nance!

                        TED
           All right, just be cool.
                 (under breath)
           He looks like he's not all there, you know
           what I mean?

A crowd starts to gather which only incites Smokey more.

                        BOYFRIEND/SMOKEY
           Get the fuck out of my way, man!

Smokey tosses Ted out of the way and moves toward the Ear-Muff
Guy. Just then Mary shows up and steps between them.

                        MARY
           What's going on here?

She bends down and helps the Ear-Muff Guy off the ground.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           Are you all right?

                        EAR-MUFF GUY
           Mary, you seen my baseball?

                        MARY
           No, I haven't seen your baseball. Jeez,
           Warren, you know you're not supposed to
           leave the yard by yourself.

                        BOYFRIEND/SMOKEY
                 (to Mary)
           You know him?

                        MARY
           He's my brother.

           Oh.
                 (beat)
           I didn't realize he was...you know...

At this, Smokey and his girlfriend reluctantly head toward the
school, along with most of the crowd.

Mary turns her attention in the direction Ted was thrown.

                        MARY
           You okay?

HER POV - Ted is sitting in a mud puddle. He stands and brushes
himself off.

                        TED
           Oh yeah. Fine.

                        MARY
           Thanks a lot, Ted.

CLOSE ON - Ted. He can't believe what he's just heard. As Mary
helps him up, she turns her attention to Warren.

                        MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
           That she knew my name blew my mind. Some of
           my best friends didn't know my name.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING

Mary and a muddied Ted are walking Warren home. Warren lags
behind, mumbling to himself. Mary notices that Ted is limping.

                        MARY
           Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt
           yourself?

                        TED
           No, it's an old football injury.

                        MARY
           Oh, are you on the team?

                        TED
           No, a couple of the players and me were
           joking around and, uh, I fell off the
           school.

Warren approaches and motions for Ted to hop on his back.

                        WARREN
           Piggyback ride?

                        MARY
           Warren, come on, leave Ted alone.

Warren pats his back again.

                        WARREN
           Piggyback ride.

                        TED
                 (to Mary)
           I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.

                        MARY
           Oh he can hold you. He weighs
           two-hundred-and-thirty pounds.

                        TED
           A real Clydesdale, huh Warren?

Ted hops onto Warren's back.

                        TED (cont'd)
           Giddy-up.

Warren walks about five feet and stops.

                        WARREN
           My turn now.

Off Ted's reaction, we

Muddy sweat is running down Ted's face as he struggles up a hill
with Warren on his back.

                        TED
                 (straining)
           We're here, Warren. You wanna get off?

                        WARREN
           Giddy-up.

Ted rolls his eyes and continues toward the front door. Mary looks
on, amused.

                        MARY
           So who you taking to the prom?

                        TED
           Huh?

                        MARY
           The prom--you going?

                        TED
           Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty
           dumb.

                        MARY
           'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go
           if you weren't already taking someone.

                        TED
           I mean dumb in the sense that they only
           happen once a year.

She smiles at this.

           From that moment on the guys at school
           looked at me in a whole new light.

                        FRIEND #1
           Because you're a loser, and in some warped
           way this gives you a momentary sense of
           worth.

                        FRIEND #2

As the others join in, we

EXT. MARY'S HOUSE - TWILIGHT

A tuxedoed and smiling Ted drives up in his parent's station
wagon.

EXT. MARY' S FRONT DOOR - TWILIGHT

Ted knocks on the door and Mary's gruff DAD answers.

                        MARY'S DAD
           Yeah? What do you want?

                        TED
           Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take
           Mary to the prom.

                        MARY'S DAD
           Prom? You're about twenty minutes late. She
           just left for the prom with her boyfriend
           Woogie.

Ted looks devastated. Suddenly the door swings open revealing
MARY'S MOM.

                        MARY'S MOM
           Charlie, that's mean. Come on in, Ted.
           Don't listen to Mr. Wise Guy here. He's a
           joke a minute.

                        TED
           Oh.
                 (relieved)
           Oh, that's a good one.

INT. MARY'S HOUSE - TWILIGHT
Ted nervously enters and sees Warren watching T.V. in the den.

                        TED
           Hey, Warren.

Warren doesn't look his way.

Just then Mary comes down the stairs looking as if the directors
had really taken their time casting this role. Ted can't believe
his eyes.

                        MARY
           Hi, Ted.

                        TED
           Hi, Mary.

                        MARY'S MOM
           Poor Teddy--he's been getting it both
           barrels from the Wisenheimer here.

                        MARY
           Dad, have you been busting Ted's chops?

Mary's Dad shrugs.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           Warren, did you say hi to Ted?

                        WARREN

           'Bout ten times.

                        TED
           Hey, Warren, I think I know where your
           baseball is.

This finally gets Warren's attention.

                        WARREN
           You seen my baseball?

We see Ted discreetly pull a BRAND NEW BASEBALL out of his pocket
and palm it in his hand.

                        TED
           Well, if it's a big white one with red
           stitching, I think I saw it right behind
           your ear ..

Ted is reaching behind Warren's ear when suddenly Warren TAKES A
SWIPE AT HIM, knocking him to the ground.

                        MARY
           Warren!!!

Ted HITS HIS HEAD on the coffee table.

ON THE BASEBALL - as it rolls under the couch, stopping right
next to the OTHER MISSING BALL.

BACK TO SCENE - In a split second, Warren is up like a cat and
DIVES ONTO TED. As MARY AND HER PARENTS SCREAM, Ted manages to
free himself from the disabled man's clutches and GETS WARREN IN A
HEADLOCK.

                        MARY'S DAD
                 (to Ted)
           What the hell are you doing?!

                        MARY'S MOM
           Teddy, let him go!

                        TED
                 (out of breath)
           I'm trying...tell him to...calm down.

The family jumps on Warren and finally break it up.

                        MARY'S DAD (cont'd)
                 (to Ted)
           Jesus Christ, guy, what the hell were you
           doing?!

                        TED
           I was playing a trick. I-I-I had a
           baseball.

                        MARY'S MOM
           What baseball? Where's a baseball?

Ted looks around but there's no ball in sight.

                        TED
           There was a ball I had a honest.

As Mary helps Ted up, we see that his shirttail is out and his tie
is hanging off. Mary's parents lead the frothing Warren back to
the couch.

                        MARY (to Ted)
           I'm sorry. I should've told you, he's got a
           thing about his ears.

                        TED
           Oh. Okay. I gotcha.

                        MARY
           Are you all right?

                        TED
           Oh yeah.

                        MARY'S MOM
                 (to Mary)
           Honey, now you're all wrinkled.

Mary looks down and frowns.

                        MARY
           Ted, will you just give me one more minute?
           I have to iron this thing.

Ted starts to tuck his pants in as Mary and her mother head back
up the stairs. Mary's Dad and Ted are left alone. And Warren.

Ted rubs his head, sees a spot of blood.

                        TED
                 (to Mary's Dad)
           May I use your bathroom?

INT. BATHROOM - TWILIGHT

Ted dabs his head with a tissue, then moves to the toilet. As he
TAKES A LEAK he glances out the window to his left.

TED'S POV - two LOVEBIRDS are perched on a branch.

Ted smiles...

...at the SOUND of these beautiful tweeties singing their love
song for themselves, for the spring, for Ted and Mary, and
suddenly they fly away and we...

SNAP FOCUS 
...to reveal Mary in the bedroom window DIRECTLY BEHIND WHERE THE
BIRDS WERE, in just a bra and panties, and just then her mother
glances Ted's way and MAKES EYE-CONTACT with what she can only
presume to be a leering Peeping Tom.

ON TED...

...he loses the smile and ducks his head back into the bathroom,
HORRIFIED.

PANICKING NOW, he hastily zips up his fly and

                        TED

           What?! No please, sir--

                        MARY'S DAD
           She's a dental hygienist. She'll know what
           to do.

Mary's Mom comes in and closes the door behind her.

                        MARY'S MOM
           Teddy, hon, are you okay?
                 (moving closer, seeing the situation)
           OH HEAVENS TO PETE!

                        TED
           Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.

                        MARY'S MOM
           Just relax, dear. Now, um...what exactly
           are we looking at here?

                        TED

                 (gruff)
           Is it the frank or the beans?

                        TED
           I think a little of both.

Suddenly we hear Warren from outside the door:

                        WARREN (O.S.)
           Franks and beans!

Ted hangs his head.

Mary and Warren are huddled outside the door.

Mary REACTS to this.

           One guess.

           How the hell'd you get the beans all the
           way up top like that?

                        TED
           I don't know. It's not like it was a well
           thought-out plan.

                        MARY'S MOM
           Oh my, there sure is a lot of skin coming
           through there.

                        MARY'S DAD
           I'm guessing that's what the soprano shriek
           was about, pumpkin.

                        MARY'S MOM
           I'm going to get some Bactine.

                        TED
           No, please!

Suddenly a POLICE OFFICER sticks his head in the bathroom window.

                        POLICE OFFICER
           Ho there.

                        TED
                 (humiliated)
           Oh God.

                        POLICE OFFICER
           Everything okay here? Neighbors said they
           heard a lady scream.

                        MARY'S DAD
           You're looking at him. C'mere and take a
           look at this beauty.

                        TED
           No, that's really unneces--

But the Officer's already climbing in the window. Once inside, he
turns his flashlight on Ted and WHISTLES.

                        POLICE OFFICER
           Now I've seen it all. What the hell were
           you thinking?

                        TED
                 (frustrated)
           I wasn't trying--

                        POLICE OFFICER
           Is that bubble what I think it is? 

Mary's parents nod.

                        POLICE OFFICER (cont'd)
           But...how...how'd you get the zipper all
           the way to the top?

                        MARY'S DAD
           Let's just say the kid's limber.

The Officer makes a face, then rolls up his sleeves.

                        POLICE OFFICER
           Well, there's only one thing to do.

                        TED
           No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my
           shirttail out and work on it in the
           morning.

                        POLICE OFFICER
           Look, son, this'll only hurt for a second.

The Officer reaches down and takes hold of the zipper.

                        TED
           No, no, please!

                        MARY'S MOM
           Teddy, be brave.

           Beans and franks!

                        MARY (O.S.)
           Warren, shhh.

Defeated, Ted holds his breath and braces for the worst.

                        POLICE OFFICER
           It's just like pulling off a Band-aid.
           A-one and a-two and...

Mary does as she's told.

Ted, now in his 30's, lays on his therapist's couch.

                        TED
           ...Anyway, school ended a few days later
           and that July her father got transferred to
           Florida.

The CAMERA PANS up to reveal that the CHAIR BEHIND HIM IS EMPTY.
Ted has been telling all this to no one.

                        TED (cont'd)
           It took me half the summer to pay off all
           those bets.
                 (sighs)
           I never did see Mary again. That was about
           twelve years ago.

Just then the door quietly opens and Ted's PSYCHIATRIST tip-toes
back into the room and takes his seat. (He has a dab of mustard on
his chin and has forgotten about the cloth napkin tucked into his
collar.)

                        PSYCHIATRIST
           Uh-huh. Interesting.

The Psychiatrist notices the napkin and quickly wipes his chin,
then tosses it aside.

                        TED
           Anyway, it's not something you exactly
           forget about, but I guess I must've blocked
           it out of my head. Then about a week ago
           I'm driving on the highway and I got to
           thinking about Mary and suddenly I couldn't
           breathe...I couldn't keep up with the flow
           of traffic anymore I felt like I was
           going to die. I pulled into a rest area,
           parked the car, and just started shaking.

The Psychiatrist scratches his chin.

                        PSYCHIATRIST
           You know...rest areas are homosexual
           hang-outs.

                        TED
           Huh?

                        PSYCHIATRIST
           Highway rest areas--they're the bathhouses
           of the nineties for some gay men.

Ted thinks about this, then glances back at the shrink.

Ted and his friend DOM are blasting a couple buckets.

           Gay? He said you were gay?

                        TED
           He implied it.

                        DOM
           Well you're a writer, and a lot of
           writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.

                        TED
           Yeah, but he was successful.

                        DOM
           Let me ask you this: When you smoke a
           cigar, do you ever pretend it has balls?

Ted appears to think about this.

                        TED
           Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.

                        DOM

           assistant.

           Good-looking?

                        DOM
           I just told you, she's half Asian. half
           American. They're all good looking. You
           could mate Don Rickles and Yoko Ono and
           they're going to have a gorgeous kid. It's
           a foolproof combo.

Ted thinks about it.

                        TED
           What's the point? Let's face it, Dom, I'm
           in a slump.
                 (SIGHS)
           Lately I've been feeling like...well...like
           a loser.

                        DOM
           Loser? You?

Ted shrugs.

                        DOM (cont'd)
           Give me a break. Remember five years ago,
           when your kidneys failed? If you were a
           loser would they have been able to find a
           donor with an exact tissue match? What are
           the odds of that, one in a million?

                        TED
           Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got
           killed in an explosion?

                        DOM
           I never said that. I'm saying your lucky
           those kids found his kidneys.
                 (beat)
           Besides, your brother Jimmy never gave a
           shit about you.

Ted gives him a look.

                        DOM (cont'd)
           You know, you're a real glass-is-half-empty
           guy. You got a fucking guardian angel, man.

Ted manages a small smile. Just then, Ted's cell phone RINGS.

                        TED
           I gotta take this, it might be my boss.

           puke!

Whoever it is HANGS UP. Without reacting, Ted closes the phone and
puts it back in his pocket.

EXT. DOM'S HOUSE - DAY

Dom and Ted are drinking beer while sitting on Dom's front steps.
We see signs of kids everywhere: a tricycle, six-foot basketball
hoop, dolls, etc.

DOM'S WIFE comes out and hands them each a cigar.

           I thought you guys might like these with
           your beers.

           Thanks, baby.

She goes back inside.

           See, that's what I want. I don't need these
           bimbettes you got me chasing. I want what
           you have. A family....Someone to...you
           know...love.

These guys don't usually talk about this crap, and Ted gets a
little embarrassed.

           It must be great with a wife like that.

           Mary again.

                        TED
           Look, I admit it was brief, but it was
           definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve
           years.

           Whatever happened to Mary?

                        TED
           I told you, her family moved to Miami.

                        DOM
           I mean since then.

                        TED
           I don't know.

                        DOM

           Yeah, right.

           Why not?

                        TED
           Because I guarantee she's married and has a
           couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay
           single.

                        DOM
           What if you're wrong? You just said she's
           the only girl you ever loved, what have you
           got to lose by calling her?

                        TED
           I did try calling her.

                        DOM
           So that was it? One bump in the road and
           you gave up?

                        TED
           I also called Unsolved Mysteries.

           You're kidding? What did they say?

                        TED
           They told me they don't help out stalkers.
                 (beat)
           Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long
           time.

                        DOM
           I got it--you hire a private eye, fly him
           out there, he follows her around a couple
           days, she'll never know a thing.

Ted considers this.

                        TED
           No. No fucking way. That's too creepy.

Dom thinks a moment, then SNAPS his fingers.

                        DOM
           Wait a second. There's a guy named Healy in
           my office who might be able to help you
           out. He's a claims investigator and he goes
           to Miami every couple weeks.

           He'll do better than that. I'll send him
           down to Miami on business, you throw him a
           couple bucks on the side, and he'll track
           her down.

Ted thinks about this.

                        DOM (cont'd)
           Just let me warn you--This guy runs a
           little hot, but he gets the job done.

INT. HEALY'S CUBICLE - MORNING

Ted is seated inside a small cubicle across the desk from PATRICK
HEALY, a shaggy-looking guy in a mis-matched three-piece suit.
Healy looks more like a used-car salesman than an insurance
investigator.

                        HEALY
           So, Dom tells me you're looking for some
           lady-friend you knew in high school.

                        TED
           Uh-huh.

                        HEALY
           Any idea where I might start looking?

                        TED
           She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago.
           I checked directory assistance down there
           and she's not listed. She might've moved
           ten times since then.

                        HEALY
                 (skeptical)
           All you want is a phone number?

                        TED
           Well, I know you're busy

                        HEALY
           Don't play games with me, Ted.

                        TED
           I don't know, maybe you could poke around
           for a half day and see if she has five kids
           and a Labrador.

                        HEALY
           I don't buy it.

                        TED
           You don't buy what?

Suddenly Healy is in his face.

                        HEALY
           Ted, I'm the kind of guy who shoots from
           the hip. Now I want you to level with me:
           Did you knock this skirt up?

                        TED
                 (indignant)
           No.

                        HEALY
           She's blackmailing you, right?

                        TED
                 (more indignant)
           No.

                        HEALY
           You want her dead, don't you?

                        TED
           You can't be serious.

                        HEALY
           Do you really expect me to believe this is
           a straight stalker case?

                        TED
           I'm not a stalker ! She's a friend of mine.

                        HEALY
           Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted
           number and you haven't heard squat from her
           in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted.
           You're a real piece of work.

                        TED
                 (stands)
           Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the
           whole thing.

                        HEALY
           I get one hundred a day plus expenses.

                        TED
                 (LAUGHS at Healy's nerve)
           You get fifty a day, period. It's a
           business trip, they'll pay for your
           expenses.

Healy thinks about it. 

                        HEALY
           Okay, Ted, I'll do it. But if this chick
           turns up with a toe tag, I'm rolling over
           on you.

ESTABLISHING SHOT - of Miami Beach

EXT. COLLINS AVENUE - DAY

Healy waits alone on a corner carrying one bag and a RACK OF
BEERS. Suddenly a '89 Chrysler Lebaron convertible with a GREAT
DANE in the back SCREECHES to a halt in front of him. The driver,
SULLY, is a muscular, well-groomed man in his thirties.

                        SULLY
           Healy you dog!

                        HEALY
                 (checking out car)
           Fucking Sully! Look at you!

                        SULLY
                 (Boston accent)
           You hot shit. Ya look fuckin' pisser.

INT. CHRYSLER LEBARON - DAY

The dog is catching wind in the backseat and Sully hands Healy a
packet.

                        SULLY
           Here's the info you asked for.

                        HEALY
           Thanks.

                        SULLY
           You should thank me--that girl was not easy
           to find. What'd she scam you out of-some
           insurance dough?

                        HEALY
           Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track
           down his high school girlfriend.

                        SULLY
           Stalker, huh?

                        HEALY
           Big time.

INT. SULLY'S APARTMENT - DAY

This place is modest and clean but it has a direct view of South
Beach. Healy puts his bags down and looks around.

                        HEALY
           Very nice.

                        SULLY
           I'm doing okay.
                 (checks watch)
           I gotta get ready for work.

Sully ducks into the bedroom and Healy looks around the apartment.

                        HEALY
           Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels?
           Looks like you really cleaned up your act.

                        SULLY (O.S.)
           What can I tell you? It's a healthier
           lifestyle down here, and it's easier to
           succeed when your head's clear. Those guys
           I worked with back in Boston, they were a
           bad influence.

                        HEALY
           Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go
           grab a couple drinks.

                        SULLY (O.S.)
           Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.

                        HEALY
           Yeah, and you don't drink any less, right?

Suddenly a huge Boa Constrictor slithers up on Healy's lap.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           What the...?!

Sully comes back in the room wearing a police uniform.

                        SULLY
           Take it easy, that's Bill.

                        HEALY
           Tell Bill to get the fuck off!

                        SULLY
                 (smiling)
           Relax, he just ate.

Healy just stares at his friend.

                        SULLY (cont'd)
                 (proudly)
           Nineteen months I been sober.

                        HEALY
           What are you talking about? You were never
           an alky, you were a cokehead.

                        SULLY
           Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta
           quit the booze, too.

                        HEALY
           Is that right? Well good for you, Sull, I'm
           proud of you.

Healy pops open one of his beers and hands it to Sully.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           Here, just have one of these then.

                        SULLY
           Healy, what I just tell you?

                        HEALY
           This is a light beer. You can't have a
           light beer?

                        SULLY
           No I can't.

Healy stares at him, baffled.

                        HEALY
           Sully, it's one fuckin' beer for Christ
           sakes.
                 (holds up beer)
           Ooh, the big bad beer's gonna get ya.

Sully stares at the beer, weakening.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           I'm worried about you, man. You better
           learn to have a pop once in a while or
           you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're
           being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.

                        SULLY
           Am I?

                        HEALY
           Bet your ass you are. Now I don't want to
           hear anymore of your happy horseshit. You
           gotta learn how to bend a little or believe
           me...you're gonna break.

Finally, Sully takes the beer. He stares at it a moment and then
sips.

                        SULLY
           Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't
           even taste good to me anymore.

                        HEALY
           Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are
           you, spotting?

Healy takes the beer from Sully and as he chugs it, we

INT. CHRYSLER LEBARON - DAWN

Healy is on a stakeout. He's dozing. He's been here for hours,
food wrappers litter Sully's car. He's wearing Walkman-type
HEADPHONES which are connected to a RADIO SURVEILLANCE MICROPHONE
attached to a pair of BINOCULARS.

Suddenly MUSIC explodes through his headphones--Healy's jolted
awake. Who threw the grenade? Recovering, Healy aims the
binoculars toward...

HEALY'S POV - MARY'S APARTMENT ACROSS THE STREET

Healy has a clear, unobstructed view into Mary's apartment. The
music is coming from Mary's clock radio. MARY sits up in bed and
shakes herself awake, like someone's just poured cold water over
her. She cranks the music even LOUDER. Mary hops out of bed,
wearing only her panties, and though she's a little older now, she
still looks well cast.

CLOSE UP - ON HEALY - he's become extremely interested in his
work. As much as Healy's enjoying the show, he's got a job to
do--he speaks into a MICRO-CASSETTE RECORDER:

                        HEALY
                 (into recorder)
           Okay, Ted, I found your Mary. Her current
           address, two-niner-eight Euclid Avenue,
           Miami Beach. Husband, negative. Children
           and Labrador, negative. Extremely nice ass,
           affirmative.

INT. MARY'S APT. - DAY

Mary walks into the living room where we see an old woman, MAGDA,
sitting on the couch LISTENING to a stack of RADIO SCANNERS.

                        MARY
           Have you been up all night again?

                        MAGDA
           Bet your ass I have. It's an important job,
           Neighborhood Watch is.

                        MARY
           Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call
           listening in on stranger's phone
           conversations?

                        MAGDA
           These ain't strangers, they're neighbors.
           This only picks up signals in a half-mile
           radius.

                        MARY
           Meaning?

                        MAGDA
           Meaning these are the people you live
           amongst, you got a right to know if they're
           creeps. For instance, did you know there's
           a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?

                        MARY
                 (feigning shock)
           You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta
           move.

                        MAGDA 
           I confirmed it on the scanner. I knew
           something was up because Puffy used to bark
           like hell whenever he saw him and you know
           Puffy only barks at bad people.

Magda pats her little dog PUFFY on the head.

                        MARY
           Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.

                        MAGDA
           That's because there's a lot of bad people
           out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you
           about that Steve guy you was seeing--he was
           a fucking asswipe--but you had to find out
           for yourself, didn't you?

                        MARY
           Okay, you win. Now try to get some sleep,
           huh.

Mary gives Magda a kiss and heads to her bedroom.

MUSIC MONTAGE - as Healy follows Mary around town.

EXT. EUCLID AVENUE - MORNING

Mary exits her apartment and bounces out into the world. There is
a HOMELESS MAN sitting on the sidewalk. Mary flips him an apple,
then jumps in her Honda Civic and drives off.

EXT. DRIVING RANGE - MORNING

Mary is at the range HITTING a couple buckets of balls.

ON HEALY - watching from the parking lot.

                        HEALY
                 (into mic)
           Looks like we got an athlete on our hands.

EXT. MACDONALD'S DRIVE-THRU WINDOW - MORNING

Mary waits in the drive-thru lane reading the SPORTS PAGE. Finally
the window opens and she is handed a HUGE BAG OF FOOD.

PAN TO Healy watching from his car.

                        HEALY
                 (into mic)
           Well, from her figure and her appetite, I'm
           guessing she's either got a bowel disorder
           or we've got a hurler on our hands.

EXT. SPECIAL ED. CENTER - MORNING

Mary's brother Warren is wearing a walkman as he plays catch out
front with a SPECIAL ED TEACHER while several other
MENTALLY-DISABLED PATIENTS entertain themselves.

Mary pulls up, gets out, and starts handing out Egg McMuffins.

                        MARY
           Get in line. One at a time.

A fat patient, GARY, approaches.

                        GARY
           Can I have two, Mary?

                        MARY
           Yeah, you can have two halves, just like
           everyone else.

                        GARY
           Thanks.

Gary takes his and walks off. A couple more patients and then
bucktoothed FREDDIE steps up to her.

                        FREDDIE
           Will you marry me, Mary?

                        MARY
           Oh yeah, pretty boy? And what about
           Dolores?

Mary points to another PATIENT staring bashfully at Freddie.

                        FREDDIE
           Would you marry us both, Mary?

                        MARY
           Yeah, that'd be a good deal for you,
           wouldn't it?

Freddie moves off and fat Gary is back, trying to be
inconspicuous.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           Wow, this is weird. There was somebody who
           looked just like you here a minute ago.

Mary smiles and hands Gary another McMuffin.

EXT. BEACH BAR - DAY

Neighborhood restaurant and bar. After-work crowd. Mary and her
friends, BRENDA, LISA, and JOANIE are sitting at a table under an
umbrella. Lisa reads from the PERSONALS COLUMN in South Beach
Magazine.

                        LISA
           Listen to this one--'Seeking sensitive Wasp
           doctor to share candlelit dinners, long
           walks in Coconut Grove, marriage.'

                        BRENDA
           What does this girl want, a corpse? You
           gotta be more specific: 'Seeking deaf mute
           with three pound cock and trust fund.'

                        JOANIE
           No, it should be 'a hockey player with
           great pecs.'

                        MARY
           Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those
           guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana
           hammock.

PAN TO the bar where we see Healy eavesdropping on their
conversation.

                        BRENDA (O.S.)
                 (to Mary)
           I suppose you wouldn't like someone with a
           washboard stomach like Brad Pitt?

BACK ON Mary and friends.

                        MARY
           I'm just saying I don't mind a guy with a
           bit of a beer belly. It means he's a guy.
           You can have those pretty boys who hang out
           in a gym all day staring at their
           reflections.

ON HEALY 
                        HEALY
                 (quietly into mic)
           A girl after your own heart, Ted.

BACK ON Mary and friends.

                        JOANIE
           I can live with those reflections.

                        MARY 
           I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies.
           Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer
           and playing thirty-six holes and still has
           enough energy to take me and Warren out to
           a ballgame.

                        JOANIE
                 (sarcastic)
           Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going
           to find a guy like that.

                        MARY
           But here's the rub. The guy I'm talking
           about has got to be self-employed.

                        LISA
           You mean, like an architect or something?

                        MARY
           Architect, yeah.

BRENDA You mean creative, but not poor.

                        MARY
           No, it's not the money. Creative, yeah,
           that's good, but it's the freedom I'm
           talking about. See, this guy has to have a
           job he could do anywhere. That way we could
           just up and leave at the drop of a hat.

                        LISA
           And where would you and your beer-bellied
           architect be leaving to?

                        MARY
           I don't know. The Super Bowl, New Orleans
           Jazz Festival...maybe a couple months in
           Nepal.

                        JOANIE
           Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy
           halfway to Katmandu.

                        MARY
           What's that supposed to mean?

                        JOANIE
           It means you're too hard on guys.

                        MARY
           No I'm not.

                        JOANIE
           Oh come off it, Mare. What about
           what's-his-name...Steverino? You could've
           at least passed the baton on that one.

The girls LAUGH.

                        MARY
           Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for
           awhile.

                        JOANIE
           All right for awhile? The guy's
           good-looking, rich, witty. He was a god.

                        LISA
           At one point you were talking about
           marrying him. Come on, why'd you dump him?

Mary thinks about this.

                        MARY
           I don't know, it was complicated. He's in
           San Francisco, I'm in Miami.
                 (dodging question)
           Besides, Magda's psychic dog hated him.

                        JOANIE
           Is that old crab still with you? Mary, you
           said you were putting her up for a
           month--it's been a year and a half.

                        MARY
           Ah, she's okay.

                        LISA
           Mary, cut the crap, what really happened
           with Steve?

                        MARY
           Nothing. I mean, you know my brother.
                 (sighs)
           Warren.

                        JOANIE
           What? Steve seemed to put up with Warren.

                        MARY
           I don't want someone who'll put up with
           him. I want someone who will enjoy him, the
           way I do. Do you know what he told my
           friend Tucker? He said he would've popped
           the question a lot earlier if Warren wasn't
           in my life.
                 (beat)
           Well he is in my life and I'm goddamn
           lucky to have him. The hell with Steve.

Everyone is touched by this. Then:

                        BRENDA
           Well, that's the last time I blow him
           behind your back.

As the girls LAUGH, we

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. MARY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Healy sits out front in his car again waiting for Mary to get
home. He picks up the phone, dials a number, and someone answers
but doesn't speak.

                        HEALY
           Hello...? Sully...?
                 (beat)
           Sully, that you?

                        SULLY (V.O.)
                 (over phone)
           Who the fuck is it to you?

                        HEALY
           Sully, it's Healy. What's going on over
           there?

INT. SULLY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Sully is sitting on the kitchen floor in his police uniform, a
ring of white around his nostrils. The room is littered with beer
cans, he has another one in his hand, there's a pile of cocaine
and a rolled-up bill on the breakfast table. The dog and the snake
are in the doorway looking at him with concern.

                        SULLY
                 (into phone, sloshed)
           Fuckin' Patrick Healy, you think your shit
           don't stink. Well I got news for
           you--you're goddamn right it don't! How the
           hell are ya?!

INT. HEALY'S CAR - NIGHT

Healy looks at the phone, concerned.

                        HEALY
           Uh, I'm fine. Just wanted to let you know
           I'll have your car back in a couple hours,
           I'm still staking out this girl's
           apartment.

                        SULLY (V.O.)
           You found my car?!

Just then Healy notices Mary pull up and park. He slides down in
his seat.

ON MARY - she gets out carrying a bag and approaches the
Homeless Man, who is still sitting on the sidewalk. She hands him
the bag.

                        HOMELESS MAN
           Thanks, Mary.

                        MARY
           You watch out for yourself, Herb.

As Mary bounds up the steps of her building, we

HOLD ON the Homeless Man as he happily takes a sandwich and soda
out of the bag.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

As Mary rushes into the apartment, Magda is glued to her radio
scanner, listening intently.

                        MAGDA
           Jesus, Mary, you gotta hear this--some
           cop's staking out this broad's apartment.

                        MARY
           No time, Magda, my show's starting.

BACK ON HEALY...

... he can hear the conversation through the SURVEILLANCE EQUIPMENT
pointed at Mary's place.

                        MAGDA (V.O.)
           This is a good one, Mare. Sounds like his
           partner's all lubed up.

                        HEALY
                 (quietly into phone)
           Call you back.

                        SULLY
                 (over phone)
           God, I miss ya, ya fuck-

Healy hangs up abruptly.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

                        MAGDA
           Ah, Christ, I lost 'em.

Mary runs into her bedroom, shuts the door and flips on the tube
just as ESPN Sportscenter's OPENING THEME SONG is playing.
Relieved, Mary lays back on her bed and starts watching.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MARY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Mary is now watching Andy Griffith while SMOKING A JOINT and
GIGGLING away in bed.

ON HEALY - he's sitting in his car, GIGGLING, too.

                        HEALY
           Fucking Barney...he never learns...

INT. MARY'S ROOM - NIGHT

As the show's end credits start to WHISTLE AWAY, Mary stands and
starts to UNDRESS for bed.

BACK ON HEALY - he sits up, very interested now.

                        HEALY
                 (into mic)
           Here we go, Teddo. Here comes the money
           shot.

Healy quickly reaches in the back seat and pulls out a bigger,
MORE POWERFUL PAIR OF BINOCULARS.

HEALY'S BINOCULAR POV - we're CLOSE ON the wrinkliest,
saggiest, droopiest set of milkbags on the planet.

ON HEALY - he cringes.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           Oooof. First chink in the armor, Teddy
           Boy....

HEALY'S BINOCULAR POV - He moves his view up from the tits to
reveal...MAGDA UNDRESSING for bed.

ON HEALY - He flinches, sickened by his mistake, then
repositions the binoculars dead left to the next window.

HEALY'S BINOCULAR POV - moving over to the next window we see...
Mary as she just finishes putting on some sexy t-shirt.

ON HEALY - as he starts to drool.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           Oh sweet Jesus

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. PROVIDENCE - THE HOT CLUB - DAY

Ted is sitting alone having a beer when a smiling Healy
approaches.

                        HEALY
           I've got some very, very good news for you,
           my friend.

                        TED
           Really?
                 (perking up)
           Very, very?

Healy sits down and motions for a beer.

                        HEALY
           I think your life's about to change.

                        TED
           So you found Mary?

                        HEALY
           Right there in Liberty City. And you were
           right, she's really something.

                        TED
                 (smiles)
           So she hasn't changed?

                        HEALY
           That I couldn't. say. Let me ask you
           something: Was she a little big-boned
           in high school?

                        TED
           No, not at all.

                        HEALY
           Well she must've packed on a few pounds
           over the years.

This doesn't dampen Ted's enthusiasm.

                        TED
           Mary's a little chubby, huh?

                        HEALY
           I'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half.
           Not bad.

Ted's smile starts to fade.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           But you know, you shit out a bunch of kids,
           you're going to put on a few pounds.

                        TED
           So she's married?

                        HEALY
           Nope. Never been.

                        TED
           Huh?

                        HEALY
           Four kids, three different guys.

                        TED
           Three different guys?

                        HEALY
           Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two
           whites, and a midget.

                        TED
           Oh my.

                        HEALY
           Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to
           keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.

                        TED
           She's in a wheelchair?!

Ted looks completely drained.

                        HEALY
           Don't look so shocked, it's been a long
           time. I bet you've changed a lot over the
           last twelve years, haven't you?

                        TED
                 (shrugs)
           It's just that...Mary. I wouldn't have
           thought...

                        HEALY
           Anyway, the good news is I have all the
           information you need. Got it from her
           bookie--nice guy. You should definitely
           call her, Ted. I mean she's a real
           sparkplug, that one. She seems determined
           to get those rugrats off welfare and with
           your help I'll bet she does it.

Ted stands and starts moping away.

                        TED
           Thanks, Healy. Good work.

                        HEALY
           Ted? Don't you want the name of the
           housing project?

                        TED
           Uh, that's okay.

                        HEALY
           You sure, big guy? I'll bet she'd love to
           hear from you before her mastectomy!

As Ted leaves, Healy puts his feet up on the table and sits back.

INT. TED'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

We PAN across the room of unopened boxes to Ted laying awake in
bed. We hear HEAD-BANGER MUSIC coming from the apartment next
door. Finally Ted gets up and walks over to his dresser. As he
flips on a small light we see loose change, a balled-up Kleenex, a
few golf tees, and Ted's wallet. Ted picks up the wallet and opens
it.

TED'S POV - Inside is an an old high school photo of a smiling
Mary.

As Ted looks at it, he can't help but smile, too.

INT. PROVIDENCE UNION INSURANCE COMPANY - DAY

ON HEALY'S CUBICLE - Healy's taking his last boxload of crap out
of his cubicle when he spots Ted. He tries to duck back in but
Ted sees him. Healy forces a smile as Ted approaches.

                        TED
           What are you doing?

                        HEALY
           Oh, uh, I resigned.

Ted picks up a plane ticket off the desk.

                        TED
           Miami?

                        HEALY
           Yeah, this insurance business is too slow
           for me. I'm going to go down and try my
           hand at jai alai.

                        TED
           Jai alai?

                        HEALY
           Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at
           home in the fronton.

Healy starts walking out of the office and Ted follows. Healy is
having a hard time looking him in the eye. So he doesn't.

                        TED
           Look, uh, I've been thinking about
           everything you told me. 

                        HEALY
           Good good.

                        TED
           Well I think you're right, I should look 
           her up.

                        HEALY
           Rollerpig? Are you nuts?

                        TED
           But you said she was a sparkplug...?

                        HEALY
           I said buttplug. She's heinous.

Ted SIGHS and follows Healy out the front door.

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

They walk across the lot toward Healy's car.

                        TED
           All the same, I still want to call her. I
           know it sounds crazy--Mary sure has a lot
           of troubles in her life--but, I don't know,
           maybe I can help her out.
                 (sighs)
           The poor thing's had it tough--she's in a
           wheelchair for Godsakes.

                        HEALY
           It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal.

                        TED
           Oh. I thought
                 (beat)
           That's not it anyway. I know this doesn't
           make any sense to you, but I just can't
           turn it off that fast. I still feel
           something for her.

Healy comes to his car and puts his stuff in the trunk.

                        HEALY
           Okay, tell you what: I'll get her number
           for you just as soon as she gets back from
           Japan.

                        TED
           Japan? What's she doing in Japan?

                        HEALY
           You've heard of mail-order brides? Well
           they go that way, too.

Ted is devastated. 

                        TED
           Mary's a mail-order bride?

                        HEALY
           Fetched a pretty penny, too. Don't forget,
           it's the Sumo culture, they pay by the
           pound there. Sort of like tuna.

Off Ted's look, we

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. THE HOT CLUB - DAY

Ted and Dom are having a beer and a dog.

                        TED
           That's it, I'm making an oath. I'll never
           procrastinate about anything again. Life is
           too fucking short. 

                        DOM
           Hey, look on the bright side--

                        TED
                 (interrupting)
           What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?

                        DOM
           Well...at least now you know.

                        TED
           I think it was better when I didn't. It was
           kind of inspiring to know there was someone
           so pure in the world.

As Ted dwells on this, Dom bursts out LAUGHING.

                        TED
           What's so funny?

                        DOM
           I'm sorry, it's just that you're taking
           this all wrong, pal. Don't you see? You're
           liberated. I feel liberated. I mean here
           you've been in therapy thinking you blew it
           with the greatest girl ever, and it turns
           out that getting your dick stuck in your
           zipper was the best thing that ever
           happened to you! 

Ted flinches at this.

                        TED

           Christ, Ted, I was only four towns away. 

Ted thinks it over.

                        TED
           Maybe you're right. I should look on the
           bright side. I mean, I've still got my
           health...

           the guy?

EXT. MIAMI - DRIVING RANGE - DAY

Healy pays for a bucket of balls, then takes his clubs and strolls
jauntily to...

A GOLF TEE NEXT TO MARY'S 
Healy places a ball on the tee and takes a swing. He tops the ball
and it dribbles about ten yards.

                        HEALY
           Hit a house! Bite bite!
                 (to Mary)
           Haven't swung the wrenches in a while.

Mary nods. Healy takes another swing and duck-hooks one about
fifty yards. Mary addresses her ball, takes a smooth backswing,
and

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           Hey, can you give me some tips here?

She cracks her shot long and straight.

                        MARY
           Yeah, don't talk in someone's backswing.

                        HEALY
           Thanks.

Mary tees up another ball and Healy puts down his club.

                        HEALY (cont'd) 
           I'm gonna get a soda, you want one?

                        MARY
                 (annoyed)
           No thanks.

Healy pulls out a huge wad of change from his pocket.

                        HEALY
           Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar?
           All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins.

                        MARY
                 (interested)
           Nepal? Have you been?

                        HEALY
           Not in months. I don't even know why I
           bought the damn place.

                        MARY
           You own a home there?

                        HEALY
           Well...it's just a condo really. Right
           outside Katmandu.

                        MARY
           Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to
           go. Is it true the mountains are so tall
           you can't see the tops?

                        HEALY
           Not 'til you get about three hundred yards
           from the summit. That's been my experience
           anyway.

She looks impressed. Healy looks at his watch. 

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           You know, I should just get going. I'll
           work on my game next week.

He flips her a coin.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           Here. Spend it on your trip to Katmandu.

                        MARY
                 (smiles)
           Thanks.

Healy starts to walk off. Mary doesn't know what to do. Will she
ever see this guy again?

                        MARY (cont'd)
                 (CALLS after him)
           It was nice meeting you!

Healy doesn't answer or turn around. He just raises his hand and
gives her a little wave.

Mary shrugs her shoulders. Oh well...

EXT. DRIVING RANGE PARKING LOT - DAY

Healy is sitting in Sully's Chrysler LeBaron, right next to Mary's
Honda Civic.

He watches the rear-view mirror, and the moment he sees Mary
coming out from the driving range, he swings his legs out the door
and starts changing out of his golf shoes. As Mary tosses her
golf bag into the trunk, she notices Healy tying his shoes. A
second chance.

                        MARY
           Well, it was nice meeting you, again.

                        HEALY
           Same here again.

                        MARY
           By the way, what's your name?

                        HEALY
           Pat Healy.

There's an uncomfortable pause...Why doesn't this guy ask the
usual questions?

                        MARY
           Don't you want to know my name?

                        HEALY
           I already know it, Mary.

                        MARY
                 (surprised)
           How'd you know that?

                        HEALY
           It's right there on your golf bag.

Healy opens the back door to put away his golf shoes. Suddenly,
rolls and rolls of paper come tumbling out. Mary bends over to
help Healy pick them up.

                        MARY
           What are you doing with all these
           blueprints?

                        HEALY
           Some buildings I'm working on.

                        MARY
           Are you...an architect?

                        HEALY
           Well, just until I get my PGA Tour card.

Mary stares at him, mouth agape.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           I'm kidding. Yeah, I guess you could call
           me an architect--it's just a job really, a
           way to keep me moving. My real passion is
           my hobby.

                        MARY
           What's that?

                        HEALY
           I work with retards.

                        MARY
                 (taken aback)
           I beg your pardon?

                        MARY
                 (put off)
           Isn't that a little politically incorrect?

                        HEALY
           The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me
           who I can and can't work with.

                        MARY
           No, I mean

           --There's this one kid, we call him Mongo
           on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out
           of his cage once and--

                        MARY
           --He's in a cage?! 

                        HEALY
           Well it's more of an enclosure really.

                        MARY
           They keep him confined? That's bullshit!

                        HEALY
           That's what I said, so I went out and got
           him a leash you know, one of those
           clothesline runners for the backyard. He's
           got plenty of room out there to dig. The
           kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him
           to ball games, movies--you know, happy
           stuff.

                        MARY
           That sounds like fun.

                        HEALY
           Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven
           for me.

           Those goofy bastards are just about the
           best thing I have in this crazy old world.

                 (baby talk)
           Oh, Pufferball likes his little tum-tum
           rubbed, doesn't he now?

                        MARY
           Wow, I've never seen him like this. He
           doesn't usually like guys.

                        MAGDA
           You mean he doesn't like bad guys.

                        HEALY
           'That right?

                        MAGDA
           He can tell you're an animal nut. You are,
           aren't ya?

                        HEALY
           Truth is I usually get along better with
           animals than with people. In Nepal the
           villagers call me 'Kin-tan-tee', which
           means 'man who is loved by many animals...
                 (babbling)
           ...who love him a lot, too...and so on.'

Magda stares dreamily at Healy, smitten.

                        MAGDA
           Would you like a glass of tea or something?

                        HEALY
           You got a brew?

                        MARY
           Sure.
                 (noticing Magda's trance)
           Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more
           cheese and crackers...?

                        MAGDA
           Oh, yeah, of course, dear.

The two women go into the kitchen and Healy is left to pet the
MOTIONLESS DOG. Suddenly Healy notices that the dog is A LITTLE
TOO MOTIONLESS. Healy checks Puffy's pulse. He looks at his watch
to time the rate.

                        MARY (O.S.)
                 (CALLING out)
           Sorry, Pat, out of beer. You like vodka?

                        HEALY
                 (CALLING out)
           Great.

He starts SHAKING THE DOG, but Puffy doesn't move. Healy goes into
action. He starts pressing on his heart, PERFORMING DOGGIE CPR.
One-and-two-and-three, he continues trying to revive him.

                        MAGDA (O.S.)
                 (CALLING out)
           Would you like a little clam-dip, honey?

                        HEALY
                 (CALLING out)
           No, thanks.
                 (panicking)
           Love a little bundt cake if you have some!

INT. MARY'S KITCHEN - SAME

Magda and Mary are on their way out the door when they stop.

                        MAGDA
           Bundt cake?

                        MARY
                 (shrugs)
           Must have a sweet tooth. See if you can
           find some cookies.

As Magda starts to go through the cupboards...

INT. MARY'S FAMILY ROOM - SAME

A panicked Healy is giving the little mutt MOUTH-TO-MOUTH now.
Then back to the heart, the mouth, the heart, the mouth....

                        HEALY
                 (quietly, desperately, to Puffy)
           Come on, man, stay away from the light!

Healy resumes blowing into the dog's snout, pumping his chest,
with no results. Desperate, he picks up the cheese knife and
quickly SLICES THE WIRES ON TWO TABLE LAMPS.

Healy grabs the two wires and TOUCHES THEM TOGETHER LIKE A
DEFIBRILLATOR on the little pooch's chest.

ZZZZZTTTTTT - the dog BOUNCES a couple feet off the couch as
SPARKS FLY.

Healy takes his pulse again. Nothing. He ZAPS him once more with
the LIVE WIRES.

ZZZZZTTTTT - Still nothing. Healy gets to his feet and peeks
into the kitchen. When he turns his back, we see PUFFY IGNITE IN
FLAMES.

When Healy turns back, he's horrified at what he sees. He grabs a
vase of flowers and POURS THE WATER ON THE BURNING DOG.

With this, Puffy flinches and comes to, GASPING FOR AIR!

                        MAGDA
           All I had was some Funny Bones--how does
           that sound, honey?

Healy picks up the stunned pooch and swaddles it in a blanket as
Magda ENTERS the room followed by Mary.

                        HEALY
                 (petting dog)
           Fine. Fine.

                        MARY
           Here you go.
                 (sniffs)
           What's that smell?

Mary hands Healy his vodka and as he downs it, we

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. MIAMI MUSEUM - NIGHT

Healy looks slightly disoriented as Mary leads the way into the
courtyard area by the main building.

                        HEALY
           The museum? I thought we were going out to
           dinner?

                        MARY
           We will, but first I have a surprise.

                        HEALY
           A surprise?

                        MARY
           The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker
           is going to be here. He's an architect,
           too. You guys will have tons to talk about.

CLOSE ON HEALY'S FACE as he starts to panic.

INT. ARCHITECTURE EXHIBIT

Mary and Healy walk through the exhibit area. Mary scans the room
for her friend. Healy's face is ashen.

                        MARY
           I know he's around here someplace.

                        HEALY
                 (chipper)
           What say we get outta here and go crush a
           bucket?

                        MARY
           We just got here thirty seconds ago. Isn't
           this stuff great?

Mary points to an architectural model.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           Is this one art deco or art nouveau?

                        HEALY
           Deco.

                        MARY
           Would you call that a portico or a
           vestibule?

                        HEALY
           That...? Vestibule.

                        MARY
           How about--?

                        HEALY
           When you look at architecture, try not to
           concern yourself with the pieces--look at
           the building in its totalitarianism.

Mary gives him a look. Suddenly, Healy draws a couple of invisible
sixshooters at her.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           Stone crab time! Come on, let's get outta
           here, goofy.

He turns to go but Mary notices something O.S.

                        MARY
           Tucker!

Mary leads Healy over to her friend TUCKER, a
distinguished-looking man in his fifties. Healy looks like a dog
that's being dragged to the vet. Mary and Tucker embrace.

                        TUCKER
                 (still hugging)
           Come on, like you mean it.

Mary LAUGHS and hugs Tucker tighter. Then:

                        MARY
           Tucker, this is my friend Pat Healy.
           Healy and Tucker shake hands.

                        TUCKER
           Pleasure to meet you, Patrick.

                        HEALY
           Same here.

                        MARY
           Pat's an architect, too.

                        TUCKER
           Hey, no kidding? Where are your offices?

                        HEALY
                 (keeping cool)
           Mainly I work out of Boston. 

                        TUCKER
           Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up
           there?

                        HEALY
           Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.

                        TUCKER
           Harvard?

                        HEALY
           You bet.

                        TUCKER
                 (pleased)
           Did you study under Kim Greene?

                        HEALY 
           Among others.

                        TUCKER
           Kim and I are close friends!

                        HEALY
           Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.

                        TUCKER
           You mean him.

BEAT.

                        HEALY
           Well...that's debatable.

Healy makes a hand-gesture to imply that Kim's sexuality is in
doubt.

                        TUCKER
           Really? But he's been married for twenty
           years--they've got six kids.

                        HEALY
           Nice smokescreen, isn't it?

Tucker can hardly believe his ears.

                        MARY
           Pat does projects all over the world.

                        TUCKER
                 (impressed)
           Where would I have seen your work?

                        HEALY
           Have you been to
                 (thinking hard)
           Let's see--Santiago, Chile?

                        TUCKER
           Absolutely! I was there twice last year.
           Which building is yours?

                        HEALY
           Do you know the...soccer stadium?

                        TUCKER
           Did you build the Estadio Olympico?

                        HEALY
           No...just down the street, the Amigo Tower.

                        TUCKER
           I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What
           style?

                        HEALY
           Uh, sort of nouveau deco...with a big
           vestibule. Check it out next time you're up
           there.

Tucker starts to look a little suspicious.

                        TUCKER
           You know, I really should take your card.

                        HEALY
                 (noticing something)
           Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a
           minute, Tucker?

Healy drags Mary across the room toward a MAN who's looking at an
exhibit.

                        HEALY
                 (to Man)
           Dooby, you old sheep-fucker! How the hell
           are ya?

                        MAN
           My name's Mel.

                        HEALY
           Oh, sorry. Anyone ever tell you you look
           just like Jim Dubois?

                        MAN
           The sheepfucker?

Healy shrugs and the man walks away angrily.

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

A two-door Toyota Tercel flies by the camera.

INT. TOYOTA TERCEL

A determined Ted is cruising along the highway in his rent-a-car.
He has a cup of coffee in his hand and a HITCHHIKER in the seat
beside him. The Hitchhiker sits with a LARGE RED DUFFEL BAG
between his legs.

                        HITCHHIKER
           Thanks for picking me up. 

                        TED
           No prob, I could use the company. I've been
           on the road going on fifteen hours
           straight.

                        HITCHHIKER
           I know how you feel--I been standing in the
           same spot for the last five hours. You know
           it's against the law to pick up a
           hitchhiker in this state.

                        TED
           That must make it tough.

                        HITCHHIKER
           Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of
           salesman or something?

                        TED
           Nah. I'm...I'm nothing.

                        HITCHHIKER
           Oh. Well I am.

                        TED
           Hm?

                        HITCHHIKER
           A salesman--that's what I am. I mean, I'm
           gonna be anyway. I'm starting my own
           company--video sales--just as soon as I get
           enough seed money.

                        TED
           'That right? Good for you.

                        HITCHHIKER
           Yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea--it's a
           home run. You ever hear of Eight-Minute
           Abs?

                        TED
           The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on
           T.V.

                        HITCHHIKER
           Two million copies it sold last year. Two
           million, man. But not next year--my idea's
           gonna blow them outta the water. Get this:
                 (dramatic pause)
           Seven-Minute Abs.

BEAT.

                        TED
           I see where you're going.

                        HITCHHIKER
                 (big smile)
           Think about it. You walk into a video
           store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and
           right next to it you see Seven-Minute
           Abs--which one you gonna spring for?

                        TED
           I'd go with the seven.

                        HITCHHIKER
           Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll
           get every bit as good a work-out.

                        TED
           How do you guarantee that?

                        HITCHHIKER
           Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't
           happy we'll send you the extra minute.'

                        TED
           Huh. That sounds great.
                 (beat)
           Unless someone else comes out with
           Six-Minute Abs.

Ted CHUCKLES, but the Hitchhiker just GLARES at him, unamused.

                        TED (cont'd)
                 (unaware)
           I'm gonna pull over. I gotta take a leak.

EXT. REST AREA - NIGHT

The Toyota Tercel pulls in and parks. Ted gets out and walks into
the bushes to whiz.

ON TED - as he steps into the dark brush UNZIPPING his fly he
TRIPS over something and FALLS TO THE GROUND.

                        TED
           What the--?

Suddenly WHOOSH, WHOOSH, WHOOSH--several huge SPOTLIGHTS
illuminate the area revealing

TWO DOZEN FRIGHTENED MEN scurrying to pull their pants up all
around him.

A GUY with his pants at his ankles jumps on the bandwagon.

                        PANTS AT ANKLES GUY
           That's right! I-I-I was just pissing!

Ted glares at him.

                        TED
           No! I was pissing!

                        POLICE OFFICER
           Yeah, I'll bet you all were. Come on, in
           the truck.

As they grab Ted and the others and hustle them away, we

PAN TO the Hitchhiker sitting in the Toyota watching the raid
unfold.

The Hitchhiker is clearly PANICKY at the sight of all the cops.

Quietly he OPENS THE CAR DOOR, ducks down, and then SPRINTS AWAY
INTO THE WOODS UNSEEN, LEAVING HIS BIG RED BAG BEHIND.

Healy and Mary are walking home at the end of their date. Healy is
eating a big, wild cone of COTTON CANDY and drinking a beer.

           she rents the apartment right next to mine.
           Her husband passed away a couple years ago
           so she doesn't like to be alone.

                        HEALY
           And it doesn't cramp your style?

                    MARY
               Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.

                        HEALY
           Lint?

                        MARY
           Yeah, I think it's that dog of hers running
           around on the rug all day--just makes for a
           lot of lint. Look at this...

Mary lifts her shirt, revealing a BIG CLUMP OF COTTON CANDY
STICKING OUT OF HER BELLY-BUTTON.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           See? That's just one day.

Healy CRACKS UP and then gazes at her. What a babe.

                        HEALY
           You know, sometimes I wish I could be like
           Magda and not go home. I'd like to just
           bounce around for awhile, do a little
           traveling...

                        MARY
           Why bounce when you have your own condo in
           Nepal to go to?

It's clear Healy forgot about that one.

                        HEALY
           Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new
           place, quit the architect game, slow things
           down, read more books, see more movies...

                        MARY
           You're a movie buff?

                        HEALY
           Try to be. It's tough going with the crap
           they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the
           best they've got to offer I say thanks but
           no thanks.

                        MARY
           Have you seen it?

                        HEALY
           No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr
           hated it.

                        MARY
           A fucking moron.

                        HEALY
           Huh. I guess I just wish they made them
           like they used to. You know, something like
           The Heartbreak Kid...or Harold and
           Maude.

Mary can't believe her ears.

                        MARY
           Harold and Maude is my all-time favorite
           movie.

                        HEALY
           Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know
           it's corny, but I do love it.

                        MARY
           Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's
           the greatest--

                        HEALY
           --Love story of our time.

Mary smiles. Is this guy for real?

                        MARY
           Yeah.

                        HEALY
           Wow. I thought I was the only one.

They come to her apartment building and stop. It gets a little
awkward.

                        MARY
           So...

                        HEALY
           Yeah...I guess this is it, huh?

                        MARY
           I guess.

                        HEALY
           Well, I'll see ya.

Healy turns to go but stops.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           Mary ah, forget it.

                        MARY
           What?

                        HEALY
           No, forget it, it was stupid.

                        MARY
           Come on, what were you going to say?

                        HEALY
           Nah, really, it was moronic.

She grabs him by the shirt playfully.

                        MARY
           Just say it.

Healy takes a deep breath.

                        HEALY
           Could I feel your bosoms before I go?

Mary just stares at him.

                        MARY (beat)
           Knock yourself out.

Healy reaches out and cups her breasts. He doesn't kiss her, she
doesn't kiss him, he just fondles her breasts. Then:

                        HEALY
           Okey-dokey, so tomorrow night?

She smiles and as Healy walks away we

INT. SOUTH CAROLINA PRISON - DAY

Ted is sitting alone at a table in a small interrogation room.

PULLBACK to reveal that he is being observed through a two-way
mirror by two detectives, FRANEK and CAVALLO.

                        DETECTIVE FRANEK
           Man, they never look like you'd expect.

                        DETECTIVE CAVALLO
           That's probably how he got the victim to
           drop his guard. 

                        DETECTIVE FRANEK
           Where'd they find the body?

                        DETECTIVE CAVALLO
           In a big red bag on the front passenger
           seat. All hacked up--fucking gruesome--a
           real psycho, this one.

The Detectives ENTER the room.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

Ted stands as the Detectives take a seat across from him.

                        TED
                 (agitated)
           I'm telling you, I did not solicit sex! I
           was just stopping to go the bathroom, next
           thing I know I tripped over something--well
           someone--and, POOF, there's cops and
           lights and--

                        DETECTIVE FRANEK
           Okay, calm down, Ted, we believe you.
                 (beat)
           The problem is we found your friend in
           the car.

As Ted sits back down the Detectives just stare at him. Finally
Ted thinks he gets it.

                        TED
           Oh. The hitchhiker.
                 (CHUCKLES)
           That's what this is all about.

Ted puts his head in his hands and smiles.

                        TED (cont'd)
           Isn't that just my luck--I get caught for
           everything.

                        DETECTIVE CAVALLO
           So you admit it?

                        TED
           Guilty as charged. I'm not gonna play games
           with you. I could give you a song and dance
           but what's the point? I did it and we all
           know it.
                 (laughs)
           The hitcher himself told me it's
           illegal The irony.

The Detectives are surprised by his forthrightness.

                        DETECTIVE CAVALLO
           Well, uh, can you tell us his name?

                        TED
           Jeez, I didn't catch it.

The Detectives flinch at his glib demeanor.

                        DETECTIVE FRANEK
           So he was a stranger? It was totally
           random?

                        TED
                 (confused)
           He was the first hitcher I saw, what can I
           tell you? Now cut to the chase, how much
           trouble am I in? 

The Detectives look at one another. 

                        DETECTIVE FRANEK
           First tell us why you did it.

                        TED
           Why I did it?
                 (scoffs)
           I don't know. Boredom? I thought I was
           doing the guy a favor.

The Detectives look at each other.

                        DETECTIVE CAVALLO
           This wasn't your first time, was it, Ted?
           How many we talking?

                        TED
           Hitchhikers? I don't know--fifty...a
           hundred maybe--Who keeps track?

Finally Detective Cavallo EXPLODES across the table and starts
WAILING on a shocked Ted.

                        DETECTIVE CAVALLO
           You sonofabitch! You're gonna fry!!!!

EXT. MARY'S OFFICE - MORNING

Mary pulls up in her Honda Civic. She parks out front and enters
the building.

PAN ACROSS THE STREET TO REVEAL - Healy is parked in his car.
His surveillance equipment is pointed toward Mary's office.

INT. MARY'S OFFICE - MORNING

Mary walks into the office and sees a MEDICAL ASSISTANT standing
near the coffee maker.

                        MARY
           Mornin', Jane.

                        MEDICAL ASSISTANT #1
           Good morning, Doctor. Your friend Tucker's
           in your office to see you. 

Mary nods and heads toward her office. 

INT. MARY'S OFFICE - SAME

Mary walks into her office and sees Tucker seated at her desk.
(SHOT FROM behind Tucker so we only see the back of his head.)

                        TUCKER
           What's up, Doc?

                        MARY
           Tucker, you look different some how. Did
           you do something with your hair?

MARY'S POV - Tucker's got two TONGUE DEPRESSORS under his upper
lip making him look like a walrus.

                        TUCKER
           The teeth, the teeth. I got 'em capped.

ON MARY - smiles.

                        MARY
           Oh yeah, they look great.

INT. HEALY'S CAR - SAME

He's got his listening gun fixed on Mary's office.

                        TUCKER (V.O.)
           You don't think they're too big?

                        MARY (V.O.)
           No no, the bigger the better.
                 (beat)
           But I must say, they could be a little
           brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful
           of pearly whites.

Healy looks at his teeth in the mirror. Not exactly pearly.

INT. MARY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Tucker pulls the tongue depressors out of his teeth and laughs. He
stands up, and when Mary tries to squeeze past him he gives her a
kiss on the cheek.

                        TUCKER
           You ever been laid in this office?

Mary pushes past him.

                        MARY
           Behave yourself, Tucker.
                 (smiles)
           Come on, what are you doing here?

She sits in her chair and leans against her desk.

                        TUCKER
           I wanted to talk to you about your friend
           Patrick.

EXT. HEALY'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Healy almost flies out of his seat.

                        MARY (O.S.)
           He's a nice guy, isn't he?

                        TUCKER (O.S.)
           Well that's what I'm trying to figure
           out. How long have you known him?

INT. MARY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Tucker has a look of concern.

                        MARY
           Not long at all, but I really like him.
                 (off Tucker's look)
           Okay, I know he's a little different,
           Tucker, but that's what I like about him.
           He's a guy. A real guy. He dresses like a
           dork and eats corndogs and he isn't always
           politically correct and he probably farts,
           too. And that's okay with me.

                        TUCKER
           That's what you've been looking for--a
           farter?

                        MARY
           I've been looking for a guy--not one of
           these South Beach pussies.

                        TUCKER
                 (SIGHS)
           Look, it's just that something about him
           struck me as odd last night. He gave me
           this funny vibe. Anyway, I called some
           friends back east. They don't know of any
           architect named Patrick Healy and he's not
           listed as a Harvard alumnus.

INT. HEALY'S CAR - SAME

Healy SLAMS his hand on the steering wheel.

                        HEALY
           Fuck!!

                        MARY (O.S.)
           Huh...that's strange.

INT. MARY'S OFFICE - SAME

                        TUCKER
           I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't
           think I'm being meddlesome. I just think
           you should be careful with this guy.

                        MARY
                 (concerned)
           No no no, Tucker, thank you.

                        TUCKER
           I mean let's face it, Mary, you're
           beautiful, you've got money, you trust
           people--I'm just saying, there's a lot of
           psychos out there.

                        MARY
                 (small smile)
           I appreciate you looking out for me.

remorseful- looking partner Cavallo stands behind him.

The two Detectives and an apoplectic Ted walk down the hallway.

           At exactly 10:48 this morning a man was
           apprehended not far from where you were
           arrested. He was identified as an escaped
           mental patient and subsequently confessed
           to the murder that you were being held for.
           Lab tests confirmed a fingerprint match on
           the bag.

                 (fragile)

Detective Cavallo stops and holds out his hand.

                        DETECTIVE CAVALLO
           No harm, no foul?

                        TED

Still traumatized, Ted shakes the man's hand, then mopes toward
the door.

           about to cut your throat when you stopped

           up your ass, man.

           know where to mail his last paycheck so I
           sent my assistant by his mother's
           apartment. Turns out there is no diabetic
           mom. Landlord said she's been dead for ten
           years.

           everything! The landlord said when he got
           back from Miami he kept talking about
           falling for some doctor named Mary!

Ted is stunned.

           You're not seriously thinking about going
           out with this guy again?

                        JOANNIE
           Mary, he sounds like a psycho!

                        MAGDA
           Would you hens quit ya cackling and let her
           do what she wants to do. Puffy liked him
           and Puffy's never wrong.

The girlfriends roll their eyes.

                        BRENDA
           Mary, the guy's full of shit.

                        MARY
           What if he's not? What if Tucker just made
           an honest mistake?

                        LISA
           What if he didn't?

It's clear that Mary is torn.

                        MARY
           I don't know how I can bail now, he's going
           to be here any minute.

                        JOANNIE
           Well then blow him off when he gets here.

                        MARY
           But you didn't meet him. He seems so I
           don't know...perfect...kind of.

                        BRENDA
           He has a big cock, doesn't he?

Mary shoots Brenda a look. 

                        MAGDA
           Hey hey, what did you say Pat's last name
           was?

                        MARY
           Healy.

Magda's eyes almost come out of her head.

                        MAGDA
           I think you better listen to this.

Magda turns up the volume on her scanner and we can clearly hear
Healy TALKING ON HIS CELLULAR PHONE. Mary and her girlfriends
gather around.

                        SULLY (V.O.)
           So where the hell are you, Healy?

                        HEALY (V.O.)
           Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary
           girl I told you about.

                        SULLY (V.O.)
           The sawbones?

                        HEALY (V.O.)
           Yep.

The girls all look at one another.

                        BRENDA
           We hit the motherlode.

                        MARY
           We shouldn't be listening to this.

                        LISA AND JOANNIE
           Shhh.

                        SULLY (V.O.)
           She still think you're a fucking architect?

                        HEALY (V.O.)
           Oh yeah.

                        SULLY (V.O.)
           Dumbshit.

                        LISA
           Mr. Perfect, huh?

Mary starts to feel like a fool.

                        MARY
                 (edgy)
           Turn it up, Magda.

                        HEALY (V.O.)
           Hey, watch your mouth--she's a great gal.
           I'm the dumbshit for lying to her.

                        SULLY (V.O.)
           Why didn't you just tell her the truth?

                        HEALY (V.O.)
           I don't know. I guess...it just seems that
           women today are more impressed by the
           mighty buck than by some schmo who spent
           the last seventeen years scraping by on
           Peace Corp wages.

The girls all seem moved by this.

INT. HEALY'S CAR - NIGHT

Healy is parked out front, the phone in one hand, a SCRIPT in the
other, as he listens to Sully read the following words:

                        SULLY (V.O.)
           But Jesus, Pat, if she's as special as you
           say, she's going to want to hear about
           the things you did. 

                        HEALY
                 (dismissing this)
           Ahh.

INT. SULLY'S APARTMENT - SAME

A disheveled and wired-looking Sully is sitting on the couch in
his underwear READING FROM THE SAME SCRIPT. There's COKE on the
table, DOG SHIT on the floor, and FLIES everywhere.

In the B.G. we see the Great Dane SNIFFING at his empty bowl and
the Boa Constrictor sprawled out on the floor, barely moving.

                        SULLY
                 (reading)
           Come on, you could tell her about the
           irrigation ditches you dug in Sudan, the
           orphan babies who cried in your arms in
           Romania...
                 (does a line of blow)
           ...the hope you gave Freddie the leper in
           Calcutta...

Suddenly the dog snatches the page out of his hand and STARTS TO
EAT IT.

BACK ON Mary and friends.

                        JOANNIE
                 (welling up)
           I love this man.

Magda folds her arms and gloats.

INT. HEALY'S CAR - NIGHT

                        HEALY
           Look, I did all those things for myself.
           I'll be honest with you, I'm a selfish
           prick. I get a high from helping all of
           God's creatures. An honest to goodness
           high.

Just then, Healy sees a bug on the car window and instinctively
squashes it.

ON SULLY - he has the phone wedged between his cheek and
shoulder as he STRUGGLES with the dog to get the script.

Sully still can't retrieve the script, nor his next line.

                        SULLY
                 (winging it)
           That's bullshit, man you, uh, you were on
           the front line. Remember the, uh,
           malaria the, uh, typhoon fever that
           vicious strain of genital herpes?

ON MARY AND FRIENDS - they flinch at this.

ON HEALY - he stares at the phone, horrified.

                        HEALY (V.O.)
           Uh, sure. I cured a lot of nasty
           illnesses in third-world countries.

ON MARY AND FRIENDS - as they let out a sigh.

                        HEALY (V.O.) (cont'd)
           The bottom line is, I'm not going to use my
           philanthropy as some form of
           currency...especially after what I did.
                 (SIGHS)
           I lied to this poor girl. Lied. man. She
           deserved better.

                        SULLY (V.O.)
           Hey, love will make you do fucked-up
           things.

                        HEALY (V.O.)
           You said it, mister.
                 (choking up)
           I gotta go.

ON SULLY - as he HANGS UP the phone and does another line, we

PAN TO the Great Dane Hal as he looks around for something,
anything to eat. He SNIFFS at a sock, then a beer bottle, before
finally setting his sights on the Boa Constrictor Bill. Bill
glances the dog's way nervously, SENSES TROUBLE, and wiggles his
way into another room. As Hal TAKES OFF after the snake, we

                                                       CUT TO:

INT. MARY'S HALLWAY - NIGHT

Healy starts to knock on Mary's door, but, before he can, the door
suddenly swings open revealing a beaming Mary.

                        HEALY
                 (startled)
           Oh Mary. Look, there's something I have
           to tell you. I'm not

Before he can finish, Mary steps forward and their mouths meet in
a passionate KISS. 

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

MONTAGE OF MARY AND HEALY COURTING 
--As Mary watches, Healy plays TOUCH FOOTBALL with Warren and a
few of his friends. Healy catches a pass then, trying a little too
hard to impress Mary, he delivers a forearm shiver to his defender
and gives Warren a vicious STRAIGHT-ARM. When Healy gets into the
end zone he spikes the ball and starts talking trash to another
defender.

--Healy shows up at Mary's door sporting a set of OVERSIZED
INCREDIBLY-WHITE CAPPED TEETH. He gives her a big horse smile and
she reacts uncertainly.

--Healy is in Mary's apartment as Mary finishes dressing for a
night on the town.

                        MARY
           All set.

                        HEALY
           You look great.
                 (beat)
           Hey, Mare, do I have a rip in the back of
           these pants?

When she puts her head close to inspect his pants, he lets fly a
THUNDEROUS FART. She pulls her head away, repulsed, but Healy just
LAUGHS.

--Mary and and the horse-toothed Healy are having dinner in a
romantic restaurant. As he eats he tells an animated story but
he's having trouble with the new choppers and chunks of food are
spraying out of his mouth with every word. Mary has to BOB AND
WEAVE to avoid being covered with debris.

--Healy and Warren are playing monopoly. When Warren isn't
looking, Healy cheats and puts a couple hotels on Boardwalk. In
the b.g. we see one of Warren's buddies fall out of a palm tree.

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY

A lovesick Healy is mauling Mary out on the sidewalk in front
while Warren stands off to the side LISTENING TO A WALKMAN.

REVERSE ANGLE reveals a devastated Ted and Dom watching this
from Ted's car.

                        TED
           Fuck me.
                 (sighs)
           Let's go home.

                        DOM
           No! You've gone through way too much to
           back down now. Get over there and do
           something--I can't stand watching this.

BACK ON MARY AND HEALY as Healy starts OVER-DOING IT and Mary
has to break it off.

                        MARY
           Whoa, whoa, how's my stomach taste?

Healy LAUGHS.

                        HEALY
           How's my stomach taste, she says.
                 (shakes head)
           Hey thanks for picking up the lunch tab,
           Mare. Sorry I forgot my wallet. I feel like
           a dog.

                        MARY
           Forget it. It was...fun.

ON TED AND DOM 
Ted recognizes Warren.

                        TED
           Holy shit, there's Warren.

BACK ON MARY. HEALY, AND WARREN 
Suddenly we see Warren PERK UP at something.

                        WARREN
           Franks and beans!

ON TED AND DOM 
                        TED
           Jesus, I think her brother spotted me.

They both duck down in their seats.

BACK ON MARY. HEALY. AND WARREN 
                        WARREN
           Beans and franks.

                        MARY
           Give it a rest, War. You just ate.

                        HEALY
           Aw, leave him alone, he's just got a big
           appetite.
                 (to Warren)
           Am I right?

Healy winks at Mary.

                        WARREN
           Huh?

Healy reaches over and lifts a headphone off Warren's ear.

                        HEALY
           I said you've got a big app--

Suddenly Warren SUCKER-PUNCHES HEALY IN THE THROAT.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           Urrggghh...

                        MARY
           Warren!

ON TED AND DOM - as they flinch.

                        DOM
           Attaboy!

BACK ON MARY et al - Healy holds his throat, clearly in pain.

                        MARY
           Are you okay?

                        HEALY (cont'd)
                 (raspy, to Mary)
           Not to worry. So...see you tonight,
           right? Right?

                        MARY
                 (cornered)
           Sure.

Mary watches with a look of concern as Healy gets in his car and
drives off.

ON TED AND DOM 
Ted stares gazily.

                        DOM
           Well? What are you waiting for?

                        TED
           I don't know what to say.

                        DOM
           Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the
           schmuck out of the water.

                        TED
           Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on
           her. She's gonna be fucking pissed.
                 (stares at Mary)
           She's even more beautiful than I remember.

THEIR POV - Mary and Warren start to go in the apartment.

                        DOM
           Get over there, you pussy! She's leaving!

Suddenly Dom HONKS THE HORN, then ducks down. Mary turns around
and sees Ted.

                        TED
           You asshole, what are you--
                 (CALLING OUT CHEERILY)
           Mary! Is that you?

                        MARY
                 (squinting)
           Who's that?

Ted gets out of the car and hustles across the street toward Mary.

                        TED
           It is you! It's me...Ted. From Rhode
           Island Ted.

Finally she recognizes him.

                        MARY
           Oh my God...Ted.
                 (big smile)
           What are you...? I can't believe this. I
           haven't seen you since-- 

                        TED
           Yup, that's right. Junior prom...kinda.

                        MARY
           And did everything--?

                        TED
           Oh yeah, healed right up. No visible scars.

Mary LAUGHS.

                        TED (cont'd)
           How are you doing, Warren?

                        WARREN
           Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?

                        TED
           I'm gonna take a rain check.

Mary is stunned.

                        MARY
           I can't believe he remembered you. He never
           remembers anybody.
                 (beat)
           You know I tried to call you for weeks
           after that.

                        TED
           Really? I never got a message.

                        MARY
           That's weird. I talked to your brother
           Jimmy five or six times.

Ted is devastated to hear this.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           By the way, how's he doing?

                        TED
           He's dead.

                        MARY
                 (taken aback)
           Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.

                        TED
                 (bitter)
           No, it was a good thing.
                 (off her look)
           I mean, good in that it was very quick.

Ted pantomimes an explosion.

                        MARY
           Oh. So...what brings you down here?

                        TED
           Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of
           mine decided to...ah...you know...just
           ...drive down.

She stares at him.

                        MARY
           Well you look great. Are you married, do
           you have kids?

                        TED
           Nope, nope--dodged a few bullets.
                 (smiles)
           God, I cannot believe I'm standing here
           with Mary Jenson.

                        MARY
           Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.

                        TED
                 (taken aback)
           Oh...are you...?

                        MARY
           Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.
                 (off his look)
           There was this guy back in college who was
           bothering me...got kind of ugly--a
           restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway,
           when I got out of Princeton I changed my
           name as a precaution.

                        TED
           Jeez...that sounds awful. Hey, what do you
           say we go out to dinner tonight, catch up
           on old times?

BEAT.

                        MARY
           Didn't we just do that?

Ted doesn't know how to respond to this and then she smiles.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but
           the thing is I already have plans. How
           about tomorrow night?

                        TED
           Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve
           years.
                 (beat)
           Don't make me wait another day.

Mary seems touched by this.

                        MARY
           Tell me where you're staying. I'll pick you
           up at eight.

Ted finally smiles and we

INT. HEALY'S CAR - TWILIGHT

A content Healy is parked out front of Mary's apartment, absently
listening to her spill her guts to Magda while he reads the
newspaper.

                        MAGDA (V.O.)
           I'm buying bananas tonight.

                        MARY (V.O.)
           Why?

                        MAGDA (V.O.)
           Back when I was your age I always used to
           make myself a big banana split after sex. I
           think you're gonna need one tonight.

                        MARY (V.O.)
           Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll
           probably need it before I will.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - SAME

Mary is skipping around the apartment while Magda sits on the
couch.

                        MAGDA
           Don't bet on it. Last time I had a pap
           smear the guy needed leather gloves and an
           oyster shucker.

                        MARY
           So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to
           take you to the movies.

                        MAGDA
           Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're
           in love doesn't mean everyone else has to
           be.

                        MARY
           Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.

                        MAGDA
           Oh no? I ain't seen you beaming like this
           since you broke ninety on the Blue Monster.

BACK ON HEALY - he's reveling in it all.

                        MARY (V.O. )
           Well I am pretty psyched. I ran into a
           guy today I hadn't seen since high school.

Healy loses the smile and sits up.

                        MAGDA (V.O.)
           An old flame?

                        MARY (V.O.)
           Kind of. Ted Peloquin--one of the sweetest
           guys in the world.

Healy TURNS UP THE VOLUME.

ON MARY 
                        MARY (cont'd)
           He was so shy and clumsy...I had a major
           crush on him.

BACK ON HEALY as he nearly puts his head through the roof. He
grabs hold of the steering wheel and pounds his head on it.

                        HEALY
           No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

                        MARY (V.O.) (cont'd)
           We're gonna go out tonight. Oh, that
           reminds me, I've got to call
           what's-his-face and cancel.

ON MARY 
                        MAGDA
           Do I sense a chill in the air?

Mary sits down.

                        MARY
           Oh, Magda, I let my head get in the way of
           my love life. I always pick guys on what I
           feel in here.
                 (pats heart)
           But with this Pat guy my head kept saying
           "Grow up, Mary. You have a lot in common
           with this one, you'll grow to feel
           something for him." But it never happened.

ON HEALY - he couldn't look more crushed. Suddenly his cellular
phone RINGS. He stares at it for TWO, THREE, FOUR RINGS.
Panic-stricken. Then he answers it.

                        HEALY
                 (jovial voice)
           Hey, Patty-boy here. Sorry I missed ya, but
           I'm out rustling up some champagne and
           roses in preparation for the greatest
           birthday of my life. Hope you and yours are
           having a good day, too.

Healy makes a BEEP sound and then holds his breath.

ON MARY - she stares at the phone, feeling cornered.

                        MARY
           Uh, hi Pat, it's me, Mary. Just wanted to
           say I'm...looking forward to tonight.

She hangs up.

                        MAGDA
           You vicious bitch, how do you sleep at
           night?

                        MARY
           I can't do it--I just found out it's his
           birthday.
                 (sighs)
           I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.

ON HEALY - he blows imaginary smoke off an imaginary gun. Then
he sits back and smugly listens to her DIAL THE PHONE. But then he
hears something that concerns him--a KNOCK on the door and the dog
YAPPING.

ON MARY - she puts down the phone and answers the door. It's
Tucker, the architect.

                        MARY
                 (surprised)
           Tucker...come on in.

BACK ON HEALY pulling his hair out. He's on an emotional roller
coaster heading downhill.

                        MAGDA (V.O.)
           Well look who's here.

BACK TO MARY'S APARTMENT - Tucker is carrying an unopened BOTTLE
OF SCOTCH and absently flicking the YAPPING pooch off his ankles.

                        TUCKER
           There she is--I brought you a little
           thirst-quencher, Mag.

                        MAGDA
           Oh, you are sweet.

                        TUCKER
           No, I'm not. I just want to get you-drunk
           so you'll pass out and I can have my way
           with Mary.

Everyone LAUGHS.

                        MARY
           Can I pour you one?

                        TUCKER
           Thanks, but I've got to be going.
           Unfortunately, Doc, this isn't a social
           visit.

Tucker's tone shifts and Mary grows concerned.

                        MARY
           What's up?

                        TUCKER
           Well...I've got a little more news about
           your friend Healy.

Mary seems relieved.

                        MARY
           I know what you're going to say, but he
           already told me everything. I know he's not
           an architect.

Tucker pulls out a piece of paper.

                        TUCKER (cont'd)
           I think you'd better sit down.

                        MARY
           Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this,
           but I'm really strapped for time here and--

                        TUCKER
           Mary, the man's a killer.

ON HEALY - he can't believe his ears.

BACK ON MARY - as she lowers herself onto the couch.

                        MARY
                 (stunned)
           What...?

                        TUCKER
           I've got a friend in the Boston police
           department. He faxed me this this morning.
           I'll just give you the highlights.
                 (reading from rap sheet)
           After a short stint as a petty thief,
           Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery
           by the age of fourteen. At sixteen he
           committed his first murder--a pretty
           teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove. He
           was incarcerated until age twenty-two when,
           despite a grim psychological profile, the
           state was forced to release him. In his
           mid-twenties and again in his early
           thirties he was suspected of homicides in
           the states of Utah and Washington.
           Unfortunately, the bodies were so badly
           decomposed that there wasn't enough
           evidence to hold him, and on and on and so
           forth and so on.

Mary looks like she's going to throw up.

ON HEALY - he listens intently, his face ashen.

                        MARY (V.O.)
           Holy shit...

                        MAGDA (V.O.)
           Puffy, get over here.

We hear the PITTER-PATTER of the dog's nails on the floor, then a
LOUD THUMP followed by a YELP.

ON MARY 
                        MARY
           Magda!

                        MAGDA
           The little shit lied to me about that guy!

Mary picks up the startled dog and pets him.

                        MARY
                 (growing emotional)
           I can't believe this is happening. I'm
           supposed to be meeting him in an hour.

                        TUCKER
           Okay, just calm down. It's going to be
           okay.

Tucker puts his arms around her.

                        MAGDA
           Why you two never hooked up is beyond me.

Mary looks fondly at Tucker.

                        MARY
           Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in
           my life.

                        TUCKER
           Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give
           me a big head.
                 (smiles)
           The important thing, Doctor, is you've got
           to distance yourself as much as possible
           without pissing this psycho off.

                        MARY
           Yeah, yeah. Okay, I think I know what to
           do. I'll call him right now.

BACK ON HEALY - he looks stunned. His cellular PHONE RINGS. He
stares at it, then picks it up.

                        HEALY
           Hi, I'm out drinking champagne and
           roses...and I'm really happy. Leave a
           message. BEEP.

                        MARY (V.O.)
                 (nervous)
           Uh, hey buddy. Oh boy, am I pissed. You're
           not going to believe this--well, you'll
           believe it, there's no reason not to--but I
           just got beeped for emergency surgery.
           Well, um, sorry, but I'm going to have to
           bail on you.

As we hear a CLICK, Healy stares at the cell phone, seething.

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. MARY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER

Tucker comes out the front door, looks around, then walks off down
the sidewalk.

ANGLE ACROSS THE STREET - on Healy, his steely gaze fixed on
Tucker.

                        HEALY
                 (under breath)
           You're gonna pay, fucker.

Healy discreetly pulls out and slowly follows Tucker in his car.

BACK ON TUCKER - He continues down the sidewalk, looking back
once or twice, apprehensive. He rounds a corner, then stops next
to an OLD FORD PINTO. He looks around nervously again. Then Tucker
DUCKS INTO THE DRIVER'S SEAT and DRIVES OFF. Healy pulls into
traffic and follows.

                                                       CUT TO:

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 

Dom's mixing a drink while Ted paces nervously.

                        TED
           Oh God, I'm fucking nervous. I don't know
           if I'm ready for this, man.

                        DOM
           Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?

                        TED
                 (pats his back pocket)
           Got cash.

                        DOM
           Car clean? Plenty of gas?

                        TED
           Check.

                        DOM
           Mints?

                        TED
           Copped a tin of Altoids at the car wash.

Dom nods, satisfied.

                        DOM
           Okay, sounds like you're all set. Just
           clean the pipes and it's a go.

                        TED
           Hm?

                        DOM
           You know, clean the pipes.

                        TED
           Pipes? What are you talking about?

                        DOM
           You jerk off before all big dates, right?
           Tell me you jerk off before your big dates.

Ted just stares at him.

                        DOM (cont'd)
                 (incredulous)
           You don't jerk off before--?! Are you
           crazy?! That's like going out there with a
           loaded gun. No wonder you're nervous!

Ted considers this.

                        DOM (cont'd)
           Think about it: After you've had sex with a
           girl and the two of you are laying in bed,
           are you nervous?

                        TED
           No.

Dom shrugs...Duh.

                        DOM
           Why's that?

                        TED
           I'm usually too tired to be.

Dom makes a game-show BUZZER sound.

                        DOM
           Wrong. It's because you ain't got the baby
           batter in your brain any more. That'll fuck
           with your head, that stuff will.

                        TED
                 (starting to believe)
           Huh.

                        DOM
           The most honest moment in a man's life is
           the five minutes after he's blown a load.
           That's a medical fact. And it's because
           you're no longer trying to get laid. You're
           actually thinking like a girl. They love
           that.

                        TED
           Jesus Christ you're right.

                        DOM
           You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go
           out with a loaded gun, you empty the
           barrels!

                        TED
                 (shakes his head)
           Holy shit, I've been going out with a
           loaded gun!

                        DOM
           People get hurt that way.

EXT. HOTEL - EVENING

Dom walks out of the lobby just as another cab arrives and Mary
gets out. He sees and her and ducks behind a bush as she walks
past him.

INT. TED'S HOTEL BATHROOM - SAME

Ted has a newspaper splayed out on the counter (open to the bra
ads) as he furiously FLOGS THE DOLPHIN (chest-high side view.) We
see some balled-up tissue nearby. After several frantic strokes,
he takes a deep breath and slowly and loudly EXHALES, clearly
having COMPLETED HIS MISSION.

He draws a few more breaths, picks up a face cloth, and goes to
clean up.

But something's missing: The Load. Ted looks down, checks his
hands, pants, shoes, looks in the sink, finally glances at the
ceiling, with no luck.

The Load IS MISSING!!!!

That's when the doorbell RINGS. Ted couldn't look more HORRIFIED.
As he buckles his pants, he makes a last, panicky reconnaissance
of the area. The doorbell RINGS AGAIN and Ted reluctantly goes to
answer it.

INT. TED'S HOTEL ROOM - SAME

Ted opens the door and Mary is standing there looking as lovely as
ever.

                        TED
           Hey.

                        MARY
           Hi, Ted.

                        TED
           You look great.

                        MARY
           Thanks.

She notices something.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           What's that?

                        TED
           Hm?

                        MARY
           On your ear, you've got something.

MARY'S POV - a HUGE LOAD is hanging off of Ted's earlobe like a
drop earring.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           It looks like a gob of...

Mary leans forward for a closer look. Ted is terrified.

                        MARY (cont'd)
                 (making face)
           Is that....hair gel?

BEAT.

                        TED
           Sure.

                        MARY
           Oh great, I ran out.

Before Ted can stop her, Mary grabs The Load off his ear and WIPES
IT IN HER BANGS.

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. UPSCALE NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

Healy is still following Tucker in his car. Finally Tucker stops
in front of a lavish Victorian home and gets out carrying a pizza
and wearing a PIZZA DELIVERY HAT.

Healy SCREECHES to a sideways stop, jumps out and POUNCES ON HIM.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           You motherfucker, you're a dead man!

Tucker drops the pizza as Healy SLAMS HIM into a tree.

                        TUCKER
                 (cowering)
           Okay, Pat, take it easy--don't do anything
           stupid.

                        HEALY
           Who the fuck do you think you are making up
           that bullshit about me?!

Healy SLAMS HIM AGAINST THE TREE AGAIN.

                        TUCKER
           Whoa, whoa--I don't know what you're talking
           about.

                        HEALY
           Maybe this'll jog your memory.

Healy SLAPS him across the face.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           I'll give you a hint--it's got something to
           do with me being a murderer.

Healy raises his arm again and Tucker tries to shield himself.

                        TUCKER
           Okay, okay, I might've gotten some bad
           information.

Healy grabs him by the collar.

                        HEALY
           That stalker Ted got to you, right? You're
           working for him, aren't you, you little
           shit?

                        TUCKER
           Who?

Healy throws Tucker to the ground and takes off his sport coat.

           This is your last chance, you fuck. Now
           either you come clean or I'm going to kick
           your ass from here to Tallahassee.

Healy grabs Tucker by the hair and cocks his arm.

                        TUCKER
           I LOVE HER, OKAY?!

Tucker suddenly gets emotional. Healy stops and looks at him.

           You what?

                        TUCKER
           You heard me, goddamnit. I...I love her.

Healy slowly lets go.

           I'm a phony--just like you, man.

           What do you mean?

           I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no

           Santiago twice in a year?

           I knew shit. The only thing I knew was that
           you were a fake and I made up everything
           else.

           Community College for a semester and when
           the Wal-Mart cashier job fell through I
           hooked up with the Pizza Barn.

           And you met Mary how?

           Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her
           one night and she answered the door in her
           nightgown--that was it for me. I went home
           that night, shaved my beard, and a week
           later I was laid out in her office with a
           broken back.

Suddenly a DOGGIE TREAT flies through the window, landing on the

it, then GOBBLES IT UP. ANOTHER doggie treat lands beside him and
he eats that, too. Then ANOTHER.

Magda turns off the vacuum and we hear a BANGING SOUND coupled
with the O.S. MUFFLED YAPPING of Puffy.

Ted walks down the hall, following the YAPPING AND BANGING SOUND
until he comes to the bathroom door. The YAPPING is MUCH LOUDER

Puffy gets a piece of Ted's wrist and Ted SCREAMS and drops him.
Both man and toy poodle SPRING TO THEIR FEET.

They start CIRCLING ONE ANOTHER. Puffy leaps at Ted and Ted SMACKS
HIM into a wall. Unfazed, the dog gets a running start and LEAPS
AT TED'S NECK.

Ted manages to duck and PUFFY FLIES OUT THE OPEN WINDOW!

sissy. Convinced it's not too dangerous, Warren
decides to go for it and Ted follows.

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Ted shows up at Mary's apartment door carrying a BOUQUET OF
FLOWERS and a BASEBALL. When he KNOCKS, the door opens.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Ted peeks around the corner and sees a SOMBER Mary sitting on the
couch.

                        TED
                 (chipper)
           Hey.

Mary doesn't look up. Ted ENTERS, revealing his gifts.

                        TED (cont'd)
           The flowers are for you and the ball's for
           Warren. I had a friend of mine Fedex it to
           me--it's signed by Tony Conigliaro.

Mary finally looks up but doesn't smile.

                        MARY
           Did you hire Pat Healy to follow me around?

Ted tries to hide his horror.

                        TED
                 (lamely)
           What do you mean?

Mary picks up a letter off the coffee table and hands it to him.
Ted takes a quick look and then drops it on the table.

                        MARY
           It's not true...right, Ted?

Ted CLEARS HIS THROAT.

                        TED
           Well, funny story there. You see, uh, it
           started out as a uh...yeah...it's true. =

Mary stands up.

                        MARY
           Get out.

                        TED
           Wait, hold on, Mary--it's not as bad as it
           sounds. I certainly didn't know--

                        MARY
           That you put a murderer on my trail?

                        TED
           Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I
           just thought--

                        MARY
           What did you think, Ted? That you could spy
           on me and trick me into thinking you were
           someone I could...really go for?

Mary starts to get emotional.

                        TED
           Mary, I swear I wasn't trying to trick you.

                        MARY
           Then what the fuck did you do it for?

                        TED
           I did it because because I'd never
           stopped thinking about you and if I didn't
           find you I knew my life would never be good
           again.

Mary looks away.

                        MARY
                 (softly)
           Please leave.

                        TED
                 (devastated)
           Mary, come on...

                        MARY
           Go!

                        TED
                 (beat)
           Okay.

And so Ted does.

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. MARY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Ted comes out of the building, a broken man. He paces back and
forth on the sidewalk, manic with despair. Then he seems to grow
angry. He rifles through his pockets until he finds a SLIP OF
PAPER.

TED'S POV - the paper reads: 'Healy's Miami address--229 Court
Street, apt. 43.'

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Ted walks down a rather dark hallway until he comes to apartment
43. He KNOCKS on the door but no one answers. He tries the handle
and THE DOOR OPENS.

INT. SULLY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 

Ted ENTERS and immediately reacts to the STENCH.

REVERSE ANGLE reveals that the place is a fucking PIG-STY. DOG
SHIT is everywhere, FLIES fill the room, a MOUSE scampers across
the carpet.

                        TED
           Hello...?

No answer. Suddenly he HEARS SOMEONE out in the hall, so he ducks
behind the door.

Healy and Tucker ENTER the apartment and stop in their tracks when
they see the MESS.

                        HEALY
           Ho-ly shit.

                        TUCKER
           Hey, this is a pretty nice place.

                        HEALY
           Sully...! What the fuck happened here?!

Again, no answer. Suddenly Ted SLAMS THE DOOR shut and grabs Healy
by the collar.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
                 (alarmed)
           Hey, hey, hey!

                        TED
           Surprised?

                        TUCKER
           Hey, buddy, don't do anything rash now.

                        TED
                 (to Tucker)
           Who the fuck are you?

                        HEALY
           He's in love with Mary, too.

Ted releases Healy and glares at him.

                        TED
           You fucked me, man? Why would you do that?

                        HEALY
                 (righteous)
           What do you mean 'why'?

                        TED
           Answer the question, shitball.

                        TUCKER
           I think everybody could use a drink.

Tucker goes into the kitchen.

                        HEALY
           Look, you asked me to follow your girl
           around, and I did and I started to like
           her, and then I realized I just couldn't in
           good conscience do it.

                        TED
                 (amazed)
           Do what?

                        HEALY
           Turn her over to a stalker.

                        TED
           What?! You're calling me a stalker?

                        HEALY
           That's right--if you weren't you would've
           looked for her yourself!

Suddenly they hear a SOUND and turn to see Bill the Boa slithering
into the room with A HUGE, GREAT-DANE-SIZE LUMP in his midsection.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
                 (sickened)
           Oh Christ...poor dog.

                        TED
           You're a sick man, you know that?

                        HEALY
           Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand
           the fact that it was my turn.

                        TED
           Your turn?

                        HEALY
                 (getting emotional)
           That's right, hot shot! My turn. What's
           the matter with me, huh? Why can't I ever
           get the great girl? Give the big pig with
           the B.O. to Healy, right? Well I was sick
           of it, man! No more--it was my turn. It was
           time for me...time for me...to be happy.

This is so pathetic that it actually gets to Ted. He sits down,
runs his fingers through his hair.

                        TED
           Well you didn't have to blow us both out of
           the water. Jesus Christ, just because she
           found out about you, why'd you have to take
           me down with you?

                        HEALY
           I don't know what you're talking about.

                        TED
           I'm talking about the letter, asshole.

                        HEALY
           What? 

Ted stares at him.

                        TED
           Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a
           letter outlining our deal?

                        HEALY
           Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be
           screwing myself.

The guys stare at one another, then Tucker comes out the kitchen
with a drink. They turn their attention to him.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           You little fuck.

                        TUCKER
           What?

                        HEALY
           You fucking prick, we had a deal--you said
           you wouldn't fuck me and I wouldn't fuck
           you until we had this fuck out of the
           fucking picture.
                 (moves in on Tucker)
           You crossed the line, man.

Tucker backs away nervously. 

                        TUCKER
           Whoa, whoa, you're getting crazy now. Why
           would I cross the line--what do you think I
           got no pride?

Healy grabs Tucker by the neck.

                        TUCKER (cont'd)
           I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You
           probably did it yourself, you piece of
           shit.

                        HEALY
           Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I
           rat myself out?

                        TUCKER
           Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy
           who's idea of courting is blowing farts in
           the chick's face

                        HEALY
           You were following us?

                        TUCKER
           Don't flatter yourself--I was following
           her, I always do. How the hell you think
           I got rid of Mary's boyfriend Steve?

This gets Ted's attention.

                        TED
           You mean...Steve didn't say all that stuff
           about Warren?

                        TUCKER
           Are you shitting me--Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes?
           He was like a fucking eagle scout. You two
           should be kissing my balls--if it wasn't
           for me, she might've married that schmuck!

Ted thinks about this.

                        TED
           The hell with you both--I'm out of here.

Ted walks out the door leaving Healy and Tucker to stare each
other down. Just then Hal the Great Dane walks out of the bedroom
with a CEREAL BOX stuck on his head. Healy does a double-take,
then looks back at the snake.

                        HEALY
                 (sadly)
           Oh...Sully.

                        TUCKER
           Look, if it wasn't you who sent the letter,
           and it wasn't me who sent it?

                                                       CUT TO:

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY

CLOSE ON an alarmed Mary.

                        MARY
           Woogie? What are what are you doing here?

REVERSE ANGLE reveals Dom sitting on her bed.

                        DOM
           Did you get my letter, Mare? The one about 
           Ted?

                        MARY
           You sent that?

                        DOM
           Uh-huh. I was worried about you.

                        MARY
           Well...thank you. But...you know you're not
           supposed to be within four hundred yards of
           me.

                        DOM
                 (excited)
           That's what I want to tell ya. I've been
           through two years of extensive
           psychotherapy and you know what? You were
           right--I needed help.

                        MARY
                 (cautious)
           That's great, Woogie, I'm happy you're
           better--you seem...good--but...you put me
           through quite an ordeal, you know.

Dom nods aggressively.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           I had to move, go to court, change my last
           name--you stole all my shoes!

Dom stands up.

                        DOM
           Look at me.

Mary turns her head.

                        DOM (cont'd)
           Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on
           God above, on everything that is holy to
           me, I did not steal your shoes.

                        MARY
           Woogie, I caught you red-handed.

                        DOM
           All right, I did, but I was in a weird
           place then.

He approaches her.

                        DOM (cont'd)
           Give me a break, Mare, I was nuts!

Mary backs into the living room.

                                                       CUT TO:

INT. HEALY'S CAR - DAY

Healy and Tucker are parked right out front LISTENING TO THIS
CONVERSATION. They seem concerned.

                        MARY (V.O.)
           Woogie, please, you're starting to scare me.

                        HEALY
           Who the hell's Woogie?

Tucker just shrugs.

BACK ON Mary and Dom. =~

                        MARY
           I'm asking you to leave.

                        DOM
                 (gentle)
           Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all
           wrong.
                 (beat)
           I'm not leaving...

BACK IN HEALY'S CAR 
                        DOM (cont'd) (V.O.)
           ...Not until I get a little something to
           remember you by.

                        MARY (V. O . )
                 (clearly struggling)
           Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!!

Healy and Tucker jump out of the car and RUN INTO THE BUILDING.

                                                       CUT TO:

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Healy and Tucker STORM INTO THE ROOM and freeze at what they see.

THEIR POV - Dom is cradling SEVERAL PAIRS OF SHOES in his arms
and trying to crawl to the door while Mary holds him back.

                        MARY
           Stop it!

                        DOM
           Just one pair! You owe me that much, you
           heartless bitch!

Healy and Tucker grab Dom and throw him down on the couch.

                        HEALY
           Dom, you're pathetic, fucking over your
           friend Ted like that.

                        DOM
           What? You fucked him over, too.

                        HEALY
           He's no friend of mine.

Suddenly Magda ENTERS from her bedroom. She's holding a half-eaten
BANANA SPLIT. Herb, the Homeless Man, follows after her, sporting
a Tom Jones and buttoning up his shirt.

                        MAGDA
           What the hell's going on here?

At first no one knows what to say. Then:

                        HEALY
           We're in love with your roommate.

                        MAGDA
           Aw, Christ, I can't take it anymore. I'm
           gonna pack my bags and go back to my own
           place.

Magda heads back into her bedroom and Herb follows.

                        MARY
           Tucker, where are your crutches?

Tucker is stumped for a second, then:

                        TUCKER
                 (British accent)
           Interesting query, Mary...

Healy slaps Tucker in the back of the head.

                        HEALY
           Shut the fuck up and tell her the truth.

Before he can respond, Ted ENTERS.

                        TUCKER
           Well isn't this nice--now we've got the
           whole gang together.

Ted can hardly believe Dom is there.

                        TED
           Dom? What are you?

                        DOM
           You stole her from me. Now I want her back.

                        MARY
                 (rolling eyes)
           Woogie and I went out for awhile in high
           school.

                        TED
                 (stunned)
           You're Woogie?

                        DOM
           Dom Wooganowski. Duh.

                        TED
           But but you're married. You have kids a
           great wife.

                        DOM
           If you're so happy with them, please, be my
           guest.

                        HEALY
           If I may I have a proposal.

Everyone turns to Healy.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           I say none of us leave this room until our
           young Mary here stops jerking us around and
           decides once and for all who she wants. Now
           Mary, I know this is difficult but you
           really will be doing them all a favor to
           tell them the truth about us.

                        MARY
           Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're
           a murderer.

Healy glares at Tucker.

                        TUCKER
           Uh, well...not exactly. You see, I
           exaggerated a little there.

                        MARY
           You mean he's not a criminal?

                        HEALY
           God no!
                 (pleased)
           I'm just a pathological liar!

Mary looks at Tucker, confused.

                        MARY
           Tucker...not you, too?

Tucker lowers his head and reluctantly nods.

                        TUCKER
           Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my
           folks.

                        MARY
           Oh Jesus...

Just then the door opens and BRETT FAVRE, the Packers quarterback
ENTERS, with Warren (wearing a walkman) beside him. Everyone is
stunned.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           Brett...?

                        BRETT FAVRE
           Hi, Mary.

                        HEALY
           What the hell is Brett Favre doing here?

                        BRETT FAVRE
           We're in town to play the Dolphins.

                        TED
           I called him. I told him to pick up Warren
           and get over here.

everyone turns their attention to Ted.

                        TED (cont'd)
           Mary, I found out that your buddy Tucker
           there lied to you about Brett.

Tucker lowers his head.

                        TED (cont'd)
           Brett never said anything bad about Warren.
           He loves Warren...and from what he just
           told me on the phone, he loves you, too.
                 (beat)
           He's the guy you should be with.

                        BRETT FAVRE
           That's right, Mare. And you know I'll
           always be true to you.

                        DOM
           Aw shit, this isn't fair.

Mary manages a smile.

                        TED
                 (to Mary)
           I realized something tonight. I'm no better
           than any of these guys. None of them really
           love you...they just fixated on you because
           of how you made them feel. But that's not
           real love...Thank you for letting me see
           that. Now I can get on with the rest of my
           life.

Tucker, Healy, and Dom scoff.

                        TUCKER
           Oh please...

                        DOM
           Don't listen to him, Mary. It's a ploy.

                        HEALY
           You are so full of shit, Strohman. Are you
           going to stand here and tell us that you
           aren't in love with this girl?

Ted looks into Mary's eyes. She looks vulnerable.

                        TED
           Yeah...that's what I'm telling you.
                 (winks)
           See you, Mare.

Ted looks Mary in the eye, then starts for the door.

                        TED (cont'd)
                 (as he passes Warren)
           See you, Warren.

                        WARREN
           Huh...?

Ted lifts the earphones off Warren's ear.

                        TED
           See you, Warren.

                        WARREN
           Bye, Ted.

Ted then WALKS OUT OF THE ROOM. They all stand there in silence
for a moment, then Dom turns to Brett Favre.

                        DOM
           Hey, Brett, any chance I can get you to
           autograph one of these pumps for me?

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. MIAMI STREET - DAY

Ted is walking down the street BLUBBERING LIKE A SCHOOLGIRL.
Everyone he passes stares at him. Suddenly Mary comes running down
the OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET.

                        MARY
           Ted!

Ted stops and looks across the street at her. He wipes his eyes,
hopeful.

                        TED
           What what are you doing here?

                        MARY
           You forgot your keys!

She holds up a RABBIT FOOT KEY-CHAIN.

                        TED
                 (deflated)
           Oh. Thanks.

They remain across the street from one another.

                        MARY
           Did you mean what you said back there, Ted?

Ted starts to well up again.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           Ted...?

                        TED
                 (looking down)
           I...I just want you to be happy, Mary.

                        MARY
           But I think I'd be happiest...with you.

Ted just stares at her.

                        TED
           You're fucking with me, right?

Mary smiles.

                        TED (cont'd)
                 (wiping eyes)
           But but what about Steve?

                        MARY
           Oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun--the guy
           doesn't even drink beer or gamble.

Now Ted smiles.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           Get over here.

                        TED
           Really?

                        MARY
           Really.

The BEAMING Ted starts walking across the street. Suddenly a BUS
WHIZZES BY AND SMACKS TED BROADSIDE. He bounces around under the
bus like a rag doll, then finally squirts out the back end and
TUMBLES TO A LIMP STOP.

Mary SCREAMS and runs toward the body as a CROWD begins to gather.

                        MARY
           Ted, no, no....!

She starts giving him CPR. Somebody covers him with a blanket.

Just then, another CAR WHIZZES OVER HIS FEET like speedbumps. The
crowd winces.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           Somebody hold up traffic!
                 (beat)
           Come on, Ted. Come on. Tell me you're going
           to be okay.

Then Ted takes a deep breath and his eyes flutter open.

                        TED
           Mary....Oh Mary, I love you.

Mary's smile is as bright as the light from heaven.

                        MARY
           I love you too, Ted.
                 (beat)
           I think I always have.

As the two lovebirds kiss, a LADY CALLS OUT:

                        LADY
           Over here! I found his foot! It was in the
           storm drain!

ON THE LADY as she holds up a SEVERED FOOT in a cloth.

                        MARY
           All right, everyone, let's fan out and look
           for the penis!

As Ted REACTS to this, we pull UP, UP, UP, and

                                                       FADE OUT.

          DJANGO REINHARDT'S "TEA FOR TWO".


   FADE IN:


   INT.   LIVING ROOM   -   NIGHT.

   ALBERT, a middle-aged man, feeds MELVIN, a two-year-old.

                    ADULT MELVIN (V.O.)
           I loved my father and he taught me
           many useful things. But he didn't
           teach me anything at all about
           women. There was a time when I
           resented that. And then, one day,
           it occurred to me that perhaps he
           didn't know all that much about
           the fairer sex.

   On the other side of the room, CORINNE, a vulgar,
   morbidly obese woman, sits on the couch and devours a
   large packet of potato chips.

                    ADULT MELVIN (V.O.)
           One look at my mother and I had
           conclusive proof.

   She burps loudly and gives a smile of satisfaction.


   EXT.   EAST PERTH STREETS    -    PRESENT DAY.

   MELVIN, now thirty-two, walks along with MIKE, three.
   Both are bespectacled.

                           MELVIN
           Here's what I'm going to do, son.
           I'll give it to you straight. I'm
           not going to fill your head with
           stories about fictitious characters
           like Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny
           or God. There's only one thing you
           need to worry about in this life and
           that's women. And I'm going to
           teach you everything I know about
           the art of meeting, courting and
           seducing 'em. Don't worry about
           anything else, there's nothing more
           important. Reading, writing, toilet
           training you can learn later in life.
                                                        2.

   INT.   DEPARTMENT STORE   -   DAY.

   Mike, wearing cute denim overalls with a teddy bear
   embroidered on the front, stands on a footstool in front
   of Melvin and a TAILOR.

                           MELVIN
           Clothes maketh or unmaketh the man.
           What were you thinking when you put
           that on this morning? That you were
           going to spend the day in the sandpit?

   Mike responds with a look of innocence and confusion.

                           MELVIN
                        (to tailor)
           We'll take the best you've got.
                         (to Mike)
           The finer the threads, the more
           inclined the ladies will be to tear
           them off. I know, don't try to make
           sense of their logic. They have none.


   EXT.   CAFE   -   DAY.

   Melvin at a table with Mike, who is now dressed in smart
   casual attire and looks more like his father.

                           MELVIN
           Of course, it's not all about clothes.
           It's the way you carry yourself too.
           You've gotta make a conscious effort
           to be relaxed but in control in all
           situations. And a little playful.
           Go for an expression where you're
           suppressing mild amusement. But
           don't overdo it. You want to look
           dignified at all times.

   Melvin glances over to Mike, who is picking his nose.

                           MELVIN
           Damnit, son! Are you not listening
           to a word I say?

   Mike freezes, unsure what to do, his finger still planted
   in his nostril. Melvin yanks it out.
                                                        3.

   EXT.   PRESCHOOL    -       DAY.

   Melvin and Mike approach the entrance.

                          MELVIN
          Now meeting the right person is
          really all about spending enough
          time in the right places. So we're
          going to a new preschool today. One
          in a higher socioeconomic suburb.


   EXT.   PLAYGROUND       -    DAY.

   Melvin and Mike sit on a bench and watch children at play.

                                    MELVIN
          Well?

   Mike looks around then points.

                          MELVIN
          You like the girl over there?

   Mike nods. She's MOLLY, three. A shy, bespectacled
   girl, she sits on her own and reads a book.

                          MELVIN
          Uh ... yeah. I think there's enough
          geek genes in our family. It's time
          to diversify.

   Elsewhere, BRITTANY, four, is taunting another child.

                          MELVIN
          And avoid that bitchy girl. She may
          be pretty but believe me, it's not
          worth the trouble. You definitely
          don't want to get involved with
          someone like your mother.

   Melvin keeps looking. He points out AMELIE, three,
   well-dressed and eating a baguette.

                          MELVIN
          Stay away from the French girl too.
          French women have no morals.
                                                        4.

                          MELVIN
          It might be great for a bit of slap
          and tickle after midnight when the
          only meat your buddies are getting
          is at a kebab shop. But there's no
          word in French for "fidelity" and
          what we're looking for is a serious
          relationship. I mean, what you're
          looking for.
                 (awkwardly unconvincing)
          I'm fine.

   SARAH, three, blonde and dressed in pink, sits at a table
   nearby. She talks excitedly with a group of girls.

                          MELVIN
          She's popular, good-looking. She
          seems friendly enough. I think
          Barbie there might be worth a try.

   Mike doesn't look so sure.

                          MELVIN
          Go and talk to her.

   Intimidated, Mike shakes his head, his eyes pleading.

                          MELVIN
          C'mon! It's better to get shot
          down than wonder "What if?"

   Melvin gives him a push in Sarah's direction.

                          MELVIN
          Just show an interest in the things
          that interest her and you'll have
          plenty to talk about.

   Mike, looking completely out of place in his flashy
   clothes, apprehensively approaches the girls. They stop
   talking and watch him.

   He picks up Sarah's handbag and admires it, putting it
   over his shoulder. Then he tries on her sun hat and
   slips into her discarded pink shoes. The girls laugh at
   him and run away.

   Melvin covers his face in disbelief.
                                                       5.

   A MOMENT LATER.

   Back on the bench, Melvin scolds Mike.

                           MELVIN
           Would you like to go to the toyshop
           later on? You can pick out a nice
           fairy costume. What are you doing
           to me, boy?!

   Mike shrugs defensively.

                           MELVIN
           We need to toughen up your image now.
           Most girls are attracted to bad boys.
           See if you can start some sort of
           altercation with her. Understand?

   Mike thinks, then nods his head.


   A MOMENT LATER.

   Mike grabs a handful of sand from the sandpit, marches up
   to Sarah and throws it forcefully into her face. Sarah
   starts to cry, drawing the attention of everyone in the
   playground. Mike smiles and looks to his father for
   approval. Melvin is horrified.


   INT.   FLORIST    -   DAY.

   Mike struggles with a large arrangement of flowers.
   Melvin pays the FLORIST.

                           MELVIN
           Well that was over the top but at
           least you got her attention. And
           it's better to be known as a jerk
           rather than a fruitcake. The good
           news is you now have the opportunity
           to apologise. If you can feign
           sincerity and a desperation for
           forgiveness, you should be able to
           endear yourself to her.
                        (to florist)
           Leave the price tag on. We want
           her to know how much we paid.
                                                                6.

   EXT.   PLAYGROUND    -   DAY.

   Melvin watches from the other side of the high fence.
   Mike carries the flowers across the playground.

   He sees Sarah being comforted by her friends.         Then he
   sees Molly, who is still reading her book.

   Melvin gestures for Mike to give the flowers to Sarah.
   Mike thinks, then gives them to Molly instead.

   Melvin groans and throws his hands up in frustration.


   EXT.   CARPARK   -   DAY.

   Melvin points his finger in Mike's face.

                           MELVIN
           I'm trying to do the right thing
           by you and you mess everything up!
           You're as incompetent as ... the
           government film funding bodies!

   MARY, early thirties and attractive, approaches with
   Molly, who carries the flowers.

                            MARY
           Molly loves her flowers.      Thank you.

   Melvin's attitude changes immediately.

                            MELVIN
           Oh.   No problem. They were my idea.

                            MARY
           Well it was a very nice gesture.

   She continues walking, then stops.

                            MARY
           We're going to lunch at the cafe on
           the corner. Would you and Mike like
           to join us?

                               MELVIN
           Absolutely.      We'll see you there.

   Mary and Molly leave.       Melvin turns back to Mike.
                                                            7.

                           MELVIN
           Great work my friend! Looks like
           we're in for a double date.

   He claps a high five with his son.

                           MELVIN
           And the perfect chance for you to
           learn from a master at work.


   INT.   CAFE ON THE CORNER      -   DAY.

   Melvin, Mike, Mary and Molly sit around a table. Before
   eating, Mary and Molly bow their heads in prayer. Mike
   watches them and does the same.

   Unseen by the others, Melvin decides to give thanks too.
   And not for the food in front of him.


   EXT.   PARK   -   DAY.

   Melvin and Mary sit and watch their children laugh as
   they chase each other about.

                            MARY
           They seem to like each other.

                           MELVIN
           They certainly do.

                            MARY
           Molly has a birthday party coming
           up. Would you like to come?

                              MELVIN
           Absolutely.

                            MARY
           I'm thinking about a sleepover?
           Or is it too soon?

   She smiles at him.       Melvin raises an eyebrow seductively.

                           MELVIN
           A "sleepover" would be great. No
           such thing as "too soon" when you're
           with the right person.
                                                        8.

   He moves closer to Mary. He puts one hand on her leg and
   uses the other to play with her hair. She pulls away
   violently and stands.

                            MARY
           What are you doing?!

                           MELVIN
           Getting to know you. Before the
           "sleepover".

                            MARY
           I meant Mike coming over to spend
           the night. Not his Dad.

                             MELVIN
           Oh.

   Unimpressed, she walks over to Molly, lifts her into her
   arms and they leave. Mike stares coldly at his father,
   his hands on his hips.


   EXT.   BUS STOP   -   DAY.

   Mike picks flowers from a nearby garden. Melvin sits
   alone, dejected. Mike approaches and whispers in his ear.

                           MELVIN
           It's better to get shot down than
           wonder "What if?"?

   Mike whispers more.

                           MELVIN
           I now have the opportunity to
           apologise and endear myself to her?

   Mike presents his father with a small arrangement of
   hand-picked flowers. Melvin thinks.

                           MELVIN
           Yeah! Yeah, you're right.   I've
           taught you well!

   He takes the flowers, leans over and kisses his boy
   fondly on the head.

                                                 FADE OUT.

                       THE THREE MUSKETEERS

    OPEN ON:
1   EXT. GASCONY - DAWN                                        1

    Dawn. A verdant field in Gascony. BIRDS CALL from tree-
    tops. The WIND RUSTLES through green leaves. A fox
    darts into a thick hedge. And last, anti-pastoral, out
    of place -- the sound of CLASHING STEEL.

    SUPERIMPOSE:   France, 1625.
    Suddenly, two young men burst INTO VIEW, sword points
    cutting brilliant arcs through the morning air. The
    first is GIRARD, bearded, nearly thirty, a man in every
    facet. The second, D'ARTAGNAN. Younger in appearance
    and attitude. Exuberant, handsome. And at just this
    moment, bounding over a low stone wall with a boisterous
    cry.

    They battle across an expanse of turf thick with dew.
    Girard is the more polished combatant. But d'Artagnan is
    nearly a force of nature. He whips his sword through the
    air with wild-hearted abandon. He tumbles and somer-
    saults. This is fun.
    Girard and d'Artagnan cross the field, pass over a wooden
    fence, struggle toward a stable and hayloft. As they
    fight, both men utilize a variety of props. Handfuls of
    hay, a wooden spar, quick kicks from heavy boots.
    Anything goes as the swords cut through the air.
    D'Artagnan, gaining increasing advantage, forces Girard
    up against a peaceful country manor. Girard, seemingly
    cornered, executes a gymnastic flip onto the roof,
    fights from this high angle. D'Artagnan merely smiles...
    and follows.


2   ANGLE ON ROOFTOP                                           2

    Seen briefly in silhouette against the rising sun, Girard
    and d'Artagnan scramble up the v-shaped rooftop, pause
    to exchange swipes at the peak, then slide down the other
    side, attacking, defending, as they go.

3   INCLUDE INTERIOR                                           3

    Inside the manor house, a HANDSOME WOMAN of forty glances
    up from her writing table, hears FOOTSTEPS on the roof.
    She reacts -- curious, not afraid -- and steps to an open
    window. As  if to follow the footsteps to the other side.

                                                        2.

4   BACK TO SCENE                                              4
    Girard leaps to the ground first -- landing in an en-
    closure filled with SQUAWKING GEESE. D'Artagnan flies
    after. The geese scatter, d'Artagnan -- whose wild
    progress frequently resembles that of a young colt --
    stumbles briefly. Girard seeks advantage, thrusts his
    sword toward the young man's heart. But d'Artagnan
    parries the blow with a heavy gloved hand, rolls over
    the offending goose -- glances deadpan apology -- and
    rises to fight again.
    The epic battle continues. Girard's modest success de-
    volves into desperate flight. D'Artagnan's seemingly
    endless reserves are wearing him down. Then, at the
    last possible moment, Girard spies escape: a slow-
    moving HAYCART RUIMBLING up the country road. He runs
    toward the cart, leaps upon it, turns back to d'Artagnan
    with a confident smirk -- an expression that vanishes
    when the young Gascon executes a nearly impossible leap
    to join him.
    And still they battle, the clash of swords a kind of
    music by now, the men, their exuberance, the bright morn-
    ing all combined into a dazzlingly heroic display. Just
    then: The haycart crosses a wooden plank bridge. Girard
    backs from d'Artagnan's sword, weak from exhaustion, he
    stumbles. D'Artagnan has his man and he knows it. He
    prepares one last blow --
    -- And the haycart shifts, deposits both men over the
    side and down to the small muddy creek below. A comical
    antidote to all this glorious swordplay.


5   INCLUDE CREEK                                              5
    Girard lands flat on his back, stunned, his sword out of
    reach. D'Artagnan lands similarly, but recovers with
    grace, or rather, as much grace as the muddy situation
    will allow. He rolls toward Girard, sword in hand, and
    lightly places the sharp gleaming tip against his adam's
    apple.

    A long beat. Then a surprise. Girard begins to laugh,
    long and loud. D'Artagnan responds with a charmed smile.

                            D'ARTAGNAN
              Had enough?
                            GIRARD
                     (breathless
                      deadpan)
              I believe now would be a good
              time to end your, uhm, formal
              training. Well done.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                             3.

5   CONTINUED:                                                    5
                               D'ARTAGNAN
                 Thank you, sir.

    D'Artagnan leaps to his feet, races off without another
    word. Girard struggles upward, peers at the shape of his
    clothing -- cut to ribbons, muddy and soaked.

                               GIRARD
                 And god have mercy on whomever
                 you meet next.

                                                   CUT TO:

6   EXT. GASCONY - HANDSOME WOMAN'S POV - DAY                     6

    D'Artagnan races across the green fields, triumphant.

    She stands at the open window, watches his coltish high
    steps with love. Sadness too.

                                                   CUT TO:

8   INT. D'ARTAGNAN'S HOME - DAY                                  8

    D'Artagnan steps through the country manor, calls out:
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                 Mother...?

    But he does not see her.    D'Artagnan continues, chatter-
    ing proudly as he goes.

                               D'ARTAGNAN
                 Did you see us? You heard us,
                 I'll bet. Girard finally
                 surrendered a compliment...
                 though I almost had to kill him
                 to get it... Mother...?
    D'Artagnan comes upon an open door, a small room beyond.
    He pauses, then steps inside.

9   INCLUDE FATHER'S STUDY                                        9

    A Spartan interior. Heraldic emblems upon the wall, sou-
    venirs from battles won and lost.
                                                   (CONTINUED)

    A piece of parchment, on it the words: "All For One, and
    One For All." And, in a place of honor, a worn blue and
    gold tunic. Below it, the Handsome Woman, d'Artagnan's
    mother, kneels at an open chest. She turns back to him.
                              MOTHER (HANDSOME WOMAN)
                 Sit down.

                               D'ARTAGNAN
                 Didn't you hear me? Girard --

                              MOTHER
                 Sit.
    D'Artagnan sighs, sits in a large wooden chair. A beat.
    His mother speaks quietly, eyes turned back to the open
    chest.
                               MOTHER
                 Your father was a proud man. And
                 he had a right to be. I never
                 knew one as brave or as kind. He
                 knew that his strength was a gift
                 to be given in the service of
                 honor. That is why he dedicated
                 his life to his country and his
                 King. That is why he gave his
                 life, for both.

    She reaches into the chest, carefully extracts a
    beautiful saber.
                               MOTHER
                 I watched you this morning and
                 saw someone I knew. You have
                 your father's heart, his will to
                 fight, his courage. But these
                 gifts have no value unless they
                 are given.
    She rises, holds the sword out to him.

                               MOTHER
                 It's time for you find your
                 fortune with men as brave and
                 as bold as you are. In Paris.
                 With the King's Musketeers.
                        (re: sword)
                 You'll need this.

                               D'ARTAGNAN
                        (quiet, moved)
                 Father's sword.

                                MOTHER
                  Forged in the Crusades, handed
                  from generation to generation.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  And now to me.

     D'Artagnan can't help it, his eager reply leavens the
     nobility of the moment with warm humor, youthful inno-
     cence. His mother smiles as she repeats.

                                 MOTHER
                  Yes, son.   And now to you.
     With that, she holds out the beautiful saber.         D'Artagnan
     takes it firmly into his hands.

     A huge and beautiful field appropriate to the moment.
     Mother and son stand in the vast expanse. D'Artagnan
     holds a restless horse by the reins, his traveling satch-
     el attached to the saddle.
                                MOTHER
                  I'm not your mother now. I'm
                  speaking for your father. And
                  this is what he would have told
                  you. Never forget the code of
                  the d'Artagnans. It is your
                  special heritage.

                  Never run from a fight...
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I won't.

                                MOTHER
                  Never submit to insults.    Except
                  from the King.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Never.

                  And be wary of Cardinal Richelieu
                  for he rules France through the
                  King.
     A bittersweet moment. D'Artagnan posed before his first
     great adventure. But not completely certain that he
     wishes to leave home.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Mother. Maybe I should wait.
                  Until after harvest.
     D'Artganan's mother smiles, understands.       And speaks
     gently to urge him forward.

                                MOTHER
                  You've heard that every man in
                  the Musketeers is on the run from
                  someone or something?
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                  Yes.   But what am I running from?

                                MOGHER
                         (gentle humor)
                  A shrew of a mother, and a drafty
                  old house. Now go.

     And in this fashion, she releases him. D'Artagnan sweeps
     his Mother into an embrace, now turns, heroic, and leaps
     into the saddle. The horse reacts with a start, skitters
     in a half-cicle. D'Artagnan struggles to gain control,
     finally brings the horse to rein. He manages a charmed
     grin. His mother smiles, scolds:
                                MOTHER
                  And for heaven's sake, practice
                  your horsemanship.
                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                  Horsemanship.    Got it.
     D'Artagnan digs his heels into the horse's flanks, shoots
     off across bright green fields. His Mother shields her
     eyes from the sun, feels a gathering of tears, and
     watches him ride into the distance.

12   EMBLEM OF KING'S MUSKETEERS                                  12
     It FILLS the SCREEN, serves as background for the MAIN
     TITLES. As the FINAL CREDIT APPEARS, and the MUSIC ENDS,
     the blade of a sword ENTERS FRAME. It slides beneath the
     emblem, pries it off the wall. The emblem falls to the
     floor with an undignified thud. A fire blazes in a huge
     hearth behind it.


13   INCLUDE MUSKETEERS' HEADQUARTERS                             13
     A room in the Musketeers Headquarters. The fallen emblem
     is retrieved by JUSSAC, an officer who wears the bright
     red tunic of the Cardinal's Guards.
                             JUSSAC
               What should I do with this?

     Jussac offers   the emblem to a tall, elegant wraith in
     black finery,   a patch covers one eye. This is the COUNT
     DE ROCHEFORT,   Richelieu's right hand, one of the deadli-
     est swordsmen   in all of France.
                             ROCHEFORT
               Throw it on the fire with
               everything else.
                             JUSSAC
               But this is the emblem of the
               Musketeers...
                             ROCHEFORT
               The Musketeers no longer exist.
               Or haven't you heard?
                      (cold command)
               Throw it on the fire.
     Jussac hastily adds the emblem to the fiery blaze, it is
     instantly consumed. Rochefort watches it burn, then
     walks to a balcony overlooking a vast courtyard.

14   INCLUDE COURTYARD                                            14
     Grim, funereal silence as a hundred Musketeers remove
     their blue and gold tunics, drop them into a pile that
     already contains their swords and muskets. The
     Musketeers remain stoic throughout, unwilling to reveal
     the depth of their despair. The latter is supervised by
     the Cardinal's Guards, who view their hated enemies'
     plight with satisfaction. This is a sad day for the
     Musketeers, the end of an era.

     MONSIEUR DE TREVILLE forces a salute toward the captain
     of the Cardinal's Guards, hands over his own musket.

     Treville is the respected leader of the Musketeers.       This
     is the saddest moment of all.

     Rochefort watches from above, a cruel smile twists his
     lips. He steps to the railing, addresses the men below.

                                  ROCHEFORT
                  Musketeers...
     A hundred faces turn   upward to regard him. And on each
     the same expression   -- absolute loathing for the man in
     black. Rochefort is    not intimidated by this sea of con-
     tempt. He revels in    it.
                                ROCHEFORT
                  By joint edict of His Majesty
                  King Louis XIII and His Eminence
                  Cardinal Richelieu, the
                  Musketeers are officially
                  disbanded. In preparation for
                  the coming war with England, your
                  ranks and commissions are hereby
                  transferred to the Infantry. You
                  will be contacted and told where
                  to report. Until that time, you
                  are instructed to return to your
                  homes.
                                DE TREVILLE
                         (shouting to
                          Rochefort)
                  And who will protect the King?
                                ROCHEFORT
                  The Cardinal's Guards are more
                  than capable of assuming that...
                  responsibility.

     Muttered curses and dissent throughout.       Rochefort raises
     his voice to be heard:

                                ROCHEFORT
                  You are hereby ordered to
                  disperse. Should even one of you
                  resist... the entire corps will
                  be arrested and imprisoned.
                         (with pleasure
                          and disdain)
                  'All for one, and one for all.'

     As Rochefort intended, the Musketeers explode. But
     before they can attack the Guards, de Treville's com-
     manding voice calls out above the clamor.
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                  Musketeers!

     And with that, the Musketeers freeze. Their eyes go to
     de Treville. There is a moment of silence as de Treville
     chooses his words carefully. Even in defeat, de Treville
     is stoic.

                                DE TREVILLE
                  Go to your homes. Wait. Our
                  day will come again.

     De Treville shoots a defiant look at Rochefort who smiles
     in a patronizing manner. Then, de Treville leads his
     Musketeers out of the courtyard.


15   ROCHEFORT                                                  15
     He returns to the adjoining room where Jussac stands by.
     Rochefort has enjoyed himself immensely. He goes to a
     mirror and preens, adjusting his eye patch to a more rak-
     ish angle. That's when he catches a glimpse of something
     behind him. Something red. Rochefort turns.
     a tall, powerfully built MAN stands in the shadows of the
     room, a spectre in red.
                                ROCHEFORT
                  Your Eminence.
     Rochefort and Jussac instantly fall to their knees.
     ARMAND DU PLEISS THE CARDINAL RICHELIEU steps out of the
     darkness and into the light, his long crimson robes
     swirling about him like clouds of blood. His face is
     long, shrewd and intelligent. His eyes are penetrat-
     ing. He smiles his crocodile smile.
     Richelieu observes a duty roster on one of the walls.
     It contains the names of all the Musketeers, past and
     present.
                                RICHELIEU
                  Have they all been accounted for?

                                ROCHEFORT
                         (hedging)
                  All but... three.

     On Richelieu's face, a flicker of irritation.

                                RICHELIEU
                  Three?

                  I sent a patrol to find them but
                  it hasn't returned yet.
                                RICHELIEU
                  I want those Musketeers, not
                  excuses. Bring them in at once.

16   EXT. BOULEVARD OF CRIME - DAY                                   16
     Jussac leads   a regiment of the Cardinal's Gruards down
     Paris' most   colorful and notorious street. They react
     to SHOUTING   and VIOLENT NOISES coming from a tavern
     ahead. The    one called... The Dead Rat.
     The tavern door flies open, and two of the Cardinal's
     Guards are flung into the street, bruised and bloody.
     Just then: A window on the second floor bursts open,
     and a big Musketeer dangles a struggling Guard by his
     feet, threatening to drop him into the street. The
     Musketeer, a man of enormous appetites -- wine, women,
     song -- is called PORTHOS. Jussac shouts:
                                JUSSAC
                  Release that man!!
     Happy to comply, Porthos lets go of the Guard who plunges
     to the street with a dull thud. Then, with a wink and a
     piratical grin, Porthos ducks inside. Jussac darkens,
     signals his men, and they rush toward the tavern.


17   INT. TAVERN                                                     17

     Jussac and his company burst in and discover the room in
     a shambles, the aftermath of a violent fight. But for
     now, all is calm.

     A group of the Cardinal's Guards is seated around a big
     table littered with flagons and bottles. On the floor
     around them are their swords and rifles. It appears the
     Gruards are celebrating a victory. But wait. There's
     something wrong with this picture. On closer inspection,
     we see that the Guards have been stripped to their under-
     clothes and tied to their chairs with ropes. They are
     all bruised and bloody. Some are unconscious.

     Presiding over the "celebration" are two Musketeers.
     They sit at the head of the table, relaxing with their
     boots up.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                           11.

     One of them casually cleans his sword with a lace hand-
     kerchief. He is ARAMIS, the most handsome and dashing of
     the Musketeers -- a poet and idealist -- a gentleman of
     great personal charm and style.
     His companion is   ATHOS, the Musketeers' deadliest and
     most charismatic   member -- also its most mysterious and
     tortured. Athos    is the unofficial leader of the Three
     Musketeers, their   planner and strategist. At the moment,
     he's sewing up a   nasty gash on his right arm.

                                JUSSAC
                         (approaching)
                  What is this?

     Athos greets him with a dark smile.

                                ATHOS
                  A private party. Go away.
                                ARAMIS
                  Athos -- is that any way to greet
                  our guests?

     Aramis leaps to his feet and bows graciously.    He is the
     epitome of politeness.
                                ARAMIS
                  Don't be shy, gentlemen. Come
                  in. Your friends have been
                  expecting you.
     Jussac is not amused.

                                JUSSAC
                  Your presence is requested at
                  Musketeer Headquarters by Captain
                  Rochefort.
     Athos and Aramis exchange looks.

                                ATHOS
                  The Cyclops is a Captain? He
                  must've made a pact with the
                  Devil.

                                ARAMIS
                  Or the Cardinal.
                                ATHOS
                  What's the difference?

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                            12.

                                ARAMIS
                         (with an edge
                          of contempt)
                  The Devil is more ethical than
                  the Cardinal.

     Jussac takes a step forward, fingering his saber.

                                JUSSAC
                  You're instructed to come with
                  me and surrender your tunics.

     With a sweeping gesture, Athos indicates the bloody
     Guards around him.

                                ATHOS
                  These gentlemen made a similar
                  request.
                                JUSSAC
                  Are you refusing to come
                  peaceably?
                                ATHOS
                  Probably. But I'll leave it up
                  to my companions. Aramis?
                                ARAMIS
                  We can't refuse Rochefort's
                  invitation. It would be
                  impolite.
     Athos tips back in his chair and gazes upward.

                                ATHOS
                  And what do you say, Porthos?

     To the Guards' surprise, Porthos is balancing on the
     balcony rail above, just about even with a large wagon
     wheel chandelier.

                                PORTHOS
                  I'll be right down!
     With the grace of an aerialist, Porthos jumps from the
     balcony and lands atop the chandelier. His weight causes
     the chains suspending it to break. With a whoop of
     pleasure, Porthos rides the chandelier down as it lands
     squarely atop Jussac's Guards, squashing them.

     When the dust clears, only Jussac has been spared. He
     looks on in disbelief as Porthos extricates himself from
     the wreckage and calmly brushes his clothes off.

     Athos and Aramis sheathe their swords, put on their hats,
     wrap their capes around them and cross the room to join
     Porthos.
                                ARAMIS
                  Congratulations, Porthos.   You

                                PORTHOS
                  My aim was off. I was trying to
                  hit Jussac.

     Athos fixes Jussac with a dark, threatening look.
                                 ATHOS
                  Now.   About those tunics...
     Jussac turns to watch Athos, Porthos, and Aramis step to
     the street. He mutters as if to curse:

                  Musketeers.

18   EXT. HIGH ROAD TO PARIS - DAY                                  18
     D'Artagnan, on horseback, pauses on a bluff overlook-
     ing the magnificent city on the Seine. What he beholds
     is Paris as it looked in the early part of the Seven-
     teenth Century, its steeples and towers rising to meet the
     sky. For a country boy like d'Artagnan, Paris is a
     magical place where the wildest of dreams can come true.
     D'Artagnan's reverie is broken by the sound of THUNDERING
     HOOFBEATS coming from behind. He turns in response and
     what he sees is this:
     Two women on horseback are riding for all they're worth
     pursued by two men on horseback.

19   D'ARTAGNAN                                                     19

     His heroic blood stirs. Women in danger! As the women
     GALLOP past, d'Artagnan leaps from his horse. Quickly
     formulating a plan, he clambers up the trunk of a nearby
     tree and climbs out on a branch that overhangs the road.

                                                           14.

     As the two riders pass underneath, d'Artagnan leaps into
     space and tackles one of them, knocking him out of the
     saddle. The rider hits the ground and is knocked sense-
     less. One down.
     D'Artagnan scrambles to his feet as the second rider re-
     verses direction and GALLOPS back, charging d'Artagnan.
     The rider draws his saber.
     D'Artagnan dodges the horse and the sword. He catches
     the second rider's arm and yanks him right out of the
     saddle. The man lands with a painful thud at
     d'Artagnan's feet. Before he can recover, d'Artagnan is
     upon him with flying fists. One swift punch -- and the
     second rider is senseless. Two down.

     D'Artagnan stands over his two victims, out of breath,
     but greatly pleased with his performance. He looks up as
     the two women ride back to see what's happened.
     The first woman is of noble breeding, a beautiful dark-
     haired girl in her late teens. Her name is ANNE. Her
     companion is roughly the same age, titan-haired and
     equally beautiful. Her name is CONSTANCE.
     Anne regards the two men on the ground, then d'Artagnan.
     She shakes her head, laughs with delight and rides off.
     Constance remains. She smiles down at d'Artagnan from
     atop her horse.
                             CONSTANCE
               Do you have any idea what you've
               done?

                             D'ARTAGNAN
               I've saved you and your friend
               from these bandits.

                             CONSTANCE
               These 'bandits' are the Queen's
               own bodyguards.

     D'Artagnan is stunned.
                              D'ARTAGNAN
               The Queen?

     Constance points a finger in Anne's direction.
                             CONSTANCE
               If I were you, I'd make myself
               scarce. These men are going to be
               very angry when they wake up.

     D'Artagnan looks at the two bodyguards who are beginning
     to recover. Then he looks up at Constance, feeling like
     a prize idiot.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I didn't know. I thought...

     Constance smiles at him, her eyes twinkling.
                                CONSTANCE
                  Do you have a name?

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  D'Artagnan.

                                CONSTANCE
                  You're a very foolish boy,
                  d'Artagnan... but a very handsome
                  one. Good-bye.
     Constance spurs her horse and rides off to catch up with
     Anne.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                          (calling after her)
                  Wait!   You didn't tell me your
                  name!
     But Constance is gone.
     D'Artagnan stands in the middle of the road, feeling
     foolish and oddly thrilled at the same time. The two
     bodyguards groan and grumble.

     A bright reflection catches d'Artagnan's eye. He looks
     down and sees a gleaming bracelet. He picks it up and...

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  The man who attacked you...
                         (pointing in the
                          opposite direction)
                  ... went that way.
     With a guilty smile, d'Artagnan spurs his horse and rides
     like Hell.

     D'Artagnan rides to the top of the ridge, stops suddenly,
     sees something that takes his breath away.

22   D'ARTAGNAN'S POV                                             22
     Paris laid out for him like a jewel, cloaked in mystery,
     promising adventure and romance. D'Artagnan watches the
     women as they ride into the fabled city in the distance.
     He follows.

23   INT. MUSKETEER HEADQUARTERS - DAY                            23
     Athos, Aramis, and Porthos sweep into the now deserted
     courtyard. Silence -- the last thing they expected --
     stops them in their tracks. The place is a cemetery,
     haunted by the ghosts of generations of Musketeers.
     Porthos is visibly distraught. Rochefort enters from
     behind an archway.

                             ROCHEFORT
               I'll take those tunics,
               Musketeers.
                             PORTHOS
                      (to Aramis)
               What did he say?
                             ARAMIS
               He said he'll take those tunics.
                              PORTHOS
               Tunics?   Coming right up.
     Porthos reaches inside his cloak and takes out a crumpled
     red tunic he took from one of the Cardinal's guards. He
     drops it on the ground, digs into a pocket and takes out
     another. He finds another in his boot and another up his
     sleeve. There's one in his hat. Like a magician, he
     keeps pulling red tunics out of the most bizarre places.

     Athos and Aramis have a few guard tunics themselves.
     They pull them out and drop them into the growing pile.

                             ATHOS
               I was trying to remember the last
               time I saw you here. I know. It
               was the day you were kicked out of
               the Musketeers.

                             ARAMIS
               Conduct Unbecoming a Musketeer.
               Wasn't that the charge?

                             ROCHEFORT
               You ought to know. Three witnesses
               stood against me.

                                ATHOS
                  It was the least we could do.

     The bitter memory hangs in the air for a moment.
                                ROCHEFORT
                  You are hereby ordered to
                  surrender your commissions and
                  make yourselves available for
                  reassignment in the King's Army.

                                ATHOS
                  And if we refuse?
                                ROCHEFORT
                  You will become outlaws.   Hunted
                  men.
                                PORTHOS
                  It doesn't matter where I go or
                  what I do. Sooner or later
                  somebody's calling me 'outlaw.'
     Athos cuts him off with a look. He's familiar with
     Porthos' propensity for tall tales. But not here, not
     now. Athos turns back to the balcony. Rochefort lobs a
     taunt.
                                ROCHEFORT
                  Are you refusing to serve your
                  King?
                                ARAMIS
                  We are refusing to serve the
                  Cardinal.
                                PORTHOS
                  Same thing, these days.
                                ARAMIS
                  France has one King too many.

                                ROCHEFORT
                  I'll tell him you said that.

     Athos, who has remained silent, speaks with quiet power:

                                ATHOS
                  Do that, Rochefort. Tell his
                  Emminence the Cardinal that we
                  will continue to perform our sworn
                  duty to protect the King. From
                  enemies across the sea.

                  Musketeers.

     The gauntlet has been thrown.       Rochefort picks it up with
     glee.

                                ROCHEFORT
                  I'll make sure His Emminence the
                  Cardinal gets the message. But I
                  can't promise he'll be pleased.

     Rochefort steps back, disappears into the shadows.       A
     beat. The Musketeers regard each other.

24   EXT. STREETS OF PARIS - DAY                                  24

     D'Artagnan rides through the streets of Paris. A country
     boy happily stunned by the sights, sounds, and smells of
     the city. Merchants gossip and call to each other from
     shop doors. Colorful vendors and pedestrians move along
     the crowded boulevard. Acrobats, puppeteers, and jug-
     glers perform on street corners. LAUGHTER and MUSIC
     drift from taverns and public houses.

     D'Artagnan views it all with great enthusiasm. He sees
     the exterior of the Musketeer Headquarters... wow! The
     future belongs to him.

25   ATHOS                                                        25
     He crosses the courtyard to a large wooden door. But as
     he reaches for the handle, the door flies open and smacks
     him in his injured arm.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (as he enters)

                         (wincing in pain)
                  Aaarrgghh...

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (in a panic; looking
                          around)
                  Where are they? Where are the
                  Musketeers? I'm in the right
                  place, aren't I?

                                ATHOS
                         (through gritted
                          teeth)
                  Not as far as I'm concerned.

     Athos is wearing his cape in such a way that it hides
     his Musketeer tunic. D'Artagnan has no idea who he's
     dealing with.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  But this is Musketeer
                  Headquarters...

                  No. This was Musketeer

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  You mean it's been moved?

                                ATHOS
                  I mean the Musketeers have been
                  disbanded. Feel free to poke
                  around for souvenirs.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  What do you mean 'disbanded'?

                                ATHOS
                  Some nonsense about being needed in
                  the army. Now if you'll excuse
                  me...
     D'Artagnan blocks Athos' path.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  But I just got here. How can I
                  become a Musketeer if they've been
                  disbanded?
                                ATHOS
                  I'd say you've got a problem.
     D'Artagnan grabs Athos by his injured arm. Athos, stif-
     ling pain, fixes d'Artagnan with a deadly look.
                                ATHOS
                  You could use a lesson in manners.
     D'Artagnan touches his sword, eyes flashing at the pos-
     sibility of a duel.
                               D'ARTAGNAN
                  Any time.

                                ATHOS
                  I'm in a hurry now -- but I'll
                  meet you at the Carmes-Deshaux
                  monastery at noon.

     Athos exits.

                         (to himself)
                  An hour in Paris, and I already
                  have my first duel!
     Just then, d'Artangnan spies two familiar figures on
     horseback, distinctive cloaks hiding their faces. Anne
     and Constance, though he does not yet know their names.
     D'Artagnan hurries after.

26   EXT. STREETS OF PARIS - DAY                                  26

     START CLOSE ON Porthos, his rogue's grin, the twinkle in
     his eye.
                                PORTHOS
                  But, Catherine, don't you see? As
                  an outlaw I'll be constantly on
                  the run from the Cardinal's guards,
                  a refugee. Think of all the places
                  you can hide me. I'm thinking of
                  them now.

27   ANOTHER ANGLE                                          27

     reveals Porthos leaning against an open window, speaking
     amiably to a pretty woman on the other side. She dabs a
     tear from her eye, manages a nod.


28   ANGLE ON D'ARTAGNAN                                    28
     Meanwhile, d'Artagnan races around another corner, down a
     narrow lane, and speeds after the ladies on horseback.
     He dashes through a muddy puddle -- spraying foul water
     all over Porthos where he stands. D'Artagnan doesn't
     notice, a huge cart loaded with wine barrels has rolled
     INTO VIEW, blocking the lane. Fellow travelers shout
     complaints, the cart driver shakes his head, makes an
     obscene gesture. It's a Seventeenth Century traffic jam.

     D'Artagnan sees Anne and Constance dismount in the dis-
     tance, tie their horses, and step into an alley. A man
     waits in the shadows to escort them. D'Artagnan leaps
     off his horse, he means to continue his pursuit on foot.
     But he takes two quick steps, and... runs directly into
     Porthos' outstretched hand.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

     D'Artagnan looks up -- literally, given Porthos' impres-
     sive stature -- and sees the Musketeer's muddied tunic,
     and worse, a unique and expensive sash, now thoroughly
     soiled.
                                PORTHOS
                         (not a glimmer of a
                          grin)
                  Do you know where this sash comes
                  from?

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                  No.
                                PORTHOS
                  It is a gift from the Queen of
                  America.
     Porthos' righteous indignation is more impressive than
     his knowledge of current affairs. D'Artagnan corrects.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  There is no Queen of America.

                                PORTHOS
                         (to pretty woman)
                  Madame Augustine, would you excuse
                  me for a moment, I'm going to kill
                  him.
                         (back to d'Artagnan;
                          ever the gentleman)
                  Now, where were we?
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (glancing at the
                          ladies; the alley)
                  I rode through a puddle, muddied
                  your sash, the Queen of America
                  except there isn't one, I'm in a
                  hurry, and you were about to
                  challenge me to a duel.

                                  PORTHOS
                           (amused)
                  I was?

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  That seems to be the local custom.
     Porthos lets out a weary sigh.         He shakes his head.

                  Everywhere I go, it's always the
                  same. There's always some kid who
                  thinks he's hot with a sword...
                  some itchy punk who wants to go
                  up against the great Porthos...

                                D'ARTAGNAN

                  The great Porthos.
                         (when d'Artagnan
                          isn't impressed)
                  Me, you idiot.

     D'Artagnan gives him a blank look.
                                PORTHOS
                  Don't you know who I am?
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  The world's greatest talker?

     Porthos couldn't be more insulted.       He sputters with
     rage.
                                PORTHOS
                  All right, you little puke! You
                  want to die? So be it! One
                  o'clock behind the Luxembourg!
                  And bring a coffin!
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Bring your own!


29   EXT. STREETS OF PARIS - ALLEY - DAY                               29
     D'Artagnan thinks he sees     Anne and Constance, races down
     the alley, turns a corner,     down a short street, makes a
     hasty decision, runs down     yet another alley... and tum-
     bles into a shadowy lane.      He stops, looks left and
     right. And does see them.

     The ladies enter a chapel's back door, close the door
     behind them. D'Artagnan flies after, skids across cob-
     blestones, rips the door open... and finds himself face
     to face with the man who has escorted Anne and Constance
     this far.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                  Let me pass.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I must speak to those young women.

                  The young women do not wish to be

                                D'ARTAGNAN

                  I'll deliver it for you.

                  No, you've been enough help
                  already. Would you be so kind
                  as to point out the Carmes-Deshaux
                  Monastery?
     The Guard points to a large building in the distance with
     a large cross.

     PAN ACROSS the Virgin Mary and many lit candles to a
     BEAUTIFUL DAMSEL sharing a love seat with the third
     Musketeer, the dashing Aramis. Aramis has a book open
     and is reading from it.
     The Damsel suddenly grabs Aramis and kisses him on the
     mouth. Aramis politely extricates himself. He's not the
     least bit embarrassed, only slightly amused.

                                ARAMIS
                  Madam, I'm flattered but I thought
                  you wanted me to tutor you in
                  theology.

                                DAMSEL
                  Excuse me, Monsieur Aramis. But
                  when you started talking about
                  Original Sin, I lost control and
                  became impassioned. It won't
                  happen again.

                                ARAMIS
                  There's nothing unholy about
                  expressing one's emotions. On
                  the contrary. Religion should be
                  experienced in a passionate, all-
                  embracing way. We should feel
                  free to express our spirituality.

                                  DAMSEL
                  Yes, darling!
     The Damsel attacks him again.         Suddenly, a pounding on
     the door.
                                  MAN (O.S.)
                  Open up!

                                DAMSEL
                         (a gasp of fear)
                  My husband!
                                ARAMIS
                  Your husband!?
                                DAMSEL
                  Aramis -- run!

     But Aramis' heart is too noble.         He gets down on his
     knees.

                                ARAMIS
                  First we must pray to God for
                  forgiveness.

     That's when the door bursts open and the lady's husband,
     an irate MARQUIS enters with a pistol. His eyes blaze
     with madness. He aims the pistol at Aramis' head.

                                ARAMIS
                  On second thought, God's often
                  busy.
     Aramis leaps to his feet and sprints for the open window.

     As the Marquis aims and FIRES, Aramis puts one foot on
     the ledge and leaps into space. The shot misses him by
     inches.

                                                            26.

     As d'Artagnan runs past. Aramis lands on top of him and
     they go crashing to the cobblestones. As they untangle
     themselves and get up...
                             ARAMIS
               Thanks. You broke my fall
               perfectly. But I do apologize
               for the inconvenience...

                      (angry)
               Get off me!
     D'Artagnan pushes Aramis aside. Aramis grabs d'Artagnan
     by the scruff of his neck and pulls him back.

                             ARAMIS
               If there's one thing I can't
               abide, it's rudeness.
                             D'ARTAGNAN
               You fell on me!
                             ARAMIS
               And I apologized for it.
                             D'ARTAGNAN
               I suppose you'd like to teach me a
               lesson in manners, too.
                             ARAMIS
               I'd be honored.
     D'Artagnan brightens.   Another duel!
                             D'ARTAGNAN
               How's two o'clock behind the
               Luxembourg?
     Aramis bows politely.

                             ARAMIS
               If that's where you wish to die,
               I won't disappoint you. Until
               then...

     Aramis takes off.   d'Artagnan swells with pride.

     The Royal Palace of Louis XIII.

                             ANNE (V.O.)
               Have you seen the King?

33   INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY                                       33

     Anne, or rather, Queen Anne, steps into the throne room,
     a massive cathedral-like chamber. Twin thrones occupy
     a raised dais. An entire wall is covered with a spectac-
     ular map of the world. The map contains every known
     country and continent, including the New World. The
     SENESCHAL exits, closing the doors with a resounding boom.
     Anne pauses, all alone in the big, drafty chamber. And
     for the first time, she looks and acts her age. Barely
     a woman, chilled by the ghosts of all the French kings
     and queens who came before her. And a long way from
     home. Anne steps to the great map of the world. She
     reaches out to touch her own country, Austria, feels a
     pang of separation. We hear:
                             MAN (O.S.)
               Your Majesty...

     Anne reacts with a start. A tall, powerfully built man
     stands in the shadows, a spectre in red.
                             ANNE
               Cardinal Richelieu, you surprised
               me.
     Cardinal Richelieu steps out of the darkness.     He smiles.

                             RICHELIEU
               How was your ride?

     Richelieu's question takes her by surprise. He bows
     before Anne. Considering a reply, she extends her hand.
     The Cardinal kisses it.

               My ride...?    Well, I... I'm not
               sure...
                             RICHELIEU
                      (rising up)
               Forgive me.

               But your welfare is
               more than a matter of personal
               interest. It is a matter of
               State. But rest assured, your
               secret is safe with me.

     His manner is both charming and paternal. Anne, smart
     enough to exercise caution in all her palace dealings,
     is nonetheless touched by his concern.

                                 ANNE
                  Thank you.
     Richelieu turns to the great map, speaks gently.

                                RICHELIEU
                  You're homesick.
                                ANNE
                         (after a beat)
                  Lonely. Is that the same thing?
                                 RICHELIEU
                  Sometimes.
     Richelieu brings his eyes back to Anne, continues:
                                RICHELIEU
                  Austria's loss is France's gain.
                                ANNE
                  I'm not sure my new husband shares
                  your opinion.
                                  RICHELIEU
                  Nonsense.    He's young, not blind.

                                ANNE
                  Mostly, he is absent. I've barely
                  seen His Majesty since our wedding,
                  and that was three months ago.
                  Whenever he's around me, he has
                  nothing to say.

                                RICHELIEU
                  Arranged marriages can be
                  difficult. Your father and I
                  thought yours would bring Austria
                  and France closer together.

                  Countries align more swiftly than
                  people, I'm afraid. Louis and I
                  remain... far apart.
                                RICHELIEU
                  May I advise you?

     He says it with seeming humility, not condescension.        Anne
     nods assent.

                                RICHELIEU
                  Louis was only nine years old
                  when his father was assassinated.
                  He lost his childhood forever that
                  day. I have watched him grow
                  toward manhood, seen the toll his
                  life demands. A boy who is not
                  allowed to be a boy sometimes has
                  difficulty becoming a man. He is
                  shy, yet boastful. Giving, yet
                  stubborn. But most of all, he is
                  not yet sure exactly who he is.
                  The boy who lost his father. Or
                  the King of France.
                                ANNE
                  But how can I...?

                                RICHELIEU
                  Flatter him. Make the boy feel
                  like a King. So that the King
                  may be your husband.

     Anne considers his eloquent advice, formulates a reply...
     when the huge doors to the throne room open with a dull
     boom, the Seneschal chants:

                                SENESCHAL
                  His Majesty, the King.

     The Seneschal steps aside as LOUIS XIII enters. He is
     surprisingly young, no older than d'Artagnan. His face
     is handsome and intelligent.

                                  RICHELIEU
                  Your Majesty.
                                LOUIS
                  Cardinal Richelieu, I've been
                  looking for you.

     As Louis strides toward them, Richelieu and Anne bow.

     When Louis sees Anne, he reacts with an almost imper-
     ceptible start. Her presence catches him off guard.

                                LOUIS
                  Oh. Anne. Hello. I didn't know
                  you were here.

     Louis hides his nervousness, not to mention his love,
     behind a formal veneer. Anne, emboldened by Richelieu's
     confidences, replies:

                                ANNE
                  Would you like me to go?
     Louis suddenly remembers the reason he's here.       Determin-
     ation breeds a more capable attitude.

                                LOUIS
                  No.  Please, stay.
                         (to Richelieu, aware
                          that she is watching
                          him)
                  Your Eminence, I demand an answer.

                                RICHELIEU
                         (hiding his amusement)
                  Perhaps if I knew the question...
                                LOUIS
                  I've just been told that you went
                  ahead and disbanded my Musketeers.
                                RICHELIEU
                  You approved the decision.
                                LOUIS
                  But not the timing of the matter.
                  I intended to address them myself,
                  explain the situation...
                                RICHELIEU
                  Your Majesty, France is on the
                  brink of war. We dare not
                  hesitate.

                                LOUIS
                  But these men are my personal
                  guards...

                  field if we're to win this war
                  with England. Buckingham plans
                  to invade La Rochelle within the
                  month. I thought it best to act
                  quickly --

                  I will be the judge of what is
                  best. For me, and for France.

     He says it with newfound resolve. Richelieu receives the
     rebuke with quiet grace. Anne watches the latter closely,
     suppresses a smile. The boy is nearer to King than
     Richelieu imagined.

                                 RICHELIEU
                  Of course.   Forgive me.

     by the carriage window. Long blonde curly hair that

     DE WINTER. She is to sex, what Constance is to innocence.

     D'Artagnan watches as if in a dream. The carriage, the
     beautiful woman inside it. Paris wraps its arms around
     the young man's heart. Suddenly: a second face enters the
     carriage window, replacing hers, jarring by contrast. It
     is the fierce visage of Milady's Indo-Chinese Bodyguard,
     PARKER. The bodyguard glares, pulls at the carriage
     window curtains, taking Milady, the dream, from view.
     HOLD ON d'Artagnan, bewitched, as the CARRIAGE RUMBLES off
     into the city.

                                                 CUT TO:

36   EXT. STREETS OF PARIS - SEINE - POV SHOT - DAY              36
     A beautiful house situated near the Seine. Milady's
     carriage stops before it. She steps to the street,
     Parker follows. After a brief spoken exchange, the body-
     guard departs on some errand. HENRI, the driver, a brutal-
     looking fellow, incongruous in his elegant coachman's
     uniform, snaps the reins, and guides the carriage away.
     Milady steps inside.


37   ANOTHER ANGLE - POV                                         37
     REVEALS this to have been the POV of two men standing in
     the shadows across the street. COUNT DE WINTER, forty-
     five, a kind face etched with sadness, and ARMAND DE
     WINTER, twenty-five, his son. They are well-dressed. But
     their manner and appearance suggests that they have
     traveled a long distance to find her.
                               COUNT DE WINTER
                  Wait here.
                                ARMAND
                  But, Father...

                               COUNT DE WINTER
                  Wait.
     He will not consider otherwise. Armand sighs, stands in
     the shadows, and watches his father cross toward Milady's
     house.

38   INT. MILADY'S HOUSE - DAY                                   38
     Milady stands before a mirror, reaches for one of the many
     ivory combs that adorn her hair. As she places the comb
     we notice a small flower-like tattoo on her arm. She
     pauses to admire her beauty, then to see the image of
     Count de Winter, now standing behind her, his eyes dark
     and cold. Milady does not move from the reflecting glass,
     she smiles.

                             MILADY
               Count de Winter.

                             COUNT DE WINTER
                      (as much happiness as
                       the thought allows)
               We found you.

                             MILADY
                      (eyes on the mirror)
               Yes. Now that you have, what
               will you do?
                             COUNT DE WINTER
               Bring you back. To pay for what
               you did to my son.
                             MILADY
               And if I resist...?
                             COUNT DE WINTER
                      (voice breaking with
                       emotion)
               I will kill you with my bare
               hands.

     The Count steps closer, close enough to touch. Milady,
     eyes bright with excitement, the smile still playing about
     her lips, replies:

                             MILADY
               Well if that's the case, I'd
               better start packing. But first,
               my hair...
     Milady, who has been removing combs throughout, reaches
     for the next, and...

     Armand keeps his eyes on Milady's house opposite. No
     sign of his father. He looks about, impatient... and
     steps across the street to enter.

                                                 CUT TO:

40   INT. MILADY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    40
     Armand climbs a flight of stairs.    Still no sign of his
     father, or Milady. He calls out:

                            ARMAND
               Father?

     Worry makes him hurry. Armand takes hasty steps into
     Milady's bedroom. The first thing he sees is his own
     face in the mirror. The second is his father's inert
     body below it. Armand gasps, races to his side. A thin
     trail of bright blood is seen briefly at the older man's
     ear. Armand gathers his father up into his arms, and
     begins to weep.
                                                  CUT TO:


41   EXT. CARMES-DESCHAUX MONASTERY - DAY                         41
     The monastery is a windowless building   bordered by a
     barren field, a dueling ground for men   who have little
     time to waste.  Athos sits on a stone   bench, waits for
     his adversary to arrive. His horse is    hobbled nearby.
     D'Artagnan rides INTO VIEW, dismounts.
                             ATHOS
               Ten minutes early.
                             D'ARTAGNAN
               I have another appointment at one.
                             ATHOS
               You'll miss it, I'm afraid.

                             D'ARTAGNAN
               I'll try my best to be on time.

     Athos appreciates the young man's retort, takes a closer
     look. Then he rises to his feet, the pain in his arm
     makes him wince.

                             ATHOS
               I asked two of my friends to act
               as seconds, but they are not as
               punctual.

     D'Artagnan notices Athos' pained expression, the blood on
     his sleeve.
                             D'ARTAGNAN
               But you're wounded.

                             ATHOS
               Don't worry. I fight just as well
               with my left hand.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  If you'd rather kill me another
                  time...
                                ATHOS
                  Thanks, but I see my seconds
                  coming now.

     Porthos and Aramis arrive on horseback. They dismount,
     view d'Artagnan with amazement. D'Artagnan reacts with
     similar surprise, smiles sheepishly.

                                PORTHOS
                         (to Athos)
                  What're you doing? You can't
                  fight this man.

                                ATHOS
                  Why not?
                                PORTHOS
                  Because I'm fighting him.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Excuse me, monsieur. But not
                  until one o'clock.
                                ARAMIS
                         (amused)
                  Wait a minute. I've got a duel
                  with him, too.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                  Yes, sir.   But not until two.
                                ATHOS
                         (to d'Artagnan)
                  How long have you been in Paris?
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I arrived this morning.

                                ATHOS
                  You've been... busy.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I've also fallen in love.
                                ATHOS
                         (gruff to a fault)
                  Better to die for love than to
                  live for it. Gentlemen?

     Athos gestures for Aramis and Porthos to stand aside. He
     draws his saber, ready to fight. A beat. And in that
     moment, d'Artagnan's face reveals an emotion he has never
     felt before in his young life. Fear. Athos sees it,
     allows him a moment to withdraw his saber. D'Artagnan
     does so, they square off, touch sabers, and...

     ... Jussac leads a patrol of the Cardinal's Guards INTO
     VIEW.
                                JUSSAC
                  There they are!!
     Athos and d'Artagnan separate as Jussac and his four
     swordsmen stride towards them.

                                 ARAMIS
                  Jussac.   Again.
     Athos steps forward to meet him.
                                ATHOS
                  I told you the next time we met
                  I'd want an answer. But I didn't
                  expect you so soon.
                                JUSSAC
                  The three of you are under arrest.
                  The boy's of no interest to me
                  and is free to go. Do you intend
                  to resist?
                                PORTHOS
                  Oh, don't be stupid. Of course we
                  intend to resist. Just give us
                  a second.

     Porthos huddles with Athos and Aramis.
                                PORTHOS
                  Interesting odds. Five of them
                  and three of us.
                                ARAMIS
                  It hardly seems fair. Let's give
                  them the chance to surrender.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (interrupting)
                  Excuse me, but there are four of
                  us.

     They turn and regard d'Artagnan.

                  This is not your fight.    You're
                  not a Musketeer.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I may not wear the uniform, but I
                  believe I have the heart of a
                  Musketeer.
     The three Musketters exchange smiles. D'Artagnan's
     youthful bravado manages a small dent in their cynicism.

                                PORTHOS
                  Bold and brave.

                                ARAMIS
                  A poet.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  D'Artagnan.

                         (startled)
                  D'Artagnan?
     The name has meaning for all of them. The Musketeers
     look at each other, deadpan, shake their heads.
                                ARAMIS
                  Impossible.

                                PORTHOS
                  It couldn't be.

     Athos knows that it is. He steps forward, extends a
     hand. The others follow, shake as well. Athos intro-
     duces each in turn.

                                ATHOS
                  Athos... Porthos... Aramis.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Pleased to meet you... How do you
                  do?... Good to see you again...
     Meanwhile, Jussac and his Guards look on with increasing
     impatience. He clears his throat, draws his saber. The
     Musketeers turn toward the Guards, d'Artagnan standing
     among them.

                  The Cardinal's Guards.

     D'Artagnan and the Musketeers draw their swords... and
     charge.

42   FIGHT                                                      42
     Suddenly: nine men are locked in mortal combat. Athos
     takes a Guard named Cahusac, Porthos battles BISCARAT,
     and Aramis battles with two adversaries at once.
     D'Artagnan looks for an opponent... and finds himself
     face to face with Jussac.
     The fighting style of the Musketeers is an exuberant mix-
     ture of styles and techniques. Athos is a brutal swords-
     man, his strokes overpowering and savage. His repertoire
     also includes swift kicks, solid punches, the occasional
     elbow when necessary. Aramis is a seamless and graceful
     technician, he handles his two opponents with balletic
     ease, an artist working with steel and flesh, rather than
     paint and canvas.
     And last, and perhaps the most entertaining of all,
     Porthos. He is a walking arsenal, carrying a variety of
     bizarre weapons on his body -- a crossbow, daggers, bolo,
     nunchucks -- all of which he uses with the polished skill
     of a master. Add this funhouse of armaments to his
     already impressive size and strength, and you have a one-
     man wrecking crew of epic proportions.
     D'Artagnan's youthful energy is by now familiar. He
     bounds about like a newborn tiger, encircles his adver-
     sary, changing stance and shifting his ground with alac-
     rity. Jussac is having a hard time defending himself
     against his opponent who seems to be attacking from all
     directions at once.
                                JUSSAC
                         (losing patience)
                  Stand still! How do you expect
                  me to kill you if you keep jumping
                  around!!

43   MONASTERY                                                  43

     A monk watches from the bell tower, incensed by the battle
     raging on the field below. He grabs the BELL rope, gives
     it a mighty pull... and sounds a clamorous ALARM.

                                                           41.

44   BACK TO SCENE                                               44
     Porthos reacts to the interruption with irritation. He
     produces a pair of nunchucks. Biscarat looks at the odd
     weapon with professional curiosity, slight confusion...
     and Porthos whacks him on the side of the head, knocks
     him to the ground.

               everybody's fun.

     Aramis replies while shifting from one foe to the next.
                             ARAMIS
               They are nearer to God...

                             PORTHOS
               They're about to get a little
               nearer to the hilt of my sword.
                               ARAMIS
               Pagan.
                               PORTHOS
               Papist.
     Porthos slides over to handle one of Aramis' opponents.
     He'd rather bicker from close range. But Biscarat
     struggles to his feet, grabs his saber. Porthos sees
     him, sighs.
                             PORTHOS
                      (to Aramis)
               Excuse me?
                             ARAMIS
               I'm fine, thank you.

     And Porthos returns to his original foe. Meanwhile,
     Athos' heavy strokes take their toll. Cahusac staggers,
     wounded in arm, shoulder, grazed at the head -- and falls
     to the ground with a thud. Aramis calls out to him,
     indicates d'Artagnan:
                             ARAMIS
               Take a look at our young friend.

                             ATHOS
               You mean he's still alive?

     Not only is d'Artagnan alive, but he's making a fool out
     of Jussac.  Frustrated, enraged, Jussac makes a full lunge
     at him, but d'Artagnan ducks, then slips under Jussac's
     sword like a snake and runs him through.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                              42.

44   CONTINUED:                                                     44
     Jussac falls to the ground, lies still.    He is dead.

     Athos and Aramis react, impressed. Then turn their full
     attention on weakening foes. They disarm and disable
     them with swift strokes. Meanwhile, Porthos chases
     Biscarat into a grove of trees. The Guard has discovered
     the better part of valor, now runs for his life. Porthos
     -- who is at play as much as he is war -- takes a Spanish
     bolo from his cloak, and whips the balls over his head.
     Biscarat hears the odd WHIZZING sound, turns to face him.
     The color drains from his face.

                                 BISCARAT
                  Now what...?

     Porthos lets the bolo fly -- it catches Biscarat about
     the neck, the balls slam into his head. The Guard drops
     to the ground without a sound.
                                PORTHOS
                  God, I love my work.


45   AFTERMATH                                                      45
     A sudden silence, save for the occasional dull groan.
     D'Artagnan scans the battlefield, sees Aramis bending
     over Jussac's body, speaking in solemn tones under his
     breath.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (to Athos)
                  What's he doing?

                                ATHOS
                  Last rites. Aramis takes death
                  very seriously.

     Porthos returns in high spirits, stashes the bolo in a
     pouch under his cloak. D'Artagnan sees the other weapons
     there, including a boomerang. Maybe next time.

                                PORTHOS
                         (re: the bolo)
                  Do you know where this bolo comes
                  from?

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (a bold jest, given
                          the circumstances)
                  The Queen of America?

                                 PORTHOS
                  Spain.

     Porthos deadpans, then grins acceptance.      All for one,
     and one for all. D'Artagnan beams.

                                ARAMIS
                  Don't encourage him. By killing
                  Jussac, the boy's made himself
                  an outlaw too.

                                ATHOS
                  Not if he leaves Paris. Which is
                  exactly what he's going to do.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I can't leave. I just got here.

                                PORTHOS
                  Go home, find a wench, live long
                  and prosper.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Why can't I stay with you?
     Aramis and Porthos look to Athos.      As always, he will
     decide.
                                ATHOS
                  Because I do not want you to.
     It's hard to say whether he's acting out of concern for
     the boy... or he simply doesn't give a damn. Whatever
     the case, d'Artagnan is crestfallen. The Musketeers
     mount their horses, Porthos and Aramis adopt a friendlier
     tone.

                                ARAMIS
                  I know Athos may seem cold and
                  unfriendly, but don't let that
                  fool you.
                                PORTHOS
                  He really is cold and unfriendly.

                                ARAMIS
                  But he's also right. This is our
                  fight, not yours. Go on, get out
                  of here.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Whatever happened to the motto of
                  the Musketeers? 'All for one,
                  and one for all.'

                                  ATHOS
                  Wake up, boy.    The Musketeers are
                  just a dream.
                                                     (CONTINUED)

     Athos spurs his horse, rides away. Aramis and Porthos
     follow. HOLD ON d'Artagnan as he watches the Musketeers
     grow small in the distance. Then, sadly, he steps to his
     horse, climbs into the saddle. It has been both the best
     and the worst day of his young life.

     That's when a group of horsemen come riding around the
     corner of the monastery -- five Cardinal's Guards led by
     Rochefort himself. They see their wounded comrades,
     Jussac dead, and the three Musketeers escaping in the
     distance.

                                ROCHEFORT
                         (pointing)
                  There they go! After them!

     But before Rochefort and the Guards can give chase,
     d'Artagnan rides into the middle of the field to
     challenge them, as if to further prove himself worthy
     of the blue and gold.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (defiant)
                  Long live the Musketeers.
     And d'Artagnan draws his saber.


     AT DISTANCE
     The three Muskeeters rein their horses, look back to
     d'Artagnan's bold charge.
                                PORTHOS
                         (with admiration)
                  Do you believe this kid.

     D'Artagnan gallops toward the Guards to engage them.    He
     races through PISTOL SHOTS like a demon possessed.
     Rochefort rides to the lead, draws his sword.

                                ROCHEFORT
                         (shouts to the
                          others)
                  Fall back! I'll take him myself!

     And like two jousting knights, d'Artagnan and   Rochefort
     meet in the middle of the field. Their BLADES    connect
     with a resounding CLASH, d'Artagnan is knocked   clear of
     his saddle. He hits the ground with a painful    thud.
     Rochefort's Guards leap towards him.

                                                            45.

46   ANGLE TO INCLUDE MUSKEERS                                    46
     Porthos and Aramis are greatly moved by d'Artagnan's
     courage.

                              PORTHOS
                Rochefort's got the boy.

                              ATHOS
                       (seemingly unmoved)
                Too bad.
                              ARAMIS
                You can't just leave him.
     Athos spurs his horse, rides away. Aramis and Porthos
     exchange sad looks and hopeful comments.

                              ARAMIS
                He has a plan.
                               PORTHOS
                Definitely.   A plan.
     And with that, they gallop after.


47   BACK TO SCENE                                                47
     Meanwhile, d'Artagnan is soon outnumbered, and quickly
     subdued.
                              GUARD
                This boy fights like a wildcat.
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                       (exhausted)
                Thank you.

     The Guard clobbers d'Artagnan with the scabbard of his
     sword. The last thing d'Artagnan sees is the three
     Musketeers riding into the distance. Then the WORLD
     TILTS, GOES SUDDENLY BLACK.

     FADE IN:

48   EXT. BASTILLE - NIGHT                                        48

     The walls and towers of France's most infamous prison
     rise to meet a starless sky. The portcullis is raised
     by men-at-arms, admitting a spectacular crimson carriage
     pulled by a team of snow-white stallions. The emblem of
     the Cardinal of France is emblazoned on the carriage
     door, and THROUGH its WINDOW we see the profile of
     Richelieu.

     Lovingly, he fingers the upholstery of his extravagant
     carriage.

                                                    CUT TO:

49   INT. DUNGEON - NIGHT                                           49

     A chamber in hell. Spiders the size of rats, rats the
     size of small dogs. A foul stench in the air. D'Artagnan
     is sprawled in a corner, unconscious, on a filthy matted
     floor. The sharp tip of a sword pokes him in the chest.
     D'Artagnan wakes with a start, springs back into action.
     As if he was still battling Jussac at the Carmes-Deschaux.
     He slaps the sword away, leaps to his feet, and reaches
     for his own. But it is gone.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                  My sword --
                                ROCHEFORT
                  It's magnificent. Where did you
                  get it?

     Rochefort steps INTO VIEW, the familiar eyepatch, admiring
     d'Artagnan's sword in his hands.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (after a beat)
                  It belonged to my father.
                                ROCHEFORT
                  Your father...

     Rochefort studies d'Artagnan for a long moment, then...
                                ROCHEFORT
                  Well now it belongs to me. I
                  collect swords. I take them
                  from the men I kill.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I'm not dead yet.
     D'Artagnan starts forward. But Rochefort raises the
     sword, points it at his throat. D'Artagnan freezes,
     feels the sharp tip of the blade.
                                 ROCHEFORT
                  Soon enough.

     Rochefort shoves d'Artagnan back to the floor with a
     heavy boot. A beat. D'Artagnan peers at his dismal
     surroundings.

                  I'll give you a hint. It's not

                  Well, you're the first person who
                  was ever happy to be here.
                  Unfortunately, your visit will be
                  a short one.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  What do you mean?
                                ROCHEFORT
                  You killed one of the Cardinal's
                  Guards. An offense punishable
                  by death.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  He interrupted a duel I was
                  fighting.

                                ROCHEFORT
                  Also punishable by death.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  It was a long day.
                                ROCHEFORT
                  You know them?

                                ROCHEFORT
                  The Musketeers.
     D'Artagnan says nothing.     He will not betray them.
     Rochefort leans close.

                                ROCHEFORT
                  Tell me where they are, and I
                  will be lenient.

                                D'ARTAGNAN

                  sword.
     A long beat. D'Artagnan eyes the gleaming saber, forged
     in the Crusades. He nods, gestures for Rochefort to
     come closer. As if to impart a secret. Rochefort tilts
     downward, d'Artagnan rises up... and whispers.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Give me my father's sword, and
                  I'll cut out your heart.
     Bold words, bad timing. Rochefort snarls, slams the hilt
     of the sword into d'Artagnan's head. The youth slumps
     from the wooden stool to the floor, unconscious.
                                 ROCHEFORT
                  Fool.   Like your father.
     Rochefort storms from the cell. He nods at a grizzled
     jailer on his way out, indicates the chains and manacles
     on the cell wall. The jailer scurries over to d'Artagnan,
     inert in a shallow puddle of foul water. He lifts, drags
     him toward the chains -- but d'Artagnan's eyes pop open,
     the jailer reacts with surprise, and...
                                                   CUT TO:
50   INT. BASTILLE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT                              50
     The jailer exits from d'Artagnan's cell, closes the heavy
     door behind him. A CLOSER look reveals d'Artagnan in the
     jailer's soiled tunic, eyes bright with adventure. He
     looks left and right -- dank corridors, darkness, the
     OCCASIONAL GROAN. And steps lightly into the shadows.

51   ON D'ARTAGNAN                                                 51

     He seeks exit, finds only a labyrinth. Two jailers con-
     verse, step towards him. D'Artagnan leaps into a cell
     doorway, allows them to pass. Suddenly: scabrous hands
     reach from inside the cell, grab d'Artagnan by the throat.
     He shudders, leaps free. And continues.

     D'Artagnan steps     deeper in the labyrinth. Frustrated,
     no way out. Just      then: more FOOTSTEPS heading toward
     him. D'Artagnan      seeks refuge, watches as a cloaked
     figure steps INTO     VIEW, accompanied by a retinue of
     sullen jailers.
     D'Artagnan thinks fast... and joins them.

                                                   CUT TO:

                                                           49.

52   INT. BASTILLE - NIGHT                                       52
     D'Artagnan keeps step with the cloaked figure, the ret-
     inue. He keeps his head down, glances at the corridor
     ahead, looking for a way out. But the cloaked figure is
     escorted up a long stairway, into another hall, and
     toward a pristine wooden door. D'Artagnan watches as
     the door opens, revealing... Cardinal Richelieu, a fear-
     some apparition in red, the most powerful man in France.

     D'Artagnan's jaw drops. The cloaked figure steps inside.
     The jailers disperse. D'Artagnan takes steps as if to
     join them... then turns back, eyes the door, the Cardinal
     and the cloaked figure now behind it.

53   ANGLE TO INCLUDE INTERIOR                                   53

     The cloaked figure bows to the Cardinal. Richelieu
     smiles, concupiscent. Rochefort stands in a corner,
     ignored for the moment.
                             RICHELIEU
               I have an errand that requires
               your singular talents.

     The figure rises. The hood falls back... revealing the
     unforgettable features of Milady de Winter. She answers
     the Cardinal's smile with a seductive expression.
                             MILADY
               I was beginning to think you'd
               forgotten me.
                              RICHELIEU
               Forget you?   Impossible.
     Richelieu and Milady share a look of intimacy, two vipers
     from the same pit.

54   OUTSIDE DOOR                                                54

     D'Artagnan slips closer, reaches for the handle, finds it
     unlocked. He opens the door a fraction, holds an ear
     close...


55   BACK TO SCENE                                               55
     Richelieu produces a sealed document from his sleeve,
     and hands it to Milady.

                             RICHELIEU
               Carry this to the Duke of
               Buckingham.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                               50.

55   CONTINUED:                                                      55
                                MILADY
                         (impressed)
                  You did it. An alliance with
                  Buckingham.
                                RICHELIEU
                  The King left me no choice. Now
                  that he's come of age, the boy
                  believes he should rule France.
                  Instead of me.

     Rochefort knows what this portends.    He steps from the
     corner.
                                ROCHEFORT
                  You're going to go through with
                  ... everything?
                                RICHELIEU
                         (silences him with
                          a glance)
                  Yes. Everything.
                         (to Milady)
                  You're to leave for Calais at
                  once. A ship called the
                  Persephone will carry you to
                  England. It sails Tuesday,
                  midnight. I want Buckingham's
                  signature next to mine before the
                  King's birthday. Friday.
                                MILADY
                  Consider it done.

                                RICHELIEU
                  And doing so, shall earn you the
                  gratitude of... a King.

     Richelieu's not talking about Louis.    He's talking about
     himself.

                                                     CUT TO:

56   INT. BASTILLE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT                                56

     D'Artagnan leaps back from the door as it opens, head
     down, shuffles to join the retinue of jailers as they
     RETURN TO VIEW. Milady, unrecognizable behind her cloak,
     steps into the corridor, the retinue escorts her forward.
     D'Artagnan falls into place, eyes down, eager for escape.
     Just then: a hand slams down upon his shoulder.
     D'Artagnan looks up into the face of Captain Rochefort.

                                                            51.

58   INT. BASTILLE - NIGHT                                        58

     D'Artagnan lands with a thud at Richelieu's feet.
     Rochefort hisses:
                              ROCHEFORT
                On your knees.

     When d'Artagnan fails to respond, Rochefort gives him a
     mighty kick. D'Artagnan scrambles into the correct
     posture of supplication. Rochefort continues:

                              ROCHEFORT
                This is the boy who killed
                Jussac.
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                I can explain that --
                               ROCHEFORT
                Silence!
     Rochefort punches d'Artagnan in the head, knocking him to
     the floor. The Cardinal frowns.

                             RICHELIEU
                Rochefort. Violence solves
                nothing. Leave him to me.
     D'Artagnan reacts to the Cardinal's reasonable tone.
     Rochefort makes a sullen exit. The Cardinal smiles.
                                RICHELIEU
                Please.    Sit down.
     D'Artagnan reacts with perceptible awe, as if seeing his
     first movie star. He sits in a finely brocaded chair,
     looks at the Cardinal, an apparition in red. The Cardinal
     speaks, his manner casual, friendly.
                              RICHELIEU
                How much did you hear?

                              D'ARTAGNAN
                       (busted)
                Not a word, Your Eminence. I
                stepped from my cell for a breath
                of air, and became lost in the
                corridors, it's dark as you know,
                but then I saw a light up ahead,
                the light over your door, I...

     Richelieu smiles, dismisses d'Artagnan's tale with a
     wave of his hand.

                                RICHELIEU
                  You may have many talents, my
                  young friend. But guile is not
                  one of them. Do you have a name?

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  D'Artagnan.

                                RICHELIEU
                  I've heard that name before.   Are
                  you a Gascon?

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Yes, Your Eminence.
                               RICHELIEU
                  Tell me. What brought you to
                  Paris. And don't say 'a horse.'
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I came to join the King's
                  Musketeers.
                                RICHELIEU
                  Bad timing.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  So I've heard.
                                RICHELIEU
                  D'Artagnan, I like you. I could
                  use a capable young man like you
                  in my Guards.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I'm honored, Your Eminence, but I
                  don't think I would be very
                  popular with the other men. Not
                  after today.
                                RICHELIEU
                  I suppose not. Your heart is set
                  on being a Musketeer.
                         (off his look)
                  When I was your age, I too had
                  dreams of joining the Musketeers.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (surprised)
                  You, Your Eminence?
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                              53.

                                RICHELIEU
                  Why not? Becoming a Musketeer is
                  the fantasy of every young
                  Frenchman. Or should I say it
                  was...
                         (with seeming
                          kindness, reason)
                  Like the Knights of the Round
                  Table, the Musketeers have
                  outlived their usefulness. They
                  are a thing of the past.
                         (beat)
                  And so have your three friends.
                  Tell me where they are, d'Artagnan,
                  and I will spare your life.

     Richelieu's seeming kindness conceals a heart of ice.
     D'Artagnan sees it now, replies quietly. No longer in
     awe, but in opposition.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I'm sorry. But I can't tell you
                  what I do not know.

                                RICHELIEU
                  In that case, give my regards to
                  the headsman.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  What about my trial?
                                RICHELIEU
                  You've just had it.

     Richelieu turns for the door, means to dismiss him.
     D'Artagnan calls after.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Wait --
                               RICHELIEU
                  Why? Do you object to losing
                  your head?
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                  Yes.   I like it where it is.

                                RICHELIEU
                  Then tell me what I want to know,
                  and perhaps you will keep it there
                  a few years longer.
                         (beat)
                  Where are the three Musketeers?

                  I don't know.

                                RICHELIEU
                  And if you did?

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (after a beat)
                  I wouldn't tell you.
                                RICHELIEU
                  I admire your courage, young man.
                  You might have made a fine
                  Musketeer after all.

     Richelieu opens the door.       Rochefort waits on the other
     side.
                                RICHELIEU
                  But we'll never know, will we?
     Rochefort steps into the room, grabs d'Artagnan roughly
     by the arm, hurls him from the chair to the floor. This
     time Richelieu does not utter protest. Instead, he
     turns to the Captain, commands:
                                RICHELIEU
                  Find the three Musketeers and kill
                  them.
                                ROCHEFORT
                  They'll be dead by dawn.
                                RICHELIEU
                  A comforting thought. Good night,
                  d'Artagnan. Enjoy it. Morning
                  comes quickly.

     With that, Cardinal Richelieu sweeps into the dark.       HOLD
     ON d'Artagnan for a beat. History's pawn.

                                                    CUT TO:

59   EXT. BASTILLE - MARKET SQUARE - DAY                            59

     BELLS TOLL. A motley crowd gathers around the execution
     scaffold, held back by men-at-arms. A hooded executioner
     mounts the steps of the scaffold in the company of a
     PRIEST. The Priest wears a black cassock and a broad
     black sombrero. The executioner, a large man, raises
     his axe and touches the end of the blade, cutting his
     finger. Razor-sharp. The executioner holds up his
     bloody thumb.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                         55.

59   CONTINUED:                                                59
     The crowd roars approval. And turns to regard the day's
     victim as he is rolled INTO VIEW.

     D'Artagnan stands, half-naked, his hands bound behind him,
     in a horse-drawn cart. The driver turns the cart, begins
     a circuit of the square. The blood-thirsty crowd cheers
     and jeers at d'Artagnan. But d'Artagnan keeps his head
     high. If he must die, he will die with dignity.

60   TOWER OF BASTILLE                                         60

     Rochefort watches from a tower overlooking the square.
     Richelieu appears beside him.

                                ROCHEFORT
                  Milady left at midnight.   By
                  private coach.
                                RICHELIEU
                  A remarkable woman. The most
                  beautiful I've ever known. And
                  the deadliest. Which would
                  explain my attraction.
                         (peering down at
                          the scene)
                  How is our young daredevil holding
                  up?

                                ROCHEFORT
                  He's wishing he'd never heard of
                  the Musketeers.
     Down below, the horse cart reaches the scaffold. A man-
     at-arms drops the tailgate, d'Artagnan steps down. He is
     taken into the custody of a CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS, and
     several men-at-arms carrying muskets.

61   ANOTHER ANGLE                                             61

     The Cardinal's familiar carriage is parked a safe distance
     from the square. The Guards who attend it have wandered
     off to watch the festivities. The coachman remains,
     seated on top, braiding his whip. Suddenly, a gloved hand
     grabs the coachman, yanks him from his seat.

62   SCAFFOLD                                                  62

     D'Artagnan is led by the Captain of the Guards up the
     stairs to the execution platform. The executioner and
     the Priest wait patiently above. D'Artagnan sees the
     bloodstained block where his neck will soon lie; pales.
     The Priest mutters comfort:
                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                             56.

62   CONTINUED:                                                        62
                                PRIEST
                  Fear not, my son...

     D'Artagnan regards the Priest whose face is hidden be-
     neath the brim of his broad black hat. He holds a
     large Bible in his hands.

                                PRIEST
                  For we are with you, always.
     The Priest raises his face, reveals it... and winks.         It
     is Aramis. He whispers:
                                ARAMIS
                  All for one, and one for all...

     D'Artagnan's heart soars. He turns to face the execu-
     tioner. Porthos grins beneath the hood's overhang.
                                CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS
                  Prepare the prisoner.
     Porthos lays his axe aside, approaches d'Artagnan in a
     threatening manner. He takes him by the scruff of the
     neck, and forces his head upon the chopping block. The
     crowd goes wild.
                                PORTHOS
                         (whispers into his
                          ear)
                  Don't worry, boy. You won't
                  feel a thing.
     The Captain of the Guards gives Aramis a suspicious look.
                                CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS
                  Where is Father Rostand today?

                                ARAMIS
                  The good father is... all tied up.

                                 CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS
                  Very well.   Proceed.
     Porthos nods.


63   ANOTHER ANGLE                                                     63
     Meanwhile, on the perimeter of the square, two figures
     ride on horseback, they wear familiar cloaks. A CLOSER
     look reveals Queen Anne and Constance. They ride through
     the city, towards the countryside beyond. But their
     progress has led them here. Anne frowns at the spectacle.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                  Barbarism.

                                CONSTANCE
                  Men call it justice.

                                ANNE
                  Are you surprised?
     She replies   with contempt, reins her horse away from the
     square, the   crowd, the executioner's axe. But Constance
     freezes in   place, eyes wide. As d'Artagnan, upon the
     cart, rolls   INTO VIEW.
                               CONSTANCE
                  It's him.

     For just a moment, their eyes lock. Inestimable space
     between. Constance's eyes fill with tears, she watches
     d'Artagnan. Porthos steps back from d'Artagnan, raises
     his axe. D'Artagnan shuts his eyes, wonders, mutters a
     silent prayer. That's when screams of panic erupt from
     the crowd. D'Artagnan raises his head to see the source
     of this mayhem.


64   MARKET SQUARE                                                64
     The Cardinal's crimson carriage races toward the scaffold,
     scattering the crowd in all directions. Men shout, women
     scream, all leaping to avoid the stallion's sharp hooves,
     the coach's THUNDEROUS spinning WHEELS. In the driver's
     seat, clutching the reins in one hand and CRACKING a WHIP
     in the other... is Athos.
     Porthos uses the heavy blunt end of the axe to topple the
     closest men-at-arms. Aramis opens his Bible, pulls out
     a PISTOL, and BLASTS the saber from the hand of the
     Captain of the Guards. A man-at-arms raises his musket
     to shoot the false priest, but d'Artagnan leaps out of
     nowhere, lands on him with both feet, knocking the man-
     at-arms off the scaffold.

65   CARRIAGE                                                     65

     Athos pulls up alongside the scaffold.
                                ATHOS
                         (the usual dour
                          expression, but a
                          hint of levity)
                  Gentlemen, your carriage.
                  Compliments of the Cardinal.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                              58.

65   CONTINUED:                                                     65
     D'Artagnan rushes to the edge of the scaffold, springs
     into the air, landing on the seat beside him. Aramis and
     Porthos shed their disguises, jump after, light upon the
     carriage. The roof fabric tears, they drop into the
     plush interior below. Athos CRACKS the WHIP... and the
     stallions race off through the crowd, towards freedom.


66   SQUARE                                                         66
     Constance watches the escape, transfixed, delighted. As
     the carriage barrels from the scaffold, she thrusts a
     gloved fist into the air, triumphant.
                                 CONSTANCE
                  Yes!


67   TOWER                                                          67

     Athos produces a dagger, cuts the leather ties that bind
     d'Artagnan's wrists.
                                 ATHOS
                  Hold on!

     Athos cracks the whip, driving the horses onward.
                                                    CUT TO:

69   INT. CARRIAGE - DAY                                            69

     Aramis and Porthos have settled in comfortably.      Porthos
     spies a wicker hamper on the floor.
                                PORTHOS
                  Well, what have we here?

     Porthos lifts the lid. Inside: bottles of wine, champagne,
     and a wide assortment of foods.

                                PORTHOS
                  How considerate of the Cardinal
                  to provide us with a snack.

69   CONTINUED:                                                      69
     Porthos extracts a bottle of wine, grabs a turkey leg.
     Aramis looks about the interior, spies a small ornate
     box.
                                 ARAMIS
                  Hello.

     Aramis opens the box, reacts.        It is filled with gold
     coins, jewelry.
                                ARAMIS
                  How is it that a man of God
                  becomes a man of gold?
                                PORTHOS
                         (looks on, grins)
                  Trinkets for the ladies.
                                 ARAMIS
                  Let's share.

70   STREETS OF PARIS - CARRIAGE                                     70

     Aramis sticks his head through the hole in the fabric
     roof, hands the ornate box to d'Artagnan.
                                ARAMIS
                  Would you be so good as to
                  distribute these? Your generosity
                  will be greatly appreciated.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (open the box, reacts)
                  But...?
                                ARAMIS
                         (to the point)
                  Throw the coins, boy.     The people
                  are hungry.

     D'Artagnan grabs a handful of coins, and tosses them into
     the air. Aramis smiles approval, drops back to the
     carriage interior. Pedestrians see the gold, shout, and
     leap after. Their hurried steps impede the Guards' pro-
     gress, horses rear up, soldiers tumble. But several of
     the Guards manage to avoid the obstacle, pursue the
     carriage with renewed determination. D'Artagnan hears a
     LOUD POPPING sound, ducks.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  They're firing at us!

70   CONTINUED:                                                    70
     Porthos sticks his head INTO VIEW, offers them a bubbling
     bottle of champagne, the source of the popping sound.

                               PORTHOS
                  Champagne?

                                ATHOS
                  You know I prefer wine.
                                PORTHOS
                  Don't go away.

     Porthos ducks down, returns with a new bottle.
                                PORTHOS
                  May I recommend this find
                  Cabernet?
     Porthos hands   the bottle to Athos. Athos hands the reins
     to d'Artagnan.    D'Artagnan struggles with the reins, tries
     to control the   horses. And beams, taking delight from
     every instant   of adventure. Athos SMASHES the top of the
     BOTTLE, drinks   deeply, settles back to enjoy himself.

                                ATHOS
                  Turn right at the next street.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  The next right...?
                               ATHOS
                  Turn.
     Athos growls, d'Artagnan jerks at the reins. The carriage
     careens around the corner, tipping on two wheels.

     Porthos looks up from his chest, champagne spilled all
     over his tunic... and a brand new sash.

                                PORTHOS
                         (to Aramis)

     The carriage charges up a steep hill. At the summit, Athos
     tosses aside his bottle, takes the reins from d'Artagnan.

     D'Artagnan sighs with relief. Athos yanks the brake
     lever, brings the horses to a halt, and leaps down from
     the driver's seat. D'Artagnan follows. Athos pulls the
     passenger door open, revealing Porthos and Aramis inside.
     Gold coins on the carpet at their feet, food and drink
     between them.

                                ATHOS
                  Gentlemen, this is the end of the
                  line. I hope you had a pleasant
                  ride.
                         (to d'Artagnan)
                  Unhitch the horses.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  But the Guards.

     D'Artagnan points to the bottom of the hill.       The mounted
     Guards chase after, begin their ascent.
                                 ATHOS
                  Do as I say.
     D'Artagnan hurries to the horses. Porthos and Aramis
     climb from the cab. Porthos emits a contented belch.
                                ATHOS
                         (to Aramis)
                  Your pistol and powder, please.
     Aramis hands Athos a sack of powder, and his pistol.
     Athos tosses the sack into the carriage, takes aim with
     the PISTOL, and SHOOTS it -- igniting the powder inside.

                                 ATHOS

     The interior of the Cardinal's carriage bursts into
     flames.

     D'Artagnan and the three Musketeers mount the Cardinal's
     white stallions, race off into the distance. Porthos
     shouts, laughing.

                  I'd give five years of your life

     The Cardinal's face is contorted in fury. He    steps out of
     a horse cart, approaches the charred remains   of his be-
     loved carriage. He stares at the smouldering    ruin for a
     long beat. Rochefort and a company of Guards    stand near-
     by, wait for him to speak. When he does, his    tone is
     measured and calm.

                             RICHELIEU
               One thousand pistoles on each of
               their heads, dead or alive. The
               boy knows our plans.

     Rochefort reacts with surprise.

     D'Artagnan and the three Musketeers rest against tree
     trunks in a hidden glade, polish off the last of the
     Cardinal's food and drink. Their usual cynicism replaced
     by something approaching camaraderie. Aramis smiles as
     d'Artagnan attacks a turkey wing.
                             D'ARTAGNAN
               I haven't eaten in three days.
               I guess with all the excitement,
               I forgot.
                             ARAMIS
               Your trip from home has been an
               eventful one.

               I heard of a d'Artagnan once. He
               was a captain in the Musketeers
               when we were just recruits.
                             D'ARTAGNAN
               He was my father.

                             ARAMIS
               A good man, I'm told.

                         (sadly)
                  He died when I was nine.
     The mention of the elder d'Artagnan's death casts a pall.
     D'Artagnan continues, tentative, the memory still hurts.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  All my mother would tell me is
                  that he died in the service of
                  the King.

     An uncomfortable silence.     It is Athos who finally speaks:
                                ATHOS
                  D'Artagnan, your father and another
                  Musketeer were ambushed and
                  murdered outside the Louvre.
     D'Artagnan pales, stunned and silent.      He manages a
     broken whisper:
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  This other Musketeer -- is he
                  still alive? I'd like to talk
                  to him.
     Athos shakes his head.     Porthos adds:

                                PORTHOS
                  You already have. His name is
                  the Count De Rochefort.
     D'Artagnan isn't listening. He stands suddenly, turns,
     and walks away. He doesn't want the Musketeers to see
     the tears forming in his eyes. Aramis shouts after:

                                ARAMIS
                  D'Artagnan.

     D'Artagnan stands at a flowing stream, wipes the tears
     from his eyes. Aramis appears at his side, offers silent
     comfort, a hand on d'Artagnan's shoulder.

                  the man who murdered my father
                  and kill him where he stands.

                                ARAMIS
                  A man is better measured by his
                  life than by his death. Your
                  father was bold, and brave.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  But you never knew him...

                  He lives in you.
     That's all the evidence Aramis requires.       D'Artagnan
     pauses to reflect. Then wonders:
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  And your father?

                                ARAMIS
                  I was orphaned at a young age.
                  The church took me in.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  You didn't have one.
                                ARAMIS
                  But I did. He was a great man,
                  a leader of the church. And his
                  example inspired me to dedicate
                  my life to God's service.

     Aramis opens his cloak, reveals a priestly cloth.       A
     secret he carries near to his heart.
                                D'ARTAGNAN

                  This great man, this father,
                  betrayed the church, and turned
                  his back on God. To worship power
                  and gold.

     Servants attach messages to   the legs of carrier pigeons.

     Richelieu nods, he already knows.       He picks up one of
     the pigeons, strokes it gently.

                  Shoot low. We'll need their
                  heads for identification.

     The Mercenaries raise their muskets, take aim. Right on
     cue, four horsemen come THUNDERING out of the mist. But
     just before they reach the bridge, the four horsemen
     break in half -- one pair rides to the left, the other to
     the right. Before the Mercenaries realize what's
     happened, the horsemen ride on either side, splashing
     through the shallow stream. In a flash, they return to
     the road, and race away. Having avoided the bridge
     completely.
     Cursing, the angry Mercenaries whirl about, FIRE at
     d'Artagnan and the three Musketeers as they ride into
     the night. Porthos' merry laugh drifts back to mock them.
                                                   CUT TO:


81   EXT. ROAD TO CALAIS - NIGHT                                   81
     An overturned wagon lies in the ditch. Beer kegs litter
     the roadway. The wagon's driver, an old FARMER, sits on
     one of the kegs, holding his head. D'Artagnan and the
     Musketeers gallop INTO VIEW, rein their horses to a stop.
                                FARMER
                         (with relief)
                  Thank God for a friendly face.
                  My horse broke loose. Can you
                  help me move these kegs out of
                  the road?
     D'Artagnan starts to dismount.

                                ATHOS
                  Stay on your horse.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  He needs our help.

                                 ATHOS
                  Don't worry.   We'll help him.

     Suddenly: two other men step before the wagon, pointing
     muskets. The ragged Farmer reaches inside his coat, pulls
     out a pistol, makes a smirking request:
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                            69.

                                FARMER
                  Won't you step down... Musketeers?

                                ARAMIS
                  Gentlemen, I beg you. Please put
                  away your weapons and remove these
                  kegs from the road. We'd prefer
                  to ride on without having to kill
                  you.
     D'Artagnan and the "Farmers" gape at Aramis in surprise.

                                FARMER
                  You're threatening us?

                                PORTHOS
                  It's not a threat, it's a fact.
                  If you don't haul those kegs away,
                  you're dead where you stand.
     The Farmer laughs, contemptuously. He raises his pistol
     and aims it at Porthos' head. But before he can pull the
     trigger, THREE EXPLOSIONS ERUPT from under the cloaks of
     Athos, Porthos and Aramis.
     When the smoke clears, d'Artagnan is startled to see the
     three dead "Farmers" sprawled in the road and the three
     pistols emerging from beneath the cloaks of the
     Musketeers.
                                PORTHOS
                  Mine hit the ground first.
                                ATHOS
                  Mine was taller.
     Aramis swings out of the saddle and begins to perform
     last rites over the bodies. D'Artagnan still can't be-
     lieve what just happened. He turns to Porthos. Porthos
     raises the barrel to his lips and blows away the gunsmoke.

                                PORTHOS
                  There's only one rule, d'Artagnan
                  -- stay alive.

     THUNDER RUMBLES and RAINS begins to fall.

82   INT. COUNTRY INN - NIGHT                                     82

     A large warm tavern with a ROARING FIRE.

     Present are the INNKEEPER, his wife, a few benighted tra-
     velers and THREE BARMAIDS. They turn as the door flies
     open and the Musketeers and d'Artagnan enter from a RAGING
     STORM. They keep their cloaks drawn about them and wear
     the brims of their hats pulled low to cover their faces.

     The occupants of the inn regard the new arrivals with
     suspicion. Outisde, the STORM BLOWS. D'Artagnan closes
     the heavy door. Fearful, the Innkeeper comes forward to
     meet the four ominous travelers.

                                  INNKEEPER
                  Good evening.
                                ATHOS
                  See to our horses and bring us
                  some food.
                                INNKEEPER
                         (apologetic)
                  I'm sorry but we have little to
                  spare. The Cardinal's Guards were
                  here today. They helped
                  themselves to our food and then
                  refused to pay.
                                ARAMIS
                         (bitter)
                  In the name of God, I'm sure.
     Porthos is on the lookout for danger. He reaches inside
     his cloak for a weapon and, in doing so, accidentally
     exposes his Musketeer tunic.

                                BARMAID #1
                         (crying out)
                  Musketeers!

     The sound of SLIDING STEEL as Athos, Porthos, Aramis and
     d'Artagnan draw their swords, ready to fight. They stand
     back to back in a circle, ready for attack.

     But there is no attack. Quite the contrary.       The people
     here are thrilled to see them.

                                INNKEEPER
                         (honored)
                  Musketeers in my house! Gentlemen,
                  put away your swords and come in.
                  Anyone who fights the Cardinal is
                  welcome here.

     The Musketeers lower their swords.

                                ARAMIS
                  I think we've found a home.

     The Musketeers return their swords to their sheathes and
     take off their dripping hats and capes. The pretty
     Barmaids crowd around them to collect their gear and car-
     ry it to the fire.

                                INNKEEPER
                  We don't have much but what we
                  have is yours.

     Porthos rubs his hands together, eager to indulge himself.
     He follows the Barmaids, booming in his loud, friendly
     voice.

                                PORTHOS
                  Ladies, you're in for a treat
                  tonight. Allow me to introduce
                  myself. I'm the Musketeer they
                  call Porthos.
     Porthos beams, waiting for a big response but nothing
     happens. The Barmaids look at each other.
                                PORTHOS
                         (repeating; louder)
                  Porthos.

     Still no response.    Aramis and d'Artagnan hide smiles.
                                ARAMIS
                  It's hard to believe they haven't
                  heard of the great Porthos.
                                PORTHOS
                  Oh, shut up, Aramis.

     The three Barmaids perk up.
                                BARMAIDS
                         (with excitement)
                  Aramis? Did you say Aramis?
     And with that, the three Barmaids desert Porthos and
     scurry across the room to attach themselves to Aramis.
     Porthos shakes his head and flops down in a chair.
                                PORTHOS
                  I don't get it. I just don't
                  get it.

                                                   CUT TO:

                                                             72.

83   INT. TAVERN - NIGHT                                           83
     Moments later.   Porthos regales the Barmaids with a tale.

                             PORTHOS
               I said, 'A Queen is no different
               than a barmaid in the dark. Though
               less... practiced in the arts of
               pleasure...'

     The Barmaids accept his leering compliment with glee.
     But d'Artagnan isn't so sure. Porthos, with two Barmaids,
     bellows a reply.

                             PORTHOS
               If you're going to be a proper
               Musketeer, you'll have to learn
               the manly art of wenching. Right,
               ladies?
     The Barmaids heartily concur. D'Artagnan looks over
     Porthos' shoulder, to the dark-haired Barmaid seen previ-
     ously. Porthos follows his gaze, grins.
                             PORTHOS
               Ahh, very good. Your first
               subject. But you'll need
               instruction. Watch closely.
     Porthos pulls one of the Barmaids to his chest, brings
     her lips toward his.
                             PORTHOS
               The secret to wenching is the
               first kiss. For in that kiss, a
               lasting impression is made. If it
               is weak, she will think you are
               weak. And if it is comical, she
               will think you are a clown. With
               me?
                               D'ARTAGNAN
               Weak... weak.    Comical... clown.

                              PORTHOS
               Very good.   And as a Musketeer is
               never weak,  and only rarely a
               clown, your  first kiss must be all
               the things  that you are. Like
               this...
     Porthos gives the Barmaid a powerful kiss.      He breaks it,
     turns to d'Artagnan with a grin.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                PORTHOS
                  You may speak first if you like,
                  your name, her name, an endearment
                  or two. But words are usually a
                  waste of time.

                                ARAMIS
                  Only if you don't know which words
                  to say.
     All turn to regard Aramis. He'll play along too.
     Porthos reacts with delight. D'Artagnan with interest.
     Aramis continues:
                                ARAMIS
                  Words may make a more lasting
                  impression than a thousand of
                  Porthos' kisses.
                                BARMAID
                         (still reeling)
                  Not likely.
                                ARAMIS
                  I'll demonstrate. Please.   Sit
                  beside me.
     Aramis' courtly behavior is as out of place in these en-
     virons as it is persuasive. The Barmaid slips from
     Porthos' lap, sits down on the bench beside him.
     Aramis does not touch her. He simply looks into her
     eyes... and begins to speak.
                                ARAMIS
                  'Shall I compare thee to a
                     summer's day?
                  Thou art more lovely and more
                     temperate:
                  Rough winds do shake the darling
                     buds of May,
                  And summer's leash hath all too

                  Nor lose possession of that fair
                     thou owest,
                  Nor shall death brag thou

                  So long lives this, and this gives
                     life to thee.'

     The Barmaid, once skeptical, sits silently. Her face
     covered with tears. Aramis pauses, almost embarrassed by
     the outcome. He turns to d'Artagnan, cites:

                                 ARAMIS
                  Shakespeare.
                                PORTHOS
                  That's cheating.
     The Barmaid on his lap disagrees.

                                BARMAID
                  It's beautiful.
     D'Artagnan looks at the dark-haired Barmaid across the
     room. Porthos urges him on.
                                PORTHOS
                  Come on, d'Artagnan. We haven't
                  got all night.

     D'Artagnan steps forward. The dark-haired Barmaid sees
     him coming and smiles. D'Artagnan stands before her,
     hesitates, not sure where to start. Then, remembering as
     best he can:
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  'Shall I compare thee to a summer's
                    day?
                  Thou are move lovely and more
                     tempest, er, more tempered...'
                         (beat)
                  Ahh, to hell with it --

     D'Artagnan takes the Barmaid into his arms, delivers a

     Aramis smile proudly. The Barmaids cheer.

                  So little time, so much to learn.

     D'Artagnan drains his flagon, indicates Athos sitting at
     a table by himself, scowling, working on his third bottle
     of Burgundy.

                                ARAMIS
                  In all the years I've know him...
                  I have never seen Athos smile.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Why is he sitting by himself?
                                PORTHOS
                  Athos takes his drinking seriously.
                  Ignore him. He'll be his usual
                  warm, charming self by morning.
                         (calls out)
                  Service! My lap is cold!
     A Barmaid scurries INTO   VIEW. Porthos grabs her by the
     waist, adds the Barmaid   to the one already sitting on his
     lap. The chair breaks    beneath them, and all three go
     sprawling on the floor,   laughing heartily.

84   ATHOS                                                         84

     He remains lost in drink. D'Artagnan appears beside him.
     He hides his concern behind a cheerful attitude.
                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                  Come join us.
     Athos pulls d'Artagnan down with a dark smile.     He fills
     his flagon for him.

                                ATHOS
                  You fight like a Musketeer. Let's
                  see if you can drink like one.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I'll drink anything you put in
                  front of me.

                                ATHOS
                  Famous last words.
                         (raising his flagon)
                  What shall we drink to?

     D'Artagnan notices the dark-haired Barmaid eyeing him
     across the room.

                  Love?

     The word nearly makes Athos grimace. He stares at
     d'Artagnan for a long beat, then beyond. As if to look
     into another time and place. Finally:

                               ATHOS
                  Love.
                         (beat)
                  Would you like to hear a story,
                  d'Artagnan? A love story?
     Athos' voice reveals unexpected vulnerability, the pain
     he keeps inside. D'Artagnan is fascinated, moved. He
     nearly whispers:

                               D'ARTAGNAN
                  Yes.
     Athos takes a long pull from the bottle of burgundy,
     wipes the blood red wine from his lips.
                                ATHOS
                  I once knew a man... one of the
                  Counts of Berry. My native
                  province. When the good Count was
                  about your age, he fell in love
                  with a visitor from Paris. A
                  breathtaking girl of seventeen.
                  She was more than beautiful,
                  d'Artagnan. She was...
                  intoxicating. And this man, the
                  poor idiot, he married her.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Isn't that what people do when
                  they fall in love?
                                ATHOS
                         (sharply)
                  Be quiet and listen.
                         (beat)
                  The Count took her to his castle
                  and made her the first lady of the
                  province. They were happy for a
                  time, as happy as a man and a
                  woman can be. Then one day, while
                  riding in the woods, the girl was
                  thrown from her horse, and knocked
                  unconscious. The Count hurried to
                  help her. Her dress was torn.

                  On her her arm, the woman wore a
                  gold band in the shape of a
                  serpent. It was the only article
                  of clothing she refused to remove.
                  The Count's curiosity got the best
                  of him. He reached over and slid
                  down the gold band. He saw
                  something on her arm... something
                  she'd kept hidden 'til then...

                               D'ARTAGNAN

                  branded...

     D'Artagnan reacts with shock.
                                ATHOS
                  The Count's angel turned out to be
                  a murderess who escaped the
                  Executioner's blade. She swore
                  that she loved him. Swore that
                  she had changed. And if he would
                  just keep her secret, they would
                  live a long life together.
     Athos pauses, imagines that life.      The Count and his
     angel.
                                ATHOS
                  But the Count was young and he was
                  stupid. He was tormented by the
                  ridicule of his social class. And
                  so he rejected her. For her lies
                  and for her past.
                         (beat)
                  And turned her over to the
                  authorities to be executed for the
                  crime.

     Athos now turns his unflinching gaze on d'Artagnan.
                                ATHOS
                  But you see... his heart did not
                  agree.  The Count soon realized
                  what she had meant to him. And
                  what he had done.

                  greater than her own.

                  Soon after he foreswore the
                  society that shaped him. Gave up
                  his title. And was never seen
                  again.
                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                  He loved her.

                                ATHOS
                  He killed her. It seemed like the
                  same thing after a while.

     HOLD ON Athos for a long time.       As he gathers up his pain,
     and puts it back again.
     Athos SMASHES open another BOTTLE. But the story has
     made d'Artagnan quite sober and a little sick to his
     stomach. He refuses another drink.
                                 ATHOS
                  Good.   More for me.
                                PORTHOS
                  Aramis -- play something with some
                  blood in it! I feel like dancing!
     Aramis launches into something appropriate. Porthos and
     a Barmaid get up and begin a festive folk dance.
     Porthos is damned good. His joie de vivre is infectious
     and soon everyone in the inn is clapping and encouraging
     him. Every once in awhile, another WEAPON -- a dagger or
     something -- drops out of Porthos' clothing and hits the
     floor with a CLATTER.

     That's when Porthos, dancing with abandon, spins out of
     control, trips and falls on Athos' table, crushing it to
     the floor.

     Porthos lies in the wreckage, staring up. Athos, totally
     unperturbed, looks down and offers him the bottle.

                                PORTHOS
                  Care to dance, Athos?
                                ATHOS
                  Only if I can lead.

     Porthos blinks in amazement at Athos' grim face, then
     breaks out laughing.
                                 PORTHOS
                  Aramis!   Athos made a joke!

     The sun rises, casts long shadows across a sparkling dew-
     wet field. D'Artagnan and the Musketeers ride INTO
     FRAME, continuing their journey to Calais. D'Artagnan
     squints ahead, wincing with every bump. Porthos grins.
                            PORTHOS
              Beautiful morning, eh, d'Artagnan?

     D'Artagnan is terribly hung-over from the night's
     carousing. He looks like he could puke at any moment.
     So that's exactly why Porthos shouts to him and says...

                              PORTHOS
              You know,   d'Artagnan, it's not a
              good idea   to travel on an empty
              stomach.    You really should have
              had a big   portion of those sheep's
              brains...

     D'Artagnan covers his mouth.    Porthos laughs good-
     naturedly.

              My head feels like it's filled

                         (knows immediatley)
                  A connon ball.

     Athos is cut off by an EAR-PIERCING WHISTLE as a CANNON
     BALL drops out of the sky and STRIKES the ground nearby,
     sending up a tremendous EXPLOSION.
                                PORTHOS
                  I hate cannon balls.

     Another BALL EXPLODES into the ground in front of them.
     Their horses rear up in fear, threatening to dump them
     out of their saddles. As the Musketeers and d'Artagnan
     struggle to control their horses, they look back and see
     an old castle atop a distant hill.
     A group of men operate two rusted cannons, left over from
     some long-forgotten war.
     The Musketeers barely calm their horses, when another
     BALL comes SCREAMING their way, IMPACTING a few feet
     away. As dirt rains upon them:

                                ARAMIS
                         (to d'Artagnan)

                  I'm beginning to wish the Cardinal
                  had chopped if off.

                  Stay with us, and you just might
                  get your wish.
     Athos spurs his horse across the field, d'Artagnan and
     the Musketeers follow. But they discover crude battle-
     ments in their path. Athos changes direction, sees six
     horsemen waiting for them in the near distance. He
     changes direction again, as the horsemen charge after.

     They ride as fast their mounts will carry them. A cross-
     roads up ahead. Athos sizes up the situation, shouts
     command.
                                ATHOS
                  Split in half! D'Artagnan rides
                  with me!

     D'Artagnan nods, thrilled to go with Athos.

     Athos and d'Artagnan take off in one direction, Porthos
     and Aramis in the other. The pursuing horsemen soon

88   INT. QUEEN'S BATH - DAY                                         88
     A room heavy with mist and steam. Behind a maze of gauze
     screens, we discover Anne reclining in a large tiled bath,
     Constance attending. Constance replenishes the bath with
     pitchers of hot water drawn from a boiling cauldron.
     In mid-conversation, as confidantes and friends:
                                CONSTANCE
                  But how, your Majesty? How can
                  you tell if you're really in love?
                                ANNE
                  Do you think about him all the
                  time?
                                CONSTANCE
                         (considers; replies)
                  Yes.
                                ANNE
                  And when he's around, do your
                  knees feel as weak as water?

                               CONSTANCE
                  Yes.

                                ANNE
                  And when he looks at you, do you
                  suddenly forget how to breathe?

                                CONSTANCE
                  Yes.

                                ANNE
                  Then you're in love.

                                 CONSTANCE
                          (thrilled by the
                           knowledge; knew it
                           all alone)
                  I am.

     Anne turns to Constance, soap and water swirl about her
     naked body. She wonders:

                                ANNE
                  Who is he?
                                CONSTANCE
                  You'll never believe it.
                                ANNE
                  Of course I will.

                                CONSTANCE
                  You won't.
                                ANNE
                  Who?
                                CONSTANCE
                  The young man who rescued us from
                  the bandit.

                                ANNE
                  The young man on the scaffold?

                                CONSTANCE
                  Yes.
                                ANNE
                         (turns back in the
                          water, peers ahead)
                  You're right. I don't believe it.

     A warm beat. Anne and Constance are friends as much as
     they are Queen and subject.
                                CONSTANCE
                  Are you in love, Your Majesty?

                                ANNE
                  What an impertinent question.

                  Are you?

     Anne pauses.    If only her life, her emotions, were as
     simple.

                                ANNE
                  My love... is a matter of state.
                  It's complicated.
     A sad beat.    Constance teases:

                                CONSTANCE
                  Do you think about him all the
                  time?

                                ANNE
                         (playing along)
                  As Queen, my mind touches on many
                  subjects.
                                CONSTANCE
                  Do your knees feel as weak as
                  water?
                               ANNE
                  Never.

                  When he looks at you, do you
                  forget how to breathe?
     A beat. And Anne is a girl of eighteen again, not Queen.
     Wistful, she replies:
                                ANNE
                  I hope he will someday.   I hope
                  I will too.
     HOLD ON Anne for a beat.

     Anne steps to a dressing chamber, wearing a long robe,
     arranging her thick wet hair into braids.
                                ANNE
                  Constance, have you seen my...?

     Anne stops short. Cardinal Richelieu waits for her in
     the dressing chamber, now bows, assumes a supplicant air.

                                RICHELIEU
                  I need your help. And could not
                  in good conscience wait another
                  minute.

                  You want my help?
                               RICHELIEU
                  Yes.

                                ANNE
                  On what matter?
                                RICHELIEU
                  Your... husband.
                                ANNE
                         (remembering
                          Richelieu's last
                          encounter with Louis)
                  Your King.

     Richelieu allows the jest, remains silent, watchful.
     Anne resumes, chooses her words with care.
                                ANNE
                  Of course. As Your Eminence has
                  been kind enough to advise me...
                         (nods assent)
                  It's the least I can do.

     Richelieu reacts with quiet pleasure.    He steps closer.
                                RICHELIEU
                  I am worried about the King's...
                  happiness.
                                ANNE
                  What do you mean?

                                RICHELIEU
                  The Huguenot rebellion, occupation
                  in the Antilles and Cayenne. The
                  coming war with France. These are
                  not the usual hobbies of youth.
                               ANNE

                  And now he wishes to postpone his
                  birthday celebration.
                               ANNE
                  Why?

                                RICHELIEU
                  He feels it is not... appropriate.
                                ANNE
                  It sounds as though he is
                  concerned with more important
                  matters.

                                RICHELIEU
                  Which is exactly why we must
                  celebrate.
                         (off her look)
                  To show the world that the King of
                  France is strong enough to face
                  any enemy on any field. To show
                  France... that he is King.
                         (beat)
                  He will listen to you. If you
                  will speak.
     Richelieu makes his case with forceful eloquence, seeming
     loyalty. Anne considers, replies, noncommittal:
                                ANNE
                  I will speak to him.
     Anne senses hidden agenda, intrigues below the surface.
     The conversation's conspiratorial tone begins to disturb
     her.

                                ANNE
                  Now, if you'll excuse me, I...
                               RICHELIEU
                  Of course.
     Anne nods, turns back toward the chambers.       Richelieu
     calls after.

                                RICHELIEU
                  Your Majesty?
                         (off her look)
                  Please understand that I do not
                  underestimate the value of your
                  assistance.

                         (quietly, as if
                          to justify)
                  For France.
     Richelieu steps away, his red cape swirling behind him.
     Anne feels a chill, pulls her robe more tightly about
     her body.

92   INT. THRONE ROOM AND GREAT HALL                                 92
     Louis watches from a balcony. Richelieu appears, fresh
     from his encounter with the Queen.
                                RICHELIEU
                  I'm sorry to be late, Your
                  Majesty, but I was wrestling with
                  an important matter of state.

     Richelieu never allows the mask to slip. Even for an
     instant. Louis glances at the throne room, the increasing
     number of Cardinal's Guards on duty. They make him feel
     uncomfortable. Louis speaks with renewed determination.

                                LOUIS
                  Why is it I don't see any of my

                  They have become outlaws. They
                  are terrorizing the countryside,
                  robbing and killing innocent
                  people.

     Louis can't believe it.

                                LOUIS
                  There must be some mistake.

                                RICHELIEU
                  No mistake. I have reports from
                  the local constables involved.

     Richelieu, ever prepared, produces a sheaf of papers. No
     doubt counterfeit. But Louis has no way of knowing. He
     takes the papers into his hands, reacts with sadness.
                                  LOUIS
                  Musketeers...
                                RICHELIEU
                  They are better off disbanded.
     Louis turns back to the balcony, the soldiers marching
     below. His mood glum and lonely. He sighs, moves on to
     another matter of business.

                                LOUIS
                  Your Eminence, I've been hearing
                  some very troubling rumors about
                  you.

     Richelieu nods, not the least bit concerned.
                                RICHELIEU
                  There are so many to choose from.
                  Is it the one about my alleged
                  alliance with Buckingham? Let's
                  see if I remember it correctly.
                  While the English attack from
                  without, I'll undermine the throne
                  from within -- depose you -- and
                  become sovereign of France myself.
                  That rumor, Your Majesty?

     Richelieu smiles, his face a mask of innocence.
                                LOUIS
                  It does seem rather farfetched.

                  If there are any doubts of my
                  loyalty, they'll be put to rest
                  when we appear together at your
                  birthday celebration.

                                LOUIS
                  I've been thinking about that. A
                  birthday celebration when we're
                  on the brink of war...

                         (alert, ready for
                          this as well)
                  Your subjects are eager to
                  celebrate the birth of their King
                  at a time like this.
                                LOUIS
                  I'm not so eager.
                                RICHELIEU
                  I have an idea. Why don't you
                  discuss the matter with your
                  Queen?
     Louis looks up, wonders. As Richelieu draws him deeper
     into his spider's strategems.

93   EXT. FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY                                  93

     Porthos and Aramis ride hard, look back over their
     shoulders. They crest the top of a bluff, rein their
     horses to a stop. They can afford to rest for a moment.
     Their pursuit is at least a mile behind them.
                                ARAMIS
                  My horse will not survive another
                  league.
                               PORTHOS
                  And you?

                         (in kind)
                  Ten, twenty at the most.

     Porthos looks into the near distance, manages a weary
     smile.

                                PORTHOS
                  Here's just the thing.     A nice,
                  relaxing boat ride.
     At the bottom of the hill: a crude ferry lands at the
     bank of a swift, choppy river.

                                                       CUT TO:

94   EXT. RIVER AND FERRY LANDING - DAY                                94

     The ferry is an open flatboat -- a wooden platform, about
     fifteen-by-twenty feet. It travels from one shore to the
     other by means of a ferry rope. Transport is slow, the
     trip to the other shore takes nearly five minutes.

     As Porthos and Aramis arrive, the flatboat is just re-
     turning, piloted by its FERRYMAN, a hunched and weather-
     beaten gnome. Four passengers wait to be carried across
     -- TWO GENTLEMAN CAVALIERS on horseback, and a country
     WOMAN and her child. As the flatboat enters its slip,
     the two Cavaliers urge their horses on board, rudely
     jostling the Woman and her child to the rear.
     The Ferryman, an experienced boot-licker, bows and
     scrapes to the Cavaliers, collects the coins they toss
     to his way.

                                FERRYMAN
                  A privilege to carry you on my
                  humble boat...
     The Ferryman turns a greedy eye on the Woman and child.
                                  FERRYMAN
                  Two pistoles.

                                WOMAN
                  But I only have one. Couldn't
                  my child ride free? She's so
                  small...
                                FERRYMAN
                         (hand outstretched,
                          demanding)
                  Two pistoles.
     A courtly voice intervenes.

                                ARAMIS
                  Put away your money, madame. You
                  and your child will cross the
                  river under our protection. For
                  free.
                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                         90.

94   CONTINUED:                                                 94
     All turn to regard Aramis on horseback, Porthos at his
     side. The Woman reacts with grateful surprise. The
     Ferryman is outraged, spittle flies as he curses and
     protests.
                                FERRYMAN
                  Nobody rides for free! Under
                  your protection bloody well
                  indeed! I'll teach you a thing
                  or two about protection! Apple-
                  cheeked young fools!! -- Just who
                  do you think you are!!
                                ARAMIS
                         (waits for the
                          tirade to cease;
                          simply)
                  Musketeers.
     Two two Cavaliers react to the word. The Ferryman does,
     too -- into cringing, obedient servant.
                                FERRYMAN
                  Musketeers? Well, why didn't you
                  say so? Of course you'll ride for
                  free. I insist on it. This way,
                  pretty madame. My what a lovely
                  little girl...

                               ARAMIS
                  Porthos!
                               PORTHOS
                  What?
     Aramis takes Porthos by the shoulder and turns him so
     he can see their pursuers pouring over the top of the
     hill on their horses.
                               PORTHOS
                  We sail!

     And with that, Porthos takes the sharp edge of his boom-
     erang and brings it down on the dock rope. The rope
     splits and the ferryboat lurches away from the dock.


95   HILL AND SHORE                                             95
     The pursuers charge down the hill and ride to the end of
     the dock but they're too late. Porthos and Aramis have
     gotten away.

                                                          91.
96   FLATBOAT                                                   96
     Porthos laughs and taunts the angry pursuers. Aramis
     ties scarves around the horses' eyes to blindfold them
     for the crossing. Then he turns around and sees what
     Aramis is already seeing -- the two Cavaliers watch them
     with keen interest.
                             FIRST CAVALIER
               You're those Musketeers everyone's
               been looking for.

                              PORTHOS
                Popularity has its price.

     The First Cavalier smiles, produces a flask.
                              FIRST CAVALIER
                I have some excellent brandy here.
                Would you gentlemen care to drink
                a toast with us to the Cardinal?
                              PORTHOS
                We'd be happy to.
     Porthos produces a bottle from under his cloak.
                              PORTHOS
                If you'll drink one with us to
                the King.
                              SECOND CAVALIER
                But the only King we recognize...
                is the Cardinal.
                              ARAMIS
                There are those who would call
                that treason.
                              FIRST CAVALIER
                Happily, no such objections have
                been raised... here.
                               PORTHOS
                All right.   I'll object.

                              SECOND CAVALIER
                I'm listening.

                              PORTHOS
                Let's see. You are, by your dress
                and by your manner, members of a
                bone-lazy class of servile ninnyhammers
                whose slavish allegiance to His
                Eminence the Cardinal is as that
                of a dog who likes nothing better
                than to sniff today where he has
                peed the day before.

                                PORTHOS
                  I was momentarily inspired.

     The Cavaliers are not amused. The first replies in
     measured tones, his lips white with fury.

                                 FIRST CAVALIER
                  May I reply?
                                ARAMIS
                         (courtly)
                  By all means.
                                FIRST CAVALIER
                  Better to be a dog in the service
                  of a great master, than a beef-
                  witted moron so dazzled by the
                  throne that he does not see the
                  true nature of the foolish boy
                  who wobbles atop it. Which is to
                  say, that most muddy-brained of
                  all men... a Musketeer.
     The Cavaliers have already pulled out their swords.
     Porthos and Aramis now reach for their own. Porthos
     deadpans:
                                PORTHOS
                  Maybe there's something  about us
                  that just pisses people  off. At
                  least I'd like to think  so. It's
                  too bad we can only kill  them
                  once.

97   FIGHT                                                       97

     The middle of a river on a rocking flatboat is not the
     best place for a duel. But the combatants make the most
     of it. Slipping, sliding, and falling. They attack with
     everything they've got. The Cavaliers are excellent
     swordsmen. And, as if that were not enough, the
     Musketeers have an additional disadvantage -- they must
     keep the Woman and child clear of the flashing blades.

97   CONTINUED:                                                     97
     Porthos drives his opponent about the flatboat with a
     devilish grin, chases him between -- and at one point,
     over -- blindfolded horses.
     Aramis duels with the expected artistry, gradually re-
     ducing his opponent to tatters. At one juncture, the
     child loses her footing, slides toward the low end of
     the flatboat, the deep river beyond. Aramis executes a
     neat sidestep, stops the child's desperate progress with
     one arm while continuing to do battle with the other.
     He returns child to Mother with a grin, continues.

     The two Cavaliers are soon vanquished, groaning on the
     flatboat deck. Porthos and Aramis meet at the middle,
     breathless. Porthos complains:

                                PORTHOS
                  I've been called a lot of things

                          opposite shore)
                  Porthos...
                                PORTHOS
                  But beef-witted is a little more
                  than I can stand, not to mention
                  unfair...

                  Porthos...
                                  PORTHOS
                  What?
     Aramis indicates the opposite shore as the flatboat
     approaches it. There, waiting patiently, swords and
     muskets already drawn... is a patrol of Cardinal's
     Guards.

                                  ARAMIS
                  Can you swim?
                                 PORTHOS
                          (doesn't like the
                           sound of this)
                  No.   My horse can.
                                  ARAMIS
                  That'll do.

                                  PORTHOS
                  But...?

     Aramis hurries to    his horse, takes off the blindfold.
     Porthos grumbles    after, follows suit. They leap atop
     their mounts, the    horses slip upon the wet deck as they
     guide them to the    edge.
                                ARAMIS
                  You go first and I'll watch your
                  progress.
                                 PORTHOS
                  No, no.   Please. After you.

     Stalemate. Then, they can't help it, Aramis and Porthos
     grin. Life is an adventure, lived to the fullest. They
     count...

                                ARAMIS AND PORTHOS
                  One, two -- three!
     And with that, as the Woman and child, the Ferryman look
     on, Aramis and Porthos guide their horses into the raging
     river. The Woman whispers after:
                                 WOMAN
                  Thank you.   God speed.
     Porthos manages a wink as he floats into the distance.

     The Cardinal's Guards react with anger and disbelief.


99   RIVER                                                          99
     A wild ride down the ROARING RIVER. Porthos clinging to
     his horse for dear life. Aramis keeping an eye on his
     fellow Musketeer... and the deep rapids up ahead.
     Through twists and turns, walls of white water, huge
     boulders, and gyrating whirlpools... Aramis and Porthos
     finally reach a quiet pool, a leafy shore beyond. They
     lead their horses from the water, step toward dry land...
     and see yet another (or perhaps the same) patrol of
     Cardinal's Guards. Waiting, swords drawn, for their
     arrival.
     Porthos looks down at his latest sash -- destroyed like
     the others. Aramis draws his saber, mutters.

                                ARAMIS
                  A nice relaxing boat ride...

      And with that, Aramis and Porthos charge towards the
      Guards.

100   EXT. DENSE FOREST - DAY                                         100

      Cool, clear water. WIDEN to reveal d'Artagnan and Athos
      at a shallow pond, watering their horses. The forest
      around them is dark and primeval.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   Do you think we've lost them?
                                 ATHOS
                   They'll catch up eventually.

      To the point, as always. D'Artagnan pauses to look at
      their beautiful surroundings, remembers:
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   My father used to hunt in a forest
                   like this. He promised to take me
                   on my tenth birthday. I don't know
                   why he picked that year. Something
                   about a boy becoming a man. I'd
                   lay in bed at night and imagine it,
                   just the two of us. But he died
                   before I could go with him.
      Athos is unmoved, or so it would seem.       He replies with
      quiet cynicism:
                                 ATHOS
                   Well. You have your boyhood wish
                   at last. The dark forest. The
                   thrill of the hunt. The nearness
                   of death.
      Only d'Artagnan is the hunted, not the hunter.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   I'd be proud to die for my King.
                                 ATHOS
                   I just wanted to save you from the
                   life of a Musketeer. You don't
                   have to go looking for experience,
                   d'Artagnan. It'll find you soon
                   enough. And when it does -- it
                   will mark you forever.

      Athos rides into the forest.    D'Artagnan hurries to
      follow.

                                                      CUT TO:

                                                          96.

101   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                         101
      Athos leads d'Artagnan through the forest. Sunbeams
      shoot down through thick branches like golden bars. A
      pastoral setting, almost peaceful. And then: THUNDERING
      HOOFBEATS. Athos and d'Artagnan turn in surprise, see
      SIX HORSEMEN CRASHING through the glade.


102   ANOTHER ANGLE                                             102
      Athos and d'Artagnan GALLOP through the dense forest.
      The horesmen FIRE PISTOLS as they ride. A SHOT grazes
      d'Artagnan's shoulder, he staggers, retains his mount.
      Athos leads them up a hillside, a series of boulders at
      the top. The climb is fast and treacherous, GUNFIRE all
      around them. Athos' horse is struck by a bullet, stag-
      gers forward... and collapses just as they reach the
      crest. D'Artagnan leaps off his horse, takes cover with
      Athos behind the boulders. Athos takes aim, FIRES a
      SHOT, and kills one of the horsemen below. The others
      curse, leap from their mounts, seek cover. SHOTS WHIZ
      back and forth like angry hornets.
      Stalemate, but not for long. They are badly outnumbered.
      The horsemen creep slowly up the hillside, from tree to
      tree. Athos turns to d'Artagnan as he reloads:
                              ATHOS
                I'll hold them off for as long as
                I can. Go on without me.
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                I can't leave you here. Not like
                this.

                              ATHOS
                Ride to Calais and stop the
                Cardinal's agent.

                              D'ARTAGNAN
                Athos... I can't.

      Athos points his pistol at d'Artagnan.
                              ATHOS
                Go, or I'll kill you myself.

      A few days ago, d'Artagnan would have obeyed without
      question. Fearful, if nothing else. But not here, not
      now.

                               D'ARTAGNAN
                A duel then.
                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                               97.

102   CONTINUED:                                                     102
                                 ATHOS
                   You're insane.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   We never finished the first.

                                 ATHOS
                   All right. I'll toss a coin.
                   Tails I stay, heads you remain.
                   Agreed?

      D'Artagnan nods. Athos FIRES off another SHOT. He
      produces a gold coin, flips, slams it between palm and
      hand. And looks between.


103   ATHOS AND HIS POV                                              103
      Heads. D'Artagnan is to remain.       Athos looks up without
      missing a beat.
                                   ATHOS
                   Tails.    I stay.

      Athos returns the coin to his doublet without giving
      d'Artagnan a chance to see.
                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                   But...?
      Athos reloads, FIRES below. D'Artagnan recognizes the
      kindness he has received. That Athos cannot fully express
      it. And that there is no use arguing with him.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   At least take my pistol.

      He gives it to Athos.      They clasp hands.
                                 ATHOS
                          (gruff; yet proud)
                   Don't let us down... Musketeer.
      There are tears in d'Artagnan's eyes.       He knows Athos
      hasn't got a chance.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                          (a choke of emotion)
                   I'll never forget you.

                                  ATHOS
                   Go!
      Athos turns away, SHOOTS at another horseman.       D'Artagnan
      runs to his MOUNT, GALLOPS away.

                                                               98.

104   D'ARTAGNAN                                                     104
      He rides, straining to hear the sounds of GUNFIRE. As
      long as the SHOTS continue, he knows Athos is alive.
      Abruptly... the SHOTS CEASE.
      D'Artagnan swallows his heart, and rides.

                                                     CUT TO:

105   EXT. ROAD TO CALAIS - NIGHT                                    105

      A lonely stretch of road, illuminated by moonlight. A
      signpost announces: CALAI 15 LEAGUES. An exhausted
      HORSE CLOPS INTO VIEW, its rider half-conscious in the
      saddle. It is d'Artagnan. He can barely keep his eyes
      open. Suddenly, d'Artagnan passes out, tumbles from
      his saddle, and lands in the middle of the road. He
      opens his eyes once -- a sky filled with stars -- then
      closes them.
      We hear HORSES, and the CREAK of a CARRIAGE APPROACHING.
      The DRIVER brakes, and the horses are brought to a halt
      just short of trampling d'Artagnan. In the darkness, we
      can make out other shapes, rugged men on horseback,
      bodyguards to the carriage's passenger. Milady de
      Winter.
                                 MILADY (O.S.)
                   What is it, Henri?
                                 HENRI (DRIVER)
                   There's a body in the road, Milady.
                                 MILADY (O.S.)
                   Be careful.
      Pistols are cocked.    Henri's shadow falls across
      d'Artagnan's body.
                                 HENRI
                   It's a young man. He appears to
                   be injured.
      We hear the CARRIAGE DOOR OPEN.     FOOTSTEPS to d'Artagnan's
      side.

                                 MILADY (O.S.)
                   My, what a handsome boy. Put him
                   inside with me.

      Strong hands grasp d'Artagnan and lift him from the cold
      ground.
                                                     CUT TO:

106   D'ARTAGNAN'S POV - BLACK SCREEN                             106
      Out of the darkness, a face appears,   BLURRY and OBSCURED.
      It FILLS the SCREEN, slowly swimming   INTO FOCUS. It is
      Milady de Winter, even more beautiful   in CLOSEUP.
      Familiar, and no doubt deadly, ivory   combs gleam in her
      hair. She smiles warmly.

                                MILADY
                Welcome back.    Did you dream?

107   ANOTHER ANGLE                                               107

      reveals the interior of a bed chamber at a roadside inn.
      D'Artagnan, regaining his senses, finds himself propped
      up in a large bed. He blinks into the face of Milady
      who sits at the edge. His eyes widen with recognition,
      faint awe.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                You.
                                MILADY
                Have we met?

                              D'ARTAGNAN
                I... saw you in Paris.
      D'Artagnan notices that his shoulder has been bandaged.
      He looks around the large room. A FIRE ROARS in the
      grate. Food and drink have been set upon a table.
      D'Artagnan continues, still groggy, uncertain:
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                Where am I...?
                              MILADY
                This is Calais.

                              D'ARTAGNAN
                       (with a jolt)
                Calais!
                       (muttered; to self)
                The ship... Tuesday at midnight...
      D'Artagnan leaps out of bed. Then realizes he is stark
      naked. Milady smiles. D'Artagnan gathers a bedsheet
      around him.
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                       (frantic)
                Where are my clothes?

                                 MILADY
                   Filthy. I'm having them cleaned.
                   Is something wrong?
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   What day is it? What time?!

      D'Artagnan runs to a window, and throws open the shutters.
      Beyond: the harbor lights of the Port of Calais.
                                 MILADY
                   It's Tuesday, near nine.
                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                   Nine?   Are you sure?

      Somewhere in the night, a BELL TOLLS the HOUR.        Milady
      smiles.
                                 MILADY
                   Quite sure.
      D'Artagnan relaxes slightly.        Milady rises from the bed.
      She wears a sky blue dressing       gown, something soft and
      silken beneath it. D'Artagnan        reacts perceptibly. En-
      joying his discomfort, Milady       crosses the room, joins
      him at the window.
                                 MILADY
                   Are you in a hurry?
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                          (after a beat)
                   How did I... get here?
                                 MILADY
                   I found you in the road.
                   Discarded. Like an unwanted
                   kitten. Do you have a name or
                   shall I make one up for you?

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                          (nervous)
                   My name is d'Artagnan.

                                 MILADY
                   D'Artagnan. I like that. I am
                   the Countess de Winter. Milady.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   Countess?

                                 MILADY
                   My husband's dead.

                   I'm sorry.

                                 MILADY
                   I have learned to live with death.

      She manages to combine sympathy, seduction, and just a
      hint of danger. All in a single reply. D'Artagnan
      hesitates, he is not immune to her charms, then:
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   Countess, I'm very grateful for
                   what you've done, but I can't stay
                   here. I've got...

                                 MILADY
                   What...?
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   Important business.
                                 MILADY
                   How mysterious. A handsome young
                   man with 'important business' in
                   the still of night. Does it
                   involve a young lady?
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   No.
                                 MILADY
                   Does it require clothes?
                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                   Yes.   I need my clothes.
                                 MILADY
                   They won't be ready for at least
                   an hour.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   An hour?
                                  MILADY
                   I told the  innkeeper to bring them
                   when they  are dry. Until then,
                   I'm afraid  you are my prisoner.
                   Would the  prisoner care for a
                   drink?

      Milady crosses to the table, food and drink upon it. As
      she passes by the fire, her dressing gown seems to disap-
      pear, revealing a silhouette that makes d'Artagnan's
      heart stop.

                           never coy)
                   I am... thirsty.
      Milady pours wine into glasses, turns to face him.      And
      offers a smile that dazzles and burns.

                                 MILADY
                   Good. Then we will sit by the
                   fire, and eat and drink, and you
                   may impress, perhaps even move me,
                   with the story of how you came to
                   lie unconscious, in the middle of
                   the night, on the road to Calais.
                          (soft seductively)
                   I love a good adventure.
      D'Artagnan hesitates, then steps to her.

108   EXT. ROOF OF PALAIS CARDINAL (PARIS) - NIGHT                  108
      A CARRIER PIGEON FLUTTERS out of the dark sky, and enters
      its box. The little door on the other side opens. A
      hand reaches in and removes the bird. Richelieu unpeels
      the message on its leg.
                                                   CUT TO:


109   INT. CARDINAL'S PRIVATE CHAMBER - NIGHT                       109
      A room as cold as the man who owns it. Behind
      Richelieu's desk, there is a life-sized portrait of the
      King. Rochefort occupies a window seat, cleaning
      d'Artagnan's sword. He lifts it to the light, and
      slashes the air. He stands, duels with an imaginary
      opponent. Richelieu enters with the message.

                                 RICHELIEU
                          (dry; re: Rochefort's
                           fencing)
                   The wonderful thing about an
                   imaginary opponent is that he is
                   always greatly skilled, and always
                   easily defeated. The pride of
                   victory, without the risk of loss.
                   If only life were like that.

      Richelieu sits at his desk, peers at the message.      He
      looks up, pleased.

                   Milady has reached Calais.

                                 ROCHEFORT
                   I told you not to worry about the
                   Musketeers. They are dead by now.

                                 RICHELIEU
                   Buckingham's signature will be on
                   the treaty by morning.

                                 ROCHEFORT
                   The King's birthday celebration...?
                                 RICHELIEU
                   Will proceed as planned. Thanks
                   to the kind intercession of Queen
                   Anne.
      Rochefort steps closer, speaks quietly.
                                 ROCHEFORT
                   And our plans...?

                          (knowingly)
                   Will proceed as well.
      Richelieu pours two glasses of port, offers one to
      Rochefort. They turn, raise their glasses to the
      King's portrait. And drink.

110   INT. MILADY'S CHAMBER AT INN - NIGHT                      110

      D'Artagnan and Milady face each other on a rug in front
      of the roaring fire. The plate of food between them is
      empty. They drink wine from goblets. D'Artagnan drains
      his cup, and stares into the burning embers. Milady
      speaks quietly, with seeming compassion:
                                  MILADY
                   You are sad.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   I was thinking about my friends.
      Milady knows when to speak, and when to listen. She
      looks at d'Artagnan with gentle expression, allows him to
      continue. The warm room, the wine, her kindness. All
      conspire to loosen his tongue. D'Artagnan speaks
      quietly, from the heart:

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   The three best friends a man could
                   have. We were separated on our
                   way to Calais. I'm afraid I'll
                   never see them again.

                                 MILADY
                   What brings you here?
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   I'd like to tell you. But I can't.

                                 MILADY
                   'Important business.'

      D'Artagnan nods. He wants to impress her. He wants her
      to know how brave he is. And Milady is well aware of it.
      She looks down, assumes a more vulnerable pose.
                                 MILADY
                   I understand. Men make bold plans
                   in secret. And women wait... to
                   mourn, or to celebrate the outcome.
                   I know from experience, it's a
                   lonely vigil.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN

                   All I can tell you is... I'm on a
                   mission for the King.
                                 MILADY
                          (looks up; laughs
                           lightly)
                   I've heard that one before.
                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                   I'm serious.
                                 MILADY
                   You are a young man. And young
                   men are given to exaggeration.
                   However, if you would like to
                   entertain me with a story, I'm
                   eager to hear it. And please,
                   make it very brave, filled with
                   handsome knights and beautiful
                   ladies. I know, a dragon --
      There is nothing a man is more loathe to experience than
      a woman who does not take him seriously. D'Artagnan acts
      accordingly, and reveals:

                   I came to Calais to stop a spy
                   from sailing to England.

                          (alert; though
                           d'Artagnan doesn't
                           see it)
                   A spy...?
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                   Yes.

                   I believe you...
                          (beat)
                   Aren't you afraid?
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   Musketeers are not afraid of
                   anything.
                                 MILADY
                   I knew it. I knew you were a
                   Musketeer the moment I saw you.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                   You did?

                                 MILADY
                   Of course.
                          (with sudden concern)
                   But, d'Artagnan, if this spy was
                   to find out you are here, your
                   life could be in grave danger.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   A Musketeer is not afriad of
                   danger.
                                 MILADY
                   I'm dangerous. You're not afraid
                   of me?
      Her tone heralds a sudden shift. D'Artagnan sees the
      look in her eyes, can almost feel her lips upon him.
      But he resists. There is Constance's memory to consider.
      And midnight as it approaches.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   You're not dangerous.

                                 MILADY
                   Then what am I?

                   You're... beautiful.

      Milady covers him with caresses. D'Artagnan resists
      slightly, but she presses closer, she will not be denied.

      Milady leans close, runs a fingertip along     the line of
      his jaw. Her dressing gown falls open at      the top, enough
      for d'Artagnan to see her breasts as they     press against
      the silk beneath it. Milady speaks as her      finger traces.

                                 MILADY
                   Beauty, danger. They are the same.
      And with that, she reaches up to her hair, an ivory
      comb...


111   ON D'ARTAGNAN                                                  111
      He cannot continue.      Constance, the hour, a confusion he
      cannot deny.
                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                   I'm sorry --
      D'Artagnan pulls back -- just as Milady's arm arcs down
      toward his neck, holding a long sharp stick pin, almost a
      dagger, attached to an ivory comb. D'Artagnan sees it in
      the nick of time, parries with his free hand, knocking
      the dagger to the rug. Milady leaps after it, hands out-
      stretched. D'Artagnan follows, battles for the dagger,
      stunned with fear and surprise:

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   What're you doing?! Have you lost
                   your mind?!

                                 MILADY
                   You came to Calais to stop a spy
                   from sailing to England.

      D'Artagnan nearly chokes on the knowledge. Milady is the
      messenger he is seeking. He grabs the dagger, rolls to
      the side. Milady staggers after, the shoulder of her
      negligee rips open. D'Artagnan sees the soft white flesh,
      reacts with shock, recognition -- she bears the brand of
      the fleur de lis. The infamous mark of the murderess.
      Just as Athos told it to him.      Not so long ago.

                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                   My God...

                   Parker!!
      The chamber door flies open. Henri and Parker, the Indo-
      Chinese bodyguard, appear. Parker faces d'Artagnan with
      a half-smile. He holds out his hands, both empty. And
      steps toward him. D'Artagnan looks at the dagger in his
      right hand. Then, unwilling to fight the man with an un-
      fair advantage, he tosses the dagger to the side, steps
      forward to meet him.

      Parker disposes of d'Artagnan with lightning speed. A
      series of unexpected kicks, brutally efficient blows.
      The young man is unfamiliar with, and no match for, the
      martial arts. Parker hoists d'Artagnan to his feet,
      dazed. Henri picks up the dagger with bad intentions.
      Milady straightens her dressing gown, adjusts her hair,
      and commands:
                                MILADY
                   Kill him.
      Parker holds him fast. Henri steps forward.        And
      d'Artagnan thinks fast.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   You can kill me. But a surprise
                   waits for you in England. That
                   even Buckingham can't prevent.
                                 MILADY
                          (stops Henri with
                           a gesture)
                   What... surprise?
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   That's one thing I'll never tell
                   you.
                                 MILADY
                   D'Artagnan. You are young, vain,
                   and foolish. But I do not know
                   if you are clever.

      D'Artagnan's expression reveals nothing. Except to
      suggest the existence of a secret he is bravely keeping.
      Duly deceived, though she doesn't know it, Milady changes
      her mind.

                                 MILADY
                   We'll take him with us.

                   convince you to share your final
                   secret with me. It is a long
                   voyage.

112   INT. INN - UPPER HALL AND LANDING - NEAR DAWN                112

      Milady emerges from her room, dressed for travel. She is
      followed by d'Artagnan, now clothed. He is flanked by
      Henri and Parker. Henri presses the blade of a knife
      against d'Artagnan's side.
                                 HENRI
                   The bodyguards are waiting outside.

      Milady leads them down the hall. But when she reaches
      the landing, and looks at the tavern below... she draws
      back with surprise.


113   ANGLE TO INCLUDE MILADY AND HER POV                          113
      The innkeeper, roused   from sleep, and wearing a night-
      shirt, is engaged in   urgent conversation with Armand de
      Winter -- the son of   the man Milady killed in Paris. The
      innkeeper shakes his   head. Armand grabs him by the
      collar.

      D'Artagnan sees Milady's reaction -- surprise, impatience,
      and just a hint of fear. Milady commands:
                                 MILADY
                   The back stairs. Hurry!
      They change directions. As he is pulled away, d'Artagnan
      catches a glimpse of Armand de Winter below.

      Milady's coach emerges from the carriage house, speeds
      away in the direction of the harbor. In the driver's
      seat, Henri whips the horses, driving them onward.
      Milady's seven bodyguards follow on horseback.

115   INT. CARRIAGE - NIGHT                                     115
      D'Artagnan and Parker  sit across from Milady. Her face
      betrays faint doubt,  apprehension. Emotions she is not
      used to feeling, let  alone displaying to the world around
      her. D'Artagnan sees   his opening... and speaks:
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                The man at the inn... what did
                he want?
                              MILADY
                       (hollow laugh)
                Justice. Honor. Revenge.
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                Why?

                              MILADY
                He is the brother of my late
                husband, Lord de Winter. He
                blames me for de Winter's death.
                He thinks I murdered him.
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                Did you murder your husband,
                Milady?
                              MILADY
                What do you think?

      A beat. D'Artagnan studies her pale, beautiful face.
      Remembers Athos' tale of love and loss.
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                I think he's not the first husband
                you killed.
                       (off her look)
                I once knew a man, one of the
                Counts of Berry. He told me a
                story... of beauty and danger.
                He was the bravest man I've ever
                known. And the saddest.

                              MILADY
                I know...

      The truth strikes home. Milady cannot conceal it. But
      she does not react with anger or scorn. D'Artagnan has
      reminded her of the one thing in the world that still
      touches her heart. D'Artagnan looks at her with a steady
      gaze. Milady cannot hold it, she turns to the carriage
      window.

116   EXT. CALAIS - NIGHT                                        116
      Milady's carriage turns down a steep lane that leads to
      the harbor. The fog is so thick that only the masts of
      the schooners can be seen, poking out of the gloom.
      Their lanterns glow gloomily. The carriage comes to a
      stop.

117   EXT. HARBOR OF CALAIS - NIGHT                              117

      The lights of the harbor are muted by low-hanging fog.
      We see the outline of a ship waiting at the pier. Henri
      helps Milady out of the carriage. D'Artagnan follows.
      Milady's bodyguards dismount, six of them. A motley
      bunch of sinister killers. They look around the pier,
      ready for any encounter.
      D'Artagnan takes in his surroundings.    There is a mel-
      ancholy air about him.
                              MILADY
                What's the matter, d'Artagnan?
                Still hoping for your friends to
                ride to the rescue?
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                My friends are dead.

                              MILADY
                Well. If it's any consolation,
                you'll soon be joining them.
      Milady's return to form does not surprise. Parker shoves
      d'Artagnan toward the fog-enshrouded ship. A name can be
      made out on her barnacled hull. Persephone.

      Henri calls out to the ship, which is little more than an
      outline in the fog, her boarding gangplank leading to
      the soupy darkness of her deck.

                              HENRI
                We are the Countess de Winter's
                party, arrived from Paris.
                Permission to come aboard.

      There is no reply.    Closely guarded by Parker, d'Artagnan
      strains to see.

      Milady nods to Henri. He steps up the narrow gangplank,
      followed by Milady, d'Artagnan, Parker, and the six
      bodyguards.

119   EXT. DECK OF THE PERSEPHONE - NIGHT                              119

      The deck is filled with swirling fog. Henri peers into
      the gloom as he climbs aboard, followed by the others.
      He addresses one of the crew, a tall figure standing
      nearby.

                                 HENRI
                   Take us to your captain.
      The tall figure does not reply, nor does he move.        Henri
      demands:
                                 HENRI
                   What are you, deaf?
      Henri goes to shake the man. He grabs his arm, and the
      man pitches forward, falling face first on the deck.
      Henri jumps back in alarm. Milady and the others react.
                                   BODYGUARD
                   What is this?
      Milady's Bodyguards rush around the deck, confront the
      other silent silhouettes. They, like the tall figure...
      are dead. The limp bodies topple at their touch. The
      Bodyguards shout alarm and panic:

                                  BODYGUARDS
                   Dead!   They're all dead!

                                 PORTHOS (O.S.)
                   Well I certainly hope so. After
                   all that hard work.

      That's when Porthos, and Aramis -- come swooping down
      from above like avenging angels. They swing on the ends
      of ropes, slicing through the air, then dropping feet
      first on top of Milady's Bodyguards. D'Artagnan stands
      open-mouthed, as his three friends draw their swords.

                                 ARAMIS
                          (calling to him)

                   Two of them.

                                 PORTHOS
                   Remind me to tell you the story
                   of horses that could fly above
                   raging waters. A heroic tale of
                   love, death, and Musketeers.
                   Suitable for the general public.
      Porthos wades into the Bodyguards, at play, shouting as
      he goes.
                                 PORTHOS
                   All right then. All those who
                   wish to die, raise your hands!
                   Don't by shy, there's plenty to
                   go around!
      D'Artagnan grabs a sword from the deck, turns to join
      the fray. And finds himself face to face with Parker, the
      Indo-Chinese bodyguard. Parker has two Oriental swords
      spinning in his hands. One knocks d'Artagnan's sword out
      of his hand. D'Artagnan does a back flip but falls on
      the slippery deck. As Parker is about to chop
      d'Artagnan's head off, his face grimaces as he is lifted
      on a sword OUT OF FRAME. In the mist Athos is revealed!
                                 ATHOS
                   Sorry I'm late. Did I miss
                   anything?
      D'Artagnan almost cries with happiness.       He leaps to his
      feet and embraces Athos.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   I thought you were dead.

                                 ATHOS
                   Keep your mind on the mission,
                   d'Artagnan.

      He winks at d'Artagnan, returns to the fray. D'Artagnan
      follows. The Musketeers confront Milady's evil Bodyguards
      in the night and fog. Athos with brutal perfection.
      Porthos with strange weapons and a healthy sense of the
      absurd. And Aramis with familiar grace and artistry --
      and a marked determination to disable, not kill, his
      opponents.

      Milady views the latter with alarm. As the battle rages
      around her, she retreats into the shadows.

      Athos and d'Artagnan find themselves fighting side by
      side. Athos observes d'Artagnan's technique -- the usual
      frenetic windmill of feint and thrust -- with a frown.
                                 ATHOS
                   Boy, it's a miracle you're still
                   alive fighting like that.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   What do you mean?

                                 ATHOS
                   First, always find your enemy's
                   weakness. Second, take advantage
                   of it. Watch me.

      One of the Bodyguards, who wears a wooden leg, attacks
      Athos. Athos kicks the false leg out from under him,
      knocks him to the deck. D'Artagnan repeats, even as he
      disables his own foe.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   Find the weakness. Take advantage.
                   Got it.
      Aramis kneels at a dying man, delivers muttered last
      rites. A Bodyguard races INTO VIEW, means to kill him
      where he kneels. Aramis doesn't miss a beat -- he shifts,
      rises, delivers a punch and kick, knocking the man off the
      ship to the water below. A SPLASH is heard. And Aramis
      resumes a priestly pose, continues the litany.

      With a collective "yah!" the two Sailors drop their
      daggers, and flee into the foggy night. Porthos looks
      about to see if anyone noticed their exit. D'Artagnan
      grins nearby.

                                 PORTHOS
                   I told you I was famous.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   Porthos the Pirate?

                                  PORTHOS
                   Privateer.   There's a difference.
      Every Musketeer is running from something or someone.
      D'Artagnan deadpans:
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   I love a good sea story.     Do tell
                   me sometime.
      Porthos reacts to d'Artagnan's jest. But before he can
      reply, the youth has bolted back to the fray.

      The battle raging aboard the Persephone, sabers flash,
      PISTOLS EXPLODE.


123   BACK TO SCENE                                                 123
      Athos drives several Bodyguards back with his sword,
      notices d'Artagnan working his way towards him.

                                 ATHOS
                   Did you find the Cardinal's spy?

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   Yes.
                                 ATHOS
                   Did you kill him?

                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                   Athos.   The spy... is a woman.

                   What?

      Athos turns to d'Artagnan, wonders. And at that moment,
      sees a figure at the gangplank, swathed in fog and diffuse
      light. Milady. Time stops as they regard each other
      across the deck, the battle between.

                                ATHOS
                   No.

      Milady turns and runs into the night.    Athos races after.
                                                      CUT TO:


124   EXT. PIER - NIGHT                                             124
      With the speed and grace of a panther, Milady runs down
      the gangplank, climbs into the saddle of one of her
      Bodyguard's horses, and gallops off. Athos appears
      moments later, leaps into the saddle of another horse.
      And gives chase.

                                                      CUT TO:

125   EXT. HARBOR ROAD - NIGHT                                      125

      Milady whips her horse, drives it onward. But Athos
      overtakes, leaps from his saddle, takes her into his arms.
      They fall to the ground with a crash. Milady grabs the
      deadly comb from her hair, grips the dagger's handle.
      Athos, stunned from breaking their fall, rolls to his
      side. Milady peers at his face, vulnerable in the half-
      light. And lowers the dagger. She will not kill him.

      Milady scrambles to her feet, runs toward a dark forest.
      But Athos stands and shouts:
                                ATHOS
                   Stop!!
      Milady takes a halting step, then turns to face him.
      Athos holds his musket in a steady hand. A very long
      beat. Milady takes a step closer. Finally, she whispers,
      with love, with hate:
                                MILADY
                   Athos.

                                 ATHOS
                   How did you do it, Sabine? How
                   did you come back from the dead?

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                 MILADY
                   A kind gentleman took pity on me.

                                 ATHOS
                   I did not.

                                 MILADY
                   No, Count. You were too proud to
                   listen to the truth. I learned
                   the value of lies soon after.

      Athos grips the pistol tighter, as if to ward off the
      past and what it brings.
                                 ATHOS
                   Give me the Cardinal's treaty.

                                 MILADY
                   No.
                                 ATHOS
                   Then I will shoot.
      Athos cocks the trigger.     Milady whispers:
                                  MILADY
                   Be kind.   And aim for my heart.
      Athos' face is a mask of contradiction. He tries to pull
      the trigger, but it is not in him. Milady recognizes
      his pain with a nod. She feels it, too. Then, briefly,
      before she leaves him, Milady speaks softly. The past,
      their love, and where it led them.

                                 MILADY
                   I remember... everything.

      She turns and runs away... directly into the arms of
      Armand de Winter. He has ridden, and he has followed,
      and he has finally found her here.

                                 ARMAND
                   Countess de Winter...
      As d'Artagnan, Porthos, and Aramis arrive on the scene...

126   INT. INN (CALIAIS) - PUBLIC ROOM - NIGHT                     126

      The public room is empty, save for d'Artagnan and the
      three Musketeers. They gather around a table. Aramis
      holds the treaty in his gloved hand. The mood is somber
      and tense.

                                 ARAMIS
                   The treaty outlines Richelieu's
                   plan to forge an alliance with
                   Buckingham.
                                 PORTHOS
                   What about the King?

                                 ARAMIS
                   He is not mentioned directly. But
                   the agreement is contingent on a
                   'demonstration' of the Cardinal's
                   power.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   A demonstration? What does that
                   mean?
                                   ARAMIS
                   I don't know.
      Athos' face grows dark. He has been silent throughout.
      Now he rises to his feet.

                                 ATHOS
                   I know someone who does.
      D'Artagnan, Aramis, and Porthos watch in grim silence as
      Athos crosses the room to an imposing door.

127   INT. PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT                                    127
      A fire burns in the grate. Milady sits beside it in a
      chair, staring into the glowing embers. Their hot re-
      flection dances in her pale blue eyes. There is a KNOCK
      at the door. Armand de Winter emerges from a dark corner
      of the room where he has been standing guard with an
      impassive executioner. He crosses to the door, opens it.
      And Athos steps inside.
                                 ATHOS
                   I'd like a word with your
                   prisoner.

                                 ARMAND
                          (a beat, he nods)
                   She dies at dawn.

      Athos nods, and steps to Milady, stands before her.
      Milady stares at the fire, speaks softly, her eyes on the
      flames.

                   Did you come to offer me
                   consolation?
                                ATHOS
                   No.

      Milady turns, looks up to face him.
                                 MILADY
                   There was a time when I would've
                   given my life for a kind word.
                                 ATHOS
                   I could not give it, Sabine.
                   I was... a fool.
      Milady hears the regret in his voice, holds his gaze.
      Athos indicates Armand in the corner.
                                 ATHOS
                   Did you kill his brother and his
                   father as he says?
                                 MILADY

                           honest at the
                           last)
                   I have become... the nightmare
                   you once thought me to be.
                                 ATHOS
                   But not before. Not us.
                                MILADY
                   No. The memory will keep me
                   company.
      Athos kneels at her side, near to pleading:

                                 ATHOS
                   Do you know the Cardinal's plans?
                                MILADY
                   Yes.

                                ATHOS
                   Tell me.

                                 MILADY
                   Will you spare my life?

                   Sabine. You'll die for your

                   But how you leave this world is

      Milady offers a half-smile, takes his hand in hers.

128   EXT. SEASIDE CLIFFS - NIGHT                                   128
      A hundred feet below, waves crash on a rocky shore. On
      the jagged cliff above, a black mass of trees is outlined
      against a stormy sky filled with copper-colored clouds,
      surreal in effect. A sinister procession approaches the
      cliff.
      Porthos leads Milady. She wears a simple white shift,
      her hair pulled back into a long braid. She looks years
      younger, the girl she used to be. The Executioner walks
      behind them. Followed by Armand de Winter, Aramis,
      d'Artagnan. And Athos. He watches every step.

      The procession stops at the cliff's edge.
      THUNDER RUMBLES. Lightning slashes the sky. The
      Executioner ties Milady's hands behind her. The
      Executioner removes a bright scimitar from beneath his
      cloak. Milady catches Athos' eye. He holds her gaze.

      He stares at Milady unflinchingly, as if to burn her
      image into his eyes, so that he might keep it there until
      the day he dies.
      Aramis reaches inside his cloak, removes the sacred
      priestly cloth he carries.

      The Executioner delivers the formal litany:

                                 EXECUTIONER
                   I forgive you for your crimes.
                   Die in peace.

      Athos repeats, whispers:

                                   ATHOS
                   Die in peace.

      Aramis comes forward, intones:
                                 ARAMIS
                   I am the resurrection and the

                   believeth in me, though he were
                   dead, yet shall he live; and
                   whosoever liveth and believeth
                   in me shall never die...
      The Executioner's sharp blade shines in the light of
      dawn.

                                 EXECUTIONER
                   On your knees.
      Milady kneels, the Executioner steps closer. The tableau
      silhouetted against a reddish glow on the horizon. The
      Executioner brushes Milady's braid from her neck,
      exposing the soft white skin beneath. He raises the
      scimitar overhead, and just as he is about to bring it
      down... a cry is heard, torn from the heart:

                                   ATHOS
                   No.

      Athos grabs the Executioner's wrist, and twists the
      scimitar loose. It falls to the ground.
                                 EXECUTIONER
                   What's this...?
      Porthos leaps forward, locks his great arms around Athos.

                                   PORTHOS
                   Athos --
      But Athos breaks free.       Milady rises to her feet.   Athos
      rushes to her.

                                 ATHOS
                   Forgive me, Sabine.       Please
                   forgive.

                   I do.

      The words he could never say, finally spoken. Milady
      locks eyes with him. Athos' desperate act, the pure
      feeling it signifies, has given her a kind of release.
      And the strength to face her fate.

                                 MILADY
                   The Cardinal intends to assassinate
                   the King at his birthday celebration
                   on Friday.
      And with that, Milady reaches forward, offers a gentle
      kiss. Then, as Athos and the others look on, stunned,
      uncertain... she takes a backward step, finds the
      cliff's edge... and steps over it. The Executioner
      rushes to look after. The others follow. Except for
      Athos, who remains rooted in place, eyes on the
      distant horizon. A long silence. THUNDER RUMBLES.
                                 EXECUTIONER
                   God's justice be done.

      D'Artagnan sadly lowers his head. Porthos puts a
      consoling hand on his shoulder. Aramis stands to the
      other side, mutters:
                                 ARAMIS
                   Amen.
                                 ATHOS
                   Musketeers.

      D'Artagnan, Porthos, and Aramis turn. Athos has regained
      his former self. Stoic, in command. And hiding a broken
      heart.

                                 ATHOS
                   The King's life in danger.   We
                   have work to do.

      START CLOSE ON the now familiar portrait of King
      Louis XIII, usually found hanging behind Richelieu's
      desk. A SHOT RINGS OUT -- and a blast tears through
      the painting, leaving a smoking hole where the King's
      heart should be.

      REVEALS Richelieu and Rochefort as they walk across the
      roof to the painting, appraise the damage. Thie Cardinal
      pokes a long finger into the hole.
                               RICHELIEU
                 Impressive.

                               ROCHEFORT
                 He can do it every time.
      Rochefort signals approval to a solitary marksman
      positioned far away on one of the roof parapets. The
      marksman rises from a shooter's crouch, bows curtly,
      and begins to reload his musket.

                               RICHELIEU
                 And he has no qualms about...
                               ROCHEFORT
                 None. He believes that man should
                 honor no Kings before God.
                               RICHELIEU
                 A man of faith. How delightful.
                        (turns back to
                         the painting)
                 Whatever you're paying him, double
                 it. I want the King's birthday to
                 be a memorable event. And rehang
                 this painting in my chamber. Just
                 as it is.
      HOLD ON Richelieu for a beat.   Framed by a sky filled
      with stars. His evil intent.

      D'Artagnan and the three Musketeers thunder through on
      horseback. Pedestrians scurry to get out of their way.
      As they ride past, Porthos raises a crossbow and fires
      it. The arrow slices through the air with a terrible
      hum and imbeds itself on the public wall. Attached to
      the arrow is a piece of parchment, like the one in
      d'Artagnan's father's study. It reads: All For One,

      Townspeople are gathered around.

                declared outlaws and are sentenced
                to death. Any person sheltering
                or aiding them will be hanged --
      HOOFBEATS interrupt. The Captain turns in irritation.
      And Porthos and Aramis ride to either side, snatch the
      man up by the arms, drag him briefly through the air,
      and deposit him with a thud against a hitching post.
      The Captain, stunned, looks down at the piece of
      parchment now attached to his chest. All For One, And
      One For All.

      share a common destination, the Palace. A festive mood
      is in the air. And why not, it is the King's birthday.

137   INT. LOUVRE - GREAT HALL AND THRONE ROOM - DAY             137
      A gathering of nobles and ladies, all in full ceremonial
      dress. Rochefort is there as well, the familiar eye
      patch, in command of the Cardinal's Guards. A Seneschal
      waits at the door with two flanking lines of trumpeteers.
      The trumpeteers raise their instruments and blow a royal
      blast.

      Louis, Queen Anne, and their retinue enter from a
      corridor, proceed slowly across the room toward the
      balcony that overlooks the waiting crowd outside.
      Noblemen bow, and their ladies curtsy as the King and
      Queen pass. Constance, dressed for the occasion, looks
      on from the sidelines, smiles. The King and Queen
      proceed, two teenagers with the world at the feet.

                              LOUIS
                They look... happy.

                Hungry, more likely.

                Still, you were right about the
                celebration. And when the Cardinal
                told me how much it meant to you...
                              ANNE
                I said nothing.

                              ANNE
                The Cardinal expressed in
                confidence how much the celebration
                would mean to you...
      Both pause to consider the manipulation.

      Richelieu stands in an anteroom just off the procession,
      he watches the King and Queen as they walk, speaks
      quietly, to himself:
                              RICHELIEU
                I'm not sure which is sadder... to
                die so young. Or to die a King.
      Richelieu turns from the procession. Speaks to Rochefort
      who pauses in the shadowy alcove behind him.

                              RICHELIEU
                France will not go wanting. A new
                King will sit on the throne. The
                true King after all...

      He says it quiet fervor, the dream at long last within
      reach. Then, as if to reassure:

      The balcony has been colorfully decorated. The crowd
      focuses its attention on the empty space where the King
      will soon appear. Below, the entrance to the Palace is
      protected by a double line of the Cardinal's Guards,
      resplendent in their crimson tunics. It would take an
      army to get past them.

      The streets leading to the Palace are clogged with
      people, all pushing and straining to get closer.
      D'Artagnan and the three Musketeers arrive on horseback,
      are forced to dismount. They push through the crowd,
      trying to reach the Palace, afraid that they will be too
      late. Athos barks orders as they struggle forward:

                          (to d'Artagnan)

                   We'll try to reach the King...

      Athos and the others press on. D'Artagnan, a little
      disappointed to be left behind, pauses, checks the
      buildings that loom overhead. Then he starts, reacts
      with shock and surprise.

      The bell tower of the Carmes-Deschaux monastery. A
      figure moving about, dimly-viewed, but this much is

      musket in his hands.

      trails the royal couple. He nods to Rochefort in
      passing. They exchange significant smiles. Anne spots
      the smirk on Rochefort's face. He resumes a supplicant
      pose. Anne glances back, Richelieu behind them.

153   INT./EXT. LOUVRE - DAY                                    153
      Pandemonium, inside and outside the Palace. Athos,
      Porthos, and Aramis emerge from the crowd at the entrance,
      draw their swords, and prepare to rush the long line of
      Guards protecting the doors. The Guards cannot believe
      what they are seeing. Three men against a hundred. It's
      ridiculous. But then... the looks on Guards' faces begin
      to change, subtly at first, from amusement to horror.

154   THEIR POV                                                   154

      Behind Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, something incredible
      happens. Musketeers appear from every direction. Some
      from the surrounding crowd. Some from buildings, roof-
      tops. Others appear on horseback, a few disguised as
      monks. And all defiantly wearing their blue and gold
      tunics.
      The murmur of the crowd becomes an excited roar. The
      corps of Musketeers line up behind Athos, Porthos, and
      Aramis. Porthos and Aramis exchange a smile. Athos
      keeps his usually dour expression. But his eyes are
      charged with excitement. They raise their arms, and
      face the long line of Guards. A hundred sabers flash in
      the sunlight.
                                ATHOS
                  Save the King!!

      The Musketeers charge.   It is a glorious sight.

155   EXT. BELL TOWER - DAY                                     155
      D'Artagnan scrambles up through the trapdoor, and tackles
      the marksman. As the BELL CONTINUES TO CLANG, they fight
      hand-to-hand. The marksman forces d'Artagnan toward the
      edge of the tower. Two hundred feet to the ground below.
      They remain deadlocked for a beat, the marksman inching
      d'Artagnan backward, certain death behind him. And at
      the last moment, d'Artagnan summons up the strength of
      three -- and shoves the marksman backward with a resound-
      ing kick.

      The marksman stumbles, falls through the open trapdoor,
      and plunges to his death.
      D'Artagnan peers down the shaft. There's a faint CRASH
      as the marksman hits bottom. Utilizing the bell ropes
      like a fireman's pole, d'Artagnan grabs hold and slides
      down into the abyss.

156   INT. GREAT HALL AND THRONE ROOM - DAY                     156
      Pandemonium reigns. Rochefort instructs his Guards to
      close the huge door to the great hall. The members of
      the King's royal court run in panicked circles, convinced
      the palace is under seige. Constance pauses amid the
      riot, seeks the Queen.

      But Richelieu has found her first. He steps to Anne,
      assumes an air of priestly innocence.
                              RICHELIEU
                Your Majesty...

      But Louis steps INTO VIEW, puts a protecting arm around
      his wife, speaks stern command:

                              LOUIS
                Leave us... alone.
      That's when a loud BOOM rocks the room.


157   ANOTHER ANGLE                                             157
      The great door shudders under the impact of a terrific
      blow. Another BOOM and the great hall is plunged into
      further chaos. The regiment of Guards rush forward,
      press their bodies against the door to secure it.
      BOOM -- the great door threatens to split in half.
      Richelieu huddles with Rochefort amid the rising panic.
      His eyes narrow to mean slits, he gestures toward Louis
      and Anne across the room.

                              RICHELIEU
                       (a cold whisper)
                Kill him. Kill her, too.

      Rochefort draws d'Artagnan's sword from its sheath. He
      advances on Louis and Anne. Louis has witnessed the
      latter, treason confirmed. He raises his own sword,
      prepared to protect his Queen. To die for her if
      necessary.
                              LOUIS
                       (to Anne)
                Get behind me.
      Rochefort takes confident steps toward the King. But
      one last BOOM and the great DOOR comes CRASHING down on
      the Guards, revealing a tide of Musketeers on the other
      side. Athos, Porthos, and Aramis at the lead.

157   CONTINUED:                                                 157
      Louis breaks into a wide grin. The Musketeers wade into
      the Guards, and the great hall is transformed into a bat-
      tlefield. Rochefort turns, sees Athos charging at him.
                                 ATHOS
                   Greetings, Monsieur Cyclops.   Are
                   we interrupting?

                                   ROCHEFORT
                   Not for long.

      Athos and Rochefort lock swords and duel.

158   BATTLE                                                     158

      Musketeers surround Louis and Anne to ward off attack.
      But the young King has no intention of being protected.
      He wades to the fore, fights side by side with his
      Musketeers. Anne watches him with a host of emotions.
      Respect, admiration... love. Louis pauses to return her
      gaze, then returns to battle.
      Constance dashes through the fray. She sees a Guard
      slip behind a curtain, approach the Queen. She grabs a
      heavy goblet, shouts:
                                   CONSTANCE
                   Look out!
      Anne looks up. Constance tosses the goblet to her. Anne
      catches it neatly, brings it down on the head of the
      hapless Guard. Constance smiles, leaps forward.

      Aramis cuts down a Guard. As another man comes at him
      from behind, Porthos intervenes, runs the man through.
      The two Musketeers pause to exchange deadpan thanks,
      and continue.
      Athos and Rochefort slash at each other. It is a mighty
      confrontation. But Athos soon gains the upper hand.
      Rochefort shouts to a nearby Guard for help. Now it's
      two on one. Athos receives a wound in the shoulder, he
      staggers... and the treaty falls from his tunic to the
      floor. Rochefort reacts with a start, he grabs the
      treaty, stuffs it into his doublet. Athos shakes off
      the sudden pain, disposes of the Guard. Rochefort and
      Athos face each other a second time. Athos wounded,
      Rochefort confident he can finish the injured Musketeer.

      But Athos merely changes sword hands. Rochefort reacts.
      Their SABERS CLASH as they draw together. Rochefort
      grabs a dagger from his belt with his free hand. But
      Athos sees it coming, and smashes Rochefort across the
      face with his fist.
                                                 (CONTINUED)

158   CONTINUED:                                                    158
      Rochefort goes sprawling. He loses his sword, it slides
      across the floor until someone's foot stops it.
      Rochefort looks up... and sees d'Artagnan standing on
      the blade.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   This sword belongs to me.

      D'Artagnan stoops to pick up his long-lost sword. He
      tosses his other saber to Rochefort, who catches it
      neatly. Athos watches from a short distance, knows
      this moment belongs to d'Artagnan. He will not intervene.
      But he shouts:
                                  ARAMIS
                   D'Artagnan.   Kill him where he
                   stands.
      These are d'Artagnan's words. A son vowing to avenge the
      death of his father. D'Artagnan wonders. Rochefort
      confirms.
                                 ROCHEFORT
                   By all means. Let's discover if
                   you are as brave a man as your
                   father was. And as foolish.
                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                          (stunned by the
                            revelation as it
                            unfolds)
                   What...?
                                 ROCHEFORT
                   He died for his King and for
                   France. But most of all... he
                   died on the end of my sword.
                          (the final curse)
                   As will you.
      Rochefort smiles a taunt.     D'Artagnan raises his sword,
      whispers to heaven.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   This is for you, Father.

      Then, eyes blazing, d'Artagnan attacks Rochefort with
      everything he's got, driving him into an adjoining
      chamber.


159   ANGLE TO INCLUDE CHAMBER                                     159
      A FIRE ROARS in a great stone hearth. Its light pro-
      jects giant shadows on the wall as d'Artagnan and
      Rochefort duel, slashing at each other.

                                                             132.

160   GREAT HALL                                                    160
      Athos, Porthos, and Aramis take the fight to the
      Cardinal's Guards. Each with his by-now familiar
      tradmarks. King Louis fighting beside them.

161   D'ARTAGNAN AND ROCHEFORT                                     161

      They battle before the blazing fire, sweat covers their
      faces. Rochefort wears a wolfish grin. But d'Artagnan
      has learned his lessons well. He attacks with gusto.
      Rochefort's grin soon turns toward desperation. He
      cannot match the boy's vengeful steel. So he drives a
      knee into d'Artagnan's groin. D'Artagnan falls to the
      floor. Rochefort means to finish him there. But
      d'Artagnan rolls away from the blade, leaps back to his
      feet. Undaunted, he hurls himself at his hated opponent.

      Rochefort sidesteps, throws d'Artagnan against a wall.
      He pins him there, stunning the youth. And hisses with
      superior disdain:
                                 ROCHEFORT
                   One thing's certain. You're no
                   Musketeer.
      But d'Artagnan remembers Athos' advice. "Always find
      your enemy's weakness." He shoves a thumb into
      Rochefort's good eye. Rochefort stumbles backward.
      D'Artagnan plunges his sword into Monsieur Cyclops's
      heart.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   Take it back...?

                                 ROCHEFORT
                   I might... have been... mistaken.

      Rochefort crumples to the floor, dead. D'Artagnan looks
      at Rochefort's blood on his sword. His father's death
      finally avenged. That's when he hears the RUSTLE of a
      SILKEN ROBE. D'Artagnan pivots, sees Richelieu kneeling
      at Rochefort's body... extracting the treaty from his
      doublet.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                   No!!

      Richelieu smiles,   hurls the treaty into the blazing
      fireplace. As the    flames begin to lick at the parchment
      paper, d'Artagnan   flies past the Cardinal, and dives
      after to retrieve   it.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

      Athos, Porthos, and Aramis enter the room. D'Artagnan
      stumbles out of the fireplace, covered with soot,
      clutching the treaty. He grins. ON d'Artagnan's look
      of triumph...
                                                    CUT TO:


162   INT. GREAT HALL AND THRONE ROOM - DAY                       162
      A short time later. The battle is over. The Musketeers
      have won. On the dais, Louis and Anne confront Richelieu
      who is a prisoner now, guarded by several Musketeers.
      Louis holds the recovered treaty in his hands.

      D'Artagnan and the three Musketeers stand nearby.

                                 RICHELIEU
                   Your Majesty, that document is an
                   obvious forgery. I am clearly the
                   victim of a conspiracy designed
                   and perpetuated by these three
                   Musketeers.

      Richelieu assumes a trustworthy pose, one familiar to
      both King and Queen.
                                 LOUIS
                   This is a complicated matter,
                   Your Eminence, affecting both
                   France and the crown...
      A beat. As all wonder if Richelieu will manage to elude
      blame after all. But Louis continues with quiet author-
      ity, just a trace of humor. As King, and as a man.
                                 LOUIS
                   And so, until such time as I and
                   my advisors --
                          (gestures toward
                           Anne; the
                           Musketeers)
                   -- can determine the whole truth
                   of the matter. I invite you to
                   await our decision in the comfort
                   of... the Bastille.

      Musketeers close in around the Cardinal.     He fumes,
      protests.

                                 RICHELIEU
                   You can't do this to me.   I'm the
                   Cardinal of France.

                                 LOUIS
                          (never more certain)
                   And I am its King.
      Shouts of "Long live the King!       Long live the King!"

                                 LOUIS
                   And as King... I hereby reinstate
                   the Musketeers.
      A tremendous cheer is heard from all. Richelieu is led
      from the room. He pauses in front of d'Artagnan.
                                 RICHELIEU
                   Congratulations, Monsieur
                   d'Artagnan. I'll be keeping an
                   eye on you.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                          (unphased)
                   Thank you, Your Eminence.    I'll
                   be watching you, too.
      Richelieu smiles his crocodile smile. Followed by
      guards, he turns and strides away, hands clasped behind
      his back, scarlet robes billowing behind him.
      Louis turns to the Musketeers.       He indicates d'Artagnan.

                                 LOUIS
                   Is this the young man who saved
                   my life?
      Porthos puts a hand on d'Artagnan's shoulder.
                                 PORTHOS
                   His name's d'Artagnan, Sire.

                                 LOUIS
                   Approach, d'Artagnan.

      D'Artagnan's heart pounds as he draws closer to King and
      Queen. Then he remembers, reaches into his doublet. And
      turns to the Queen.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   I have something that belongs to
                   ... Your Majesty...
      D'Artagnan produces the bracelet he found on the country
      road. He holds it out to her. The King wonders, the
      Queen smiles.

                   bracelet does not belong to me.
                          (off his look)
                   It belongs to her.

      Anne indicates Constance, who steps forward, INTO VIEW.
      D'Artagnan and Constance lock eyes for the third time.
      The thrill of recognition, the promise of romance,
      charges between. D'Artagnan slips the bracelet around
      her wrist. Constance kisses him on the cheek. Louis
      continues:
                                 LOUIS
                   D'Artagnan, I am in your debt.
                   What can I do to repay the courage
                   you've shown me? Anything,
                   D'Artagnan.  Whatever your heart
                   desires...
      D'Artagnan knows what he wants. But he is tongue-tied,
      unable to ask for it. Athos asks for him.
                                 ATHOS
                   Majesty, his heart has only one
                   desire. To become a Musketeer.
      D'Artagnan looks at Athos, thankful for the intercession.
      Louis answers with pleasure.
                                 LOUIS
                   Then kneel, d'Artagnan.
      D'Artagnan drops to his knees. Louis lays the blade of
      his sword on each of his shoulders.
                                 LOUIS
                   The world is an uncertain realm,
                   filled with danger. Truth
                   despoiled by broken promises.
                   Honor undermined by the pursuit
                   of gold. Freedom sacrificed when
                   the weak are oppressed by the
                   strong. But there are those who
                   oppose these powerful forces.
                   Those who dedicate their lives to
                   truth, honor, and freedom. They
                   are a constant reminder to all of
                   us. That such a life is not just
                   possible, but necessary to our
                   continued survival. As a country,
                   as a King. These men are known as
                   the Musketeers...
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                               136.

      As Louis speaks, D'Artagnan closes his eyes; countless
      images rush through his mind. His home in Gascony,
      Constance and Queen Anne on the country road, his first
      encounters with Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, their
      adventures together, the face of Milady. It's been a
      busy week.

                                 LOUIS
                   Rise, d'Artagnan. And join them.
                   Musketeer.

      D'Artagnan stands, transformed from boy to man. BELLS
      RING in the distance. Constance smiles brightly, tears
      gleam in her eyes. Athos, Porthos, and Aramis surround
      their young friend, and happily present him with the
      bright blue tunic of the Musketeers. They slip the tunic
      over d'Artagnan's head, react with a cheer. D'Artagnan
      hugs each of the three. For each has given him gifts
      more valuable than gold.
      Porthos, Aramis, and last... Athos.       Who, to the surprise
      of all who know him... smiles.
                                 PORTHOS
                   Do my eyes deceive me?
                                 ARAMIS
                   I find it hard to believe myself.

                                 PORTHOS
                   His lips, unused as they are to
                   such a contortion, twisted and
                   stretched... into a smile.

                                 ARAMIS
                   It was spectacular. And what
                   teeth.

      D'Artagnan basks in their company, wonders aloud.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   I know this is a stupid question.
                   But what exactly does a Musketeer
                   do?

      Porthos and Aramis exchange a glance.       They're not so
      sure themselves.
                                 PORTHOS
                   Truth... honor...

                                 ARAMIS
                          (helpfully suggests
                           a third)
                   And freedom.

      The Three Musketeers -- no, make that the four
      Musketeers -- raise their swords, and clash blades
      together, causing them to give off sparks.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   All for one...
                                 OTHERS
                   ... And one for all!!

      MUSIC SOARS.    The curtain falls.
                                                FADE OUT.

    TINNY CHEATIN' HEART MUSIC, the dull GROAN of a TRACTOR,
    CRICKETS CHIRPIN' love songs, sporadic ZAPS from BUG
    LIGHTS, and an occasional random THWOCK as we --


    FADE IN:


1   EXT. TEXAS - DRAMATIC ANGLE - SUNSET                        1

    Out west where the sun descends gloriously over desolate
    mountains. A sense of timeless and incorruptible beauty
    if you ignore the TWANG of the MUSIC, the SPUTTER of the
    TRACTOR, the ZAPS, the THWACKS... and something else...

    ... MEN'S VOICES.   Garrulous with drink, fraternity and
    amusement.

    We PAN DOWN TO:


2   EXT. DRIVING RANGE - LATE DAY                               2

    A man, JOSE, is on the roof, wrestling with a rickety
    satellite dish, stringing wire, trying to get it to work.
    (We get glimpses of him throughout the scene as he
    struggles with what is assuredly a pirate operation.)

    Four of six floodlights nailed to the roof cast pools of
    yellow into the gathering darkness. ROY "TIN CUP" McAVOY
    stands under the swarm of moths crowding the brightest
    light, hitting golf balls. THWOCK...! Launching them,
    really, into the deepening night. There's a beer between
    his legs. Behind him:

    A group of men forms a semicircle, facing away from Tin
    Cup. These men are the range regulars: CURT, CLINT,
    EARL, and DEWEY. Each man has money in one hand and his
    preferred libation in the other. They're all looking
    back and forth between the bug lights hung on the back
    wall, and muttering what sounds like bets to:

    ROMEO POSAR -- a smaller man, he stands at the center of
    the group with a handful of cash. Romeo is a part-time
    bookie and full-time driving range man. Born across the
    river in Mexico, Romeo is Tin Cup's caddie, confidante,
    best friend.

                             ROMEO
               Okay, all bets are down!

    Their eyes rivet on the bug lights, edgy, hopeful,
    until... ZAP! A BUG is ELECTROCUTED. And Dewey cheers
    triumphantly while the other regulars mutter curses about
    how they woulda, coulda, shoulda bet.

                                                                   2.
                             ROMEO
               Number one is the winner! Dewey
               has the winner. Pays five to two!

     Romeo quickly pays Dewey and more quickly takes money from
     the losers. It's fast-paced, inane, time-killing
     gambling. Tin Cup looks over.

                             TIN CUP
               Don't you shitheels ever get
               bored?

     The regulars flap dismissive palms and mutter in the
     negative as they turn back to Romeo and the action at the
     bug lights.

                             TIN CUP
               ... 'Cuz I got a riddle.

     Tin Cup leads the regulars inside.

                                                   CUT TO:


A3   INT. DRIVING RANGE - LATE DAY                                A3

     Tin Cup holds court.

                             TIN CUP
               Takes about two ounces of brains
               to figure it out. Anyone think
               they got a brain with two ounces
               of brains in it?

     The regulars silently look at each other, reluctant to
     reveal the heft of their brains.

                             TIN CUP
               For Chrissakes, boys! A little
               self-confidence from the players'
               gallery. We ain't talking long
               division.

                             EARL
                      (timidly)
               How much we gotta lose?

                             TIN CUP
               You want to liven things up, Earl?
               That's a hell of an idea. Say
               everyone puts in twenty bucks and
               the pot goes to whoever solves the
               riddle.

                             DEWEY
               You going to get the riddle, Tin
               Cup?

                                                            3.

                        TIN CUP
                 (patiently)
          Dewey. I'm the one asking the
          riddle. I already know the
          answer. I don't getta guess.
          Although... We could say if I get
          to five hundred bounces and no one
          gets the riddle, I get the pot.
          And I know what you're thinking.
          It's an impossible riddle. Well,
          It's not. It's an easy riddle.
          And if somehow by the grace of
          fluke luck I win, and you all
          don't agree it was an easy
          riddle, hell, I'll refund your
          money.

                        EARL, CLINT & ALL
          I'm in... We're in... Count us
          in... etc...

                        TIN CUP
          Okay, a man's driving down the
          road with his son and they get
          in a crash. Two ambulances come
          and take the man and his son to
          different hospitals. Son goes
          into the operating room, the
          doctor looks at him and says, 'I
          can't operate on this boy. He's
          my son.' How's that possible?
                 (beat)
          The clock's ticking boys...

Tin Cup begins bouncing a ball on the face of his wedge.

                        EARL
          Father didn't sneak back in,
          right? He's still at the other
          hospital?

                        TIN CUP
          It ain't 'Star Trek,' Earl.   No
          one beamed him aboard.

That eliminates the most plausible theory in their minds.
The men think harder.

                        EARL
          Well... if the father married the
          son's daughter --

                        TIN CUP
          It's a family riddle, Earl.   Think
          clean thoughts.

                                                                   4.
    The regulars puzzle some more.

                            CLINT
              Give us a little hint.

                            MOLLY (O.S.)
              The doctor's a woman.

    All heads turn to take in the arrival of:


3   MOLLY GRISWOLD                                             3

    Standing just inside the door -- she's a fresh-faced
    beauty in her early thirties, and she's got all new
    everything the sport of golf requires: new bag, new
    clubs, new shoes, new clothes, new visor... she looks
    like she stepped out of an ad in Golf Digest. And all
    the men are asking themselves the same question: what's
    she doing here? The silence invites Molly to supply the
    riddle's answer.

                            MOLLY
              The doctor is the son's mother.
              Feminists pose the riddle to
              reveal how deeply our sexual
              stereotypes run.
                     (directly to Tin Cup)
              I take it you're a feminist?

    Tin Cup misses the ball he's been bouncing, breaking the
    spell. The regulars wait for Tin Cup's response.

                            TIN CUP
              Ma'am, I've been called a lot of
              things -- but no one's ever
              saddled me with that one.

                            MOLLY
              You might try being saddled
              sometime -- the smell of leather,
              the sting of a whip...

    The regulars snicker, enjoying her one-upmanship.

                             TIN CUP
                     (slightly taken
                      aback)
              I'm just a humble golf pro...

                            MOLLY
              You're Roy McAvoy the golf pro? I
              pictured something... different.
              I have a seven o'clock lesson.

                            TIN CUP
              I thought I had a Doctor Griswold

                                                                   5.
              at seven.

    They hurry out to the range, Tin Cup oblivious to his
    gaffe.

    And the regulars gather to look out the window --


4   THEIR POV - THROUGH WINDOW                                 4

    To the range, where Molly is stretching and Tin Cup is
    discreetly waving to the regulars to get lost.

                                                   CUT TO:


5   EXT. DRIVING RANGE - NIGHT                                 5

    The lesson begins. Tin Cup can be slightly condescending
    in these situations, though she's got him a little wary.

                            TIN CUP
              The first thing you gotta learn
              about this game, Doc, is it ain't
              about hitting a little white ball
              into some yonder hole. It's about
              inner demons and self-doubt and
              human frailty and overcoming all
              that crap. So... what kinda
              doctor'd you say you were?

                            MOLLY
              I'm a psychologist -- in layman's
              terms call me a neo-Jungian, post-
              modern Freudian, holistic
              secularist.

                               TIN CUP
              Damn.

    She begins unpacking one of her bags, pulling out every
    golf gimmick on the market -- swing aid straps to pull
    your elbows together, a ball pendulum that hangs from
    your hat, a metal contraption for your feet, etc.

                            MOLLY
              Inner demons and human frailty are
              my life's work. I used to
              practice in El Paso but I've moved
              here now...

                               TIN CUP
              What're those?

                            MOLLY
              I ordered these from the Golf
              Channel.

                                                           6.

He stares in disbelief as she tries to wriggle into some
of this stuff. He's enchanted and dismayed.

                        TIN CUP
          That stuff's a waste of money.

                        MOLLY
          I'm sure there are excesses and
          repetitions here, but I believe in
          the gathering of knowledge and I
          figured, well, there must be some
          truths about the golf swing
          illustrated by these devices --
          and that you'd help me sort
          through it.

She stands there with contraptions coming from every
limb.

                        MOLLY
          I have dozens of golf videotapes,
          too... And a golf watch.

                        TIN CUP
                 (irritated, impatient)
          Take it off. All of it. Now!
          You're a smart woman, for
          Chrissakes -- don't you know the
          work of charlatans when you see
          it?

She deposits all the golf gimmick devices in a pile.

                        MOLLY
          No. I can always tell when
          someone is lying to himself, but
          I'm quite susceptible and
          frequently wrong when that person
          lies to me.
                 (pointing to the
                  pile of devices)
          That stuff cost me over 200
          dollars --

                        TIN CUP
          Then it's 200 dollars of shit...

He tees a ball, hands Molly her driver and steps back.

                         TIN CUP
          Go ahead.   Take a swing.

Molly takes a pitty-pat swing and whiffs, and mutters
under her breath with the ease of a longshoreman.

                                                          7.
                        MOLLY
          Aw, fuck...

                        TIN CUP
          Well, you talk like a golfer --

Molly unloads a mighty second swing. The club head
bounces off the mat. The ball sits untouched.

                        MOLLY
          Shit.

                        TIN CUP
          'Fuck...' 'Shit...' these are
          highly technical golf terms and
          you're using them on your first
          lesson -- this is promising.

                        MOLLY
          Awright, wise ass, show me.

Tin Cup takes the club from Molly, motions for her to
step back, tees up a ball, and rockets a drive into the
night.

                        TIN CUP
          Something like that.

He hands her back the club and tees up another ball.
Molly just looks at him.

                        MOLLY
          Impressive. Y'know, I tend to
          process things verbally. Can you
          break down into words how you did
          that?

Tin Cup takes a deep breath -- this is his speech.

                        TIN CUP
          'What is the golf swing?' -- by
          Roy McAvoy.
                 (beat)
          The golf swing is a poem.

                        TIN CUP (CONT'D)
          Sometimes a love sonnet and
          sometimes a Homerian epic -- it is
          organic and of a piece, yet it
          breaks down into elegant stanzas
          and quatrains. The critical
          opening phrase of this song is the
          grip, in which the hands unite to
          form a single unit by the simple
          overlap of the smallest finger...
                 (displays grip)
          ... held lightly, a conductor's

                                         8.
baton.
       (starts swing)
Lowly and slowly the clubhead is
pulled back, led into position
not by the hands but the body
which turns away from the target,
shifting to the right side without
shifting balance. Tempo is
everything, perfection unobtainable,
as the body coils, now to the top
of the swing, in profound equilibrium.
And then a slight hesitation, a nod
to the gods...

              MOLLY
A nod to the gods?

              TIN CUP
To the gods, yes... that he is
fallible. As the weight shifts
back to the left pulled now by
powers inside the earth -- it's
alive, this swing, a living
sculpture -- and down through
contact, always down, into terra
firma, striking the ball crisply
-- with character -- a tuning
fork goes off in your heart, your
balls -- such a pure feeling is
the well-struck golf shot -- And
then the follow through to finish,
always on line -- The reverse 'C'
of the Golden Bear, the steelworker's
power and brawn of Carl Sandburg's
Arnold Palmer, the da Vinci of
Hogan, the unfinished symphony of
Roy McAvoy.

                MOLLY
What?    What's unfinished?

              TIN CUP
I have a short follow through --
my swing can look unfinished.

                MOLLY
Why?

              TIN CUP
Some say it's because that's the
best way to play through the winds
of West Texas... and some say it's
because I never finish anything.
You can decide. The point is every
finishing position is unique as if
that is the signature left to the
artist, the warrior athlete who,

                                                       9.
          finally and thereby, has asserted
          his oneness with and power over the
          universe by willing a golf ball to
          go where he wants and how and when,
          because that is what the golf swing
          is about...
                 (finally)
          It is about gaining control of
          your life, and letting go at the
          same time.

Molly stares back, exhausted and intrigued.

                           MOLLY
          Jeez Louise...

                        TIN CUP
          There is only one other acceptable
          theory of how to hit a golf ball.

                        MOLLY
          I'm afraid to ask. What's the
          other theory?

                        TIN CUP
          Grip it and rip it.

                        MOLLY
          While I appreciate your poetic
          sensibility, Mr. McAvoy --

                        TIN CUP
          Call me Roy, Molly...

                        MOLLY
          Call me Dr. Griswold...

                        MOLLY (CONT'D)
          Roy... but at this point I think
          I'm more of the 'grip it and rip
          it' school. Hand me the driver.

Tin Cup does.   She tees it up.

                         TIN CUP
          Waggle it, Doc, don't forget to
          waggle.
                  (as she stares at
                   him)
          Waggle... the club head...
                  (shows her)
          ... it's a little relaxing
          ritual...

She waggles the club head, then takes the club back.

                                                             10.
                        TIN CUP
          Let the Big Dog eat!

She stops, lets the club fall.

                          MOLLY
          What Big Dog?

                        TIN CUP
          The driver, the number one wood --

                          MOLLY
          It's metal.

                        TIN CUP
          Yeah, woods are metal -- don't
          worry about it -- and the driver's
          known as the Big Dog and I'm just
          saying to turn him loose, let 'er
          rip, let the Big Dog eat!

                          MOLLY
          Oh.

She swings.   Tops the ball.   It goes ten feet.

                        MOLLY
          This is, without a doubt, the
          stupidest, silliest, most idiotic
          grotesquery masquerading as a game
          that has ever been invented.

                        TIN CUP
                 (cheerfully)
          Yes, ma'am, that's why I love it.
                 (beat)
          And if you hit one good shot -- if
          that tuning fork rings in your
          loin -- you can't wait to get
          back.

She cracks one dead solid perfect out into the night.   It
felt great and she knows it.

                        MOLLY
          I think the Big Dog ate something.

                        TIN CUP
          Did the tuning fork ring in your
          loin?

                        MOLLY
          I wouldn't go that far.

                        TIN CUP
          Always quit on a good shot. We'll
          call that lesson number one...

                 (confidentially)
          ... and if ya wouldn't mind paying
          me in cash -- there's a little
          I.R.S. situation I'm dealing with
          --

                        MOLLY
          If you're such a legendary striker
          of the golf ball as everyone says,
          then why are you, at your age, out
          here in the middle of nowhere
          operating a barely solvent
          establishment, ducking the I.R.S.,
          collecting a few pathetic dollars
          to buy your next sixpack -- when
          you're capable of so much more?

Her speech is delivered without judgement or rancor, so
matter of factly that he's disarmed.

                        TIN CUP
          Perhaps I'm chocked full of inner
          demons?

                        MOLLY
          No, you're chocked full of
          bullshit --
                 (cheerily)
          Same time next week?

She heads off to the parking lot.    He stares.

                        TIN CUP
          What did you mean I should try
          'being saddled' sometime?

                        TIN CUP (CONT'D)
          Were you being literal or was that
          some kind of Freudian type deal?
          Molly? Doctor?
                 (beat)
          What kind of saddle?


CLOSE ON MOLLY

As she walks into the West Texas night.    She smiles,
enjoying Tin Cup's confusion.

Tin Cup just stares into the night, holding his cash, until
JOSE'S VOICE ECHOES down from the roof.

                         JOSE

          I said get even, Pod. I didn't
          say shoot the wad. We better see
          that three dog rolling on his ass.

All eyes on the monitor -- the dogs break.

                        EARL
          Except... if he breaks slow, he
          won't get creamed...

The starting box opens -- "THERE GOES THE RABBIT" -- the
three dog breaks slow and trails down the front stretch.

          Three dog's dying, T.C.... easy

The one dog veers wide, going into the escape turn,
annihilating the field. Dogs fly ass over teakettle
like bowling pins, and --

                        REGULARS
          Uh-oh.

The three dog clears the pileup, untouched, hugging the
rail. It has a ten length lead as it moves down the
backstretch and past the toteboard. The race is over --
the three dog wins.

Deathly silence. Somebody flips OFF the TV. Finally,
in a lame attempt to lighten the moment, Romeo speaks --

                        ROMEO
          So, Roy, you were saying you
          felt a little flutter for this

                                NAKED DANCER
               Tin Cup!     Hi, sweetie!

                             TIN CUP
               Hiya, honey -- lookin' sweet...

     And backstage they go, easily waved through by another
     bouncer. They come up to a dressing room door. And
     knock.

     A voice from inside.

                             VOICE (O.S.)
               That better be you, Roy.


10   TIN CUP AND ROMEO                                           10

     enter this holy of holies with complete familiarity. And
     there she is -- DOREEN, 35, at least, the classic chesty,
     hippie, big-wigged Texas goddess. She's older than the
     other girls, and more experienced in every way. She's
     smoking a cigarette and finishing up the touches on her
     stripper's outfit.

     Tin Cup and Romeo stand at her beckoning.

                                TIN CUP
               Doreen...

                             ROMEO
               You're looking particularly
               lovely this evening -- This is
               nicer than the leopard suit --

                             DOREEN
               Cut the horseshit, guys. So...
               the one and two dogs always run
               wide and the three dog always
               breaks slow, so I figure there's
               gonna be a big ol' pile of fur at
               the turn and the three dog's
               gonna tiptoe around it and walk
               on home... I was right.
                      (smiles)
               You owe me twelve thousand
               dollars.

                             ROMEO
               We going to pay you.

                                                              16.

Tin Cup squirms as Doreen babbles a bit.

                        DOREEN
          I know you're going to pay me.

                        DOREEN (CONT'D)
                 (admiring her own
                  outfit)
          Y'know I finally got rid of the
          leopard suit thing -- it was so
          retro, y'know... it's not easy
          being a post-modern stripper...
                 (beat)
          So... twelve big ones?

Tin Cup finally digs into his coat pocket and produces
some official-looking papers. He hands them to her.

                        TIN CUP
          There. With equity and inventory
          it's worth twelve grand... more or
          less.

Doreen leans forward to examine the papers.    She looks at
Tin Cup with surprise.

                         DOREEN
          This is how you think you can
          settle up? By deeding me your
          driving range?

                        TIN CUP
          Only on condition you don't sell
          right away, and me'n Romeo keep
          our jobs.

                        DOREEN
          What in the world would I want
          with your stupid driving range?

                        TIN CUP
          Equity, inventory, cash flow...
          not to mention an enhanced stature
          in the community, and prepaid
          membership in the Salome Chamber
          of Commerce.

For a moment, Doreen can only stare dumbly at Tin Cup,
caught off guard by this unexpected turn of fortune. Then
she starts to consider the idea more seriously.

                        DOREEN
          What are your labor costs?
                 (off no response
                  from Tin Cup)
          Payroll, Roy. What do you pay

                                                                17.
               your help?

                             TIN CUP
               Let's see... the tractor kid gets
               five bucks an hour. Romeo, he
               gets ten cash --

                             DOREEN
               What do you pay yourself?

                                TIN CUP
               Myself?

     Doreen nods in a way Tin Cup finds threatening.

                             DOREEN
               To hit golf balls all day... when
               you're not breaking for beers or
               corn dogs or to gather the guys
               and lay bets on which crow flies
               off the fence next.

                             TIN CUP
               You're referring to my managerial
               salary?

                             DOREEN
               I'm referring to every nickel you
               snatch out of the till and every
               bag of beer nuts you lift from the
               rack, is what I'm referring to.
                      (beat)
               I'll say it's worth ten and you
               still owe me two.

     She smiles, he sighs.

                                                    CUT TO:


11   EXT. PAWN SHOP - MORNING                                   11

     Tin Cup parks his big old red Cadillac convertible out
     front. He goes around to the trunk, opens it, takes out
     his golf clubs, and carries them into the pawn shop.

                                                    CUT TO:


12   EXT. DRIVING RANGE - RIDGE - PARKED WINNEBAGO - MORNING    12

     Tin Cup's domicile, parked near a slow-moving river. The
     red Cadillac is parked out front next to Romeo's Mercury
     Comet.

                                ROMEO (V.O.)

                        the Winnebago)
                You hocked your golf clubs?!


A13   INT. WINNEBAGO - DAY                                      A13

      Tin Cup sits on the couch, swigging Maalox.

                              TIN CUP
                I still got two grand to pay off.
                And I can't see my new salary of
                seven bucks an hour plus lessons
                getting it done.

                              ROMEO
                But your clubs are your livelihood.

                              TIN CUP
                Well the hood ain't too lively at
                the moment.

      A CAR HORN SOUNDS from outside.

                              TIN CUP
                Whoever it is, tell 'em I'm in
                Houston on business.

      Romeo opens the door, and steps outside.

                               ROMEO
                David Simms!   What you doing in
                town?

      Romeo steps outside to greet Simms.   Warily.

                                                      CUT TO:


13    EXT. WINNEBAGO - DAY                                      13

      Romeo and Simms under the awning.   A spiffy new car
      parked nearby.

      DAVID SIMMS, 38, looking every bit like the successful
      tour pro he is... Payne Stewart to Tin Cup's Maynard G.
      Krebs.

                              SIMMS
                Romeo! It's been awhile.    Is
                Tin Cup around?

      Romeo is evasive.

                              ROMEO
                He's on business in Houston... You
                supposed to be out playin' on the
                golf tour.

                                                           19.

                        SIMMS
                 (unfazed)
          Well, you tell him I'm in town for
          my big charity best-ball
          tournament, and I got a spot for
          him when he comes back from...
          whatever.

                        ROMEO
          You got a spot for Tin Cup?   I
          thought you hated him.

                        SIMMS
          Romeo! You wound me. I'm fond
          of the guy, going way back to our
          days at University of Houston,
          when we won all those titles
          together.

                        ROMEO
          He says he carried you on his
          back.

Simms won't be drawn into this adolescent competition --
he's too comfortable with himself and his success.

                        SIMMS
          I didn't have much craft back
          then -- just a little native
          ability. Roy's a great ball-
          striker....

                          ROMEO
          Why you here?

                        SIMMS
          I want to win my own tournament,
          and he can help me if we can
          manage to behave like grownups
          together. Tell him that.

Tin Cup suddenly appears in the doorway.

                        TIN CUP
          What's the catch?

                        SIMMS
          There is no catch. I put together
          a tournament with an elite field
          and a half-million dollar purse,
          and I'm tired of seeing all the
          money head out of town.

                        TIN CUP
          Then make more birdies.

                                                            20.
                        SIMMS
          I need you on my team.

                        TIN CUP
          You ain't that friendly a guy...

                         SIMMS
          We're playing Cottonwood where you
          once shot fifty-nine, where you
          can shoot sixty-five in your sleep
          'cuz you know every bump on every
          fairway, every subtle break on
          every green --

                        TIN CUP
                 (warily)
          You an' me --

                        SIMMS
          Me an' you -- like the old days.

Tin Cup can't quite believe this offer from his old
nemesis but there aren't many options out there. He
grabs Simms's hand and starts pumping it, gushing
with enthusiasm.

                        TIN CUP
          ... Well, put 'er there, partner!
          These two homeboys are gonna show
          the world what golf in West Texas
          is all about!

                        SIMMS
          No, Roy. I didn't mean I want you
          to play with me. I just want you
          to caddie for me, read my putts,
          club me, that kinda stuff.

Tin Cup wilts like a time-lapsing daisy.   His hand falls
free of Simms's. Words fail him.

                        ROMEO
          You son of a bitch.

                        TIN CUP
                 (to himself, blankly)
          Caddie? Me?

                        SIMMS
          I can't bring a guy in off the
          street to play in my tournament.
          It's a big-time event, corporate
          sponsors, thirty dollar tickets...
          I got a network to cover --

                        ROMEO
                 (interrupting,

                                                                   21.
                       outraged)
               This guy off the street, he could
               kick your ass on that golf course.
               Like he kicked your ass in junior
               golf. Like he kicked your ass in
               college. Like --

                             SIMMS
               I'll pay you a hundred for the
               loop, five percent of any
               earnings --

                             ROMEO
               Get the hell outta here! Take
               your goddamn color coordinated
               corporate sponsored soul and get
               outta here.

                             SIMMS
               Okay, okay, just thought I'd offer
               you some work...

     Simms heads to his car.

                                  TIN CUP
               Simms!

                                  SIMMS
                        (stops)
               What?

                             TIN CUP
               I'll take the job.

                             ROMEO
               We'll take the job.

     Simms nods in agreement, and exits.    Tin Cup stands there
     with Romeo, feeling humiliated.

      BILLY MAYFAIR putts out on the 16th green to polite
      applause.

      The two twosomes tee off and the caddies follow,

15    EXT. COTTONWOOD - 16TH FAIRWAY - DAY                       15

      A leader board reads:   SIMMS/STADLER -10, MICKELSON/
      MCCORD -8.

      A giant gallery lines the fairway and rings the distant
      green which is fronted by a lake, as:

      STADLER hits a three wood toward the green -- the BALL
      PLUNKS in the middle of the lake. The GALLERY GROANS.

      Stadler just shrugs to Simms, as if to say, "I thought I
      had enough club."

                              SIMMS
                Like I told you, it was more'n
                you had in the bag.

                              STADLER
                Yeah, well... I had to go for it
                after your caddy said he could
                get home from here.

      Simms swivels his head around to look at Tin Cup.

                               TIN CUP
                I could.

      Simms looks away, at the shot he's facing: a two hundred
      fifteen yard carry over water. He looks back at Tin Cup,
      shaking his head.

                              SIMMS
                I gotta hand it to you, Roy. For
                fifteen holes you've seemed to
                grasp the concept here: I'm
                trying to win and your job is to
                help me.

                                                            23.
                        TIN CUP
          Five percent of your earnings does
          numb the gag reflex.

                        SIMMS
          Give me the seven iron.   I'm
          laying up.

                        TIN CUP
          You can make that shot.

                        SIMMS
          The smart play's to lay up.

                        TIN CUP
          These fans didn't pay thirty bucks
          to watch a tour star lay up on a
          short par five.

                        SIMMS
          I'm sitting on a two shot lead
          with three to go, and my partner's
          in his pocket. Suddenly, par's a
          good number. Gimme the seven
          Iron.

                        TIN CUP
          No way. You're going for the
          green. These fans paid good money
          to see golf shots they can't hit,
          not golf shots they feel shitty
          about themselves for having to
          hit.

Simms reaches for the seven iron.   Tin Cup clamps a hand
over the club.

                        TIN CUP
          Thirteen years on tour and you're
          still a pussy. Hit the fucking
          one iron, Dave.

                        SIMMS
          Thirteen years in a driving range
          and you still think this game's
          about your testosterone count.

Simms removes Tin Cup's hand from the seven iron and
grabs the club, stepping up to address the ball. Tin Cup
mutters to the gallery.

                        TIN CUP
          Two-fifteen to carry, and the tour
          star's laying up.

And the remark summons gallery voices suddenly urging
Simms to go for the green. Simms motions for Tin Cup, as

                                                               24.
     if reconsidering.

                             SIMMS
               But if you're gonna editorialize,
               do it on the other side of the
               ropes. I got no qualms about
               firing your ass right here, right
               now.

                              TIN CUP
               Fire me?   Hell, I should fire you.

     Simms steps back to his ball with the seven iron, and:


16   Stadler's still standing back where he hit the shot into  16
     the lake. MICKELSON and GARY McCORD, the other team in
     the pairing, are there with him. Romeo, Stadler's caddie,
     stands just behind them.

                              McCORD
                      (to Mickelson)
               I know you could knock it on from
               here, I'm just saying that caddie's
               been drinking muddy water if he
               thinks he can.

                               ROMEO
               He can.

     All the players look at Romeo as:

     Simms dumps his seven iron shot safely down in front of
     the water to a smattering of polite applause.

     Simms tosses the club back to his bag as Tin Cup
     retrieves the divot. And:

                              STADLER
               Hey, Dave!   We in a hurry?

     Simms looks several yards back where Stadler is still
     standing with McCord and Mickelson.

                             STADLER
               'Cause I just bet McCord and
               Mickelson that your caddie could
               knock it on from here.

                             SIMMS
               We're trying to win a tournament,
               pardo.

                               STADLER
               I know.    But I'm getting five to
               one.

                                                                  25.

17   EXT. TV TOWER                                                17

     The ANNOUNCER from the GOLF CHANNEL looks at the monitor
     where a hand-held camera is picking up Stadler motioning
     Tin Cup over.

                              GOLF CHANNEL ANNOUNCER
               From two-fifty from a snarly lie,
               over water, on national TV, with
               no warmup... I'd give ten to one
               to a tour pro.


18   BACK TO COURSE                                               18

     Stadler, McCord, and Mickelson are smiling at the bet.


     This is golf. But Simms snarls at being challenged.
     Stadler drops a ball in the rough for Tin Cup to hit.

                              STADLER
               Here ya go.   Take a hack at it.

                             SIMMS
               Balls versus brains, Roy. You
               hit that shot, just keep walking,
               'cuz your ass is fired.

     Tin Cup mulls over the warning, as:

                               STADLER, McCORD, MICKELSON
               Come on, Roy!    Your fans are
               calling!

     Stadler waves his arms to summon a cheer from the gallery.
     Tin Cup puts down Simms's golf bag.

                             TIN CUP
               How you gonna fire me in front of
               all these people? Especially when
               I knock it on the green.

     And he heads over to where Stadler and the others stand
     waiting.


19   OMITTED                                                      19

     PETER KOSTIS, with a hand mike, following the group,
     begins to describe the extraordinary event unfolding.

                             KOSTIS
                      (on mike)
               It seems like the Charity
               Tournament is taking a little

                                                               26.
               break for a side bet, here --

     Gary McCord moves toward the camera and takes the
     microphone.

                             McCORD
               Peter, I've done a little
               background here -- this unfolding
               disaster's a driving range pro
               named Roy McAvoy, who everyone
               calls Tin Cup. Locals claim he
               he was a pretty good college lick
               and knocked around the mini-tours...

20   Tin Cup steps up to hit the shot.   McCord lowers his     20
     voice.

                             McCORD
               ... but I guarantee you, he's
               about to suffer brain arrest.
               He's thinking about the cameras
               and the gallery and the water, and
               all that gray matter between his
               ears is turning to goo... and
               incidentally, Stadler's got it booked
               at ten to one...

     Tin Cup swings, and:

21   The CAMERA PICKS UP the ball arching high and true off  21
     the club. It lands on the green. The CROWD ROARS... and
     the roar becomes deafening as the ball rolls three feet
     from the pin.

                             KOSTIS AND McCORD
               He's not that good... he's
               definitely not that good... (etc.)


22   BACK TO the course -- a scuffle's breaking out.           22

     David Simms helping some guy over the gallery rope.
     Simms walks the guy back to his golf bag... and now Tin
     Cup understands what's happening, and:

                             SIMMS
               Take a hike, Roy -- the loop's
               over.

                             TIN CUP
               You can't fire me. How can you
               fire me? I just knocked it stiff
               from two fifty. Gimme that bag.

     Tin Cup reaches for the bag. The guy holds onto it.
     They wrestle briefly, as Simms sighs with fatigue and
     looks for a marshal.

                                                                 27.

                               SIMMS
               Security!

     Tin Cup gives up wrestling when he sees a couple marshals
     approaching. He turns his anger on Simms.

                             TIN CUP
               What about my money?

                             SIMMS
               You just hit the shot that took
               you out of the money. Welcome to
               life on the tour.

     Tin Cup goes after the bag again. The guy still hangs
     on. The marshals arrive, and begin to wrestle with Tin
     Cup. He goes berserk... a WWF battle royal.

                                                     CUT TO:


23   INT. DRIVING RANGE BAR - CLOSE ON TELEVISION - NIGHT        23

     Sports highlights.    Introducing "Sports Machine" with
     George Michaels...

               And finally Sports Machine brings
               you a bizarre incident...

     A brief highlight of Tin Cup, going crazy, wrestling with
     the marshals and replacement caddie.

                             GEORGE MICHAELS (V.O.)
               Driving range pro, Roy `Tin Cup'
               McAvoy...

     MALE LAUGHTER greets the shot, and:

                               EARL (O.S.)
               Hey, Tin Cup!    You made the news!


     WIDER

     The Regulars crowd under the TV on the wall above the
     till, hooting at what they just saw. Tin Cup is nowhere
     in sight.


24   INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT                                      24

     Romeo scoops balls into wire buckets from the garbage can
     of water where the balls are washing. Tin Cup sits on a
     bench, alternately swigging cheap whiskey and Maalox.

                                                         28.
                        TIN CUP
          If I had it all to do over, I'd
          still hit that shot.

                        ROMEO
                 (nods with neither
                  rancor nor irony)
          The look comes over your face, you
          would bury yourself alive to prove
          you can handle a shovel.

Tin Cup looks over at Romeo for signs of an implied
pejorative. But Romeo's just washing and scooping
balls... and looking badly in need of perspective.

                        TIN CUP
          You know why I'd still hit that
          shot?

Now Romeo looks over... and he decides that Tin Cup is
the one in need of perspective.

                        ROMEO
          'Cuz it's the only way you can
          beat David Simms. 'Cuz you never
          got over that he is on tour and
          you are not. 'Cuz you get that
          look on your face...

                        TIN CUP
          No...
                 (pauses, adding
                  weight to his
                  thoughts)
          I'd hit it again because that shot
          was a defining moment. And when a
          defining moment comes along you
          define the moment or the moment
          defines you. I did not shrink
          from the challenge. I rose to it.

Romeo nods, holding his peace.

                        ROMEO
          1981, Fort Washington Golf Club,
          Fresno, California, final round of
          the Tour Qualifying School...

Tin Cup cringes at the memory, then moves for the high
ground.

                        TIN CUP
          I was playing to win.

                        ROMEO
          A defining moment when you tried
          to hit the same impossible cut

                                                               29.
               three wood into the wind from a
               hilly lie -- four in a row out of
               bounds -- until you finally pulled
               it off and tapped in for a
               thirteen.
                      (beat)
               When a twelve woulda got you on
               the tour! That was a defining
               moment and the definition was
               shit!

                             TIN CUP
               Greatness courts failure, Romeo.
               That's why most people, in their
               whole lives, never ever reach for
               the brass ring, never know when to
               dig deep and try for the
               impossible shot...

                             ROMEO
               You're right about that, boss, but
               sometimes... sometimes... par is
               good enough to win.

     Tin Cup tosses down another Maalox cocktail.

26   INT. GOLDEN TASSEL - NIGHT                                26

     Doreen dances in a yellow rose outfit, a more classic
     strip look than her protegees.


     CLOSE ON ROW OF DOLLAR BILLS

     held aloft by the eager locals in the front row... and
     then a handful of papers held aloft by one Roy McAvoy,
     also in the front row.

     Doreen dances over and picks the papers from his hand,
     reading them as she dances.

               The DieHard/West Texas Calcutta,

                        TIN CUP
          It's a business proposition. I'm
          offering you my winnings from all
          them tournaments this summer.

                        DOREEN
          In exchange for what?

                        TIN CUP
          My driving range back.

She dances away from him, not exactly sold on the idea.

She dances back to him, reclines a leg on the partition,
and moves her face opposite his.

                         DOREEN
          Roy, I'm not as dumb as my hair
          makes me look.

                        TIN CUP
          They ain't all strictly minor
          league. One of 'em pays almost
          two grand!

She twirls off.    He chases her, beer and entries in hand.

                        TIN CUP
          Now wait, Doreen. You gotta do
          the math, and you gotta look at
          how good I'm playing. I hit the
          shot of the tournament at the
          best-ball. They put it on
          national TV.

                          DOREEN
          I saw.

                        TIN CUP
          And what does that tell you?

The MUSIC comes to an END.   The club is momentarily
silent.

                        TIN CUP
                 (shouting)
          And what does that tell you?

                        DOREEN
          It tells me you took an
          unauthorized day off. Next time
          it happens, you're fired. In the
          meantime, I'm putting in a time
          clock.

                        TIN CUP
          I'm not punching in no time

     Tin Cup punches the new time clock which is located
     under the awning near the ball wash.

     KACHUNK goes the TIME CLOCK as he hurries outside --


29   EXT. DRIVING RANGE - DAY                                    29

     -- and there he finds Molly, waiting on the tee with her
     driver and a bucket of balls.

                                TIN CUP
               Am I early?

                              MOLLY
               Mr. McAvoy, I can appreciate that
               you have a fairly laid-back,
               relaxed lifestyle -- but I have
               hours to keep.

               fluid sense of time to being born
               under the sign of Pisces --
               something about floating through
               the universe --

     He tees a ball for her and steps back.   She's staring at
     him, half-amused.

                             MOLLY
               You amuse me, Roy. But I'm the
               only woman in America born after
               World War II who thinks astrology
               is a crock of shit.

               Waggle.

                             MOLLY
               I'm waggling...

                              TIN CUP
               Set up to the ball like I showed
               you last time.

     Molly addresses the shot.    Her stance is rigid, overly

mechanical.   Tin Cup winces.    But she looks terrific.

                        TIN CUP
          Quit trying to wring that club's
          neck, Molly. Show it a little
          warmth and compassion...

He moves around behind her to reposition her shoulders.

                        TIN CUP
          Remember, this game's about trust
          and touch and letting go. So
          while I'm subtly enhancing your
          technical prospects, why don't you
          tell me all about your personal
          life...

                         MOLLY
          It's none of your fucking
          business, Roy.

Tin Cup's hands move down to square her hips.    He's
discreet and professional.

                        TIN CUP
          Your boyfriend's a golfer --
          that's my bet -- and he's why
          you're taking this game up.
          Hell, I probably even know
          him --

                        SIMMS (O.S.)
          Get your hands off her ass, Roy.

And, as Tin Cup's hands recoil in alarm...

DAVID SIMMS steps onto the range.

                         MOLLY
                 (to Simms)
          Hi, sweetie...

A killer smile. The man is absolutely at ease with his

     A shadow paces across the drape in the lighted window.

               He's taking her to Miami for the

               to compete with that?


31   INT. WINNEBAGO - NIGHT                                   31

     Romeo ponders Tin Cup's dilemma from the couch.

                             ROMEO
               Man, you are having a bad week.

                             TIN CUP
               She must think I'm such a nothing,
               such a loser... a lousy driving
               range pro living in a Winnebago,
               making five bucks an hour plus
               lessons.

                             ROMEO
               She don't know you live in a
               Winnebago.

                             TIN CUP
               Well, she sure as hell knows I
               ain't taking her to no Doral for
               massages and mimosas all weekend.
               I gotta do something with my life.

     He reflects deeply while Romeo shrugs.

                             TIN CUP
               I gotta rise to a level worthy of
               the women that think I'm a joke.

                             ROMEO
               Well... you could go out and win
               The Open.

                             TIN CUP
                      (pausing, as
                       if jarred)
               Romeo, that idea has promise.

                               ROMEO
               I was joking.

                               TIN CUP
               I ain't.

                                     34.
              ROMEO
We talking about the same
tournament? The U.S. Open? The
Biggest golf tournament in the
world?

              TIN CUP
Not just the biggest golf
Tournament in the world; the most
democratic.

              ROMEO
What do you mean?

              TIN CUP
I mean it's open. Anyone's got a
shot at it. You just gotta get
past a local and a sectional
qualifier, and unlike Doral or
Colonial or the A.T.T., they can't
keep you out. They can't ask you
if you're a garbageman or a bean-
picker or a driving range pro
whose check is signed by a
stripper. You qualify, you're in.

              ROMEO
And then you pay out of your own
pocket to go there and get all
nervous and intimidated --

              TIN CUP
Who's intimidated? I just told
you I'm gonna win the damn thing!

              ROMEO
You don't got the game.

              TIN CUP
I got every shot in the book.

              ROMEO
I said you don't got the game.
The mental game. The head game.

              TIN CUP
You suggesting I err on the side
of excess?

              ROMEO
You always go out to shoot zero.
Sometimes you pull it off. But
you can't play like that at the
Open. You win by taking what the
course gives you. You win by
being humble, which you aren't,
and patient, which you never will

     Tin Cup comes over to the couch, sits down, and puts an
     arm around Romeo.

                             TIN CUP
               Well, since you're the authority,
               How'd you like to teach me how to
               be what I ain't and never will be?

                             ROMEO
               You don't ever listen to me.

                             TIN CUP
               This time'll be different.   I
               promise.

                             ROMEO
               I don't know, man. Right now you
               don't even got the money to get
               your clubs out of hock.

                             TIN CUP
               Yeah, well... my sticks may be in
               a pawn shop, but I got a rake and
               a hoe at the range.

     CLOSE ON TRUCK OF MERCEDES

     The trunk opens. A set of expensive golf clubs is
     removed by a wealthy looking guy, BOONE, 40'S. He
     turns to face Tin Cup and Romeo who is reaching into
     the trunk of Roy's Cadillac.

                             BOONE
               Let me get this straight -- you're
               going to play me for four hundred
               dollars with those?

     Romeo removes an old golf bag from the trunk. It
     contains a rake, a hoe, a baseball bat, and assorted
     garden tools.

                             TIN CUP
               And I'll give ya two a side... I
               got the title to my car as
               collateral.

               I'm not interested in that piece
               of shit.

                              TIN CUP
               That's cuz you think of it as
               transportation, Boone. Think of
               it as bragging rights. Think of
               yourself sitting around the bar
               crowing to your buddies about the
               Cadillac you won off Tin Cup
               McAvoy.
                       (the real kicker)
               They'll forget all about the
               Winnebago you lost to me.

               No mullies, no gimmes, no bumping

     And he rips a drive down the fairway.

                             BOONE
               Nutted it.

     Tin Cup selects the baseball bat from his golf bag.
     Romeo hands him a pink ball and Tin Cup shows it to
     Boone.

                             TIN CUP
               I'll be playing a Pink Lady today.

               That little pink fag ball supposed
               to rattle me?

     Tin Cup moves over to the tee markers.

                             TIN CUP
               Not unless I knock it by you.

     And he tosses up the Pink Lady and fungoes it long and
     straight down the fairway.

     where Boone has arrived with his caddie at his drive.

                             TIN CUP
               Yep, I caught this thing way the
               Hell on the toe.

     Boone knocks an iron onto the edge of the green.

                             BOONE
               Drive for show, putt for dough, big
               shot.

                             TIN CUP
               Did you hear that, Romeo? Boone
               was being profound! He has
               revealed to me the essential
               mystery of golf! Drive for show,
               putt for dough...

                       a palm)
               Louisville Slugger, please.

     Boone's a little rattled by Tin Cup's insouciance.

                             ROMEO
               You got Boone shakin' already --

                      (calling his shot)
               Front left bunker -- plugged lie.

     He tosses up the ball and fungoes a lazy fly ball.

35   EXT. MESQUITE 1ST GREEN AND SAND TRAP - DAY                 35

     Boone gazes with malicious delight at Tin Cup's ball,
     buried in the front left bunker. He watches Tin Cup take
     the hoe from Romeo and move down into the trap.

                             BOONE
               I want to see a legitimate swing.
               No scooping.

     Tin Cup holds up a hand like a gallery marshal requesting
     silence.

                                TIN CUP
               Stand, please.     Gallery, please,
               stand.

                                                                 38.
     He addresses the ball, choking down on the hoe,
     positioning the blade at an odd angle. He hacks at the
     ball with an unorthodox chopping motion. The ball pops
     up in the air, lands on the green, releases and rolls up
     a foot from the hole.

     Boone's jaw drops. Tin Cup hit an impossible shot with
     utter ease and facility.

                              TIN CUP
               I'll finish.

     Tin Cup trades Romeo the shovel for the rake, takes the
     pin out of the hole, and pool cues the putt home. Par.
     Boone looks at his own sixty-foot putt and he knows he's
     just been had... utterly, embarrassingly, and thoroughly.

     Without a word he counts four hundred dollars from his
     roll and drops it on the green.

                             BOONE
               Get the hell off my course.


38   EXT. PAWN SHOP - DAY                                        38

     Tin Cup and Romeo emerge, Romeo carrying T.C.'s sticks.

                             TIN CUP
               Listen, swami, your job is to
               teach me patience and humility,
               not to advise me on my love life.

                             ROMEO
               No. My job is to get your head
               straight so you can qualify for
               The Open, much less win it. To
               get your head straight you got to
               forget about the doctor lady.

     They head up the street under a collonade toward Tin
     Cup's waiting Caddy.

                             TIN CUP
               Not all my thinking occurs below
               the belt. I actually stand for a
               few things beside where my next
               romantic interlude is coming from.

                             ROMEO
               Then you got no problem telling
               the doctor lady you can't teach
               her no more till after the Open.

     Tin Cup blinks silently a moment, feeling slightly cornered.

                                                              39.
                             TIN CUP
               That would make an issue of
               something that ain't an issue.
               Besides, I'm focused.

     Romeo responds with a Spanish curse.

                             TIN CUP
               I mean, this is my quest!

                             ROMEO
               Ahhh... your quest... chingaso...

                             TIN CUP
               This is where I stand up for all
               the little guys everywhere who've
               had their fill of soulless robots
               like David Simms --

                             ROMEO
               He may be a soulless robot but
               he's a rich, happy soulless robot
               with a beautiful doctor lady
               girlfriend who's got you by the
               huevos --
                      (beat)
               Besides, how is getting into the
               U.S. Open gonna change what she
               thinks about you?

                             TIN CUP
               It'll prove to her that I'm not
               who she thinks I am.

                             ROMEO
               But you are who she thinks you
               are! Look, I don't bet on a
               horse with a hard-on.

                             TIN CUP
               Hard-on?! Hard-on?! Hard-on?!
               Here, touch me, feel --
                      (as Tin Cup grabs
                       himself)
               I don't feel nothing! Here!

                             ROMEO
                      (embarrassed)
               Hey, hey... shit... cool it...


39   Suddenly a convertible passes -- Simms and Molly,        39
     laughing, carefree, enjoying each other. The couple in
     the car doesn't see Tin Cup grabbing his crotch making
     a fool of himself on the sidewalk -- but Tin Cup and
     Romeo see them.

                                                                40.
     The car disappears down the street. Tin Cup cools off,
     chilled, really -- and full of chagrin.

                             TIN CUP
               Okay, okay... maybe I got a semi.

                                                      CUT TO:


40   INT. GOLDEN TASSEL - DOREEN'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT        40

     Doreen's on the phone, between shows, and is adamant.

                             DOREEN
               I cannot give you time off to win
               The Open. I don't care if it's
               your 'quest'...
                      (listens)
               ... or your 'destiny'...
                      (listens)
               ... or any of those terms you
               vaguely remember from your Cliff
               Notes...
                      (listens)
               You shoulda treated me nicer when
               we were an item -- then maybe I
               wouldn't be such a nasty boss.
               G'bye, Roy -- I have a business to
               run.

     She hangs up and heads out on stage as the music calls.

                                                      CUT TO:


41   INT. DRIVING RANGE - NIGHT                                 41

     Tin Cup hangs up the phone and turns to Romeo.

                             TIN CUP
               Man, ever since I let her dump my
               ass she just can't resist kicking
               me in it.

                             ROMEO
               Maybe you should treat her more
               like a lady.

                             TIN CUP
               After she ran off with that Dallas
               banker?

                             ROMEO
               She did that after you let her
               dump you. It wouldn't kill you
               just once to tell her she's
               beautiful, she can dance, she's

                                                        41.
           sexy.

                         TIN CUP
           Romeo... are you sweet on Doreen?

                         ROMEO
           No more'n you are for that doctor
           lady.

A couple of deep sighs.   Two losers with fluttering
hearts.

                         TIN CUP
           Great, Romeo, just great... just
           when I need you to be my friend
           and coach, you go get all gooey
           about one of my ex-girlfriends
           who just happens to be our boss.

                         ROMEO
           Anybody comes to me for help on
           their love life about women is
           already too far gone.

                          TIN CUP
           I don't recall asking you for
           advice.
                   (beat)
           Women are tougher to figure out
           than a feathered one iron from a
           tight lie --

Suddenly a golf image relaxes them into their comfort
zone.

                         ROMEO
           Actually if you open the club face
           a hair and play it off your back
           foot --

                         TIN CUP
           Shut up, Romeo... I wasn't really
           seeking golf tips...

                         ROMEO
           It's all I'm good for -- but you
           can count on me for that, at
           least.

                         TIN CUP
           How far off the back foot?

                         ROMEO
           'Bout three balls...

Silence.   Golf is so much easier than life.

                                                                 42.

                I'm ready to charge forth in
                pursuit of my mythic destiny and I
                can't get time off work to do it.

                               ROMEO
                I'm no expert, but it seems to me
                that the `pursuit of a person's
                mythic destiny' is not the sort of
                thing that a person needs to get
                off a five dollar an hour job in
                order to do...

                              TIN CUP
                I'm stuck. Buried. My life's a
                plugged lie in a kakuyi bunker
                with a tight pin position on a
                green with a stimp meter reading
                of thirteen.
                       (beat)
                I need help. I need advice. I
                need counsel...
                       (beat)
                I need a shrink.

                              ROMEO
                You don't know no shrinks.

                              TIN CUP
                I know one.

                              ROMEO
                Not the doctor lady?

                              TIN CUP
                Why not?

                              ROMEO
                You can't ask advice about the
                woman you're trying to hose from
                the woman you're trying to hose!

                              TIN CUP
                Hose?! Hose?! Get your mouth
                outta the gutter! This is a
                matter of the heart!

A42   EXT. MAIN STREET (SALOME) - DAY                            A42

      Tin Cup's Caddy pulls up and   he gets out, goes to the
      front of a store that is now   a health services office.
      He looks around warily -- as   if someone might see him
      entering such a place -- and   ducks inside.

                                                                 43.
                                                     CUT TO:


B42   INT. SMALL ROOM - DAY                                      B42

      It's the exit, "cool down" room, not the waiting room.

      Tin Cup sits nervously, he's slightly overdressed for
      the occasion. He looks childlike.

      The door to the inner office opens -- a woman comes out
      and sits down across from him. She's weeping
      uncontrollably. He stares. He fidgets. He's nervous,
      out of place.

      Finally Molly enters through the same door because she
      hears the crying. She sees Tin cup -- an awkward moment,
      then --

                              TIN CUP
                I didn't do anything!

                              MOLLY
                I know... I know... wait in there.

      Tin Cup slips into the main office while Molly consoles
      the weeping woman.

                                                     CUT TO:


42    INT. MOLLY'S OFFICE - FEW BEATS LATER - DAY                42

      Tin Cup is dutifully lying on the couch because he
      heard that's what you do. He stares at the ceiling.
      Molly enters and sits down.

                              MOLLY
                Roy... are you okay?

                              TIN CUP
                I need therapy.

                                 MOLLY
                Obviously.

                              TIN CUP
                What do I do? I mean... to do it
                ... therapy... I mean, how do I
                start doing... it.

                              MOLLY
                In parlance you might understand,
                just kick back and let the Big Dog
                eat.

      He sighs and plunges in.

                                     44.

               TIN CUP
Okay, okay, let 'er rip...
        (deep breath)
Suppose there's this guy. He's
standing on the shore of a big,
wide river. And the river's fulla
all manner of disaster, like
alligators and piranhas and
currents and eddies, and most
people won't even go down there to
dip a toe. But on the other side
of the river's a million dollars,
and on this side of the river
there's a rowboat. I guess my
question's this: What would
possess the guy on shore to swim
for it?

                 MOLLY
He's an idiot.

              TIN CUP
No. He's a hell of a swimmer,
see. His problem's more like...
why's he always gotta rise to the
challenge?

              MOLLY
He's a juvenile idiot.

              TIN CUP
You don't understand what I mean
by the river.

              MOLLY
We're talking about you and what
you like to call your inner
demons, Roy, that human frailty
you like to blather about, not
some mytho-poetic metaphor you
come up with in a feeble and
transparent effort to do yourself
credit.

              TIN CUP
Y'mean you're gonna make me feel
lousy? I came here to feel better
-- what kinda therapy is this?

              MOLLY
You don't have any inner demons.
What you have is inner crapola,
inner debris -- garbage, loose
wires, horseshit in staggering
amounts.

                                     45.
              TIN CUP
I ain't just some jerk driving-
range pro who drinks too much
booze and eats too few vegetables.

              MOLLY
You're being defensive -- cut to
the chase and tell me why you're
here.

              TIN CUP
Well... I'm smitten with a woman.

               MOLLY
That's good.   Is she smitten with
you?

               TIN CUP
Not yet.

              MOLLY
Have you asked her out?

              TIN CUP
She's seeing a guy. I don't know
how serious it is, but the guy's a
real horse's ass, in my opinion...

              MOLLY
If you shared your heart with this
woman -- maybe asked her out to
dinner -- then it would force
these issues out in the open.

              TIN CUP
I'm afraid she'll say no.

               MOLLY
Ahh... so what you're saying is
that all your speeches about
swimming across the shark infested
waters are really just about your
golf game -- not about your
personal life.

              TIN CUP
Christ, I didn't know we were
gonna get into my personal life!

              MOLLY
This is therapy!

              TIN CUP
Well, jeez, I know, but I didn't
think it was that kind of
therapy...

                                                          46.
                        MOLLY
          What were you expecting?    Ann
          Landers?

                            TIN CUP
          Yeah.

                        MOLLY
          Look, it's rather simple. Those
          risks that you love to take on the
          golf course, the risks you talk so
          passionately and poetically about
          -- you need to apply those risks
          to your personal life with the
          same passion.

                        TIN CUP
          I should ask this woman out.

                            MOLLY
          Yes!

                        TIN CUP
          I should risk coming right over
          the top and snap-hooking it out of
          bounds left.

                            MOLLY
          Yes!

                        TIN CUP
          Risk hitting it a little thin
          and --

                        MOLLY
          For Godsakes, Roy, that's enough!

                            TIN CUP
          Right.   Sorry.

                        MOLLY
          S'okay...
                 (beat)
          Look, just walk up to this woman,
          wherever she is, look her in the
          eye with those big beautiful green
          eyes of yours, let down your guard
          and don't try to be smooth or cool
          or whatever -- just be honest and
          take the risk -- you can do it!

Tin Cup rises with new confidence. He does several deep
breathing exercises, trying to work up the courage. She
stares at him. And he walks right up to her.

                        TIN CUP
          Dr. Griswold -- I think I'm in

                                                       47.
          love with you.

Molly is stunned.

                           MOLLY
          What?!

                        TIN CUP
          From the moment I first saw you I
          knew I was through with bar girls
          and strippers and motorcycle
          chicks, and when you started
          talking I was smitten and I'm
          smitten more every day I think
          about you -- and the fact that
          you know I'm full of crapola
          only makes you more attractive
          to me because usually I can
          bullshit people but I can't
          bullshit you and in addition, most
          women I'm thinking about how to get
          into their pants from Day One but
          with you I'm just thinking about
          how to get into your heart --

Molly was clue-less.   She just stares.

                           MOLLY
          My God...

                         TIN CUP
                 (optimistically,
                   proudly)
          Stunned, eh? So what about dinner
          and we can talk about `us' and if
          we have a future and how to drop
          that horse's ass boyfriend of
          yours --

                        MOLLY
          Roy, slow down --

                        TIN CUP
          Hey! I just hit a eight degree
          driver off a cart path here, I'm
          staring eagle in the face --

                        MOLLY
          This is a terrible mistake!

Tin Cup is knocked off his horse.   Into deep rough.

                        TIN CUP
          I'm acting from the heart so I
          can't make a mistake?! Right?

                                                                 48.
                               MOLLY
                 Wrong.  Aw, shit...
                        (beat)
                 I am one horrible shrink...
                 jeez... I didn't know you were
                 talking about me.

                               TIN CUP
                 Would your advice have been
                 different?

     She's frustrated and at a loss for words.

                               MOLLY
                 Session's over. You better leave.

     Crushed, Tin Cup heads to the door, stops and turns.

                               TIN CUP
                 I'm gonna qualify for the U.S.
                 Open and kick your boyfriend's
                 ass.

                                 MOLLY
                 Please leave.

                               TIN CUP
                 Whatever you think of me, you
                 should know that your boyfriend
                 hates old people, children, and
                 dogs.

     He exits.   She just sits there.

                                                     CUT TO:


43   EXT. DRIVING RANGE - HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT                     43

     The lone figure of Tin Cup stands on a tee, arching SEVEN
     IRONS -- THWOCK! -- into the night, serenaded by CRICKETS
     and the occasional BUG-LIGHT ZAPPING a fly.

     Romeo and the regulars stand behind Tin Cup observing
     approvingly. Tin Cup mutters something with every swing.
     It sounds like he's saying --

                               TIN CUP
                        (just before
                         swinging)
                 Dollar bills...

     Tin Cup hits another shot, totally focused.

                               TIN CUP
                 Dollar bills...

                                                             49.
                        ROMEO
          How'd it go with the doctor lady,
          boss?

                        TIN CUP
          If she was a par three, I'd'a made
          a nine.

                        ROMEO
          Stroke and distance, eh?

                        TIN CUP
                 (nods, deep in
                  concentration)
          Dollar bills...

Romeo backs off to let the man practice, and Clint asks:

                        CLINT
          What's he saying?

                        ROMEO
          Dollar bills. His divots got to
          look like dollar bills. 'Course
          Moe Norman hits divots like bacon
          strips 'cuz he come over the top,
          but that's gettin' too technical
          for you.

Clint turns and nods approvingly to the rest of the
regulars.

                        CLINT
          See that, boys? He's hitting
          dollar bills. Tightening his
          game.

They murmur approval, but Earl catches Clint's eye and
jerks his head at Tin Cup, indicating Clint isn't doing
his job as group spokesman. Clint takes a step forward.

                        CLINT
          Uh, something us shitheels want
          you to know, Tin Cup, is uh, well,
          we been to see Doreen, and we told
          her we'd stage a customer's strike
          if she didn't give you time off to
          win the Open.

This remark penetrates Tin Cup's concentration.   He turns
with a smile to the regulars.

                        TIN CUP
          You perverts did that for me?

                        JOSE
          We believe in you, man.

                                                                    50.

                             EARL
               And if you get past the local
               qualifier, we gonna sponsor you.

     Tin Cup looks at the beaming faces of the regulars and
     smiles broadly.

                              TIN CUP
               Thanks, boys -- a man couldn't
               have better friends. Now move the
               hell back and shut the fuck up.
               You're messing up my
               concentration.

     And with big smiles, they move each other back so as not
     to mess up Tin Cup's concentration. And he pulls out
     another ball, mutters dollar bills, and hits another
     perfect shot.

                                                     DISSOLVE TO:


44   EXT. DRIVING RANGE - NIGHT (LATER)                             44

     Everyone's gone home except Tin Cup, who keeps drilling
     beautiful shots into the Texas night.

                                                     CUT TO:


45   EXT. ADJACENT HIGHWAY - NIGHT                                  45

     A car is parked unnoticed. A figure sits alone, watching
     Tin Cup from a distance. Molly.


     MOLLY'S POV - SOLITARY FIGURE OF TIN CUP

     With his elegant swing,   as graceful as he is crude, a Zen
     ritual. Finally, weary    at last, Tin Cup tosses his club
     in his bag and drags it   toward his ever-present
     Winnebago, which we see   him enter.

                                                     CUT TO:


46   INT. WINNEBAGO - NIGHT                                         46

     He drops his clubs on the couch. The place is a wreck,
     and he collapses in a chair, CRACKING a CAN of cheap
     BEER.

     A KNOCK at the door.   He's startled.

                             TIN CUP
               Debt collection? Process server?

                                                           51.
          Ex-flame? Jesus, I'm clean.
                 (disguises his
                  voice)
          Who is it?

The door opens -- Molly enters. He's surprised but well-
settled into his bath of cynicism.

                        MOLLY
          God, you've got a beautiful
          swing --

                        TIN CUP
          -- And big, beautiful green eyes
          -- I'm a beautiful guy.

                        MOLLY
          I came here to apologize.

                          TIN CUP
          For what?

                         MOLLY
          Well, I counseled you, you did
          exactly what I said, and I just...
          poured cold water over your
          effort.
                  (quickly)
          I didn't get it. I'm a terrible
          shrink, probably... I should've
          never got out of real estate --
          actually I should never have
          left Ohio for that cowboy in
          Armarillo -- have you ever been
          to Amarillo?

                          TIN CUP
          A cowboy?

                        MOLLY
          It's not as romantic when you're
          actually with one -- a wrangler,
          y'know -- so of course the oil
          man in Dallas looked great after
          that -- I don't know what I was
          thinking... That's when I went to
          the gulf and ended up in, well,
          trailer sales and then all those
          condos in Corpus Christi -- the
          bottom fell outta the market and
          I needed a new gig --

                          TIN CUP
          A new gig?

                          MOLLY
          Therapy.    I took all the classes.

                                                            52.
           I'm licensed, y'know.
                  (suddenly dejected)
           Oh God...
                  (reaching into her
                   purse)
           Mind if I smoke?
                  (lights up)
           Anyway, I'm flattered you asked me
           out. I can't accept because I am
           involved with David and I haven't
           seen any evidence that he treats
           old people, kids or dogs badly.

                         TIN CUP
           I got a little carried away, I
           guess. I shoulda just layed up,
           made my par, and moved on.

                         MOLLY
           Look, I want to propose something
           -- as long as you understand this
           is professional -- we're not going
           out together --

                          TIN CUP
           Tee it up.

                         MOLLY
           I can help you with the mental
           aspects of the game. You've got
           Romeo to be your swing doctor, I
           can be your head doctor.

                         TIN CUP
           But you said you were a lousy shrink?

                         MOLLY
           Well, yeah... I'll improve.

                         TIN CUP
           I got no money to pay for you.

                         MOLLY
           I'll trade my services for golf
           lessons and help you through the
           qualifying. If you get into the
           Open, well, you're on your own.

                         TIN CUP
           You'll be with David.

                          MOLLY
           Yeah...

Silence.   A deal.   It's the best they can do.

                                                  CUT TO:

47   EXT. COTTONWOOD - FIRST TEE - MORNING                     47

     Local qualifier. The First Tee of the Local Open
     Qualifier. And the voice of the starter.

                             STARTER (V.O.)
               ... the next group... Roy McAvoy,
               Salome, Texas... who will be
               playing with...

     The regulars applaud and whistle and shout way too many
     "You the man's!" as Tin Cup steps onto the first tee,
     followed by his Sancho Panza, Romeo. Tin Cup is feeling
     on top of the world, at his cocky best.

                             ROMEO
               How ya feelin', boss?

                             TIN CUP
               I'm feelin' like par's a bad
               score, podnuh -- fifty-eight's
               within the realm!

                             ROMEO
               Jesus, the doctor lady's here --


     POV SHOT - MOLLY

     standing not far from the regulars.

                             TIN CUP
               Didn't I tell ya? She's gonna be
               your guru partner. You handle my
               swing mechanics and she handles my
               brain mechanics.

                             ROMEO
               Long as you keep your dick out of
               it --

                             TIN CUP
               Me an' the 'big guy' have an
               understanding. He's gonna lie low
               till I get in the Open -- then...
               then...

                             ROMEO
               The Big Dog'll eat?

                             TIN CUP
               The Big Dog'll hunt, that's for
               sure...

     Tin Cup steps up to the tee, a couple quick limber

                                                            54.
swings, and he tees it up.   As he does, Romeo slips over
to Molly.

                        ROMEO
                 (softly)
          Looks like we partners, Dr. Molly
          --

                        MOLLY
          I just have to help him keep his
          head on straight --

                        ROMEO
          If you can, you be the first.

                        MOLLY
          He does have the occasional
          tendency towards self-destruction
          it seems.

                         ROMEO
          It ain't occasional and it ain't
          no tendency -- it's a fact of life
          that he gonna blow sky high, it's
          just a matter of when and how
          fast can the pieces be put back
          together.
                 (beat)
          Behind that twinkle in his eyes is
          nitroglycerin.

Tin Cup waves and motions to his team.

                        TIN CUP
          Quiet in the gallery! A man's
          trying to do his job.

And Tin Cup uncoils a mighty drive with an elegant
stroke, fully confident and smooth. The gallery
applauds.

                        TIN CUP
                 (generally
                  announcing)
          Got my 'A' game with me today,
          folks... you're in for a real
          treat!

Molly leans to Romeo just before they all head down the
fairway and confides --

                        MOLLY
          I find him mildly attractive when
          he's obnoxious and arrogant like
          this --

                                                                 55.
                            ROMEO
               Good. 'Cause it's his best
               side...

     And they head down the fairway, a scruffy little gallery
     on a so-so course. With a lot at stake...

                                                      CUT TO:


48   MONTAGE OF TIN CUP'S FRONT NINE                             48

     Molly, the gallery, the universe --

                             TIN CUP
               Dollar bills...

49   He nails a two iron straight as a string.                   49

                              TIN CUP
               Nutted it...

50   He rifles another drive into the stratosphere.              50

               Ben Hogan?   Who's he?

53   EXT. COTTONWOOD LOCAL QUALIFIER - TENTH TEE - DAY           53

     Tin Cup's in a zone, talking to himself, full of himself,
     in a fabulous, indomitable state of mind.

     Molly and Romeo keep looking at each other and shrugging,
     Tin Cup's on a roll and needs no help. So far...

     A couple of the regulars shout out encouragement.

                             CLINT/EARL
               You the man, Tin Cup! You the
               man!

                             ROMEO
               They bugging you, boss -- I can
               shut 'em up?

                             TIN CUP
               The way I'm swinging today,

                                                          56.
          nothing bugs me -- except
          insufficient applause.
                 (surveying the
                  fairway)
          Gimme the lumber.

But Romeo is handing him a two iron.

                        ROMEO
          I think two iron's safer.

                        TIN CUP
          I said I want the Big Dog.

Romeo looks warily down the fairway of a tight dogleg
left par five.

                        ROMEO
          Tight par five, out of bounds
          left... you don't want to hit
          driver.

                        TIN CUP
          I'm not going left of those trees.
          I'm going over those trees... with
          a little draw. That way I get
          home in two. That way I'm putting
          for eagle.

                        ROMEO
          You don't need eagle to qualify!
          You need to get used to playing
          smart -- no mistakes wins the
          Open.

                       TIN CUP
          Qualify? I want the course
          record! Now gimme the lumber!

Tin Cup reaches for the driver.   Romeo shifts the golf
bag beyond Tin Cup's reach.

                        ROMEO
          You not going to listen to me?
          You don't care I'm trying to help?
          You think I'm full of shit?

                        TIN CUP
          I think I'm gonna get penalized
          for slow play if you don't give me
          that fucking driver.

                        ROMEO
          You a head case, boss, always
          were, always will be.

                                                              57.
                        TIN CUP
          Then let's ask the head doctor.
          Dr. Griswold?
                 (to Molly)
          Dr. Griswold, should I hit the Big
          Dog or the two?

Suddenly an OFFICIAL steps forward.

                        P.G.A. OFFICIAL
          Soliciting shot selection advice
          is a two-stroke penalty.

                        MOLLY
          Trust your feelings, Roy.

                         TIN CUP
                  (to Romeo)
          Ha!   Gimme the driver and shut up.

Romeo pulls out the driver and he snaps it in half over
his knee. He tosses the two halves on the ground near
Tin Cup.

                          ROMEO
          ... Go ahead.    Hit the driver.

Tin Cup looks at the two halves of his driver, curbing
his anger, not giving Romeo the satisfaction of a
reaction.

                        TIN CUP
          I changed my mind. Gimme the
          three wood.

                        ROMEO
          You can't clear the dogleg with a
          three wood.

                          TIN CUP
          Wanna bet?

Romeo pulls out the three wood, snaps it     over his knee,
and tosses the halves on the ground next     to the driver
halves. Tin Cup turns with amusement to      his playing
partners, lest they think management has     lost the upper
hand with labor.

                        TIN CUP
          Guess I'm going with the safe
          shot, boys.

Tin Cup reaches for the two iron, studies it a moment,
frowns, and then:

He snaps it over his knee. He dumps these halves on the
ground with the halves of the driver and three wood.

                                                              58.
Romeo stares, aghast.   Tin Cup merely shrugs.

                        TIN CUP
          Sometimes I fan that two iron.
          Better gimme the three.

Romeo warily hands Tin Cup the three iron.    Tin Cup looks
at it, frowns, then:

He snaps it over his knee and tosses it on the ground.

Molly leans over to the regulars.

                        MOLLY
          Is this normal behavior for him?

                        EARL
          The word 'normal' and him don't
          collide in the same sentence too
          often.

She watches in amazement as --

                         TIN CUP
          Sometimes I catch that three a
          little thin...

He drops the three iron halves with the other halves, and
steps past Romeo and sequentially yanks all but the seven
iron from his bag.

He snaps them over his knee, one by one, citing the
crimes of each club with mounting absurdity and ire.

                         TIN CUP
          And I've hooked my four iron...
                  (snap)
          ... and hit flyers with the
          five...
                  (snap)
          ... and shanked the six...
                  (snap)
          ... and skulled the eight...
                  (snap)
          ... and fatted the nine...
                  (snap)
          ... and chili-dipped the wedge...
                  (snap)
          ... and bladed the sand wedge...
                  (snap; then pauses
                   to reflect
                   contemptuously
                   on his putter)
          ... and then there's Mister
          Three-putt...

He snaps the putter in half and dumps it in the pile of

                                                                59.
     broken clubs at his feet.

     Then, he reaches for the last club in his bag, the seven
     iron. The regulars hold their breath, thinking this is
     the end of Tin Cup's Open bid. But...

     Tin Cup smiles and caresses the seven iron
     affectionately.

                             TIN CUP
               But the seven iron, I never miss
               the seven iron. It's the only
               truly safe club in my bag.

     He moves to the tee, drops a ball, and hits it down the
     middle with the seven iron.

                             TIN CUP
               You happy, Romeo?

                             ROMEO
               No, boss, I'm tired... my life's
               too short to spend it watching you
               fall apart. I done it too many
               times.

     Romeo turns and starts walking away.

                             TIN CUP
               What's this? You're quitting?
               First sign of adversity, you're
               quitting?
                      (as Romeo
                       continues)
               Anyone want to bet me I can't par
               in with a seven iron?
                      (to Molly)
               Doc? Take the bet?

                             MOLLY
               Roy -- just shut up and hit the
               ball.

                                                    CUT TO:


54   QUICK SERIES OF SHOTS                                      54

     Tin Cup's magic with a seven iron.   He drives with a
     seven iron.


55   He chips with a seven iron.                                55


56   He blasts out of sand with an open-bladed seven iron.      56

                                                                 60.

57   EXT. COTTONWOOD LOCAL QUALIFIER - EIGHTEENTH HOLE - DAY     57

     Tin Cup drains a ten foot putt -- also with the seven
     iron, and left-handed to boot. He's past the local
     qualifier.

     The regulars erupt in cheers.   You'd have thought he won
     the Masters.

     And Tin Cup shrugs to the tiny gallery, with insouciance
     and cockiness, and pronounces --

                             TIN CUP
               An easy game, this golf...

                                                       CUT TO:


58   EXT. 19TH HOLE - OUTDOOR BAR - DAY (LATER)                  58

     Tin Cup holds court surrounded by his regulars and much
     of the gallery. He's a local hero -- but Molly's not
     impressed.

     A WAITRESS delivers a tray of long neck beers.

                             19TH HOLE WAITRESS
               Beer for everybody.

                             CLINT
               You the man, Tin Cup!

     A toast is raised to their king, and Tin Cup eats it up.

                             TIN CUP
               Thanks, boys, what'ya think was my
               best shot -- the seven iron on
               twelve, the seven iron on
               fourteen, or maybe it was the
               bunker shot on eighteen which, to
               my recollection was a -- seven iron?

     Much laughter.   This is the Tin Cup they love.

                             EARL
               You definitely the man!

                             TIN CUP
               How'd I do, Doc?

                             MOLLY
                      (cheerfully)
               You failed miserably.

                                     61.
              TIN CUP
What?! I parred the back nine
with a seven iron, I qualified for
the regionals, I --

              MOLLY
Your job is not just to qualify
for the Open, it's to prepare for
the Open. My job is to help you
prepare.

              TIN CUP
You said to 'trust my feelings'!

              MOLLY
I didn't know you felt like
breaking all the clubs in your
bag.

              CLINT
He didn't break the seven!

              EARL
He smoked that seven, brother --

              MOLLY
From what I understand, the U.S.
Open is the most difficult golf
tournament in the world played
under the most difficult
circumstances with the greatest
players -- winning it means
controlling yourself, managing
your emotions, staying cool, not
getting in a pissing contest with
your caddie who, incidentally,
quit.

              TIN CUP
He always quits, he always comes
back.

              MOLLY
Nonetheless, from the mental
aspect -- which is my domain --
you have regressed and are
fumbling somewhere between
delusion and denial.

              TIN CUP
'Regression, delusion, denial'?
You gotta use all this
psychological language?

              MOLLY
I'm a psychologist.

                                                            62.
Tin Cup turns to the regulars for support.

                         VOICE (O.S.)
           Have a bad day, Roy?

Everyone turns to see David Simms enter the conversation.

                          MOLLY
           Hi, honey...

                         TIN CUP
           I shot 65 -- parred the backside
           with a seven iron.

                         SIMMS
                  (intrigued)
           Why?

                         MOLLY
           That's the question -- why?

Silence.

                         CLINT
           'Cause he broke all his other
           clubs.

                         EARL
           Snapped 'em in two -- even the
           putter.

                         SIMMS
           Jesus, Roy, I'm on your side here.
           We go way back... I hope you get
           into the Open, but if you don't
           play under control, you'll get
           slaughtered. Good players shoot
           82 in the Open. You can't always
           go for it.

                         TIN CUP
           Swear to God, Doc, this guy is
           not who you think.

                         CLINT
           It's a well-known fact that if a
           camera's not on him, he treats old
           people and children like dirt.

                          EARL
           And dogs.

                         TIN CUP
           Yeah, don't forget the dogs.

                         MOLLY
           I think we should go, David.

                                                           63.

                          SIMMS
          I think so...

Tin Cup's worst characteristics flare up, he won't let
go.

                        TIN CUP
          You ever shoot par with a seven
          iron?

                        SIMMS
          It never occurred to me to try.
                 (to Molly)
          C'mon, let's go. The car's over
          here....

                        TIN CUP
          I'll bet you a thousand dollars
          against my car that I can beat you
          in any game -- any game, you name
          it -- with a seven iron.

                        SIMMS
          This is ridiculous.

                        TIN CUP
          You a coward? You gonna lay up
          the way you did at the Masters
          last year?

                        REGULARS
                 (taunting, like
                  children)
          Chickie, chickie, chickie...

Simms is a little drawn in, not so much by the challenge
as the desire to shut up Tin Cup.

                        SIMMS
          Any game, I name it?

                        MOLLY
          Oh, come on, David --

                        SIMMS
          I just want to teach him a lesson.

                        MOLLY
          Why do men insist on measuring
          their dicks?

Tin Cup takes her literally and rises, starting to
unbuckle his belt.

                        TIN CUP
          Awright, awright! Let's measure,

                                                            64.
          right now!

                        MOLLY
          For God sakes, I wasn't being
          literal!
                 (beat)
          David, let's go.

                        SIMMS
          Molly, trust me on this one. Call
          it part of his mental preparation
          for the Open, where the rough is
          deep, the greens are slick, and
          the nerves are shattered.
                 (to Tin Cup)
          I'll take the bet.

                          MOLLY
          Oh, jeez...

The Regulars cheer -- this is what they live for. Simms
hands a roll of cash to Molly. Tin Cup hands her his car
keys.

                         TIN CUP
          Awright!   What's the game?

                        SIMMS
          One swing each. Who can hit the
          longest seven iron --

                        TIN CUP
          It's a lock! I hit the seven like
          John Daly hits a three!

The Regulars whoop it up. Their man's a cinch. Tin Cup
pulls a ball from his pocket, drops it right on the
ground in the middle of the patio.

                        TIN CUP
          From right here, okay?

                          SIMMS
          Fine with me.

                        MOLLY
          You guys are really being
          childish --

                        SIMMS
          Molly, leave this one to me.

                        TIN CUP
          Dr. Griswold, I know what I'm
          doing.

Tin Cup takes a couple of swings to limber up, aiming out

                                                            65.
onto an open area of the course.   Serious, intent, the
look of eagles...

                        TIN CUP
                 (to himself)
          Dollar bills...

He takes a full back-swing, opens beautifully, and
launches a seven iron like a rocket out toward some
driving range markers... to "oohs" and "ahhs" from his
faithful.

The ball lands at a 170 yard marker and bounces further.

                        CLINT
          Them signs are at least thirty
          yards farther -- that ball musta
          gone 220...

                        TIN CUP
          That ball's about 2-2-7... toed it
          a bit... but it'll do...

                        REGULARS
          Nearly 230 with a seven!    Pureed
          it, baby, he pureed it!

Tin Cup hands Simms the seven iron.

                        TIN CUP
          Take a minute to limber up, fine
          with me --

                           SIMMS
          Don't need to.

Simms is still in a sport jacket, slacks, no golf shoes.

                        TIN CUP
          Take your jacket off?

                        SIMMS
          No, no, I'm fine.

Simms drops a ball about where Tin Cup's sat.   He stands
above the ball and addresses it.

                         TIN CUP
                  (cockily)
          You're gonna need to muscle up,
          big guy -- give it the old steroid
          jerk...

Simms is cool as ice. He smiles, then moves around to
the other side of the ball, suddenly facing away from the
course. This baffles everyone.

                                                                 66.
                             REGULARS
               What the hell you doin'?    Wha's
               this?

     And David Simms hits an effortless seven iron out toward
     the desert, onto the lonely highway...

59   ... and the ball bounces and bounces and bounces, for    59
     About three miles, forever. It's probably still going...


60   CLOSE ON TIN CUP                                            60

     The hustler's been hustled.


     CLOSE ON MOLLY

     She shrugs and smiles.

                                                     CUT TO:


61   EXT. COTTONWOOD CLUBHOUSE - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)             61

     Molly drives away in Simms' car -- followed by Simms in
     Tin Cup's Cadillac convertible. Simms waves.

     Tin Cup and the Regulars stand alone. Weakly, lamely, a
     couple of the Regulars speak. Without conviction.

                             CLINT
               You the man, Roy...

                             EARL
               You definitely the man...

                                                     CUT TO:


62   INT. GOLDEN TASSEL - NIGHT                                  62

     A nearly nude dancer named SAMMANTHA on stage to a big
     Saturday night crowd. Tin Cup's in the front row,
     sitting with Doreen and a beer. Disconsolate.

                             P.A. ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
               Bring out those bills, boys, if ya
               wanta see a little more of
               Sammantha!

     Guys pull out singles and larger bills around the runway,
     placing them on the railing for the gyrating stripper.

                             SAMMANTHA
                      (to Tin Cup)
               Hey, honey...

                                                      67.

Tin Cup tosses some money onstage with a lackluster
wave, he's depressed -- or something.

                           TIN CUP
          Hey, honey...

                        DOREEN
          I heard you qualified for the
          Regionals -- why you so down?

                        TIN CUP
          I broke my clubs -- don't ask why,
          my caddie's pissed off at me, I
          lost my wheels in a sucker bet,
          and my shrink thinks I'm a fool --
          'cause I probably am...

                        DOREEN
          You're seeing a therapist?!

                        TIN CUP
          Yeah, what's wrong with that?

                        DOREEN
          Only way you'd ever go into
          therapy was if the shrink was a
          doll and you were trying to get
          her into the rack --

                        TIN CUP
          You're so shallow. The Good
          Doctor and I are dealing with my
          regression and denial --

                         DOREEN
          Oh, Tin Cup, what a crock.    You
          got a hard-on.

A GUY from the next table leans over, interrupting.

                           GUY
          You `Tin Cup'?     Won the Local with
          a seven iron?

                           TIN CUP
          That's me.

                         GUY
          McAvoy?   The Tin Cup McAvoy?

                        DOREEN
          There's only one -- thank God...

                         TIN CUP
          Yeah.   You looking for a game?

                                                            68.
                        GUY
          No, but I'd sure like to show you
          my grip...

Doreen can't keep his attention. Neither can Sammantha,
who writhes only a few feet away.

                         DOREEN
          How long have you been seeing this
          `Good Doctor'?

                        TIN CUP
          Excuse me, Dor', the man's having
          trouble with his grip --

The Guy slides over to Tin Cup, quickly joined by his
buddies.

                        GUY
          See, I used to play a real weak
          grip. But you look at Couples,
          he's got a left hand way over
          here...

Tin Cup glances at the guy's grip.

                        TIN CUP
          No, grip it like this, so you're
          holding on with the last two
          fingers of your left hand.

The Guy nudges the COWBOY next to him.

                        GUY
          See that? Tin Cup McAvoy says you
          grip a golf club like this, with
          these two fingers.

                         DOREEN
          Roy?
                  (off no response)
          Roy?   Tin Cup? Hello?

                        TIN CUP
          The grip and address are about 90
          percent of the golf swing, so pay
          attention here...

                        COWBOY
          When you're done with him, can I
          ask you about my club position at
          address?

Sammantha can't keep their attention, either, even though
she's down to a G-string, inches away. At the height of
the MUSIC, she stops dancing and looks down at Doreen --

                                                                 69.
                             SAMMANTHA
               Am I doing something wrong?

                             DOREEN
               No, honey, you ain't -- but a
               healthy woman's only got two
               choices in this world of ours...
                      (beat)
               Either fall in love with another
               woman -- or take up golf.

     And Doreen heads to the dressing room, disgusted, but not
     at all surprised. She knows Tin Cup -- she knows men.

                             TIN CUP
               ... Now the stronger right-hand
               grip can help ya draw the ball,
               which I plan to do at the
               Regionals next week in Tulsa...
               just shift the hand over a little
               bit... blah, blah, blah...

     ... And naked women dance before them, unnoticed.

                                                    CUT TO:

64   INT. WINNEBAGO - DAY                                        64

     Tin Cup drives, as most of the Regulars lounge -- all are
     there including Turk (the bouncer). But Romeo is
     missing.

                             CLINT
               We get through the next 36 holes
               and we in the Open!

                             EARL
               I got the yips and I ain't even
               teeing it up...

                             TIN CUP
               Nothing to worry about, boys --

                             JOSE
               But you ain't got Romeo?

                              TIN CUP
               Don't need him till the Open --
               he'll be back.

                                                                   70.
                             CLINT
               But you don't got the doctor lady?

                             TIN CUP
               Oh no, I got her. Right here.

     He holds up a tape cassette.

                             TIN CUP
               She can't travel to Arizona for
               the Regionals -- she's got a busy
               practice, y'know... so she made me
               this tape to play while I'm out
               there... keep me calm, cool, and
               collected...

                               EARL
               What's on it?

                             TIN CUP
               A little James Taylor, little
               George Jones, little Kahlil
               Gibran, little this, little
               that... and a lotta the voice of
               the smartest chick I ever met.

                             EARL
               The good doctor herself...

                             CLINT
               Can we hear it or is it personal?

                             TIN CUP
               Since when is therapy personal,
               eh?

     He punches into his deck and the Winnebago is filled with
     the sounds of MOLLY'S TAPE, beginning with George
     Jones...

     ... and the voice of GEORGE JONES takes us into...

     The Regional Qualifier -- 36-hole tournament pitting all
     the local winners. This is a much bigger deal than the
     local tournament -- more commercial, bigger crowds,
     tougher.


     MONTAGE OF REGIONALS

     Accompanied by MOLLY'S VOICE and the MUSIC of JONES,
     TAYLOR, OTHERS.

                                                                71.


     CLOSE ON TIN CUP

     He puts the Walkman headset over his ears on the first
     tee. We hear what he hears, and --

                              MOLLY (V.O.)
                       (on tape)

                harvest a crop before you plant

     Kaboom!   He launches a tee shot down the middle.

                              MOLLY (V.O)
                       (on tape)

                the problem...'


66   TIN CUP chips into the cup.                                66


67   TIN CUP drains putt after putt with confidence.            67

                              MOLLY (V.O.)
                       (on tape)
                ... `Follow your bliss...'


68   TIN CUP takes a club from Earl who's huffing and           68
     puffing a little too hard for a caddie, and --

     Tin Cup crisps a three iron over water to a tight green.

     Tin Cup is carrying his own bag now -- Earl is several
     paces behind, dragging his body slowly, exhausted.


69   CLOSE ON SCOREBOARD -- Even par, even, even, one           69
     under...

                              MOLLY (V.O.)
                       (on tape)

                truth but that I have found a
                truth...'


70   CLOSE ON TIN CUP -- Still in a zone, confident,            70
     relaxed, hitting lots of good shots. But the score is
     close, the competition tougher. He's near the top,
     but not first.

                                                                72.
71   TIN CUP lips out a fifteen-foot putt -- heartbreak.        71
     He starts to lose it, but...

                             MOLLY (V.O.)

               without the roots...'

     And Tin Cup just smiles and taps in.


72   SCOREBOARD tells us we're down to the 36th, final hole.    72


73                           TIN CUP                            73
               Whattya think, Earl?

                             EARL
               I think three under will qualify.
               You need birdie. I could shit.

                             TIN CUP
               A little more confidence there,
               Earl...

                             EARL
               I wish Romeo was here. I ain't
               cut out to do this. I'm a
               spectator by nature. An observer.
               I'm a --

                             TIN CUP
               Shut up and hand me the Big Dog.

                             EARL
               You got it.

     Tin Cup takes the driver and uncoils a beauty.

                             TIN CUP
               The Force is with me, pods...

                                                      CUT TO:


74   TIN CUP hits a wedge approach -- the ball lands inches     74
     from the hole. The crowd gasps... but --

     The backspin grabs it and the ball spins back and back
     and back, ten, twenty, thirty feet before coming to a
     rest.

     The men head solemnly to the final green.

                                                      CUT TO:

                                                                 73.
75   EXT. LA PALOMA - 18TH GREEN - DAY                           75

     Tin Cup surveys the thirty-foot snake of a putt.   Earl's
     of absolutely no use.

                              TIN CUP
               We need this one big time, Earl,
               whattya think?

                             EARL
                      (unsurely)
               Looks straight to me.

                             TIN CUP
               Straight?! Thing's a roller
               coaster breaks four ways and dies
               at the hole -- you're blind!

                             EARL
               Actually, I am blind... 20-60 in
               one eye -- and that's the good
               eye...

                              TIN CUP
               I got a blind caddie... just hold
               the stick, Earl -- and be sure to
               pull it out...

     Tin Cup studies the hell out of this putt. If it goes
     in, he's in the Open. He misses, back to Salome.

                             MOLLY (V.O.)
                      (on tape)
               ... when the going gets tough,
               the, the, the, whirrrrrrrrrrr,
               the, the...

     Tin Cup shakes the Walkman and pounds his ears.

                             TIN CUP
               Doc?  Doc?
                      (panicky)
               Earl, Earl -- the tape's jammed!
               She's abandoning me!

                               MARSHAL
               Are you okay?

                             TIN CUP
               Yeah, yeah... I'm flying solo
               now...

                               MARSHAL
               What?

                             TIN CUP
               I gotta make this putt.

                                                                 74.

                             MARSHAL
               Obviously.

     Tin Cup stares endlessly at the long putt.

                             TIN CUP
               ... just pick the line, feel the
               speed -- bad timing, doc, Jesus...

     He steps up to the putt, still talking to himself.

                             TIN CUP
               Like a million others you made in
               your life, Roy. Just see it going
               in. Just feel it... right in the
               back of the jar... just pull the
               goddamn trigger, you pussy...


76   He strokes the putt -- It starts right, curls back          76
     left, straightens out, over the ridge, back again,
     endlessly...

                             TIN CUP
               Pull the stick, Earl, pull it!

     Earl's having trouble with the flagstick, shaking it,
     panicking, and finally -- he snaps it free, but...

     The ball stops dead on the lip of the cup.

     Tin Cup contorts in anguished body-English, then falls to
     his back like a shot animal.

                             TIN CUP
               Choking dogs die!

     And the BALL falls into the cup with a CLICK -- and a
     ROAR.

     Tin Cup takes a peek at the cup.   The ball stays in the
     hole.

                                                    CUT TO:


77   EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT                                        77

     The Winnebago returns home, a travelling party of beer,
     boisterousness, and celebration. We hear them all, led
     by Turk the bouncer and his guitar, singing "The Double
     bogey Blues"... all the way back to Texas.

                                                    CUT TO:

                                                             75.
78   EXT. DRIVING RANGE - DAY                                78

     Tin Cup arrives, fresh from the qualifier.   Romeo is
     shafting glubs.

                             TIN CUP
               Romes!  You've come back!
                      (no answer)
               You shoulda been there, Romes, I
               drained a 30-foot snake to
               qualify!
                      (off no answer)
               Earl gave me a straight read --
               the thing broke half a dozen times
               -- missed ya, pods!

     Romeo gives him the silent treatment.

                             TIN CUP
               Okay, don't talk to me -- but
               you're still my guy...
                      (losing patience)
               It's a little late to be pissed
               off! We're in the Open! You and
               me!

     Still nothing from Romeo.

                             TIN CUP
               Awright, be that way --
                      (switches course)
               -- say... has Molly been around?

                             ROMEO
               I knew you had the hots for her.

                             TIN CUP
               What's this? Garbo speaks? Of
               course I have the hots for her and
               I'm doing a damn good job of
               keeping things platonic and
               professional till I kick Simms'
               ass and show her I ain't who she
               thinks I am because, in fact, I am
               who she thinks I am but if I win
               the Open I won't be.

     Romeo stares back at that curious logic.

                             ROMEO
               Well, I don't think her nor me nor
               the God of Golf his self can keep
               you from blowing up in the Open...

                             TIN CUP
               I made it this far! I just got to
               hold it together for 72 more

                                               76.
           holes!

                         ROMEO
           There's a lotta triple bogeys out
           there waiting to grab your ass.

                         TIN CUP
                  (cheerily)
           You're complaining again! Romeo's
           back! Whining, bitching, pissed
           off -- you're my man!

Silence.   Some chagrin.

                         ROMEO
           You didn't fall in love with Earl
           to be your caddie?

                         TIN CUP
           He was a wheezing heart attack
           waiting to happen -- cost me
           three strokes a side...
                  (beat)
           I carried my bag the last four
           holes. I love ol' Earl but I need
           you.

                         ROMEO
           You don't love me?

                         TIN CUP
                  (exasperated)
           I love you, too, God damn it!

                         ROMEO
           As much as Earl?

                         TIN CUP
           I don't know! Yes, yes, as much
           as Earl --
                  (beat)
           More than Earl!

                           ROMEO
           Am I special?

                         TIN CUP
           If you can remove the sexual
           connotations and overlay a golf
           theme, Romeo -- I am your Juliet.

Romeo ponders it all.

                         ROMEO
           Muy bien, Julietta. In that case
           -- I am your caddy once again.

                                                                   77.
                             TIN CUP
               Podnuh.

     They shake hands.

                             TIN CUP
               Awright... now that we got that
               bullshit outta the way, I'm gonna
               hit me some balls and start oilin'
               that sweet swing o' mine for the
               big boys...

     Romeo sits back in the shade, still washing the thousands
     of golf balls in the rack, watching as --


79   Tin Cup drops a bucket of balls on the hardscrabble           79
     ground, pulls out a club and limbers up.

                             TIN CUP
               Nobody heard from Molly, eh?

                             ROMEO
               You got it bad, don't ya?

                             TIN CUP
               Somethin' about that chick...

     Tin Cup addresses the ball and takes a swing.    Everything
     looks normal in his swing, but...

     Thwock! -- the BALL squirls off to the side and RATTLES
     against a fence. Ugly.

                             TIN CUP
               Hmmm... little chili dipper
               there...

                             ROMEO
               Be sure to do that in the Open.

     Unfazed, Tin Cup steps up to hit again, but... once
     more --

     Thwock! -- Another horrible-looking squib to the right.

     Romeo stops washing balls and notices, watching Tin Cup.

     Thwock, thwock! -- Something's terribly wrong.


     CLOSE ON TIN CUP

     Concern crosses his face.

                             TIN CUP
               Romeo!

                                                                   78.

                               ROMEO
               I'm watching.

                             TIN CUP
               It ain't no chili dipper.

                             ROMEO
               Yeah, boss, you got the 'S' word.

                             TIN CUP
               What am I doing wrong?

                             ROMEO
               Shanks are like a virus -- they
               just show up. Nobody can figure
               'em out.

     Thwock, thwock, thwock! -- Three more chili dippers.   Our
     man definitely has the shanks. And he's panicking.

                              TIN CUP
               Romes!   Something's terribly
               wrong.   What's your guess?!

                             ROMEO
               It's the woman.

                             TIN CUP
               I thought you said it was a virus?

                             ROMEO
               A woman can have the same effect.

                               TIN CUP
               What do I do?

                             ROMEO
               Keep swinging...

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:


80   EXT. RANGE - THAT NIGHT (MUCH LATER)                          80

     Thwock, thwock, thwock! -- Night has fallen and he still
     has the shanks.

     The regulars have gathered and are huddled, murmuring.
     The word has spread like wildfire -- Tin Cup has the
     shanks.

                             CLINT
               Never thought it would happen...

                             EARL
               The shanks is for us mortals, not

                                                          79.
          for the great ones...

                        JOSE
          Esta muy feo... muy, muy feo...

(It is very ugly, very, very ugly...)

Tin Cup angrily throws his club out into the night and
turns to the regulars.

                        TIN CUP
          Y'know why they named this game
          'golf'? 'Cause the words 'fuck'
          and 'shit' were already taken!

A CAR HORN HONKS -- All heads turn to see:


POV SHOT - PINK CORVETTE

pulls in -- Doreen gets out, carrying a big package.

                           DOREEN
          Hiya, fellas!

                        TIN CUP
          What is this? Everybody like to
          watch a train wreck?!

Doreen approaches the regulars, and we notice for the
first time that there are a number of bags and packages
with the boys.

                        DOREEN
          He's in one of his pleasant moods,
          I see --

                        ROMEO
          He's got the shanks. We got the
          makings of a Greek tragedy here.

                        DOREEN
                 (shouting to
                  Tin Cup)
          Quit whining and get over here.
          We've got something for you.

Tin Cup drags his sorry ass to the group.

                        TIN CUP
          Unless it's a 'swing thought,' I'm
          not interested...

                        DOREEN
                 (ignoring his
                  attitude)
          We're here to sponsor you in the

                                                            80.
          Open. Me an' the boys have pooled
          our resources and come up with
          some cash so you can look and feel
          as spiffy as all them big-name
          pros.

                        TIN CUP
          But I got the shanks --

                        DOREEN
          Yeah, and you obviously still have
          a hard-on for the doctor chick --
          your face is all screwed up and
          tight like you haven't been laid
          in awhile --

                        TIN CUP
          Is it really that obvious?

                        DOREEN
          It's not a good look for you.
          Roy, your heart is not the only
          organ you wear on your sleeve.
          There's a certain, vulgar appeal
          to your transparency.

Tin Cup shrugs.   She always has him outflanked.

                        CLINT
          C'mon, Tin Cup, we're trying to
          make you a presentation --

                        TIN CUP
          Awright, awright...

She unwraps a tour golf bag -- Big gold and red lettering
advertises "The Golden Tassel." Pastie tassels hang from
all over the bag. Doreen sets it down proudly.

                        DOREEN
          I got the Golden Tassel to sponsor
          you at the Open.

                        TIN CUP
          You expect me to pack that around?

                        ROMEO
          I'm carrying the bag.

                        DOREEN
          It's worth four hundred dollars
          endorsement money to you --

Earl steps forward with a golf shirt bedecked with sewn
on patches and logos.

                                                        81.
                        EARL
          See, Dewey got you First State
          Banking of Salome, and Clint got
          you Short-Haul Trucking and I got
          you Brink and Brown sanitation --

                        TIN CUP
          I'm being sponsored by a sewage
          disposal system?

                        EARL
          We call it human resources
          management, Roy, please...

Jose steps forward with a golf cap, also emblazoned.

                        JOSE
          I've got Wally's Smokehouse for ya
          -- kind of a nice sign...

                        DEWEY
          And since I couldn't get the post
          office to come aboard, me and my
          girl friend Muriel's gonna buy a
          fan club patch you can put anywhere
          you want.

Doreen and the regulars look at Tin Cup proudly.

                        TIN CUP
          I'm supposed to wear this shit?

                        JOSE
          This shit is us, man.   You can't
          win without us.

                        DOREEN
          You're the pride of Salome!

                        TIN CUP
          Hell, I won't even make the cut!

                        DOREEN
          What happened to your confidence?

                        ROMEO
          He's shanking his love life so
          he's shanking the golf ball.

                        DOREEN
          Must be true love.

                          ROMEO
          He's a goner.

Tin Cup surveys all the bizarre sponsorship loot, and
starts loosening up. These are his people, after all,

                                                                   82.
     and they're behind him all the way.

                             TIN CUP
               Look, everybody, this is great.
               I'm sorry I'm acting so pathetic
               but my swing's never abandoned me
               before. I just need a little time
               to work it out.

                             EARL
               Anything you want --

                             CLINT
               Give him some room, boys --

                             TIN CUP
                      (to anyone who'll
                       listen)
               Maybe it's my grip... maybe I'm
               opening up too soon... too late...
               coming over the top... no,
               dropping underneath...
                      (beat)
               Oh, sweet Jesus, why have you
               abandoned me?

                             DOREEN
                      (to the regulars)
               He's trying to talk to God.   It's
               time for us to go.

     Doreen and the regulars quietly slip away to leave Tin
     Cup with his newly sponsored gifts and, more importantly,
     his newly lost grip, swing, and confidence.

                             ROMEO
               You want me to stay, boss?

                             TIN CUP
               I need to be alone.

                             ROMEO
               You got it.

     And Romeo herds the rest of them out to their cars in the
     lot. And as they drive away, Tin Cup sits down, his head
     in his hands.

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:


81   EXT. RANGE - NEXT MORNING                                     81

     The Winnebago sits forlornly in the parking lot next to
     the range which has never looked lonelier.

     Tin Cup's Caddy convertible pulls up to the Winnebago.

                                                                   83.
     But Roy isn't driving -- Molly is.    She gets out, goes to
     the door.

     She knocks.

                              MOLLY
               Roy?   Anybody home?

     There's no answer so she tries the door, and walks in on:

                                                     CUT TO:


82   INT. WINNEBAGO - MORNING                                      82

     Tin Cup stands there caught, like a deer in the
     headlights, like a man caught cross dressing, a private
     confession made public -- he can't run and he can't
     hide...

     Roy "Tin Cup" McAvoy is wearing every gimmick that Molly
     first arrived with -- plus many more. He wears a
     pendulum cap, his arms are strapped together, a curious
     triangular coat hanger type contraption connects his
     elbows, there's a neck brace, an ankle anchor, an arrow
     attachment to his left hand, a bucket for right foot, he
     swings a collapsible club... and a BEGINNERS GOLF VIDEO
     PROJECTS loudly from his VCR, so loudly that he never
     heard her knocking.

                                MOLLY
               My God...

                                TIN CUP
               Aarghh...

                                MOLLY
               Roy...

                             TIN CUP
               Dr. Griswold...

     A moment of pathetic silence, then:

     Molly starts laughing -- He is destroyed.

                             TIN CUP
               The therapist laughs at her
               patient? Is that how it works? A
               man is laid bare before God and
               he's the butt of the cosmic joke?

                             MOLLY
               I'm sorry, I just...

                             TIN CUP
               Some of this shit might actually

                                                           84.
          work, y'know... I mean I think
          there's something to this hat
          with the pendulum golf ball
          thing... may be on to something
          here...

                        MOLLY
          Oh, Roy, Jesus... Quoting yourself,
          'It is the paraphernalia for lost
          and desperate souls.'

Tin Cup lets down. The wind goes out of his sails and he
loses his defensiveness.

                         TIN CUP
          Well, God damn... a lost and
          desperate soul stands before you.
                  (beat)
          I assume I have the
          confidentiality of doctor-client
          privilege in regards to this
          outfit?

                        MOLLY
          Of course you do. What happened?

                        TIN CUP
          I got the shanks.

                        MOLLY
          Are you taking penicillin?

                        TIN CUP
          It can't be treated! It's much
          worse than whatever you thought it
          was.
                 (beat)
          There's a glitch in my swing.

                        MOLLY
          So it's in Romeo's department?

                        TIN CUP
          He thinks it's your department --
          says it's a head thing.

                        MOLLY
          Oh. Well. I just came over to
          congratulate you on the regionals
          and return your car -- David says
          he doesn't want it, just wanted to
          make a point with you --
                 (beat)
          But I suppose we could have a
          therapy session right here and now
          --

                                                         85.
                        TIN CUP
          I don't want therapy. I want you.

                         MOLLY
          Roy...   I gotta get some air --

                        TIN CUP
          Look at me --
                 (considering what
                  that means)
          Well, not right at the moment --
          but listen to me. You're with the
          wrong guy. I'm the right guy.
          Everyone tells me my face is all
          screwed up tight as a drum 'cause
          I've been crazy about you from
          the day you showed up wearing
          this stupid stuff and the whole
          damn thing has both inspired
          me to get here on the verge of
          greatness yet it's also caused
          me to get the shanks which
          could humiliate me in front of
          a zillion people.
                 (beat)
          Such is life. So dump that phony
          bastard and come to the Open in my
          corner -- you can delay your
          romantic urges, which I know are
          lurking in there among the excess
          of brain cells you possess --
          until the appropriate time...
                 (beat)
          Tell me you're not at least
          moderately attracted to me.

Tin Cup stands there with the ball still dangling from
his hat, the leather straps, the bucket, the arrows --
for the moment he's forgotten how stupid he looks.

                        MOLLY
          You have moments.

                        TIN CUP
          Tell me which ones are my moments
          and I'll try to duplicate them.

                        MOLLY
          This is a moment. You look great.

                         TIN CUP
          Now?!

                        MOLLY
          Utterly exposed, completely
          vulnerable, the inner child trying
          to get out.

                                                               86.

                             TIN CUP
               My inner child needs spanking.

                             MOLLY
               You always liked that part about
               saddling up, the smell of leather
               --

                             TIN CUP
               C'mon, let's have a drink. Call
               it therapy. Charge me 75 an hour.
               Little Cuervo, little Freud...

     She's thinking about it.

                             MOLLY
               Naw... I gotta go.
                      (turns to leave)
               Oh, I don't have a car, I
               need a ride.

                                                    CUT TO:


83   EXT. ALONG RIVER BACK TO TOWN - DAY                       83

     Tin Cup and Molly in his convertible.   He works on her
     without pushing too hard.

                             TIN CUP
               I know a spot along the river's
               great to watch the sunset?

                                MOLLY
               Not tonight.

                             TIN CUP
               'Not tonight' means maybe some
               other night?

                             MOLLY
               I didn't mean it like that.

                             TIN CUP
               Consciously you didn't mean it
               like that -- but how about
               unconsciously, you're the expert,
               did you mean it unconsciously?

                             MOLLY
               Unconsciously, Roy, I don't have a
               clue what I'm talking about.

                             TIN CUP
               I feel we're making progress.

                                                                   87.
                                MOLLY
                  I do too. But I have no idea what
                  it's progress towards...


A84     EXT. MOLLY'S OFFICE - DUSK                                 A84

        The Caddy pulls up in front of her office at the new
        mall. She gets out.

                                MOLLY
                  Good luck in the Open, Roy.

                                 TIN CUP
                  Put your money on me, Doc, the
                  odds are fabulous and God knows
                  I'm overdue...

        He drives away, and we stay:


        CLOSE ON MOLLY

        Watching Tin Cup careen away in his Caddy.

                                                         CUT TO:


84/85   EXT. SOUTHWESTERN HIGHWAY - DAY                            84/85

        The intrepid Winnebago on the way to the Open.    Romeo
        drives -- Tin Cup stares out the window.

                                ROMEO
                  You got to relax, boss --

                                TIN CUP
                  Goin' to the U.S. Open with the
                  shanks. Gonna be chili dipping my
                  way around the course on worldwide
                  television... sure, relax.

                                ROMEO
                  I'm gonna get rid of them shanks
                  for ya. No hay problema.

                                TIN CUP
                  Molly and I are circling each
                  other... I can feel it...

                                ROMEO
                  She the enemy, boss.

                                TIN CUP
                  Naw...

                                                                   88.
                              ROMEO
               Well she wakin' up with the enemy
               -- same thing.

                             TIN CUP
               Tell me something, Romes -- the
               absolute truth -- you think I can
               go 72 holes without falling apart.

     Romeo keeps driving, pretends not to hear.

                             TIN CUP
               You heard me! I don't want no
               bullshit... do you think I can do
               it?

                             ROMEO
               I don't know, boss, I just don't
               know.

     And Tin Cup puts on his Walkman, and stares out the
     window endlessly at a thousand miles of passing scenery,
     to the MUSIC of GEORGE JONES...

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:


86   EXT. DESERT - DAY                                             86

     The WINNEBAGO RUMBLES out of the country heading east,
     and --

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:
                                                            94.

87   EXT. CENTRAL TEXAS PLAINS - DAY                               87

     The Winnebago heads out of the high plains.

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:


89   EXT. PINE HILLS GOLF CLUB (NORTH CAROLINA) - DAY              89

     The Winnebago passes through a "tunnel" of tall, old
     pines into a cathedral environment of old money and
     old golf.


90   INT. WINNEBAGO - DAY                                          90

     Romeo and Tin Cup stare out into the trees, the lushness
     -- a couple of wide-eyed kids.

                             TIN CUP
               I bet this is the first Winnebago
               they ever saw here...

                                                            89.

                        ROMEO
          Yeah... and the first Mexican...

The Winnebago pulls up to a guard gate -- A SECURITY
GUARD comes to the window. A banner hangs above the
entrance a few paces past the security gate, proclaiming:
"Old Pines -- U.S. Open Championship."

                        SECURITY GUARD
          Yes?

                        ROMEO
          Como esta, amigo. I have with me
          one of the legendary ball strikers
          in the history of golf --

The Security Guard strains to see in.

                        SECURITY GUARD
          Who's that? Mr. Crenshaw? That you?
          Mr. Price, Mr. Norman? No?

Tin Cup leans across Romeo to introduce himself.

                        TIN CUP
          Roy 'Tin Cup' McAvoy.
          Representing the great American
          Southwest.

The Guard backs off quickly, turns to his SECOND.

                        SECURITY GUARD
          Do we have a... McCormack... on
          the list.

                        ROMEO
          McAvoy -- Roy McAvoy -- he's a
          legend!

                        SECURITY GUARD
          We got over 150 legends in this
          tournament. Sorry.

Romeo starts cursing in Spanish.   The Guard is unphased.

                        SECURITY GUARD
          Call the police.

                        ROMEO
          Police?

The police quickly appear to take over the situation.
Tin Cup leaps out of the Winnebago to argue his point.

                        TIN CUP
          There's a mistake here, fellas!

                                                           90.

A COP grabs Tin Cup and Roy is ready to fight.   It's
getting ugly real fast.

                        COP
          We'll throw your ass in jail right
          now, pal -- there's a lotta
          lunatics here and we don't take
          chances...

At that moment David Simms pulls in, driving a con-
vertible sponsor's car. He sees the scuffle, gets
out.

                        SIMMS
          What's the problem here?

                        SECURITY GUARD
          This clown says he's in the
          Open...

Simms spots Tin Cup -- a delicious moment for him. Tin
Cup wants to hide but he just gamely covers his face.

                        TIN CUP
          Hiya, David... nice sweater.

                        SECURITY GUARD
          He's not on the list.

Simms takes the clipboard with the list.

                        SIMMS
          Hiya, Roy... welcome to the big
          leagues...
                 (checks the list)
          Here ya go, Charlie, his name's
          right here.
                 (to Tin Cup)
          They spelled your name wrong --
          easy mistake with a total unknown.

                        SECURITY GUARD
                 (to Cop)
          Let him in.

Simms smiles at Tin Cup, the easy smile of a man on top.

Tin Cup doesn't respond, just asks the Guard:

                        TIN CUP
          Which way to the practice range?

As Tin Cup tries to regain some dignity, and climbs back
into the Winnebago --

                                                                 91.
                             SECURITY GUARD
                      (to Simms)
               He said he was a 'legend'?

                             SIMMS
               Oh he is... he's a very big name
               at a driving range in Salome,
               Texas...

     They all have a good laugh, and --

                                                    CUT TO:


91   EXT. PRACTICE RANGE - DAY                                   91

     Lots of the big names are there.   Romeo is like a kid at
     the ballpark.

                             ROMEO
               Look! Right there! Fred
               Couples... and Ray Floyd!

     Romeo notices that Tin Cup is staring at the pile of
     practice balls lying there on the tee.

                             TIN CUP
               Look at these balls. Brand new
               Titleists. Lookit 'em, every one
               a brand new Titleist.
                      (lowers his voice)
               Sneak a few in the bag when you
               get a chance. We swipe enough
               free shit we might even pay for
               this fiasco.

     Tin Cup limbers up, trying not to be in awe of the real
     legends who line the practice range, hitting beautiful
     shot after beautiful shot with graceful ease.

                             ROMEO
               You think it would be
               inappropriate to ask Ray Floyd for
               an autograph?

                             TIN CUP
               I think it's a dead giveaway,
               Romes... but if I still got the
               shanks we're gonna be found out
               real fast...

     Tin Cup nudges a ball from the pile into address
     position. Romeo hands him a different club.

                             ROMEO
               Hit the seven iron. You never
               miss the seven...

                                                            92.

                         TIN CUP
           Good thought, Pods...

Tin Cup waggles, shakes, limbers, addresses...

                         TIN CUP
           Dollar bills...

And he swings.

THWOCK! A hideous shank squirrels across line, almost
hitting a group of U.S. Open officials. Heads turn.

                         TIN CUP
                  (to anyone who'll
                   listen)
           Who hit that shot? Anybody see?

He addresses another one.   And swings.

THWOCK!   A disaster.   He crumbles.

                         ROMEO
           A little thin, Boss.

                         TIN CUP
           A little fucking thin?! I still
           got the shanks! Everybody's
           watching! Christ, Simms is here...

Simms has arrived and is watching Tin Cup with delight as
he loosens up.

                         ROMEO
           Maybe we should work on putting.
           Ya can't shank a putt.

Tin Cup pretends to limber a little more before daring to
strike another ball.

                         TIN CUP
           If you're the Mexican Mac O'Grady,
           Romes, you gotta figure out why
           I'm still shanking the ball.
                  (beat)
           What's the problem? I'm catching
           it on the hosel, right? Moving my
           head? I'm laying off it, I'm
           pronating, I'm supinating, I'm
           clearing too early, I'm clearing
           too late, I'm off plane, I ain't
           dropping in -- oh, God, my swing
           feels like an unfolding lawn chair.

                         ROMEO
           You got a virus in your brain.   I

                                                     93.
          got to kill the brain to kill the
          virus.

                         TIN CUP
          Anything.   Kill me now!

                        ROMEO
          Put all your change in your right
          pocket.

Tin Cup follows orders, not questioning the logic.

                        ROMEO
          Very good. Now tie your left
          shoelace in a double knot.

Again, Tin Cup dutifully follows orders.

                        ROMEO
          Esta bueno. Now, turn your hat
          around backwards and put a blue
          tee behind your right ear...

                        TIN CUP
          I'll look like a fool.

                        ROMEO
          What you think you look like
          hitting those squirrelly chili
          peppers up Freddy Couples' ass,
          eh? Do what I say or I quit.

                          TIN CUP
          Okay, okay...

                        ROMEO
          Perfect... now hit a seven iron
          into that tree over there. You're
          ready.

Tin Cup hits a perfect seven iron into the trees.

                        TIN CUP
          How'd I do that?

                         ROMEO
          You ain't thinking about shanking,
          you ain't thinking about the
          doctor lady, you ain't thinking
          period. You just lookin' like a
          fool and hittin' it pure -- your
          natural state.

                          TIN CUP
          Fuck you.

                                                                94.
                             ROMEO
               You cured.

                             TIN CUP
               That's it?

                            ROMEO
               That's it. Your brain was getting
               in the way.

                             TIN CUP
               That's rarely been a problem.
               What now?

                              ROMEO
               Well, I should recommend you go
               work on your short game but I
               think it's better if you go get
               drunk instead.

                             TIN CUP
               Get drunk?

                              ROMEO
               Yeah. You always play better when
               you're wasted.

     Tin Cups stares at the swami, and --

                                                    CUT TO:


92   INT. WINNEBAGO (IN PARKING LOT) - NIGHT                    92

     Again to GEORGE JONES on the CASSETTE PLAYER, Tin Cup is
     doing a slow dance with his driver.

     Romeo sits on the couch, stone cold sober, pouring drink
     after drink for Tin Cup, who's thoroughly plastered.

                             TIN CUP
               It's three in the morning, Romes,
               what time I tee off?

                             ROMEO
               Seven-o-five... first group off...
               Keep drinking, keep dancing...

                             TIN CUP
               That's four hours from now?

                             ROMEO
               You're drinking till five...
               c'mon, c'mon, have another --
                      (a tough coach)
               Get you in shape --

                                                                   95.
      Tin Cup tosses down yet another drink, and staggers
      around the room with his driver until, finally, he
      collapses in a heap on the floor. Romeo looks down
      at him coolly, like horse trainer Wayne Lukas sizing
      up his Derby entry.

                              ROMEO
                Nothing like the sight of a
                finely-tuned athlete on the verge
                of greatness...

      Romeo tosses a blanket over Tin Cup lying on the floor.

                                                    CUT TO:


A93   EXT. PINE HILLS CLUBHOUSE - EARLY MORNING                    A93

      Two figures hurry across the lawn to the first tee.    Our
      intrepid Don Quixote and Sancho Panza.


93    EXT. GOLF COURSE - EARLY MORNING                             93

      The first tee -- the early morning air is heavy and
      still. The course is quiet and wet with dew. The
      gallery is sparse. The silence is broken by the
      starter's voice.

                              STARTER (V.O.)
                With the honor in the 7:08
                pairing, from Salome, Texas,
                Mr. Roy McAvoy.

      A half-dozen people clap, and --

      Tin Cup and Romeo stagger to the tee, barely making it on
      time. Tin Cup is massively hung-over and unshaven.

                              TIN CUP
                No time for a bucket, eh?

                              ROMEO
                Almost missed the starting time
                trying to get you off the floor,
                boss. You don't handle the hooch
                like you used to...

      Tin Cup tries to get warm quickly, taking a few hurried
      practice swings. The early tee times are strictly for
      the longest of long shots, and almost nobody is around.
      Tin Cup's hand shakes as he closes the Velcro flap on his
      glove. He's wearing the hat and shirt with the sew-on
      patches, as he stares down the first fairway.

      Romeo hands him a driver.

                                                                   96.
                             ROMEO
               I seen this hole on TV. Hit the
               big dog down the chute --

                             TIN CUP
               No, I've learned my lesson. Gonna
               play it safe, smart, conservative.
               Fairways and greens. Hand me the
               two iron.

                               ROMEO
               You sure?

                             TIN CUP
               Thought of the day is -- `be
               humble.'

     And Tin Cup launches a two iron down the first fairway.

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:


94   EXT. SCOREBOARD - DAY (LATER)                                 94

     The scorer posts an eighty-three next to Tin Cup's name.

     Tin Cup stares, shell-shocked, as his score is posted.

                               ROMEO
               Eighty-three.    Well, you humble
               now.

                             TIN CUP
               Eleven bogeys and seven pars. I
               didn't make a three. I didn't
               make one goddam three all day.

                             ROMEO
               You weren't trying to make threes.
               You were trying to avoid making
               thirteen.

                             TIN CUP
               I was hungover!

                             ROMEO
               Maybe that was a coaching error on
               my part.

                             TIN CUP
               Thanks, amigo...

                      (on the television)
               I'm the last person who expected
               me to come out of the blocks with
               a sixty-seven and lead the Open...
               It's been a long time since I
               played this game with the fire and
               determination you need to win...

                             TIN CUP
               The Anti-Christ shoots 67, you

               ... you see, this game is all
               about integrity and tradition and

                             TIN CUP
               What? It's about cheating and
               racism and bullshit!

     Live coverage of the Simms interview. Molly is among a
     small crowd gathered to watch. He doesn't seem to know
     that she's there.

                             SIMMS
                      (live on mike)
               So tomorrow I'll just go out there
               and try to make some good swings
               and, Lord willing, maybe I can put
               up another good number. Thank
               you.

               brilliant opening round 67 to take
               the lead.

     Simms walks away, now off-camera.   FANS call out --

                                                                  98.

                                 SIMMS
               Gotta go.

     Simms cuts down behind the tent toward the clubhouse,
     away from the galleries. The marshals open a rope
     allowing him to avoid the crowds, but --

     An ELDERLY COUPLE with a young child are there.   The lady
     has a tiny dog in her arms.

                             OLD MAN

               Can't you see I'm busy?! I'm
               working! This is my office! Do I
               come to your office and ask you
               for an autograph?! Jesus...

     He practically stiff-arms them as he passes, heading up
     to the clubhouse. They stand there in shock.

                             SIMMS
                      (muttering to
                       himself)
               Who the fuck these people think
               they are...

     CAMERA PANS OVER TO the edge of the tent. Molly, trying
     to get to David, has seen the whole thing.


     CLOSE ON MOLLY

     She speaks to herself.

                             MOLLY
               Old people, children, and dogs...

                                                   CUT TO:


97   INT. CLUBHOUSE BAR - SUNSET                                  97

     Simms enters to numerous congratulations from officials,
     caddies, other PLAYERS. Instantly, in public, he feigns
     humility with convincing flair.

                             PLAYER #1
               Helluva round, Dave!

                                                            99.

                           SIMMS
             Got lucky out there...

                           PLAYER #2
             Great start, Simmsy...

Simms stops when he sees Tin Cup and Romeo drowning their
sorrows.

                           SIMMS
             Hey, Tin Cup -- heard you put a
             monster number up there...

                           TIN CUP
             Coulda been worse...

A small bar crowd is enjoying Simms' taunts.

                           SIMMS
             I played in the Pro-Am with some
             asshole movie star shot 82 here
             once... how did a great ball-
             striker like you, a `legend,'
             manage to shoot an 83?

                           TIN CUP
             I missed a four foot putt on the
             eighteen for an 82, that's how...

                           SIMMS
             It ain't like playing some muni
             track in Brownsville, is it?

A voice interrupts.

                           MOLLY
             Does, `integrity, tradition, and
             honor' include kicking a man when
             he's down?

                           SIMMS
             Oh, Mol', this is just guy stuff,
             bar talk, part of the game -- no
             offense, right, Cup?

No answer.    Tin Cup's about as low as one can go.

                           MOLLY
                    (defensively)
             This man still has a lot of good
             golf shots in his system --

                           TIN CUP
                    (trying to hide)
             Molly, it's okay, go away... I
             don't need any attention right

                                                           100.
          now...

                        SOME GUY AT THE BAR
                 (to Tin Cup)
          You the guy shot 83?!

                        MOLLY
          David, I'll bet you a hundred
          dollars right now that Roy here
          can hit a ball --
                 (looks around)
          -- from right here to... through
          that door to the patio...

She points to a double door, forty feet away across, the
bar, about an 8 x 8 foot opening.

                        TIN CUP
          Molly, please...

                        MOLLY
                 (to bartender)
          And give me a vodka tonic with a
          twist --

                        SIMMS
          Molly, really, this isn't...
          dignified...

                        MOLLY
          Roy?

                        TIN CUP
          I wanta go back to Texas...

                        MOLLY
          What about the river, the piranha,
          the immortality? All that
          bullshit? You gonna drag your ass
          home with an 83?
                 (looks around)
          In fact, two hundred says he can
          hit it through that door, over the
          patio, into the river, and make
          that pelican fly off that post.

Everyone strains to look --


POV - ABOUT 170 YARDS AWAY

A pelican sits on a piling in the river.   Impossible.


BACK TO SCENE

                                                            101.
                        SIMMS
          This is ridiculous...

But Romeo's sizing it up.

                        ROMEO
          You got that shot, Pods, hood the
          seven, turn it over, start it low,
          right to left...

Molly takes a swig of her drink and slaps some money on
the bar.

                        MOLLY
          I'm not leaving till one of you
          men starts acting in a manly
          fashion.

Simms puts a hundred dollar bill on the counter.

                        SIMMS
          Let's just get this over with.
          One ball, one swing, one gull.

                         MOLLY
          Roy?

Tin Cup still sits, head half buried at the bar. He's
never passed up such an opportunity, but he's pretty low.

                         ROMEO
          You the man.

He turns from his bar stool, glances at the situation.

                         TIN CUP
          One swing?   Four to one odds.

                        SIMMS
          I'll make it ten to one. Stick it
          up your ass. I'm leading the
          Open.

                        MOLLY
          Now we're talking! Manly men!

Whoas! From the barside gallery. Tin Cup rises and
someone hands him a club. Suddenly there's a crowd,
including Gary McCord who's been watching from the far
end of the bar. He grabs a seltzer hose as if it's a
mike and begins announcing.

                        McCORD
          ... He's looking at thirty yards
          of bar and grill, an opening
          through the French doors, forty
          yards of patio umbrellas, a

                                                                102.
               hundred yards of water, and a
               lonely pelican sitting out there
               in a 15 mile an hour breeze, south
               by southwest...
                      (beat)
               He'll probably try to shut down a
               four iron -- no, he's selected his
               trusty seven iron...

     Tin Cup steps up to a ball lying on the carpet.

                             TIN CUP
               Kind of a thin lie...

                             SIMMS
               Beats all that deep rough you were
               in today...

                             ROMEO
               Fore in the grill! Fore on the
               patio! You're the legend, boss...

     Tin Cup suddenly backs off the swing and turns to Molly.

                             TIN CUP
               What is this all about?

                             MOLLY
               Shut up and hit the ball.

                             McCORD
                      (on "mike")
               The Ledge still has to be thinking
               about that brutal, ego-sapping,
               manhood-robbing eighty-three he
               buried himself under yesterday. I
               mean, that's just an avalanche of
               golf swings, a landslide, a
               pyroclastic flow --

                             TIN CUP
               Dollar bills...


98   And he swings -- the ball rockets through the hall and     98
     clears the open door...

     The bettors pile from the bar and grill and race to the
     patio to watch the flight of the ball, as --

     It's carrying, it's hooking, it's carrying, then:

     THWACK! -- It hits the piling!    The SEAGULL lifts off,
     SCREECHING angrily.

                             ROMEO
               Stiff, baby, stiff!

                                                                  103.


99    A whoop goes up -- And Simms storms out.                    99

                              SIMMS
                I'm outta here. You're all nuts.

                              MOLLY
                I musta been blind thinking you
                were worth a shit, Simmsy!
                       (raucously)
                Drinks on me, boys! Helluva shot,
                Roy!

                              TIN CUP
                Actually I thinned it a little or
                that pelican'd be flying around
                with a Titleist up his ass...

      This is the old Tin Cup -- and he's in the clubhouse with
      an eightyfuckingthree.

                                                     CUT TO:


100   EXT. WINNEBAGO IN PARKING LOT - NIGHT                       100

      Pouring rain -- Lightning and THUNDERSTORMS.   It pours
      down on the club and the beat-up RV.

      Romeo stands outside with an umbrella, dragging on a
      cigarette, trying to stay warm.


101   INT. WINNEBAGO - NIGHT                                      101

      Tin Cup and Molly in bed, lit only by light spilling in
      from a parking lamp. They make love with enthusiasm,
      finally wobbling to a stop.

      Silence, except for the rain.   Until:

                              TIN CUP
                I kinda shanked it, eh?

                              MOLLY
                No, no, no... you were great...

                              TIN CUP
                Tempo is everything...

                              MOLLY
                Perfection's unobtainable...

                              TIN CUP
                Mighta rushed it on the downswing...

                                                                   104.
                              MOLLY
                Come over the top a little...

                              TIN CUP
                Yeah... well, as Walter Hagen once
                said -- 'Sex and golf are the only
                two things you can be bad at and
                still enjoy...'

                               MOLLY
                Let's take a mulligan and tee
                it up again --

      They embrace with enthusiasm and start thrashing again.


102   BACK OUTSIDE                                                 102

      Romeo's patience is getting thin.   He pounds on the door.

                              ROMEO
                You guys done yet? This is no
                time for a marathon...

      The rain keeps coming down.

                The sun is struggling to come out,
                the course is drying up, and in
                case you're just joining us, the
                leaders have just reached the
                ninth hole because of delayed

                -- David Simms is clinging to a
                one shot lead over Peter Jacobsen...
                but the real story is out on
                sixteen where a driving range pro
                who shot an opening eighty-three
                is making a run at perhaps the
                most legendary round of golf in
                Open history, Johnny Miller's
                sixty-three at Oakmont -- Ben
                Wright is in the tower at

105    EXT. SIXTEENTH HOLE - DAY                                   105

       We hear Ben Wright's voice as Tin Cup marks his ball on
       the green. A small gallery has begun to follow him.

                               WRIGHT (V.O.)
                 If anyone was ever to make a run
                 at what is the most storied number
                 in Open history, Miller's sixty-
                 three, it would be today when the
                 rain has softened the greens,
                 enabling the players to take dead
                 aim at the flags. Still, the
                 unswerving courage of an unknown
                 driving range pro from Salome has
                 raised that humble journeyman from
                 the ashes of an ignominious
                 eighty-three to wave a mighty fist
                 at the pantheon of golf's
                 immortals. This man, this Roy
                 McAvoy has laid siege to the
                 record book by birdieing the first
                 seven holes. A brave par from the
                 water at eight, and a glorious
                 birdie three at the daunting
                 twelfth, another at thirteen...

       Tin Cup gets his read, and steps up to putt.

                               WRIGHT (V.O.)
                 ... this putt to go ten under for
                 the day...

       Tin Cup putts -- When the ball is still two feet from the
       hole, Tin Cup raises his putter in triumph... and sure
       enough, the ball drops in the hole.

       Tin Cup knocks his approach to within six feet of the
       cup. The swelling gallery at the green roars.

                They said on the radio he was ten

      Silence, everyone watching the TV, everyone starting to
      contort in body-English, then:

      A joyous roar -- Tin Cup's putt went down.    Earl twirls
      with glee.

                              EARL
                He's shooting the lowest round
                ever!

                              CLINT
                And eighteen's a par five. A
                birdie there, he shoots sixty!

                              DOREEN
                We gotta go, boys. We gotta get
                us on a Continental Trailways and
                find this damn place!

                                                      CUT TO:


108   EXT. TELEVISION TOWER - DAY                                 108

      The MONITOR shows Tin Cup approaching his ball in the
      fairway. Ken Venturi is commentating.

                              VENTURI
                McAvoy's hit another big drive,
                but this is not a shot he wants to
                get aggressive with...


109   EXT. EIGHTEENTH FAIRWAY - DAY                               109

      Tin Cup and Romeo survey the shot -- a long downhill
      carry over a lake to a slightly elevated green. A shot
      similar to the one he pulled off at the best-ball.

                              ROMEO
                Two-sixty to carry, Roy. You got
                to lay up, man. I don't care how
                good you swinging. You got to lay

                                                                    107.
                up.

      Tin Cup looks at the iron Romeo proffers. He looks back
      at the shot, throws some grass in the air, testing the
      wind. He looks at the gallery, the lake, the green, the
      whole grand setting... and then:

      He locates Molly behind the gallery ropes, watching.    She
      makes a little charging gesture with her fist. And:

      Tin Cup reaches defiantly past Romeo and pulls out the
      three wood.


110   EXT. TELEVISION TOWER - DAY                                   110

      Venturi and Nantz watch Tin Cup set up to play the shot.

                              VENTURI
                His adrenalin's gotten the better
                of him, Jim. If he lays up he
                takes bogey out of play.

                              VENTURI (CONT'D)
                But if he knocks this ball in the
                water he could make seven or eight.
                And he still has to think about
                making the cut.

                              SUMMERALL
                Well, every golf fan in America is
                pulling for him.


111   Wearing that look, the look of eagles, Tin Cup addresses 111
      his ball... And he swings -- The ball arches off his
      club, the gallery roars, and...

                                TIN CUP
                Nope.

      ... Tin Cup drops the three wood on his bag, even as:

                                ROMEO
                Carry, honey!    Please!   Carry!


      LAKE

      The ball plunks in the water inches short of dry land.
      The GALLERY GROANS.


      BACK UP FAIRWAY

      Tin Cup smiles at Molly with chagrin but not defeat.    He
      turns to Romeo.

                                                                   108.

                              TIN CUP
                What the hell. You ride 'er till
                she bucks you or you don't ride at
                all. I can save par from here.

      Tin Cup hits a wedge to within five feet.

                                 ROMEO
                Up an' down...

                How do you go from shooting an
                eighty-three one day to a record-
                breaking sixty-two the next?

                              TIN CUP
                Well, it wasn't from clean
                living...

      Laughter from the reporters.       Reporter #1 follows up.

                              REPORTER #1
                If you had to do it again, would
                you still go for the green on
                eighteen?

                              TIN CUP
                Yeah. And I'll go for it tomorrow
                and I'll go for it Sunday, cuz I
                didn't come here to play for no
                second.

      A huge gallery lines the fairway and girds the green as
      Tin Cup approaches his ball in the middle of the fairway.
      The fans holler "You da man" at Tin Cup.

      Nantz and Venturi in the booth. Tin Cup is on the
      monitor, arriving at his ball. We hear SHOUTS from the
      GALLERY, encouraging him to go for the green.

                               VENTURI
                It's the same shot he knocked in
                the water yesterday. And the
                thing for him to do right now is
                to tune out the gallery, rein in
                his emotions, and forget what he
                said in yesterday's interview. He
                has to lay up.

                Gimme the three wood.

      Romeo picks up some grass and flips it in the air.   It
      blows away from the green.

                              ROMEO
                There's wind up there.

                              TIN CUP

                Well, he hasn't shown an ounce of
                fear all day.

                              VENTURI
                This isn't courage, Jim. This is
                inexperience, pure and simple.

      Tin Cup steps up to his shot.

                              TIN CUP
                This is for Venturi, up there in
                the booth, thinking I should lay
                up...
                       (addressing his ball)
                Dollar bills...

      He swings and holds the pose. He caught the ball
      perfectly -- it sails high and true into the luffing
      breeze, the GALLERY ROARS, and...

      ... the ball drops, SPLOOSH! into the WATER, a couple
      feet short of dry land. The GALLERY GROANS.`


      BACK TO TIN CUP

      Staring amazed, almost betrayed, that his ball didn't
      carry the water.

                              TIN CUP
                That's a long fucking ways.
                       (holds out his hand)
                Gimme another ball.

                What?

                              ROMEO
                It's a water hazard. You go up
                there and take a drop. Try to
                save par like you did yesterday.

      Tin Cup's eyes blink with thought as Romeo's words get
      through to him.

                                TIN CUP
                You're right.    What the hell was I
                thinking?

      And he starts down to the water. A THUNDEROUS OVATION
      greets his approach, and he raises his hat to salute the
      fans saluting him.

                I'm just trying to understand your

      CLOSE ON MOLLY

      Her face close to Tin Cup's.    Both awake.

                                                                   114.
                                MOLLY
                  You nervous about tomorrow?

                                TIN CUP
                  Yeah, I'm nervous. So's everybody
                  else. But I only gotta come and
                  catch Simms. Sixty-seven guys
                  gotta come and get me...

       Silence.   Except for the random snore.

                                TIN CUP
                  It won't always be like this...
                  y'know... with me... surrounded by
                  all these guys... snoring... a
                  stripper ex-girlfriend on the
                  floor... my caddie sleeping next to
                  her... all of us damn near
                  broke... won't always be like
                  this...

       She puts her finger over his mouth gently.

                                MOLLY
                  Yes it will... yes it will... and
                  it's okay...

       Tin Cup slips out of the trailer -- Romeo follows.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

       Tin Cup hitting golf balls alone, except for the faith-
       ful Romeo, getting ready for the final round of the U.S.
       Open.

       Molly serves coffee to the regulars.     She's upset.

                                MOLLY
                  Which one of you is the bookie?

                                DEWEY
                  We all are, but Earl's the best.

                                                                  115.
                               MOLLY
                 What are the odds that Roy will win?

                               EARL
                 Vegas has him at ten to one. They're
                 sure he's gonna self-destruct.

                               MOLLY
                 Those sound good to me -- I want
                 you to place a bet for me. Five
                 thousand nine hundred dollars on
                 Tin Cup to win.

      They stare nervously.

                               CURT
                 That's your nestegg.

                               EARL
                 That's a bad idea, honey -- we
                 love him, but he's gonna fuck-
                 up --

                               MOLLY
                 I said put it all on Roy.    Got
                 it?

                               DEWEY
                 We can't let you --

                               MOLLY
                 Boys --

      Silence.   Molly's in charge.    She hands them a roll of
      cash.

                               MOLLY
                 Put it all on Tin Cup.

      Earl reluctantly takes the money.

124   EXT. PUTTING GREEN - MORNING                                124

      Tin Cup hits putts, intense, focused.    Peter Jacobsen
      works his way over to Tin Cup.

                               JACOBSEN
                 Looking a little tight, Ledge.

                               TIN CUP
                 Musta got too much sleep last
                 night. How you choking?

                                                                 116.
                              JACOBSEN
                Just got one thought in my head.
                Ten under. That's my number.

      Tin Cup looks up, amused by the gamesmanship.

                              TIN CUP
                No one's ever been ten under for
                the Open, not even Nicklaus.

                              JACOBSEN
                That's right, Ledge. Not even
                Nicklaus.

      And he moves off to putt. Tin Cup drops a couple balls
      on the green to putt, and:

      A ball rolls past them and into a hole.   Tin Cup looks
      over and sees Simms.

                              SIMMS
                Sorry, Roy, can't believe I didn't
                see you with all that high-priced
                endorsement crap you're flaunting.

                               TIN CUP
                That's always been your problem,
                Dave. You don't think about
                winning; you just want to look
                good.
                       (turns away
                         to putt)
                Thing is, this ain't a beauty
                pageant.
                       (turns back, getting
                         in Simms' face)
                And it ain't a rain-shortened Quad
                Cities or a Greater Greensboro you
                can back into. This is you'n me,
                pal. This is match-play, and this
                time you ain't getting no three
                shots.

125   EXT. FIRST TEE - HIGH ANGLE - DAY                          125

      A large gallery surrounds the tree and lines the fairway
      as:

                              STARTER
                With the honor in the final
                pairing, from Salome, Texas, Mr.
                Roy McAvoy.

      Boisterous applause.   Tin Cup tips his cap and nods at

                                                                   117.
      David Simms, his pairing in this the final twosome of the
      final round of the U.S. Open.

                              TIN CUP
                Fairways and greens, Dave... and
                don't forget to wave as I blow by.

                              SIMMS
                You mean blow up? Like you always
                do?

      And Tin Cup moves to the tee.

      His hand shakes worse than it did the first day as he
      tees his ball. Stepping back to line up his shot, he
      peers down the fairway through a narrow corridor of
      faces. A daunting sight. He edges over to Romeo and
      tautly whispers:

                              TIN CUP
                Do me a favor. Bet me a buck I
                don't put it in the fairway.

                              ROMEO
                I bet you a hundred.

                              TIN CUP
                Okay, good.
                       (going to tee off)
                Puts things back in perspective.

                                                     CUT TO:


126   EXT. FIRST HOLE - MINUTE LATER                               126

      Tin Cup looks at his ball, almost invisible in the deep
      rough. He tries to locate the green beyond the trees
      that surround him. In golf parlance, he's in jail. He
      selects a club.

                              ROMEO
                Which way you going?

      Tin Cup points over the trees.   Romeo grimaces.   Tin Cup
      addresses the shot. Then:

      Tin Cup swings -- the ball flutters weakly out of the
      rough and disappears into the branches of a bushy tree,
      dropping eventually next to its trunk, and:

                                                     CUT TO:


127   LEADER BOARD                                                 127

      A scorer changes the number beside Tin Cup's name from -7

      to -5.   Simms is still -7.

      Tin Cup arrives on the tee where Simms now has the honor.

                               SIMMS
                 Nice double, Roy.

                               TIN CUP
                 Just keep making pars, asshole.

                               SIMMS
                 I'll take eighteen of 'em.

                               TIN CUP
                 And I will own you.

129   EXT. THIRD GREEN - DAY                                      129

      Molly and Doreen stand together behind the big gallery.
      Molly is using a cardboard periscope to look over the
      gallery to the green. Doreen is on her tip-toes but all
      she can see are the backs of heads.

      A swell of cheers builds, then turns to groans.

                               MOLLY
                 Oh no, Tin Cup ran it five feet
                 past.
                        (beat)
                 How did he get the name 'Tin Cup'?

                               DOREEN (O.S.)
                 He played catcher on the high
                 school baseball team. The star
                 pitcher had this big-league curve,
                 and not all his pitches hit Roy
                 in the mitt. Finally, you gotta
                 respect a man's doggedness. You
                 know?
                        (beat)
                 The team decided Tin Cup sounded
                 better than Clank.

      Molly puts down the periscope at that remark, and hands
      it to Doreen.

                               MOLLY
                 'Clank''s not a good name for a
                 man...

                                                                 119.

      Doreen looks through the periscope.


      PERISCOPE'S POV - TIN CUP

      lining up a putt.   She pans over to Romeo helping him.

                              DOREEN (V.O.)
                Tell me something, Molly... have
                you ever had a Latin lover?

      The regulars study the board -- the scruffiest lot ever
      seen at an Open. Next to them stand a group of U.S.G.A.
      officials, all in neat, matching blazers. The contrast
      is thrilling.

                              CLINT
                Our boy's in trouble... ya think
                he's chokin'?

                              EARL
                Our boy don't choke. He fucks up
                but he don't choke...

      The scorer changes the number beside Tin Cup's name to
      -- -4. Simms is -7, and --

131   EXT. TV TOWER - DAY                                        131

      Wright looks at the monitor where Tin Cup stands among
      some trees.

                              BEN WRIGHT
                This is disaster for McAvoy.
                After losing three shots to par in
                the first four holes, he should
                have just taken iron off the tee
                to get the ball in play. Does he
                have any shot at all, Gary McCord?


132   EXT. FIFTH HOLE - DAY                                      132

      Tin Cup's ball lies on dirt next to the trunk of a tree.
      He surveys his options. Behind him, wearing a headset,
      McCord analyzes the situation for the TV viewers.

                                                                  120.
                              McCORD
                This is definite jail. This is
                life without parole. His only
                chance to stage a jail-break is go
                at the ball left-handed and hope
                he can somehow snake it back into
                the fairway, and save par from
                there.

      Tin Cup glares balefully back at McCord. Then he walks
      over to a nearby tree, and surveys the line to the green
      from it. He walks back for his ball, turns to McCord...
      and we see that familiar fierceness aflame in Tin Cup's
      eyes.

                              TIN CUP
                Fifty bucks says I knock it on...
                with a seven iron.

      And he selects the seven iron, addresses the ball right- handed,
      and:

      He swings -- the ball rockets low off his club, and...

      ... it ricochets off the trunk of a nearby tree, and...

      ... it bounces up the fairway, skitters past a trap, and
      trickles onto the green, stopping ten feet from the pin.

      The gallery goes crazy as Tin Cup steps from the woods
      collecting his money from McCord while jabbing a taunting
      finger at Simms.


133   INT. TELEVISION TOWER                                       133

      Nantz and Wright stare at the monitors.

                That took balls...


134   EXT. GOLF COURSE                                            134

      Simms ignores Tin Cup's taunt, and lines up his shot.

                              SIMMS
                       (to himself)
                That's just Roy being Roy. Just
                wait him out, Dave. Just make
                pars. Let him make the mistakes.

      And he hits his iron to the fat part of the green, and --

                                TIN CUP (O.S.)
                Beauty, Dave.    Par written all
                over it.

      The scorer posts a -5 next to Tin Cup's name.   Simms is
      still at -7, and --

136   EXT. GOLF COURSE - NINTH GREEN                              136

      Tin Cup intently follows the flight of his iron shot, as:

      The ball lands near the front of the green, bounces, then
      rolls, following the contour of the green. It finally
      stops five feet from the pin.

      A SWELLING, DEAFENING ROAR from the GALLERY accompanies
      the unfolding shot, and --


137   EXT. TENTH TEE                                              137

      Jacobsen looks toward the roar at the ninth green.

                              JACOBSEN
                He's making his run.

138   EXT. LEADER BOARD                                           138

      The scorer posts a -6 next to Tin Cup's name.   Simms is
      still at -7.

      Molly and Doreen watch Tin Cup drain a putt.

                              MOLLY
                       (still watching
                        Tin Cup)
                So why'd you leave him?

                              DOREEN
                You ever dated a guy who actually
                believes in soul mates?

                                MOLLY
                Actually, no.

                              DOREEN
                He thinks he's a tough guy, but
                he's a hopeless romantic.

                                                                   122.
      And as the gallery falls silent, she turns to watch Tin
      Cup.

      GALLERY GROANS, sharing his agony, and --


141   EXT. TWELFTH TEE                                             141

      Jacobsen, pausing to watch, sighs with relief before
      starting down the fairway.

      Tin Cup follows the flight of his approach, and up ahead
      on:


143   EXT. FOURTEENTH TEE - DAY                                    143

      Peter Jacobsen hears the GALLERY ROAR.   He turns to his
      caddie, incredulous.

                              JACOBSEN
                He's throwing darts back there.
                We gotta make birdies, Squeaky, or
                we are playing for second.

      And he snatches his driver from the bag, determined to
      make birdies.

                                                      CUT TO:

145   EXT. FOURTEENTH GREEN - DAY                                  145

      Jacobsen rolls a long putt into the hole, and as the
      GALLERY CHEERS, he points a finger of challenge back at --

      Tin Cup waiting in the fairway.   Tin Cup seems to enjoy
      the taunt.

                              TIN CUP
                That's right, Peter. You'n me.
                That's all there is.

                                                                   123.

      And he selects a club, and...

146   INT. DRIVING RANGE (SALOME) - DAY                            146

      Tin Cup's fans, deeply into the beer by now, contort with
      body-english and holler at the TV screen.

                                FANS
                Get in there!    Come on!   Go down!

      They explode with cheers.   Some twirl with glee.   Others
      exchange high fives.

                              EARL
                He's tied for the lead again!    And
                they're running outta holes!

      The leader board is superimposed on the monitor.    McAvoy
      -8, Jacobsen -8, Simms -7.

                              NANTZ
                So it's come down to the seventy-
                second hole of this great
                championship, and the skill and
                courage of three Texans who have
                dueled throughout the day for the
                chance to be crowned Open
                Champion... Peter Jacobsen is on
                the fairway at 8 under, McAvoy at
                the 18th tee is tied at minus 8,
                and David Simms trails by one...


148   EXT. EIGHTEENTH TEE                                          148

      Tin Cup and Romeo watch Jacobsen hit his shot.

                              TIN CUP
                Jacobsen's laying up.
                       (turning to Simms)
                You ain't gonna have that luxury,
                Dave. Not if you play to win.

      He moves to the tee, and...

149   EXT. TELEVISION TOWER                                       149

      The monitor shows Tin Cup's drive bounding down the
      middle of the fairway.

                              NANTZ
                McAvoy's hit a perfect drive, Ken.

                              VENTURI
                I'm not sure that's good news for
                McAvoy. With his inexperience,
                the last thing he needs is an
                excuse to fool with that water
                again today.


150   BACK TO TEE                                                 150

      Tin Cup whispers to Romeo as Simms tees up.

                              TIN CUP
                I didn't catch it all.

                              ROMEO
                Then you got to lay up.

      Simms rips a drive down the middle, the ball landing
      a little short of Roy's.


151   EXT. EIGHTEENTH FAIRWAY - DAY                               151

      Tin Cup in the fairway, studying his shot.

                              TIN CUP
                So birdie wins it.

      He looks at Simms, ten yards across the fairway from him.

                              TIN CUP
                You or me, Dave?

      Simms points to himself. He has a wood in his hands, but
      he puts the club back and reaches for an iron. Tin Cup
      edges closer to Romeo.

                              TIN CUP
                       (whispering)
                He's laying up. Birdie to tie,
                eagle to win, and that gutless
                wonder's laying up.

                              ROMEO
                       (whispering)
                Par to tie, birdie to win... you
                lay up too, Roy. You can make
                birdie laying up.

                                                           125.

They watch Simms lay up. Then Romeo offers Tin Cup an
iron, hoping he'll take it.

                         TIN CUP
          You know something, Romeo? Eagle
          puts me ten under. No one's ever
          finished an Open ten under, not
          even Nicklaus.

                         ROMEO
          You don't need an eagle. Birdie
          wins, par ties.
                 (firmly)
          Hit the lay up. Hole a wedge for
          goddamn eagle.

Tin Cup throws some grass in the air, looks back at the
green, the gallery, the whole grand setting... and he
seeks out Molly's face in the crowd. He moves over so
she can hear him.

                        TIN CUP
          This is everything, ain't it?
          This is the choice it comes down
          to. This is our immortality...

                        ROMEO
          No time to be thinkin'
          'immortality,' Cup... time to be
          thinkin' 7 iron.

Molly stands with Doreen, hearing Tin Cup's words.
Thrilled and terrified and spellbound, she finds herself
nodding. Doreen, on the other is turning ash-white.

                       DOREEN
          Oh no. This is what always
          happens. He's going for it.

                        MOLLY
          Go for it!

                        DOREEN
          No! He just needs par to tie!
          Tell him to lay up! He listens to
          you!

                        MOLLY
          Go for it, Roy! Knock it on!

                        DOREEN
          This is why we split up -- he
          always went for it...

                        MOLLY
          My problem is I've never been with

                                                                 126.
                a man who went for it...

                              DOREEN
                Well, honey, he's your guy.


      BACK TO TIN CUP

      He selects the three wood.    Romeo sighs.


152   EXT. TELEVISION TOWER - DAY                                152

                              NANTZ
                Good Lord, he's going for the
                green.

                              VENTURI
                This could be tragic.


153   EXT. EIGHTEENTH FAIRWAY                                    153

      Tin Cup's eyes focus with the look of eagles as he
      addresses the shot.

                              TIN CUP
                One swing, Roy. One good swing.
                Dollar bills...

      He swings -- the ball explodes off his club.   Tin Cup
      holds the pose...

                                TIN CUP
                We're home...

      Suddenly a gust of wind blows, out of nowhere, and Tin
      Cup's cap blows off, provoking immediate concern.

                              TIN CUP
                ... little gust there, Romes...


154   TELEVISION MONITOR                                         154

      Picking up the flight of the ball approaching the green,
      carried it seems by the swelling roar of the gallery.
      The ball clears the water...

      ... and lands at the top of the slope fronting the
      elevated green. It pops up in the air, lands just past
      where it hit, and comes momentarily to rest. The gallery
      roars. And then:

      The ball starts trickling back down the slope, gaining
      speed, moving towards the water, even as the gallery
      screams for it to stop...

                                                                 127.

      ... until finally it disappears into the water with
      scarcely a ripple.


155   BACK TO TIN CUP                                            155

      He stares first with betrayal, then with anger, and
      looks at Romeo, who just shrugs, then at Molly.

                              MOLLY
                You can still make par from up
                there --

                              ROMEO
                She's right, Pods, a drop and a
                stroke, up and down par -- we'll
                win it in sudden death.

      But Tin Cup still has the look of eagles. He's staring
      at the shot he just made, still holding the three wood.

                              TIN CUP
                I nutted that thing. Little gust
                from the gods cost me...

                              ROMEO
                Helluva move you put on that
                sucker, now let's get up there,
                take the drop, and make our par,
                tie Peter...

                              TIN CUP
                I can make this shot.

                              ROMEO
                Not now.

                              TIN CUP
                Now.

      Tin Cup throws another ball on the ground.

                              TIN CUP
                I'm playing it from here.

                              MOLLY
                Take your drop and make your par!

      Tin Cup addresses the ball.

      drop from his original lie.

                              VENTURI
                I don't believe this. He just
                took himself out of the tournament
                with that drop. He could have
                walked up to the hazard line,
                saved par with a wedge and forced
                a playoff with Jacobsen. Now he
                needs a miracle shot.

                              McCORD (V.O.)
                Ken, I'm right behind McAvoy here.
                And all he said to his caddie was:
                I can make it across.


157   EXT. EIGHTEENTH FAIRWAY - DAY                               157

      Tin Cup swings again -- The ball sails long and true once
      again, and once again...


158   ... it lands into the hill, bounces once, and trickles      158
      back into the water.

                               VENTURI (V.O.)
                Oh, my.   This is tragic.

      Holding his hand out to Romeo, as the gallery murmurs
      uncomfortably.

                              TIN CUP
                Gimme another ball.


      BACK TO DOREEN AND MOLLY

      watching behind the ropes.

                              MOLLY
                I can't believe he's doing this.

                              DOREEN

                He can blow the whole tournament!

                              DOREEN
                It's a miracle he lasted this
                long...

      waiting at the green, amidst the rest of the gallery
      who's in shock about Tin Cup's decisions to keep going
      for it, keep trying to prove a point.

                               CLINT
                 He done blew a gasket, boys...

                               EARL
                 The wheels is definitely falling

                 It was a miracle while it
                 lasted...


      REGULARS' POV

      Tin Cup swings a third time.

                                                      CUT TO:


161   EXT. EIGHTEENTH GREEN - DAY                               161

      A BALL lands SPLOOSH! in the WATER, and...


162   BACK UP FAIRWAY                                           162

      Tin Cup holds out his hand for yet another ball, saying
      nothing.

      Romeo hands him another ball.

      Tin Cup unloads another 3-wood.    Another splash.

      Tin Cup holds out his hand again.

                               ROMEO
                 This is your last ball, man. If
                 this gets wet, you disqualified.

                               TIN CUP
                 I can make it across.

      Tin Cup snatches the ball from Romeo's hand.


163   EXT. TELEVISION TOWER                                     163

      Venturi and Nantz can barely look at the monitor.

                                                                  130.

                              VENTURI
                This is the most painful thing
                I've ever watched.

                              McCORD (V.O.)
                Jim, this is the last ball he has
                in his bag. If he doesn't finish
                the hole with it, he can't turn in
                a card. He'll be disqualified.

      Venturi and Nantz cover their eyes.

      Tin Cup unloads another three wood -- another splash.

164   BACK TO TIN CUP                                             164

      He looks at Molly.

      CLOSE ON MOLLY

      She's just laughing.

      Romeo tosses down another ball -- Tin Cup launches
      his fifth attempt to clear the pond. Splash.

                              MOLLY
                You're right, Roy, what the hell!
                Let 'er rip!

                              DOREEN
                You two are made for each other.

      BACK TO TIN CUP

      This is still all business to him.    He sets his jaw,
      addresses the shot, and:

                              TIN CUP
                Dollar bills...

      He swings -- another perfect shot... but this time the
      wind relents a knot, and:

165   BALL                                                        165

      clears the water, clears the slope, hits the front of the
      green, rolls up toward the pin, and drops in the hole.
      The gallery goes berserk!

166   BACK TO TIN CUP                                             166

      Raising his three wood aloft in triumph, he looks over at
      Molly and finally cracks a smile.

                                                                   131.

166   CONTINUED:                                                   166

      And when she smiles back, he takes his hat off and walks
      to the green, to as great an ovation as the game has ever
      heard.

      Tin Cup and Simms sign their cards and get up to leave in
      unison. Simms turns to Tin Cup and has to shake his
      head.

                                 SIMMS
                   I gotta hand it to you, Roy.   When
                   you go down, you go down in
                   flames.

                                 TIN CUP
                   Someday you can tell your
                   grandchildren you finished second
                   in the U.S. Open...
                          (beat)
                   -- just don't tell 'em how.

      And he moves brusquely past Simms and out of the tent,
      congratulating Tubbs, the winner, as he passes.

                                 TIN CUP
                   Good job, Tubbsy... you won it.

      And out of the scorer's tent...


169   EXT. SCORER'S TENT                                           169

      A roar goes up from the milling fans as Tin Cup emerges.
      He tries to smile, but it's all dawning on him.

                                 TIN CUP
                   My God... I just gave away the
                   Open...

      And then McCord is there, shoving a mike in Tin Cup's
      face.

                                                                  132.
                               McCORD
                 Ledge, I know it's tough to talk
                 right now, but --

                               TIN CUP
                 It's not difficult to talk... it's
                 difficult to explain... I coulda
                 laid up and still won. I made a
                 twelve on the last hole of the U.S.
                 Open. You know how much money
                 that cost me?

                               McCORD
                 Cost you a bundle...

                               TIN CUP
                 I gotta get outta here.

                               McCORD
                 It was the greatest 12 I ever saw.
                 Back to you, Jim...

       Tin Cup exits the scorers' tent and runs into the
       regulars -- They're beaming, undyingly loyal.

                               CLINT AND EARL
                 Greatest 12 I ever saw... you
                 crunched that dog, baby...
                 gorgeous shot, etc...

       He looks up and there's Molly -- He stops short.    They
       embrace.

                               TIN CUP
                 Molly, I'm an idiot. I gave away
                 the Open. The one time in my life
                 I know the play is to hit the lay
                 up -- my whole life and future
                 and career on the line, and I
                 still can't make myself do it. I
                 am a twisted human being and a
                 cautionary tale. And I guess I'm
                 a fool?

                                MOLLY
                 Yes.   A magnificent fool...

       Tin Cup and Molly are sitting, feet up, a couple Lone
       Star beers beside them, just taking in the warm Texas
       night. Her head rests on his shoulder. The world at
       peace.

                               TIN CUP
                 Some people don't like West Texas
                 but I think it's the most
                 beautiful place on earth...

                               MOLLY
                 It has its charms...
                        (beat)
                 Y'know, by finishing in the top 15
                 at the Open you qualified to be in
                 it next year --

                               TIN CUP
                 Damn, I didn't know that...

                               MOLLY
                 I'm thinking with your game you
                 should go back to the Qualifying
                 School, try to get out on tour...

                               TIN CUP
                 Then I wouldn't see you...

                               MOLLY
                 Actually, I picked up a whole
                 bunch of new clients at the Open.
                 Lotta guys on the tour said if I
                 could do that much for you,
                 imagine what I could do for
                 them...

                               TIN CUP
                 There's a lotta head cases out
                 there, you could make a bundle...

                               MOLLY

Silence.

           Y'know... a man goes through what
           I've gone through, he's supposed
           to learn something.
                  (beat)
           I'm trying to figure out what I
           learned. Did I learn anything?

                         MOLLY
           You're learning some discipline and
           self-control...

                         TIN CUP
           And that there's a time in life to
           play it safe...

                           MOLLY
           That's great,   Roy... and I'm learning
           how to listen   to the tuning fork,
           throw caution   to the wind, and take
           crazy risks I   never thought were
           possible...

                         TIN CUP
           C'mon, Molly, when did you ever take
           a crazy risk?

                         MOLLY
           I fell for you...


WIDE SHOT - LANDSCAPE

A desolate driving range outside of Salome, Texas. Bugs,
trucks passing in the night, and a tiny RADIO SENDING
GEORGE JONES across the plains.

                                                 FADE OUT.

                              a screenplay by
                               James Cameron



1 BLACKNESS

Then two faint lights appear, close together... growing brighter. They
resolve into two DEEP SUBMERSIBLES, free-falling toward us like express
elevators.

One is ahead of the other, and passes close enough to FILL FRAME, looking
like a spacecraft blazing with lights, bristling with insectile
manipulators.

TILTING DOWN to follow it as it descends away into the limitless blackness
below. Soon they are fireflies, then stars. Then gone.

                                                                   CUT TO:

2 EXT./ INT. MIR ONE / NORTH ATLANTIC DEEP

PUSHING IN on one of the falling submersibles, called MIR ONE, right up to
its circular viewport to see the occupants.

INSIDE, it is a cramped seven foot sphere, crammed with equipment. ANATOLY
MIKAILAVICH, the sub's pilot, sits hunched over his controls... singing
softly in Russian.

Next to him on one side is BROCK LOVETT. He's in his late forties, deeply
tanned, and likes to wear his Nomex suit unzipped to show the gold from
famous shipwrecks covering his gray chest hair. He is a wiley, fast-talking
treasure hunter, a salvage superstar who is part historian, part adventurer
and part vacuum cleaner salesman. Right now, he is propped against the CO2
scrubber, fast asleep and snoring.

On the other side, crammed into the remaining space is a bearded wide-body
named LEWIS BODINE, sho is also asleep. Lewis is an R.O.V. (REMOTELY
OPERATED VEHICLE) pilot and is the resident Titanic expert.

Anatoly glances at the bottom sonar and makes a ballast adjustment.

                                                                   CUT TO:

3 EXT. THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA

A pale, dead-flat lunar landscape. It gets brighter, lit from above, as MIR
ONE enters FRAME and drops to the seafloor in a downblast from its
thrusters. It hits bottom after its two hour free-fall with a loud BONK.

                                                                   CUT TO:

4 INT. MIR ONE

Lovett and Bodine jerk awake at the landing.

                                  ANATOLY

                          (heavy Russian accent)

We are here.

EXT. / INT. MIR ONE AND TWO

5 MINUTES LATER: THE TWO SUBS skim over the seafloor to the sound of
sidescan sonar and the THRUM of big thrusters.

6 The featureless gray clay of the bottom unrols in the lights of the subs.
Bodine is watching the sidescan sonar display, where the outline of a huge
pointed object is visible. Anatoly lies prone, driving the sub, his face
pressed to the center port.

                                  BODINE

Come left a little. She's right in front of us, eighteen meters. Fifteen.
Thirteen... you should see it.

                                  ANATOLY

Do you see it? I don't see it... there!

Out of the darkness, like a ghostly apparition, the bow of the ship
appears. Its knife-edge prow is coming straight at us, seeming to plow the
bottom sediment like ocean waves. It towers above the seafloor, standing
just as it landed 84 years ago.

THE TITANIC. Or what is left of her. Mir One goes up and over the bow
railing, intact except for an overgrowth of "rusticles" draping it like
mutated Spanish moss.

TIGHT ON THE EYEPIECE MONITOR of a video camcorder. Brock Lovett's face
fills the BLACK AND WHITE FRAME.

                                  LOVETT

It still gets me every time.

The image pans to the front viewport, looking over Anatoly's shoulder, to
the bow railing visible in the lights beyond. Anatoly turns.

                                  ANATOLY

Is just your guilt because of estealing from the dead.

CUT WIDER, to show that Brock is operating the camera himself, turning it
in his hand so it points at his own face.

                                  LOVETT

Thanks, Tolya. Work with me, here.

Brock resumes his serious, pensive gaze out the front port, with the camera
aimed at himself at arm's length.

                                  LOVETT

It still gets me every time... to see the sad ruin of the great ship
sitting here, where she landed at 2:30 in the morning, April 15, 1912,
after her long fall from the world above.

Anatoly rolls his eyes and mutters in Russian. Bodine chuckles and watches
the sonar.

                                  BODINE

You are so full of shit, boss.

7 Mir Two drives aft down the starboard side, past the huge anchor while
Mir One passes over the seemingly endless forecastle deck, with its massive
anchor chains still laid out in two neat rows, its bronze windlass caps
gleaming. The 22 foot long subs are like white bugs next to the enormous
wreck.

                               LOVETT (V.O.)

Dive nine. Here we are again on the deck of Titanic... two and a half miles
down. The pressure is three tons per square inch, enough to crush us like a
freight train going over an ant if our hull fails. These windows are nine
inches thick and if they go, it's sayonara in two microseconds.

8 Mir Two lands on the boat deck, next to the ruins of the Officer's
Quarters. Mir One lands on the roof of the deck hous nearby.

                                  LOVETT

Right. Let's go to work.

Bodine slips on a pair of 3-D electronic goggles, and grabs the joystick
controls of the ROV.

9 OUTSIDE THE SUB, the ROV, a small orange and black robot called SNOOP
DOG, lifts from its cradle and flies forward.

                               BODINE (V.O.)

Walkin' the dog.

SNOOP DOG drives itself away from the sub, paying out its umbilical behind
it like a robot yo-yo. Its twin stereo-video cameras swivel like insect
eyes. The ROV descends through an open shaft that once was the beautiful
First Class Grand Staircase.

Snoop Dog goes down several decks, then moves laterally into the First
Class Reception Room.

SNOOP'S VIDEO POV, moving through the cavernous interior. The remains of
the ornate handcarved woodwork which gave the ship its elegance move
through the floodlights, the lines blurred by slow dissolution and
descending rusticle formations. Stalactites of rust hang down so that at
times it looks like a natural grotto, then the scene shifts and the lines
of a ghostly undersea mansion can be seen again.

MONTAGE STYLE, as Snoop passes the ghostly images of Titanic's opulence:

10 A grand piano in amazingly good shape, crashed on its side against a
wall. The keys gleam black and white in the lights.

11 A chandelier, still hanging from the ceiling by its wire... glinting as
Snoop moves around it.

12 Its lights play across the floor, revealing a champagne bottle, then
some WHITE STAR LINE china... a woman's high-top "granny shoe". Then
something eerie: what looks like a child's skull resolves into the
porcelain head of a doll.

Snoop enters a corridor which is much better preserved. Here and there a
door still hangs on its rusted hinges. An ornate piece of molding, a wall
sconce... hint at the grandeur of the past.

13 THE ROV turns and goes through a black doorway, entering room B-52, the
sitting room of a "promenade suite", one of the most luxurious staterooms
on Titanic.

                                  BODINE

I'm in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom B-54.

                                  LOVETT

Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.

                                  BODINE

I'm tryin' boss.

Glinting in the lights are the brass fixtures of the near-perfectly
preserved fireplace. An albino Galathea crab crawls over it. Nearby are the
remains of a divan and a writing desk. The Dog crosses the ruins of the
once elegant room toward another DOOR. It squeezes through the doorframe,
scraping rust and wood chunks loose on both sides. It moves out of a cloud
of rust and keeps on going.

                                  BODINE

I'm crossing the bedroom.

The remains of a pillared canopy bed. Broken chairs, a dresser. Through the
collapsed wall of the bathroom, the porcelain commode and bathtub took
almost new, gleaming in the dark.

                                  LOVETT

Okay, I want to see what's under that wardrobe door.

SEVERAL ANGLES as the ROV deploys its MANIPULATOR ARMS and starts moving
debris aside. A lamp is lifted, its ceramic colors as bright as they were
in 1912.

                                  LOVETT

Easy, Lewis. Take it slow.

Lewis grips a wardrobe door, lying at an angle in a corner, and pulls it
with Snoop's gripper. It moves reluctantly in a cloud of silt. Under it is
a dark object. The silt clears and Snoop's cameras show them what was under
the door...

                                  BODINE

Ooohh daddy-oh, are you seein' what I'm seein'?

CLOSE ON LOVETT, watching his moniteors. By his expression it is like he is
seeing the Holy Grail.

                                  LOVETT

Oh baby baby baby.

                             (grabs the mike)

It's payday, boys.

ON THE SCREEN, in the glare of the lights, is the object of their quest: a
small STEEL COMBINATION SAFE.

                                                                   CUT TO:

14 EXT. STERN OF DECK OF KEDYSH - DAY

THE SAFE, dripping wet in the afternoon sun, is lowered onto the deck of a
ship by a winch cable.

We are on the Russian research vessel AKADEMIK MISTISLAV KELDYSH. A crowd
has gathered, including most of the crew of KELDYSH, the sub crews, and a
hand-wringing money guy named BOBBY BUELL who represents the limited
partners. There is also a documentary video crew, hired by Lovett to cover
his moment of glory.

Everyone crowds around the safe. In the background Mir Two is being lowered
into its cradle on deck by a massive hydraulic arm. Mir One is already
recovered with Lewis Bodine following Brock Lovett as he bounds over to the
safe like a kid on Christman morning.

                                  BODINE

Who's the best? Say it.

                                  LOVETT

You are, Lewis.

                            (to the video crew)

You rolling?

                                 CAMERAMAN

Rolling.

Brock nods to his technicians, and they set about drilling the safe's
hinges. During this operation, Brock amps the suspense, working the lens to
fill the time.

                                  LOVETT

Well, here it is, the moment of truth. Here's where we find out if the
time, the sweat, the money spent to charter this ship and these subs, to
come out here to the middle of the North Atlantic... were worth it. If what
we think is in that same... is in that safe... it will be.

Lovett grins wolfishly in anticipation of his greatest find yet. The door
is pried loose. It clangs onto the deck. Lovett moves closer, peering into
the safe's wet interior. A long moment then... his face says it all.

                                  LOVETT

Shit.

                                  BODINE

You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered.

                                  LOVETT

                         (to the video cameraman)

Get that outta my face.

                                                                   CUT TO:

15 INT. LAB DECK, PRESERVATION ROOM - DAY

Technicians are carefully removing some papers from the safe and placing
them in a tray of water to separate them safely. Nearby, other artifacts
from the stateroom are being washed and preserved.

Buell is on the satellite phone with the INVESTORS. Lovett is yelling at
the video crew.

                                  LOVETT

You send out what I tell you when I tell you. I'm signing your paychecks,
not 60 minutes. Now get set up for the uplink.

Buell covers the phone and turns to Lovett.

                                   BUELL

The partners want to know how it's going?

                                  LOVETT

How it's going? It's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?!

Lovett grabs the phone from Buell and goes instantly smooth.

                                  LOVETT

Hi, Dave? Barry? Look, it wasn't in the safe... no, look, don't worry about
it, there're still plenty of places it could be... in the floor debris in
the suite, in the mother's room, in the purser's safe on C deck...

                            (seeing something)

Hang on a second.

A tech coaxes some letters in the water tray to one side with a tong...
revealing a pencil (conte crayon) drawing of a woman.

Brock looks closely at the drawing, which is in excellent shape, though its
edges have partially disintegrated. The woman is beautiful, and beautifully
rendered. In her late teens or early twenties, she is nude, though posed
with a kind of casual modesty. She is on an Empire divan, in a pool of
light that seems to radiate outward from her eyes. Scrawled in the lower
right corner is the date: April 14 1912. And the initials JD.

The girl is not entirely nude. At her throat is a diamond necklace with one
large stone hanging in the center.

Lovett grabs a reference photo from the clutter on the lab table. It is a
period black-and-white photo of a diamond necklace on a black velvet
jeller's display stand. He holds it next to the drawing. It is clearly the
same piece... a complex setting with a massive central stone which is
almost heart-shaped.

                                  LOVETT

I'll be God damned.

                                                                   CUT TO:

16 INSERT

A CNN NEWS STORY: a live satellite feed from the deck of the Keldysh,
intercut with the CNN studio.

                                 ANNOUNCER

Treasure hunter Brock Lovett is best known for finding Spanish gold in
sunken galleons in the Caribbean. Now he is using deep submergence
technology to work two and a half miles down at another famous wreck... the
Titanic. He is with us live via satellite from a Russian research ship in
the middle of the Atlantic... hello Brock?

                                  LOVETT

Yes, hi, Tracy. You know, Titanic is not just A shipwrick, Titanic is THE
shipwreck. It's the Mount Everest of shipwrecks.

                                                                   CUT TO:

17 INT. HOUSE / CERAMICS STUDIO

PULL BACK from the screen, showing the CNN report playing on a TV set in
the living room of a small rustic house. It is full of ceramics, figurines,
folk art, the walls crammed with drawings and paintings... things collected
over a lifetime.

PANNING to show a glassed-in studio attached to the house. Outside it is a
quiet morning in Ojai, California. In the studio, amid incredible clutter,
an ANCIENT WOMAN is throwing a pot on a potter's wheel. The liquid red clay
covers her hands... hands that are gnarled and age-spotted, but still
surprisingly strong and supple. A woman in her early forties assists her.

                               LOVETT (V.O.)

I've planned this expedition for three years, and we're out here recovering
some amazing things... things that will have enormous historical and
educational value.

                            CNN REPORTER (V.O.)

But it's no secret that education is not your main purpose. You're a
treasure hunter. So what is the treasure you're hunting?

                               LOVETT (V.O.)

I'd rather show you than tell you, and we think we're very close to doing
just that.

The old woman's name is ROSE CALVERT. Her face is a wrinkled mass, her body
shapeless and shrunken under a one-piece African-print dress.

But her eyes are just as bright and alive as those of a young girl.

Rose gets up and walks into the living room, wiping pottery clay from her
hands with a rag. A Pomeranian dog gets up and comes in with her.

The younger soman, LIZZY CALVERT, rushes to help her.

                                   ROSE

Turn that up please, dear.

                              REPORTER (V.O.)

Your expedition is at the center of a storm of controversy over salvage
rights and even ethics. Many are calling you a grave robber.

TIGHT ON THE SCREEN.

                                  LOVETT

Nobody called the recovery of the artifacts from King Tut's tomb grave
robbing. I have museum-trained experts here, making sure this stuff is
preserved and catalogued properly. Look at this drawing, which was found
today...

The video camera pans off Brock to the drawing, in a tray of water. The
image of the woman with the necklace FILLS FRAME.

                                  LOVETT

...a piece of paper that's been underwater for 84 years... and my team are
able to preserve it intanct. Should this have remained unseen at the bottom
of the ocean for eternity, when we can see it and enjoy it now...?

ROSE is galvanized by this image. Her mouth hangs open in amazement.

                                   ROSE

I'll be God damned.

                                                                   CUT TO:

18 EXT. KELDYSH DECK - NIGHT

CUT TO KELDYSH. The Mir subs are being launched. Mir Two is already in the
water, and Lovett is getting ready to climb into Mir One when Bobby Buell
runs up to him.

                                   BUELL

There's a satellite call for you.

                                  LOVETT

Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water?
Take a message.

                                   BUELL

No, trust me, you want to take this call.

                                                                   CUT TO:

19 INT. LAB DECK / KELDYSH - NIGHT

Beull hands Lovett the phone, pushing down the blinking line. The call is
from Rose and we see both ends of the conversation. She is in her kitchen
with a mystified Lizzy.

                                  LOVETT

This is Brock Lovett. What can I do for you, Mrs... ?

                                   BUELL

Rose Calvert.

                                  LOVETT

... Mrs. Calvert?

                                   ROSE

I was just wondering if you had found the "Heart of the Ocean" yet, Mr.
Lovett.

Brock almost drops the phone. Bobby sees his shocked expression...

                                   BUELL

I told you you wanted to take this call.

                                  LOVETT

                                 (to Rose)

Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the
picture is?

                                   ROSE

Oh yes. The woman in the picture is me.

                                                                   CUT TO:

20 EXT. OCEAN - DAY

SMASH CUT TO AN ENORMOUS SEA STALLION HELICOPTER thundering across the
ocean. PAN 180 degrees as it roars past. There is no land at either
horizon. The Keldysh is visible in the distance.

CLOSE ON A WINDOW of the monster helicopter. Rose's face is visible,
looking out calmly.

                                                                   CUT TO:

Brock and Bodine are watching Mir 2 being sweng over the side to start a

She's a goddamned liar! A nutcase. Like that... what's her name? That
Anastasia babe.

                                   BUELL

They're inbound.

Brock nods and the three of them head forward to meet the approaching helo.

                                  BODINE

She says she's Rose DeWitt Bukater, right? Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the
Titanic. At the age of 17. If she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now.

                                  LOVETT

A hundred and one next month.

                                  BODINE

Okay, so she's a very old goddamned liar. I traced her as far back as the
20's... she was working as an actress in L.A. An actress. Her name was Rose
Dawson. Then she married a guy named Calvert, moved to Cedar Rapids, had
two kids. Now Calvert's dead, and from what I've heard Cedar Rapids is
dead.

The Sea Stallion approaches the ship, BG, forcing Brock to yell over the
rotors.

                                  LOVETT

And everyobody who knows about the diamond is supposed to be dead... or on
this ship. But she knows about it. And I want to hear what she has to say.
Got it?

                                                                   CUT TO:

IN A THUNDERING DOWNBLAST the helicopter's wheels bounce down on the
helipad.

Lovett, Buell and Bodine watch as the HELICOPTER CREW CHIEF hands out about
ten suitcases, and then Rose is lowered to the deck in a wheelchair by
Keldysh crewmen. Lizzy, ducking unnecessarily under the rotor, follows her
out, carrying FREDDY the Pomeranian. The crew chief hands a puzzled Keldysh
crewmember a goldfish bowl with several fish in it. Rose does not travel
light.

HOLD ON the incongruous image of this little old lady, looking impossibly
fragile amongst all the high tech gear, grungy deck crew and gigantic
equipment.

                                  BODINE

S'cuse me, I have to go check our supply of Depends.

23 INT. ROSE'S STATEROOM / KELDYSH - DAY

Lizzy is unpacking Rose's things in the small utilitarian room. Rose is

                                  LOVETT

Is your stateroom alright?

                                   ROSE

Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me.

                                   LIZZY

Yes. We met just a few minutes ago, grandma. Remember, up on deck?

                                   ROSE

Oh, yes.

Brock glances at Bodine... oh oh. Bodine rolls his eyes. Rose finishes
arranging her photographs. We get a general glimpse of them: the usual
snapshots... children and grandchildren, her late husband.

                                   ROSE

There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of
course.

                            (to the Pomeranian)

Isn't that right, sweetie.

                                  LOVETT

Would you like anything?

                                   ROSE

I should like to see my drawing.

24 INT. LAB DECK, PRESERVATION AREA

Rose looks at the drawing in its tray of water, confronting herself across
a span of 84 years. Until they can figure out the best way to preserve it,
they have to keep it immersed. It sways and ripples, almost as if alive.

TIGHT ON Rose's ancient eyes, gazing at the drawing.

25 FLASHCUT of a man's hand, holding a conte crayon deftly creating a
shoulder and the shape of her hair with two efficient lines.

26 THE WOMAN'S FACE IN THE DRAWING, dancing under the water.

27 A FLASHCUT of a man's eyes, just visible over the top of a sketching
pad. They look up suddenly right into the LENS. Soft eyes, but fearlessly
direct.

28 Rose smiles, remembering. Brock has the reference photo of the necklace
in his hand.

                                  LOVETT

Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of the
Crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything from
the neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too...
recut into a heart-like shape... and it became Le Coeur de la Mer. The
Heart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond.

                                   ROSE

It was a dreadful, heavy thing.

                        (she points at the drawing)

I only wore it this once.

                                   LIZZY

You actually believe this is you, grandma?

                                   ROSE

It is me, dear. Wasn't I a hot number?

                                  LOVETT

I tracked it down through insurance records... and old claim that was
settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you know who the claiment was,
Rost?

                                   ROSE

Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.

                                  LOVETT

Nathan Hockley, right. Pittsburgh steel tycoon. For a diamond necklace his
son Caledon Hockley bought in France for his fiancee... you... a week
before he sailed on Titanic. And the claim was filed right after the
sinking. So the diamond had to've gone down with the ship.

                                (to Lizzy)

See the date?

                                   LIZZY

April 14, 1912.

                                  LOVETT

If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day
Titanic sank.

And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you for
anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery.

                                   ROSE

I don't want your money, Mr. Lovett. I know how hard it is for people who
care greatly for money to give some away.

                                  BODINE

                                (skeptical)

You don't want anything?

                                   ROSE

                         (indicating the drawing)

You may give me this, if anything I tell you is of value.

                                  LOVETT

Deal.

                            (crossing the room)

Over here are a few things we've recovered from your staterooms.

Laid out on a worktable are fifty or so objects, from mundane to valuable.
Rose, shrunken in her chair, can barely see over the table top. With a
trembling hand she lifts a tortoise shell hand mirror, inlaid with mother
of pearl. She caresses it wonderingly.

                                   ROSE

This was mine. How extraordinary! It looks the same as the last time I saw
it.

She turns the mirror over and looks at her ancient face in the cracked
glass.

                                   ROSE

The reflection has changed a bit.

She spies something else, a silver and moonstone art-nouveau brooch.

                                   ROSE

My mother's brooch. She wanted to go back for it. Caused quite a fuss.

Rose picks up an ornate art-nouveau HAIR COMB. A jade butterfly takes
flight on the ebony handle of the comb. She turns it slowly, remembering.
We can see that Rose is experiencing a rush of images and emotions that
have lain dormant for eight decades as she handles the butterfly comb.

                                  LOVETT

Are you ready to go back to Titanic?

                                                                   CUT TO:

29 INT. IMAGING SHACK / KELDYSH

It is a darkened room lined with TV monitors. IMAGES OF THE WRECK fill the
screens, fed from Mir One and Two, and the two ROVs, Snoop Dog and DUNCAN.

                                  BODINE

Live from 12,000 feet.

ROSE stares raptly at the screens. She is enthraled by one in particular,
an image of the bow railing. It obviously means something to her. Brock is
studying her reactions carefully.

                                  BODINE

The bow's struck in the bottom like an axe, from the impact. Here... I can
run a simulation we worked up on this monitor over here.

Lizzy turns the chair so Rose can see the screen of Bodine's computer. As
he is calling up the file, he keeps talking.

                                  BODINE

We've put together the world's largest database on the Titanic. Okay,
here...

                                  LOVETT

Rose might not want to see this, Lewis.

                                   ROSE

No, no. It's fine. I'm curious.

Bodine starts a COMPUTER ANIMATED GRAPHIC on the screen, which parallels
his rapid-fire narration.

                                  BODINE

She hits the berg on the starboard side and it sort of bumps along...
punching holes like a morse code... dit dit dit, down the side. Now she's
flooding in the

                              BODINE (cont'd)

forward compartments... and the water spills over the tops of the
bulkheads, going aft. As her bow is going down, her stern is coming up...
slow at first... and then faster and faster until it's lifting all that
weight, maybe 20 or 30 thousand tons... out of the water and the hull can't
deal... so SKRTTT!!

                (making a sound in time with the animation)

... it splits! Right down to the keel, which acts like a big hinge. Now the
bow swings down and the stern falls back level... but the weight of the bow
pulls the stern up vertical, and then the bow section detaches, heading for
the bottom. The stern bobs like a cork, floods and goes under about 2:20
a.m. Two hours and forty minutes after the collision.

The animation then follows the bow section as it sinks. Rose watches this
clinical dissection of the disaster without emotion.

                                  BODINE

The bow pulls out of its dive and planes away, almost a half a mile, before
it hits the bottom going maybe 12 miles an hour. KABOOM!

The bow impacts, digging deeply into the bottom, the animation now follows
the stern.

                                  BODINE

The stern implodes as it sinks, from the pressure, and rips apart from the
force of the current as it falls, landing like a big pile of junk.

                        (indicating the simulation)

Cool huh?

                                   ROSE

Thank you for that fine forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine. Of course the
experience of it was somewhat less clinical.

                                  LOVETT

Will you share it with us?

Her eyes go back to the screens, showing the sad ruins far below them.

A VIEW from one of the subs TRACKING SLOWLY over the boat deck. Rose
recognizes one of the Wellin davits, still in place. She hears ghostly
waltz music. The faint and echoing sound of an officer's voice, English
accented, calling "Women and children only".

30 FLASH CUTS of screaming faces in a running crowd. Pandemonium and
terror. People crying, praying, kneeling on the deck. Just impressions...
flashes in the dark.

31 Rose Looks at another monitor. SNOOP DOG moving down a rusted,
debris-filled corridor. Rose watches the endless row of doorways sliding
past, like dark mouths.

32 IMAGE OF A CHILD, three years old, standing ankle deep in water in the
middle of an endless corridor. The child is lost alone, crying.

33 Rose is shaken by the flood of memories and emotions. Her eyes well up
and she puts her head down, sobbing quietly.

                                   LIZZY

                          (taking the wheelchair)

I'm taking her to rest.

                                   ROSE

No!

Her voice is surprisingly strong. The sweet little old lady is gone,
replaced by a woman with eyes of steel. Lovett signals everyone to stay
quiet.

                                  LOVETT

Tell us, Rose.

She looks from screen to screen, the images of the ruined ship.

                                   ROSE

It's been 84 years...

                                  LOVETT

Just tell us what you can--

                                   ROSE

                      (holds up her hand for silence)

It's been 84 years... and I can still smell the fresh paint. The china had
never been used. The sheets had never been slept in.

He switches on the minirecorder and sets it near her.

                                   ROSE

Titanic was called the Ship of Dreams. And it was. It really was...

As the underwater camera rises past the rusted bow rail, WE DISSOLVE /
MATCH MOVE to that same railing in 1912...

                                                           MATCH DISSOLVE:

34 EXT. SOUTHAMPTON DOCK - DAY

SHOT CONTINUES IN A FLORIOUS REVEAL as the gleaming white superstructure of
Titanic rises mountainously beyond the rail, and above that the
buff-colored funnels stand against the sky like the pillars of a great
temple. Crewmen move across the deck, dwarfed by the awesome scale of the
steamer.

Southanmpton, England, April 10, 1912. It is almost nnon on ailing day. A
crowd of hundreds blackens the pier next to Titanic like ants on a jelly
sandwich.

IN FG a gorgeous burgundy RENAULT TOURING CAR swings into frame, hanging
from a loading crane. It is lowered toward HATCH #2.

On the pier horsedrawn vehicles, motorcars and lorries move slowly through
the dense throng. The atmosphere is one of excitement and general
giddiness. People embrace in tearful farewells, or wave and shout bon
voyage wishes to friends and relatives on the decks above.

A white RENAULT, leading a silver-gray DAIMLER-BENZ, pushes through the
crowd leaving a wake in the press of people. Around the handsome cars
people are streaming to board the ship, jostling with hustling seamen and
stokers, porters, and barking WHITE STAR LINE officials.

The Renault stops and the LIVERIED DRIVER scurries to open the door for a
YOUNG WOMAN dressed in a stunning white and purple outfit, with an enormous
feathered hat. She is 17 years old and beautiful, regal of bearing, with
piercing eyes.

It is the girl in the drawing. ROSE. She looks up at the ship, taking it in
with cool appraisal.

                                   ROSE

I don't see what all the fuss is about. It doesn't look any bigger than the
Mauretania.

A PERSONAL VALET opens the door on the other side of the car for CALEDON
HOCKLEY, the 30 year old heir to the elder Hockley's fortune. "Cal" is
handsome, arrogant and rich beyond meaning.

                                    CAL

You can be blase about some things, Rose, but not about Titanic. It's over
a hundred feet longer than Mauretania, and far more luxurious. It has
squash courts, a Parisian cafe... even Turkish baths.

Cal turns and fives his hand to Rose's mother, RUTH DEWITT BUKATER, who
descends from the touring car being him. Ruth is a 40ish society empress,
from one of the most prominent Philadelphia families. She is a widow, and
rules her household with iron will.

                                    CAL

Your daughter is much too hard to impress, Ruth.

                           (indicating a puddle)

Mind your step.

                                   RUTH

                         (gazing at the leviathan)

So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.

                                    CAL

It is unsinkable. God himself couldn't sink this ship.

Cal speaks with the pride of a host providing a special experience.

This entire entourage of rich Americans is impeccably turned out, a
quintessential example of the Edwardian upper class, complete with
servants. Cal's VALET, SPICER LOVEJOY, is a tall and impassive, dour as an
undertaker. Behind him emerge TWO MAIDS, personal servants to Ruth and
Rose.

A WHITE STAR LINE PORTER scurries toward them, harried by last minute
loading.

                                  PORTER

Sir, you'll have to check your baggage through the main terminal, round
that way--

Cal nonchalantly hands the man a fiver. The porter's eyes dilate. Five
pounds was a monster tip in those days.

                                    CAL

I put my faith in you, good sir.

                                  (MORE)

                               CAL (CONT'D)

                       (curtly, indicating Lovejoy)

See my man.

                                  PORTER

Yes, sir. My pleasure, sir.

Cal never tires of the effect of money on the unwashed masses.

                                  LOVEJOY

                              (to the porter)

These trunks here, and 12 more in the Daimler. We'll have all this lot up
in the rooms.

The White Star man looks stricken when he sees the enormous pile of steamer
trunks and suitcases loading down the second car, including wooden crates
and steel safe. He whistles frantically for some cargo-handlers nearby who
come running.

Cal breezes on, leaving the minions to scramble. He quickly checks his
pocket watch.

                                    CAL

We'd better hurry. This way, ladies.

He indicates the way toward the first class gangway. They move into the
crowd. TRUDY BOLT, Rose's maid, hustles behind them, laden with bags of her
mistress's most recent purchases... things too delicate for the baggage
handlers.

Cal leads, weaving between vehicles and handcarts, hurrying passengers
(mostly second class and steerage) and well-wishers. Most of the first
class passengers are avoiding the smelly press of the dockside crowd by
using an elevated boarding bridge, twenty feet above.

They pass a line of steerage passengers in their coarse wool and tweeds,
queued up inside movable barriers like cattle in a chute. A HEALTH OFFICER
examines their heads one by one, checking scalp and eyelashes for lice.

They pass a well-dressed young man cranking the handle of a wooden Biograph
"cinematograph" camera mounted on a tripod. NANIEL MARVIN (whose father
founded the Biograph Film Studio) is filming his young bride in front of
the Titanic. MARY MARVIN stands stiffly and smiles, self conscious.

                                  DANIEL

Look up at the ship, darling, that's it. You're amazed! You can't believe
how big it is! Like a mountain. That's great.

Mary Marvin, without an acting fiber in her body, does a bad Clara Bow
pantomime of awe, hands raised.

Cal is jostled by two yelling steerage boys who shove past him. And he is
bumped again a second later by the boys' father.

                                    CAL

Steady!!

                                    MAN

Sorry squire!

The Cockney father pushes on, after his kids, shouting.

                                    CAL

Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath.

                                   RUTH

Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last
instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along
the dock like some squalid immigrant family.

                                    CAL

All part of my charm, Ruth. At any rate, it was my darling fiancee's beauty
rituals which made us late.

                                   ROSE

You told me to change.

                                    CAL

I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.

                                   ROSE

I felt like black.

Cal guides them out of the path of a horse-drawn wagon loaded down with two
tons of OXFORD MARMALADE, in wooden cases, for Titanic's Victualling
Department.

                                    CAL

Here I've pulled every string I could to book us on the grandest ship in
history, in her most luxurious suites... and you act as if you're going to
your execution.

Rose looks up as the hull of Titanic looms over them...a great iron wall,
Bible black and sever. Cal motions her forward, and she enters the gangway
to the D Deck doors with a sense of overwhelming dread.

                              OLD ROSE (V.O.)

It was the ship of dreams... to everyone else. To me it was a slave ship,
taking me back to America in chains.

CLOSE ON CAL'S HAND IN SLOW-MOTION as it closes possessively over Rose's
arm. He escorts her up the gangway and the black hull of Titanic swallows
them.

                              OLD ROSE (V.O.)

Outwardly I was everything a well brought up girl should be. Inside, I was
screaming.

35 CUT TO a SCREAMING BLAST from the mighty triple steam horns on Titanic's
funnels, bellowing their departure warning.

                                                                   CUT TO:

36 EXT. SOUTHAMPTON DOCKS / TITANIC - DAY

A VIEW OF TITANIC from several blocks away, towering above the terminal
buildings like the skyline of a city. The steamer's whistle echoes across
Southampton.

PULL BACK, revealing that we were looking through a window, and back
further to show the smoky inside of a pub. It is crowded with dockworkers
and ship;s crew.

Just inside the window, a poker game is in progress. FOUR MEN, in working
class clothes, play a very serious hand.

JACK DAWSON and FABRIZIO DE ROSSI, both about 20, exchange a glance as the
other two players argue in Swedish. Jack is American, a lanky drifter with
his hair a little long for the standards of the times. He is also unshaven,
and his clothes are rumpled from sleeping in them. He is an artist, and has
adopted the bohemian style of art scene in Paris. He is also very
self-possessed and sure-footed for 20, having lived on his own since 15.

The TWO SWEDES continue their sullen argument, in Swedish.

                                   OLAF

                                (subtitled)

You stupid fishhead. I can't believe you bet our tickets.

                                   SVEN

                                (subtitled)

You lost our money. I'm just trying to get it back. Now shutup and take a
card.

                                   JACK

                                 (jaunty)

Hit me again, Sven.

Jack takes the card and slips it into his hand.

ECU JACK'S EYES. They betray nothing.

CLOSE ON FABRIZIO licking his lips nervously as he refuses a card.

ECU STACK in the middle of the table. Bills and coins from four counrties.
This has been going on for a while. Sitting on top of the money are two 3RD
CLASS TICKETS for RMS TITANIC.

The Titanic's whistle blows again. Final warning.

                                   JACK

The moment of truth boys. Somebody's life's about to change.

Fabrizio puts his cards down. So do the Swedes. Jack holds his close.

                                   JACK

Let's see... Fabrizio's got niente. Olaf, you've got squat. Sven, uh oh...
two pair... mmm.

                           (turns to his friend)

Sorry Fabrizio.

                                 FABRIZIO

What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di
cazzo--

                                   JACK

Sorry, you're not gonna see your mama again for a long time...

He slaps a full house down on the table.

                                   JACK

                                (grinning)

'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys!

                                 FABRIZIO

Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!

The table explodes into shouting in several languages. Jack rakes in the
money and the tickets.

                                   JACK

                              (to the Swedes)

Sorry boys. Three of a kind and a pair. I'm high and you're dry and...

                               (to Fabrizio)

... we're going to--

                               FABRIZIO/JACK

L'AMERICA!!!

Olaf balls up one huge farmer's fist. We think he's going to clobber Jack,
but he swings round and punches Sven, who flops backward onto the floor and
sits there, looking depressed. Olaf forgets about Jack and Fabrizio, who
are dancing around, and goes into a rapid harangue of his stupid cousin.

Jack kisses the tickets, then jumps on Fabrizio's back and rides him around
the pub. It's like they won the lottery.

                                   JACK

Goin' home... to the land o' the free and the home of the real hot-dogs! On
the TITANIC!! We're ridin' in high style now! We're practically goddamned
royalty, ragazzo mio!!

                                 FABRIZIO

You see? Is my destinio!! Like I told you. I go to l'America!! To be a
millionaire!!

                                  (MORE)

                             FABRIZIO (CONT'D)

                              (to pubkeeper)

Capito?? I go to America!!

                                 PUBKEEPER

No, mate. Titanic go to America. In five minutes.

                                   JACK

Shit!! Come on, Fabri!

                          (grabbing their stuff)

Come on!!

                            (to all, grinning)

It's been grand.

They run for the door.

                                 PUBKEEPER

'Course I'm sure if they knew it was you lot comin', they'd be pleased to
wait!

                                                                   CUT TO:

37 OMITTED

38 EXT. TERMINAL - TITANIC

Jack and Fabrizio, carrying everything they own in the world in the kit
bags on their shoulders, sprint toward the pier. They tear through milling
crowds next to the terminal. Shouts go up behind them as they jostle
slow-moving gentlemen. They dodge piles of luggage, and weave through
groups of people. They burst out onto the pier and Jack comes to a dead
stop... staring at the cast wall of the ship's hull, towering seven stories
above the wharf and over an eighth of a mile long. The Titanic is
monstrous.

Fabrizio runs back and grabs Jack, and they sprint toward the third class
gangway aft, at E deck. They reach the bottom of the ramp just as SIXTH
OFFICER MOODY detaches it at the top. It starts to swing down from the
gangway doors.

                                   JACK

Wait!! We're passengers!

Flushed and panting, he waves the tickets.

                                   MOODY

Have you been through the inspection queue?

                                   JACK

                            (lying cheerfully)

Of course! Anyway, we don't have lice, we're Americans.

                           (glances at Fabrizio)

Both of us.

                                   MOODY

                                  (testy)

Right, come aboard.

Moody has QUARTERMASTER ROWE reattach the gangway. Jack and Fabrizio come
aboard. Moody glances at the tickets, then passes Jack and Fabrizio through
to Rowe. Rowe looks at the names on the tickets to enter them in the
passenger list.

                                   ROWE

Gundersen. And...

                           (reading Fabrizio's)

Gundersen.

He hands the tickets back, eyeing Fabrizio's Mediterranean looks
suspiciously.

                                   JACK

                         (grabbing Fabrizio's arm)

Come on, Sven.

Jack and Fabrizio whoop with victory as they run down the white-painted
corridero... grinning from ear to ear.

                                   JACK

We are the luckiest sons of bitches in the world!

                                                                   CUT TO:

40 EXT. TITANIC AND DOCK - DAY

The mooring lines, as big around as a man's arm, are dropped into the
water. A cheer goes up on the pier as SEVEN TUGS pull the Titanic away from
the quay.

                                                                   CUT TO:

41 EXT. AFT WELL DECK / POOP DECK - DAY

JACK AND FABRIZIO burst through a door onto the aft well deck. TRACKING
WITH THEM as they run across the deck and up the steel stairs to the poop
deck. They get to the rail and Jack starts to yell and wave to the crowd on
the dock.

                                 FABRIZIO

You know somebody?

                                   JACK

Of course not. That's not the point.

                              (to the crowd)

Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!

Grinning, Fabrixio joins in, adding his voice to the swell of voices,
feeling the exhilaration of the moment.

                                 FABRIZIO

Goodbye! I will never forget you!!

                                                                   CUT TO:

42 OMITTED

EXT. SOUTHAMPTON DOCK - DAY

The crowd of cheering well-wishers waves heartily as a black wall of metal
moves past them. Impossibly tiny figues wave back from the ship's rails.
Titanic gathers speed.

                                                                   CUT TO:

44 EXT. RIVER TEST - DAY

IN A LONG LENS SHOT the prow of Titanic FILLS FRAME behind the lead tug,
which is dwarfed. The bow wave spreads before the mighty plow of the
liner's hull as it moves down the River Test toward the English Channel.

                                                                   CUT TO:

45 INT. THIRD CLASS BERTHING / G-DECK FORWARD - DAY

Jack and Fabrizio walk down a narrow corridor with doors lining both sides
like a college dorm. Total confusion as people argue over luggage in
several languages, or wander in confusion in the labyrinth. They pass
emigrants studying the signs over the doors, and looking up the words in
phrase books.

They find their berth. It is a modest cubicle, painted enamel white, with
four bunks. Exposed pipes overhead. The other two guys are already there.
OLAUS and BJORN GUNDERSEN.

Jack throws his kit on one open bunk, while Fabrizio takes the other.

                                   BJORN

                          (in Swedish/ subtitled)

Where is Sven?

                                                                   CUT TO:

46 INT. SUITE B-52-56 - DAY

By contrast, the so-called "Millionaire Suite" is in the Empire style, and
comprises two bedrooms, a bath, WC, wardrobe room, and a large sitting
room. In addition there is a private 50 foot promenade deck outside.

A room service waiter pours champagne into a tulip glass of orange juice
and hands the Bucks Fizz to Rose. She is looking through her new paintings.
There is a Monet of water lilies, a Degas of dancers, and a few abstract
works. They are all unknown paintings... lost works.

Cal is out on the covered deck, which has potted trees and vines on
trellises, talking through the doorway to Rose in the sitting room.

                                    CAL

Those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money.

                                   ROSE

                      (looking at a cubist portrait)

You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without
logic. What's his name again... ?

                         (reading off the canvas)

Picasso.

                                    CAL

                      (coming into the sitting room)

He'll never amount to a thing, trust me. At least they were cheap.

A porter wheels Cal's private safe (which we recognize) into the room on a
handtruck.

                                    CAL

Put that in the wardrobe.

47 IN THE BEDROOM Rose enters with the large Degas of the dancers. She sets
it on the dresser, near the canopy bed. Trudy is already in there, hanging
up some of Rose's clothes.

                                   TRUDY

It smells so brand new. Like they built it all just for us. I mean... just
to think that tonight, when I crawl between the sheets, Iill be the first--

Cal appears in the doorway of the bedroom.

                                    CAL

                             (looking at Rose)

And when I crawl between the sheets tonight, I'll still be the first.

                                   TRUDY

                        (blushing at the innuendo)

S'cuse me, Miss.

She edges around Cal and makes a quick exit. Cal comes up behind Rose and
puts his hands on her shoulders. An act of possession, not intimacy.

                                    CAL

The first and only. Forever.

Rose's expression shows how bleak a prospect this is for her, now.

                                                                   CUT TO:

48 EXT. CHERBOURG HARBOR, FRANCE - LATE DUSK

Titanic stands silhouetted against a purple post-sunset sky. She is lit up
like a floating palace, and her thousand portholes reflect in the calm
harbor waters. The 150 foot tender Nomadic lies-to alongside, looking like
a rowboat. The lights of a Cherbourg harbor complete the postcard image.

                                                                   CUT TO:

49 INT. FIRST CLASS RECEPTION/ D-DECK

Entering the first class reception room from the tender are a number of
prominent passengers. A BROAD-SHOULDERED WOMAN in an enormous feathered hat
comes up the gangway, carrying a suitcase in each hand, a spindly porter
running to catch up with her to take the bags.

                                   WOMAN

Well, I wasn't about to wait all day for you, sonny. Take 'em the rest of
the way if you think you can manage.

                              OLD ROSE (V.O.)

At Cherbourg a woman came aboard named Margaret Brown, but we all called
her Molly. History would call her the Unsinkable Molly Brown. Her husband
had struck gold someplace out west, and she was what mother called "new
money".

At 45, MOLLY BROWN is a tough talking straightshooter who dresses in the
finery of her genteel peers but will never be one of them.

                              OLD ROSE (V.O.)

By the next afternoon we had made our final stop and we were steaming west
from the coast of Ireland, with nothing out ahead of us but ocean...

                                                                   CUT TO:

50 OMITTED

51 EXT. BOW - DAY

The ship glows with the warm creamy light of late afternoon. Jack and
Fabrizio stand right at the bow gripping the curving railing so familiar
from images of the wreck. Jack leans over, looking down fifty feet to where
the prow cuts the surface like a knife, sending up two glassy sheets of
water.

                                                                   CUT TO:

52 INT. / EXT. TITANIC - SERIES OF SCENES - DAY

ON THE BRIDGE, CAPTAIN SMITH turns from the binnacle to FIRST OFFICER
WILLIAM MURDOCH.

                               CAPTAIN SMITH

Take her to sea Mister Murdoch. Let's stretch her legs.

Murdoch moves the engine telegraph lever to ALL AHEAD FULL.

53 NOW BEGINS a kind of musical/visual setpiece... an ode to the great
ship. The music is rhythmic, surging forward, with a soaring melody that
addresses the majesty and optimism of the ship of dreams.

IN THE ENGINE ROOM the telegraph clangs and moves to "All Ahead Full".

                            CHIEF ENGINEER BELL

All ahead full!

On the catwalk THOMAS ANDREWS, the shipbuilder, watches carefully as the
engineers and greasers scramble to adjust valves. Towering above them are
the twin RECIPROCATING engines, four stories tall, their ten-foot-long
connecting rods surging up and down with the turning of the massive
crankshafts. The engines thunder like the footfalls of marching giants.

54 IN THE BOILER ROOMS the STOKERS chant a song as they hurl coal into the
roaring furnaces. The "black gang" are covered with sweat and coal dust,
their muscles working like part of the machinery as they toil in the
hellish glow.

55 UNDERWATER the enormous bronze screws chop through the water, hurling
the steamer forward and churning up a vortex of foam that lingers for miles
behind the juggernaut ship. Smoke pours from the funnels as--

56 The riven water flares higher at the bow as the ship's speeds builds.
THE CAMERA SWEEPS UP the prow to find Jack, the wind streaming through his
hair and--

57 Captain Smith steps out of the enclosed bridge onto the wing. He stands
with his hands on the rail, looking every bit the storybook picture of a
Captain... a great patriarch of the sea.

                           FIRST OFFICER MURDOCH

Twenty one knots, sir!

                                   SMITH

She's got a bone in her teeth now, eh, Mr. Murdoch.

Smith accepts a cup of tea from FIFTH OFFICER LOWE. He contentedly watches
the white V of water hurled outward from the bows like an expression of his
own personal power. They are invulnerable, towering over the sea.

58 AT THE BOW Jack and Fabrizio lean far over, looking down.

In the glassy bow-wave two dolphins appear, under the water, running fast
just in front of the steel blade of the prow. They do it for the sheer joy
and exultation of motion. Jack watches the dolphins and grins. They breach,
jumping clear of the water and then dive back, crisscrossing in front of
the bow, dancing ahead of the juggernaut.

FABRIZIO looks forward across the Atlantic, staring into the sunsparkles.

                                 FABRIZIO

I can see the Statue of Liberty already.

                            (grinning at Jack)

Very small... of course.

THE CAMERA ARCS around them, until they are framed against the sea.

NOW WE PULL BACK, across the forecastle deck. Rising, as we continue back,
and the ships rolls endlessly forward underneath. Over the bridge wing,
along the boat deck until her funnels come INTO FRAME besides us and march
past like the pillars of heaven, one by one. We pull back and up, until we
are looking down the funnels, and the people strolling on the decks and
standing at the rail become antlike.

And still we pull back until the great lady is seen whole in a gorgeous
aerial portrait, black and severe in her majesty.

                               ISMAY (V.O.)

She is the largest moving object ever made by the hand of man in all
history...

                                                                   CUT TO:

59 INT. PALM COURT RESTAURANT - DAY

CLOSE ON J. BRUCE ISMAY, Managing Director of White Star Line.

                                   ISMAY

...and our master shipbuilder, Mr. Andrews here, designed her from the keel
plates up.

He indicates a handsome 39 year old Irish gentlemen to his right, THOMAS
ANDREWS, of Harland and Wolf Shipbuilders.

WIDER, showing the group assembled for lunch the next day. Ismay seated
with Cal, Rose, Ruth, Molly Brown and Thomas Andrews in the Palm Court, a
beautiful sunny spot enclosed by high arched windows.

                                  ANDREWS

                         (disliking the attention)

Well, I may have knocked her together, but the idea was Mr. Ismay's. He
envisioned a steamer so grand in scale, and so luxurious in its
appointments, that its supremacy would never be challenged. And here she
is...

                           (he slaps the table)

...willed into solid reality.

                                   MOLLY

Why're ships always bein' called "she"? Is it because men think half the
women around have big sterns and should be weighed in tonnage?

                             (they all laugh)

Just another example of the men settin' the rules their way.

The waiter arrives to take orders. Rose lights a cigarette.

                                   RUTH

You know I don't like that, Rose.

                                    CAL

She knows.

Cal takes the cigarette from her and stubs it out.

                                    CAL

                              (to the waiter)

We'll both have the lamb. Rare, with a little mint sauce.

                  (to Rose, after the waiter moves away)

You like lamb, don't you sweetpea?

Molly is watching the dynamic between Rose, Cal and Ruth.

                                   MOLLY

So, you gonna cut her meat for her too there, Cal?

                            (turning to Ismay)

Hey, who came up with the name Titanic? You, Bruce?

                                   ISMAY

Yes, actually. I wanted to convey sheer size. And size means stability,
luxury... and safety--

                                   ROSE

Do you know of Dr. Freud? His ideas about the male preoccupation with size
might be of particular interest to you, Mr. Ismay.

Andrews chockes on his breadstick, suppressing laughter.

                                   RUTH

My God, Rose, what's gotten into--

                                   ROSE

Excuse me.

She stalks away.

                                   RUTH

                                (mortified)

I do apologize.

                                   MOLLY

She's a pistol, Cal. You sure you can handle her?

                                    CAL

                      (tense but feigning unconcern)

Well, I may have to start minding what she reads from now on.

                                                                   CUT TO:

60 EXT. POOP DECK / AFTER DECKS - DAY

Jack sits on a bench in the sun. Titanic's wake spreads out behind him to
the horizon. He has his knees pulled up, supporting a leather bound
sketching pad, his only valuable possession. With conte crayon he draws
rapidly, using sure strokes. An emigrant from Manchester named CARTMELL has
his 3 year old daughter CORA standing on the lower rung of the rail. She is
leaned back against his beer barrel of a stomach, watching the seagulls.

THE SKETCH captures them perfectly, with a great sense of the humanity of
the moment. Jack is good. Really good. Fabrizio looks over Jack's shoulder.
He nods appreciatively.

TOMMY RYAN, a scowling young Irish emigrant, watches as a crewmember comes
by, walking three small dogs around the deck. One of them, a BLACK FRENCH
BULLDOG, is among the ugliest creatures on the planet.

                                   TOMMY

That's typical. First class dogs come down here to take a shit.

Jack looks up from his sketch.

                                   JACK

That's so we know where we rank in the scheme of things.

                                   TOMMY

Like we could forget.

Jack glances across the well deck. At the aft railing of B deck promenade
stands ROSE, in a long yellow dress and white gloves.

CLOSE ON JACK, unable to take his eyes off of her. They are across from
each other, about 60 feet apart, with the well deck like a valley between
them. She on her promontory, he on his much lower one. She stares down at
the water.

He watches her unpin her elaborate hat and take it off. She looks at the
frilly absurd thing, then tosses it over the rail. It sails far down to the
water and is carried away, astern. A spot of yellow in the vast ocean. He
is riveted by her. She looks like a figure in a romantic novel, sad and
isolated.

Fabrizio taps Tommy and they both look at Jack gazin at Rose. Fabrizio and
Tommy grin at each other.

Rose turns suddenly and looks right at Jack. He is caught staring, but he
doesn't look away. She does, but then looks back. Their eyes meet across
the space of the well deck, across the gulf between worlds.

Jack sees a man (Cal) come up behind her and take her arm. She jerks her
arm away. They argue in pantomime. She storms away, and he goes after her,
disappearing along the A-deck promenade. Jack stares after her.

                                   TOMMY

Forget it, boyo. You'd as like have angels fly out o' yer arse as get next
to the likes o' her.

                                                                   CUT TO:

61 INT. FIRST CLASS DINING SALOON - NIGHT

SLOWLY PUSHING IN ON ROSE as she sits, flanked by people in heated
conversation. Cal and Ruth are laughing together, while on the other side
LADY DUFF-GORDON is holding forth animatedly. We don't hear what they are
saying. Rose is staring at her plate, barely listening to the
inconsequential babble around her.

                              OLD ROSE (V.O.)

I saw my whole life as if I'd already lived it... an endless parade of
parties and cotillions, yachts and polo matches... always the same narrow
people, the same mindless chatter. I felt like I was standing at a great
precipice, with no one to pull me back, no one who cared... or even
noticed.

ANGLE BENEATH TABLE showing Rose's hand, holding a tiny fork from her crab
salad. She pokes the crab-fork into the skin of her arm, harder and harder
until it draws blood.

                                                                   CUT TO:

62 INT. CORRIDOR / B DECK - NIGHT

Rose walks along the corridor. A steward coming the other way greets her,
and she nods with a slight smile. She is perfectly composed.

                                                                   CUT TO:

63 INT. ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

She enters the room. Stands in the middle, staring at her reflection in the
large vanity mirror. Just stands there, then--

With a primal, anguished cry she claws at her throat, ripping off her pearl
necklace, which explodes across the room. In a frenzy she tears at herself,
her clothes, her hair... then attacks the room. She flings everything off
the dresser and it flies clattering against the wall. She hurls a
handmirror against the vanity, cracking it.

                                                                   CUT TO:

64 EXT. A DECK PROMENADE, AFT - NIGHT

Rose runs along the B deck promenade. She is dishevelled, her hair flying.
She is crying, her cheeks streaked with tears. But also angry, furious!
Shaking with emotions she doesn't understand... hatred, self-hatred,
desperation. A strolling couple watch her pass. Shocked at the emotional
display in public.

                                                                   CUT TO:

65 EXT. POOP DECK - NIGHT

Jack is kicked back on one of the benches gazing at the stars blazing
gloriously overhead. Thinking artist thoughts and smoking a cigarette.

Hearing something, he turns as Rose runs up the stairs from the well deck.
They are the only two on the stern deck, except for QUARTERMASTER ROWE,
twenty feet above them on the docking bridge catwalk. She doesn't see Jack
in the shadows, and runs right past him.

TRACKING WITH ROSE as she runs across the deserted fantail. Her breath
hitches in an occasional sob, which she suppresses. Rose slams against the
base of the stern flagpole and clings there, panting. She stares out at the
black water.

Then starts to climb over the railing. She has to hitch her long dress way
up, and climbing is clumsy. Moving methodically she turns her body and gets
her heels on the white-painted gunwale, her back to the railing, facing out
toward blackness. 60 feet below her, the massive propellers are churning
the atlantin into white foam, and a ghostly wake trails off toward the
horizon.

IN A LOW ANGLE, we see Rose standing like a figurehead in reverse. Below
her are the huge letters of the name "TITANIC".

She leans out, her arms straightening... looking down hypnotized, into the
vortex below her. Her dress and hair are lifted by the wind of the ship's
movement. The only sound, above the rush of water below, is the flutter and
snap of the big Union Jack right above her.

                                   JACK

Don't do it.

She whips her head around at the sound of his voice. It takes a second for
her eyes to focus.

                                   ROSE

Stay back! Don't come any closer!

Jack sees the tear tracks on her cheeks in the faint glow from the stern
running lights.

                                   JACK

Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.

                                   ROSE

No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.

                                   JACK

No you won't.

                                   ROSE

What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will
not do. You don't know me.

                                   JACK

You would have done it already. Now come on, take my hand.

Rose is confused now. She can't see him very well through the tears, so she
wipes them with one hand, almost losing her balance.

                                   ROSE

You're distracting me. Go away.

                                   JACK

I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.

                                   ROSE

Don't be absurd. You'll be killed.

He takes off his jacket.

                                   JACK

I'm a good swimmer.

He starts unlacing his left shoe.

                                   ROSE

The fall alone would kill you.

                                   JACK

It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more
concerned about the water being so cold.

She looks down. The reality factor of what she is doing is sinking in.

                                   ROSE

How cold?

                                   JACK

                        (taking off his left shoe)

Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.

He starts unlacing his right shoe.

                                   JACK

Ever been to Wisconsin?

                                   ROSE

                                (perplexed)

No.

                                   JACK

Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there,
near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were
ice-fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice-fishing's where you chop a hole in
the--

                                   ROSE

I know what ice fishing is!

                                   JACK

Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through
some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down
there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't
breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.

                        (takes off his other shoe)

Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I
said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over
the rail and get me off the hook here.

                                   ROSE

You're crazy.

                                   JACK

That's what everybody says. But with all due respect, I'm not the one
hanging off the back of a ship.

He slides one step closer, like moving up on a spooked horse.

                                   JACK

Come on. You don't want to do this. Give me your hand.

Rose stares at this madman for a long time. She looks at his eyes and they
somehow suddenly seem to fill her universe.

                                   ROSE

Alright.

She unfastens one hand from the rail and reaches it around toward him. He
reaches out to take it, firmly.

                                   JACK

I'm Jack Dawson.

                                   ROSE

                             (voice quavering)

Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.

Rose starts to turn. Now that she has decided to live, the height is
terrifying. She is overcome by vertigo as she shifts her footing, turning
to face the ship. As she starts to climb, her dress gets in the way, and
one foot slips off the edge of the deck.

She plunges, letting out a piercing SHRIEK. Jack, gripping her hand, is
jerked toward the rail. Rose barely grabs a lower rail with her free hand.

QUARTERMASTER ROWE, up on the docking bridge hears the scream and heads for
the ladder.

                                   ROSE

HELP! HELP!!

                                   JACK

I've got you. I won't let go.

Jack holds her hand with all his strength, bracing himself on the railing
with his other hand. Rose tries to get some kind of foothold on the smooth
hull. Jack tries to lift her bodily over the railing. She can't get any
footing in her dress and evening shoes, and she slips back. Rose SCREAMS
again.

Jack, awkwardly clutching Rose by whatever he can get a grip on as she
flails, gets her over the railing. They fall together onto the deck in a
tangled heap, spinning in such a way that Jack winds up slightly on top of
her.

Rowe slides down the ladder from the docking bridge like it's a fire drill
and sprints across the fantail.

                                   ROWE

Here, what's all this?!

Rowe runs up and pulls Jack off of Rose, revealing her dishevelled and
sobbing on the deck. Her dress is torn, and the hem is pushing up above her
knees, showing one ripped stocking. He looks at Jack, the shaggy steerage
man with his jacket off, and the first class lady clearly in distress, and
starts drawing conclusions. Two seamen chug across the deck to join them.

                                   ROWE

                                 (to Jack)

Here you, stand back! Don't move an inch!

                              (to the seamen)

Fetch the Master at Arms.

                                                                   CUT TO:

66 EXT. POOP DECK - NIGHT

A few minutes later. Jack is being detained by the burly MASTER AT ARMS,
the closest thing to a cop on board. He is handcuffing Jack. Cal is right
in front of Jack, and furious. He has obviously just rushed out here with
Lovejoy and another man, and none of them have coats over their black tie
evening dress. The other man is COLONEL ARCHIBALD GRACIE, a mustachioed
blowhard who still has his brandy snifter. He offers it to Rose, who is
hunched over crying on a bench nearby, but she waves it away. Cal is more
concerned with Jack. He grabs him by the lapels.

                                    CAL

What made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! Look at me,
you filth! What did you think you were doing?!

                                   ROSE

Cal, stop! It was an accident.

                                    CAL

An accident?!

                                   ROSE

It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped.

Rose looks at Jack, getting eye contact.

                                   ROSE

I was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. And I slipped and I
would have gone overboard... and Mr. Dawson here saved me and he almost
went over himself.

                                    CAL

You wanted to see the propellers?

                                  GRACIE

                            (shaking his head)

Women and machinery do not mix.

                              MASTER AT ARMS

                                 (to Jack)

Was that the way of it?

Rose is begging him with her eyes not to say what really happened.

                                   JACK

Uh huh. That was pretty much it.

He looks at Rose a moment longer. Now they have a secret together.

                              COLONEL GRACIE

Well! The boy's a hero then. Good for you son, well done!

                                 (to Cal)

So it's all's well and back to our brandy, eh?

Jack is uncuffed. Cal gets Rose to her feet and moving.

                                    CAL

                            (rubbing her arms)

Let's get you in. You're freezing.

Cal is leaving without a second thought for Jack.

                                  GRACIE

                                   (low)

Ah... perhaps a little something for the boy?

                                    CAL

Oh, right. Mr. Lovejoy. A twenty should do it.

                                   ROSE

Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?

                                    CAL

Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do?

Cal turns back to Jack. He appraises him condescendingly... a steerage
ruffian, unwashed and ill-mannered.

                                    CAL

I know.

                                 (to Jack)

Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group with
your heroic tale?

                                   JACK

                        (looking straight at Rose)

Sure. Count me in.

                                    CAL

Good. Settled then.

Cal turns to go, putting a protective arm around Rose. he leans close to
Gracie as they walk away.

                                    CAL

This should be amusing.

                                   JACK

                            (as Lovejoy passes)

Can I bum a cigarette?

Lovejoy smoothly draws a silver cigarette case from his jacket and snaps it
open. Jack takes a cigarette, then another, popping it behind his ear for
later. Lovejoy lights Jack's cigarette.

                                  LOVEJOY

You'll want to tie those.

                         (Jack looks at his shoes)

Interesting that the young lady slipped so mighty all of a sudden and you
still had time to take of your jacket and shoes. Mmmm?

Lovejoy's expression is bland, but the eyes are cold. He turns away to join
his group.

                                                                   CUT TO:

67 INT. ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

As she undresses for bed Rose sees Cal standing in her doorway, reflected
in the cracked mirror of her vanity. He comes toward her.

                                    CAL

                           (unexpectedly tender)

I know you've een melancholy, and I don't pretent to know why.

From behind his back he hands her a large black velvet jewel case. She
takes it, numbly.

                                    CAL

I intended to save this till the engagement gals next week. But I thought
tonight, perhaps a reminder of my feeling for you...

Rose slowly opens the box. Inside is the necklace... "HEART OF THE OCEAN"
in all its glory. It is huge... a malevolent blue stone glittering with an
infinity of scalpel-like inner reflections.

                                   ROSE

My God... Cal. Is it a--

                                    CAL

Daimond. Yes it is. 56 carats.

He takes the necklace and during the following places it around her throat.
He turns her to the mirror, staring behind her.

                                    CAL

It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer,
the--

                                   ROSE

The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.

He gazes at the image of the two of them in the mirror.

                                    CAL

It's for royalty. And we are royalty.

His fingers caress her neck and throat. He seems himself to be disarmed by
Rose's elegance and beauty. His emotion is, for the first time, unguarded.

                                    CAL

There's nothing I couldn't give you. There's nothing I'd deny you if you
would deny me. Open your heart to me, Rose.

CAMERA begins to TRACK IN ON ROSE. Closer and closer, during the following:

                              OLD ROSE (V.O.)

Of course his gift was only to reflect light back onto himself, to
illuminate the greatness that was Caledon Hockley. It was a cold stone... a
heart of ice.

Finally, when Rose's eyes FILL FRAM, we MORPH SLOWLY to her eyes as the are
now... transforming through 84 years of life...

                                                                TRANSITION

68 INT. KELDYSH IMAGING SHACK

Without a cut the wrinkled, weathered landscape of age has appeared around
her eyes. But the eyes themselves are the same.

                                 OLD ROSE

After all these years, feel it closing around my throat like a dog collar.

THE CAMERA PUllS BACK to show her whole face.

                                   ROSE

I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it...

                                  LOVETT

Well, that's the general idea, my dear.

                                  BODINE

So let me get this right. You were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the
Titanic?

                               (he guffaws)

That's great!

                                  LOVETT

                                (warningly)

Lewis...

But Rose laughs with Bodine.

                                  BODINE

                             (still laughing)

All you had to do was wait two days!

Lovett, standing out of Rose's sightline, checks his watch. Hours have
passed. This process is taking too long.

                                  LOVETT

Rose, tell us more about the diamond. What did Hockley do with it after
that?

                                   ROSE

Im afraid I'm feeling a little tired, Mr. Lovett.

Lizzy picks up the cue and starts to wheel her out.

                                  LOVETT

Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the
safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination?

                                   LIZZY

That's enough.

Lizzy takes her out. Rose's old hand reapears at the doorway in a frail
wave goodbye.

                                                                   CUT TO:

69 EXT. LAUNCH AREA/KELDYSH DECK - DAY

As the big hydraulic jib swings one of the Mir subs out over the water.
Lovett walks as he talks with Bobby Buell, the partners' rep. They weave
among deck cranes, launch crew, sub maintenance guys.

                                   BUELL

The partners are pissed.

                                   BROCK

Bobby, buy me time. I need time.

                                   BUELL

We're running thirty thousand a day, and we're six days over. I'm telling
you what they're telling me. The hand is on the plug. It's starting to
pull.

                                   BROCK

Well you tell the hand I need another two days! Bobby, Bobby, Bobby...
we're close! I smell it. I smell ice. She had the diamond on... now we just
have to find out where it wound up. I just gotta work her a bit more. Okay?

Brock turns and sees Lizy standing behind him. She has overheard the past
part of his dialogue with Buell. He goes to her and hustles her away from
Buell, toward a quite spot on the deck.

                                   BROCK

Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.

                                   LIZZY

Don't you mean work me?

                                   BROCK

Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.

                                   LIZZY

I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and

                                  (MORE)

                              LIZZY (CONT'D)

one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off.

                                   BROCK

                      (with undisguised desperation)

Lizzy... you gotta understand something. I've bet it all to find the Heart
of the Ocean. I've got all my dough tied up in this thing. My wife even
divorced me over this hunt. I need what's locked inside your grandma's
memory.

                          (he holds out his hand)

You see this? Right here?

She looks at his hand, palm up. Empty. Cupped, as if around an imaginary
shape.

                                   LIZZY

What?

                                   BROCK

That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand?
I'm not leaving here without it.

                                   LIZZY

Look, Brock, she's going to do this her way, in her own time. Don't forget,
she contacted you. She's out here for her own reasons, God knows what they
are.

                                  LOVETT

Maybe she wants to make peace with the past.

                                   LIZZY

What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on
the Titanic until two days ago.

                                  LOVETT

Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.

                                   LIZZY

                            (looks at him hard)

You think she was really there?

                                  LOVETT

Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm a believer. She was there.

                                                                   CUT TO:

70 INT. IMAGING SHACK

Bodine starts the tape recorder. Rose is gazing at the screen seeing THE
LIVE FEED FROM THE WRECK--SNOOP DOG is moving along the starboard side of
the hull, heading aft. The rectangular windows of A deck (forward) march
past on the right.

                                   ROSE

The next day, Saturday, I remember thinking how the sunlight felt.

                                                              DISSOLVE TO:

71 EXT. B DECK TITANIC - DAY

MATCH DISSOLVE from the rusting hulk to the gleaming new Titanic in 1912,
passing the end of the enclosed promenade just as Rose walks into the
sunlight right in front of us. She is stunningly dressed and walking with
purpose.

                              OLD ROSE (V.O.)

As if I hadn't felt the sun in years.

IT IS SATURDAY APRIL 13, 1912. Rose unlatches the gate to go down into
third class. The steerage men on the deck stop what they're doing and stare
at her.

                                                                   CUT TO:

72 INT. THIRD CLASS GENERAL ROOM

The social center of steerage life. It is stark by comparison to the
opulence of first class, but is a loud, boisterous place. There are mothers
with babies, kids running between the benches yelling in several languages
and being scolded in several more. There are old women yelling, men playing
chess, girls doing needlepoint and reading dime novels. There is even an
upright piano and Tommy Ryan is noodling around it.

Three boys, shrieking and shouting, are scrambling around chasing a rat
under the benches, trying to whomp it with a shoe and causing general
havoc. Jack is playing with 5 year old CORA CARTMeLL, drawing funny faces
together in his sketchbook.

Fabrizio is struggling to get a conversation going with an attractive
Norwegian girl, HELGA DAHL, sitting with her family at a table across the
room.

                                 FABRIZIO

No Italian? Some little English?

                                   HELGA

No, no. Norwegian. Only.

Helga's eye is caught by something. Fabrizio looks, does a take... and
Jack, curious, follows their gaze to see...

Rose, coming toward them. The activity in the room stops... a hush falls.
Rose feels suddenly self-conscious as the steerage passengers stare openly
at this princess, some with resentment, others with awe. She spots Jack and
gives a little smile, walking straight to him. He rises to meet her,
smiling.

                                   ROSE

Hello Jack.

Fabrizio and Tommy are floored. Its like the slipper fitting Cinderella.

                                   JACK

Hello again.

                                   ROSE

Could I speak to you in private?

                                   JACK

Uh, yes. Of course. After you.

He motions her ahead and follows. Jack glances over his shoulder, one
eyebrow raised, as he walks out with her leaving a stunned silence.

                                                                   CUT TO:

73 EXT. BOAT DECK - DAY

Jack and Rose walk side by side. They pass people reading and talking in
steamer chairs, some of whom glance curiously at the mismatched couple. He
feels out of place in his rough clothes. They are both awkward, for
different reasons.

                                   JACK

So, you got a name by the way?

                                   ROSE

Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.

                                   JACK

That's quite a moniker. I may hafta get you to write that down.

There is an awkward pause.

                                   ROSE

Mr. Dawson, I--

                                   JACK

Jack.

                                   ROSE

Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the
nerve to face you.

                                   JACK

Well, here you are.

                                   ROSE

Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for
pulling me back. But for your discretion.

                                   JACK

You're welcome. Rose.

                                   ROSE

Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does
she know about misery?

                                   JACK

That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have
happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.

                                   ROSE

I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was
their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber.

                                (in a rush)

I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the
back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough.
Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I
was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry!

                                   JACK

Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.

                                   ROSE

                           (she lowers her head)

Oh God, I am such an utter fool.

                                   JACK

That penguin last night, is he one of them?

                                   ROSE

Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.

                                   JACK

Is he your boyfriend?

                                   ROSE

Worse I'm afraid.

She shows him her engagement ring. A sizable diamond.

                                   JACK

Gawd look at that thing! You would have gone straight to the bottom.

They laugh together. A passing steward scowls at Jack, who is clearly not a
first class passenger, but Rose just glares at him away.

                                   JACK

So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're
marryin' this fella.

                                   ROSE

Yes, exactly!

                                   JACK

So don't marry him.

                                   ROSE

If only it were that simple.

                                   JACK

It is that simple.

                                   ROSE

Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.

                                   JACK

Well, I guess I will tonight.

Looking for another topic, any other topic, she indicates his sketchbook.

                                   ROSE

What's this?

                                   JACK

Just some sketches.

                                   ROSE

May I?

The question is rhetorical because she has already grabbed the book. She
sits on a deck chair and opens the sketchbook. ON JACK'S sketches... each
one an expressive little bit of humanity: an old woman's hands, a sleeping
man, a father and daughter at the rail. The faces are luminous and alive.
His book is a celebration of the human condition.

                                   ROSE

Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.

                                   JACK

Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.

Some loose sketches fall out and are taken by the wind. Jack scrambles
after them... catching two, but the rest are gone, over the rail.

                                   ROSE

Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!

                                   JACK

Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.

He snaps his wrist, shaking his drawing hand in a flourish.

                                   JACK

I just seem to spew 'em out. Besides, they're not worth a damn anyway.

For emphasis he throws away the two he caught. They sail off.

                                   ROSE

                                (laughing)

You're deranged!

She goes back to the book, turning a page.

                                   ROSE

Well, well...

She has come upon a series of nudes. Rose is transfixed by the languid
beauty he has created. His nudes are soulful, real, with expressive hands
and eyes. They feel more like portraits than studies of the human form...
almost uncomfortably intimate. Rose blushes, raising the book as some
strollers go by.

                                   ROSE

                         (trying to be very adult)

And these were drawn from life?

                                   JACK

Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take
their clothes off.

She studies one drawing in particular, the girl posed half in sunlight,
half in shadow. Her hands lie at her chin, one furled and one open like a
flower, languid and graceful. The drawing is like an Alfred Steiglitz print
of Georgia O'Keefe.

                                   ROSE

You liked this woman. You used her several times.

                                   JACK

She had beautiful hands.

                                   ROSE

                                 (smiling)

I think you must have had a love affair with her...

                                   JACK

                                (laughing)

No, no! Just with her hands.

                                   ROSE

                      (looking up from the drawings)

You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.

                                   JACK

I see you.

There it is. That piercing gaze again.

                                   ROSE

And...?

                                   JACK

You wouldn'ta jumped.

                                                                   CUT TO:

74 INT. RECEPTION ROOM / D-DECK - DAY

Ruth is having tea with NOEL LUCY MARTHA DYER-EDWARDES, the COUNTESS OF
ROTHES, a 35ish English blue-blood with patirician features. Ruth sees
someone coming across the room and lowers her voice.

                                   RUTH

Oh no, that vulgar Brown woman is coming this way. Get up, quickly before
she sits with us.

Molly Brown walks up, greeting them cheerfully as they are rising.

                                   MOLLY

Hello girls, I was hoping I'd catch you at tea.

                                   RUTH

We're awfully sorry you missed it. The Countess and I are just off to take
the air on the boat deck.

                                   MOLLY

That sounds great. Let's go. I need to catch up on the gossip.

Ruth grits her teeth as the three of them head for the Grand Staircase to
go up. TRACKING WITH THEM, as they cross the room, the SHOT HANDS OFF to
Bruce Ismay and Captain Smith at another table.

                                   ISMAY

So you've not lit the last four boilers then?

                                   SMITH

No, but we're making excellent time.

                                   ISMAY

                               (impatiently)

Captain, the press knows the size of Titanic, let them marvel at her speed
too. We must give them something new to print. And the maiden voyage of
Titnaic must make headlines!

                                   SMITH

I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.

                                   ISMAY

Of course I leave it to your good offices to decide what's best, but what a
glorious end to your last crossing if we get into New York Tuesday night
and surprise them all.

                    (Ismay slaps his hand on the table)

Retire with a bang, eh, E.J?

A beat. Then Smith nods, stiffy.

                                                                   CUT TO:

75 EXT. A DECK PROMENADE - DAY

Rose and Jack stroll aft, past people lounging on deck chairs in the
slanting late-afternoon light. Stewards scurry to serve tea or hot cocoa.

                                   ROSE

                           (girlish and excited)

You know, my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an
artist... living in a garret, poor but free!

                                   JACK

                                (laughing)

You wouldn't last two days. There's no hot water, and hardly ever any
caviar.

                                   ROSE

                            (angry in a flash)

Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my
dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.

                                   JACK

I'm sorry. Really... I am.

                                   ROSE

Well, alright. There's something in me, Jack. I feel it. I don't know what
it is, whether I should be an artist, or, I don't know... a dancer. Like
Isadora Duncan.... a wild pagan spirit...

She leaps forward, lands deftly and whirls like a dervish. Then she sees
something ahead and her face lights up.

                                   ROSE

...or a moving picture actress!

She takes his hand and runs, pulling him along the deck toward--

DANIEL AND MARY MARVIN. Daniel is cranking the big wooden movie camera as
she poses stiffly at the rail.

                                  MARVIN

You're sad. Sad, sad, sad. You've left your lover on the shore. You may
never see him agian. Try to be sadder, darling.

SUDDENLY Rose shoots into the shot and strikes a theatrical pose at the
rail next to Mary. Mary bursts out laughing. Rose pulls Jack into the
picture and makes him pose.

Marvin grins and starts yelling and gesturing. We see this in CUTS, with
music and no dialogue.

SERIES OF CUTS:

Rose posing tragically at the rail, the back of her hand to her forehead.

Jack on a deck chair, pretending to be a Pasha, the two girls pantomiming
fanning him like slave girls.

Jack, on his knees, pleading with his hands clasped while Rose, standing,
turns her head in bored disdain.

Rose cranking the camera, while Daniel and Jack have a western shoot-out.
Jack wins and leers into the lens, twirling an air mustache like Snidely
Whiplash.

                                                                   CUT TO:

76 EXT. A DECK PROMENADE / AFT - SUNSET

Painted with orange light, Jack and Rose lean on the A-deck rail aft,
shoulder to shoulder. The ship's lights come on.

It is a magical moment... perfect.

                                   ROSE

So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?

                                   JACK

Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los
Angelas to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a
rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.

                                   ROSE

A whole ten cents?!

                                   JACK

                             (not getting it)

Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But
only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the
real artists were doing.

                                   ROSE

                          (looks at the dusk sky)

Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel
like it.

                             (turning to him)

Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just
talk about it.

                                   JACK

Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster
until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the
surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.

                                   ROSE

You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?

                                   JACK

Sure. If you like.

                                   ROSE

                             (smiling at him)

I think I would.

                        (she looks at the horizon)

And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit.
It's unfair.

                                   JACK

They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch
closely.

He spits. It arcs out over the water.

                                   JACK

Your turn.

Rose screws up her mouth and spits. A pathetic little bit of foamy spittle
which mostly runs down her chin before falling off into the water.

                                   JACK

Nope, that was pitiful. Here, like this... you hawk it down... HHHNNNK!...
then roll it on your tongue, up to the front, like thith, then a big breath
and PLOOOW!! You see the range on that thing?

She goes through the steps. Hawks it down, etc. He coaches her through it
(ad lib) while doing the steps himself. She lets fly. So does he. Two
comets of gob fly out over the water.

                                   JACK

That was great!

Rose turns to him, her face alight. Suddenly she blanches. He sees her
expression and turns.

RUTH, the Countess of Rothes, and Molly Brown have been watching them
hawking lugees. Rose becomes instantly composed.

                                   ROSE

Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.

                                   RUTH

Charmed, I'm sure.

Jack has a little spit running down his chin. He doesn't know it. Molly
Brown is grinning. As Rose proceeds with the introductions, we hear...

                              OLD ROSE (V.O.)

The others were gracious and curious about the man who'd saved my life. But
my mother looked at him like an insect. A dangerous insect which must be
squashed quickly.

                                   MOLLY

Well, Jack, it sounds like you're a good man to have around in a sticky
spot--

They all jump as a BUGLER sounds the meal call right behind them.

                                   MOLLY

Why do they insist on always announcing dinner like a damn cavalry charge?

                                   ROSE

Shall we go dress, mother?

                            (over her shoulder)

See you at dinner, Jack.

                                   RUTH

                            (as they walk away)

Rose, look at you... out in the sun with no hat. Honestly!

The Countess exits with Ruth and Rose, leaving Jack and Molly alone on
deck.

                                   MOLLY

Son, do you have the slightest comprehension of what you're doing?

                                   JACK

Not really.

                                   MOLLY

Well, you're about to go into the snakepit. I hope you're ready. What are
you planning to wear?

Jack looks down at his clothes. Back up at her. He hadn't thought about
that.

                                   MOLLY

I figured.

                                                                   CUT TO:

77 INT. MOLLY BROWN'S STATEROOM

Men's suits and jackets and formal wear are strewn all over the place.
Molly is having a fine time. Jack is dressed, except for his jacket, and
Molly is tying his bow tie.

                                   MOLLY

Don't feel bad about it. My husband still can't tie one of these damn
things after 20 years. There you go.

She picks up a jacket off the bed and hands it to him. Jack goes into the
bathroom to put it on. Molly starts picking up the stuff off the bed.

                                   MOLLY

I gotta buy everything in three sizes 'cause I never know how much he's
been eating while I'm away.

She turns and sees him, though we don't.

                                   MOLLY

My, my, my... you shine up like a new penny.

                                                                   CUT TO:

78 EXT. BOAT DECK / FIRST CLAsS ENTRANCE - DUSK

A purple sky, shot with orange, in the west. Drifting strains of classic
music. We TRACK WITH JACK along the deck. By Edwardian standards he looks
badass. Dashing in his borrowed white-tie outfit, right down to his pearl
studs.

A steward bows and smartly opens the door to the First Class Entrance.

                                  STEWARD

Good evening, sir.

Jack plays the role smoothly. Nods with just the right degree of disdain.

                                                                   CUT TO:

79 INT. UPPER LANDING / GRAND STAIRCASE AND A-DECK

Jack steps in and his breath is taken away by the splendor spread out
before him. Overhead is the enormous glass dome, with a crystal chandelier
at its center. Sweeping down six stories is the First Class Grand
Staircase, the epitome of the opulent naval architecture of the time.

And the people: the women in their floor length dresses, elaborate
hairstyles and abundant jewelry... the gentlemen in evening dress, standing
with one hand at the small of the back, talking quietly.

Jack descends to A deck. Several men nod a perfunctory greeting. He nods
back, keeping it simple. He feels like a spy.

Cal comes down the stairs, with Ruth on his arm, covered in jewelry. They
both walk right past Jack, neither one gecognizeing him. Cal nods at him,
one gent to another. But Jack barely has time to be amused. Because just
behind Cal and Ruth on the stairs is Rose, a vision in red and black, her
low-cut dress showing off her neck and shoulders, her arms seathed in white
gloves that come well above above the elbow. Jack is hypnotized by her
beauty.

CLOSE ON ROSE as she approaches Jack. He imitates the gentlemen's stance,
hand behind his back. She extends her gloved hand and he takes it, kissing
the back of her fingers. Rose flushes, beaming noticeably. She can't take
her eyes off him.

                                   JACK

I saw that in a nickelodean once, and I always wanted to do it.

                                   ROSE

Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson.

                                    CAL

                            (caught off guard)

Dawson! I didn't recognize you.

                               (studies him)

Amazing! You could almost pass for a gentlemen.

                                                                   CUT TO:

80 INT. D-DECK RECEPTION ROOM

CUT TO THE RECEPTION ROOM ON D DECK, as the party descends to dinner. They
encounter Molly Brown, looking good in a beaded dress, in her own busty
broad-shouldered way. Molly grins when she sees Jack. As they are going
into the dining saloon she walks next to him, speaking low:

                                   MOLLY

Ain't nothin' to it, is there, Jack?

                                   JACK

Yeah, you just dress like a pallbearer and keep your nose up.

                                   MOLLY

Remember, the only thing they respect is money, so just act like you've got
a lot of it and you're in the club.

As they enter the swirling throng, Rose leans close to him, pointing out
several notables.

                                   ROSE

There's the Countess Rothes. And that's John Jacob Astor... the richest man
on the ship. His little wifey there, Madeleine, is my age and in a delicate
condition. See how she's trying to hide it. Quite the scandal.

                         (nodding toward a couple)

And over there, that's Sir Cosmo and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon. She designs
naughty lingerie, among her many talents. Very popular with the royals.

Cal becomes engrossed in a conversations with Cosmo Duff-Gordon and Colonel
Gracie, while Ruth, the Countess and Lucille discuss fashion. Rose picots
Jack smoothly, to show him another couple, dressed impeccably.

                                   ROSE

And that's Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress, Madame Aubert. Mrs.
Guggenheim is at home with the children, of course.

Cal, meanwhile, is accepting the praise of his male counterparts, who are
looking at Rose like a prize show horse.

                                 SIR COSMO

Hockley, she is splendid.

                                    CAL

Thank you.

                                  GRACIE

Cal's a lucky man. I know him well, and it can only be luck.

Ruth steps over, hearing the last. She takes Cal's arm, somewhat
coquettishly.

                                   RUTH

How can you say that Colonel? Caledon Hockley is a great catch.

The entourage strolls toward the dining saloon, where they run into the
Astor's going through the ornate double doors.

                                   ROSE

J.J., Madeleine, I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.

                                   ASTOR

                            (shaking his hand)

Good to meet you Jack. Are you of the Boston Dawsons?

                                   JACK

No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually.

J.J. nods as if he's heard of them, then looks puzzled. Madeleine Astor
appraises Jack and whispers girlishly to Rose:

                                 MADELEINE

It's a pity we're both spoken for, isn't it?

                                                                   CUT TO:

81 INT. DINING SALOON

Like a ballroom at the palace, alive and lit by a constellation of
chandeliers, full of elegantly dressed people and beautiful music from
BANDLEADER WALLACE HARTLEY'S small orchestra. As Rose and Jack enter and
move across the room to their table, Cal and Ruth beside them, we hear...

                              OLD ROSE (V.O.)

He must have been nervous but he never faltered. They assumed he was one of
them... a young captain of industry perhaps... new money, obviously, but
still a memeber of the club. Mother of course, could always be counted
upon...

                                                                   CUT TO:

82 INT. DINING SALOON

CLOSE ON RUTH.

                                   RUTH

Tell us of the accommodations in steerage, Mr. Dawson. I hear they're quite
good on this ship.

WIDER: THE TABLE. Jack is seated opposite Rose, who is flanked by Cal and
Thomas Andrews. Also at the table are Molly Brown, Ismay, Colonel Gracie,
the Countess, Guggenheim, Madame Aubert, and the Astors.

                                   JACK

The best I've seen, m'am. Hardly any rats.

Rose motions surreptitiously for Jack to take his napkin off his plate.

                                    CAL

Mr. Dawson is joining us from third class. He was of some assistance to my
fiancee last night.

                        (to Jack, as if to a child)

This is foie gras. It's goose liver.

We see whispers exchanged. Jack becomesthe subject of furtive glances. Now
they're all feeling terribly liberal and dangerous.

                                GUGGENHEIM

                          (low to Madame Aubert)

What is Hockly hoping to prove, bringing this... bohemian... up here?

                                  WAITER

                                 (to Jack)

How do you take your caviar, sir?

                                    CAL

                            (answering for him)

Just a soupcon of lemon...

                            (to Jack, smiling)

...it improves the flavor with champagne.

                                   JACK

                              (to the waiter)

No caviar for me, thanks.

                                 (to Cal)

Never did like it much.

He looks at Rose, pokerfaced, and she smiles.

                                   RUTH

And where exactly do you live, Mr. Dawson?

                                   JACK

Well, right now my address is the RMS Titanic. After that, I'm on God's
good humor.

Salad is served. Jack reaches for the fish fork. Rose gives him a look and
picks up the salad fork, prompting him with her eyes. He changes forks.

                                   RUTH

You find that sort of rootless existence appealing, do you?

                                   JACK

Well... it's a big world, and I want to see it all before I go. My father
was always talkin' about goin' to see the ocean. He died in the town he was
born in, and never did see it. You can't wait around, because you never
know what hand you're going to get dealt next. See, my folks died in a fire
when I was fifteen, and I've been on the road since. Somethin' like that
teaches you to take life as it comes at you. To make each day count.

Molly Brown raises her glass in a salute.

                                   MOLLY

Well said, Jack.

                              COLONEL GRACIE

                            (raising his glass)

Here, here.

Rose raises her glass, looking at Jack.

                                   ROSE

To making it count.

Ruth, annoyed that Jack has scored a point, presses him further.

                                   RUTH

How is it you have the means to travel, Mr. Dawson?

                                   JACK

I work my way from place to place. Tramp steamers and such. I won my ticket
on Titanic here in a lucky hand at poker.

                           (he glances at Rose)

A very lucky hand.

                                  GRACIE

All life is a game of luck.

                                    CAL

A real man makes his own luck, Archie.

Rose notices that Thomas Andrews, sitting next to her, is writing in his
notebook, completely ignoring the conversation.

                                   ROSE

Mr. Andrews, what are you doing? I see you everywhere writing in this
little book.

                           (grabs it and reads)

Increase number of screws in hat hooks from 2 to 3. You build the biggest
ship in the world and this preoccupies you?!

Andrews smiles sheepishly.

                                   ISMAY

He knows every rivet in her, don't you Thomas?

                                  ANDREWS

All three million of them.

                                   ISMAY

His blood and soul are in the ship. She may be mine on paper, but in the
eyes of God she belongs to Thomas Andrews.

                                   ROSE

Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.

                                  ANDREWS

Thankyou, Rose.

We see that Andrews has come under Rose's spell.

83 TIME TRANSITION: Dessert has been served and a waiter arrives with
cigars in a humidor on a wheeled cart. The men start clipping ends and
lighting.

                                   ROSE

                              (low, to Jack)

Nest it'll be brandies in the Smoking Room.

                                  GRACIE

                                 (rising)

Well, join me for a brandy, gentlemen?

                                   ROSE

                                   (low)

Now they retreat into a cloud of smoke and congratulate each other on being
masters of the universe.

                                  GRACIE

Joining us, Dawson? You don't want to stay out here with the women, do you?

Actually he does, but...

                                   JACK

No thanks. I'm heading back.

                                    CAL

Probably best. It'll be all business and politics, that sort of thing.
Wouldn't interest you. Good of you to come.

Cal and te other gentlemen exit.

                                   ROSE

Jack, must you go?

                                   JACK

Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.

He leans over to take her hand.

INSERT: We see him slip a tiny folded not into her palm.

Ruth, scowling, watches him walk away across the enormous room. Rose
surreptitiously opens the note below table level. It reads: "Make it count.
Meet me at the clock".

                                                                   CUT TO:

84 INT. A-DECK FOYER-NIGHT

Rose crosses the A-Deck foyer, sighting Jack at the landing above. Overhead
is the crystal dome. Jack has his back to her, studying the ornate clock
with its carved figures of Honor and Glory. It softly strikes the hour.

MOVING WITH ROSE as she goes up the sweeping staircase toward him. He
turns, sees her... smiles.

                                   JACK

Want to go to a real party?

                                                                   CUT TO:

85 INT. THIRD CLASS GENERAL ROOM

Crow led and alive with music, laughter and raucous carrying on. An ad hoc
band is gathered near the upright piano, honking out lively stomping music
on fiddle, accoridon and tambourine. People of all ages are dancing,
drinking beer and wine, smoking, laughing, even brawling.

Tommy hands Rose a pint of stout and she hoists it. Jack meanwhile dances
with 5 year old Cora Cartmell, or tries to, with her standing on his feet.
As the tune ends, Rose leans down to the little girl.

                                   ROSE

May I cut in, miss?

                                   JACK

You're still my best girl, Cora.

Cora scampers off. Rose and Jack face each other. She is trembling as he
takes her right hand in his left. His other hand slides to the small of her
back. It is an electrifying moment.

                                   ROSE

I don't know the steps.

                                   JACK

Just move with me. Don't think.

The music starts and they are off. A little awkward at first, she starts to
get into it. She grins at Jack as she starts to get the rhythm of the
steops.

                                   ROSE

Wait... stop!

She bends down, pulling off her high heeled shoes, and flings them to
Tommy. Then she grabs Jack and they plunge back into the fray, dancing
faster as the music speeds up.

                                                                   CUT TO:

86 OMITTED

87 INT. THIRD CLASS GENERAL ROOM

The scene is rowdy and rollicking. A table gets knocked over as a drunk
crashes into it. And in the middle of it... Rose dancing with Jack in her
stocking feet. The steps are fast and she shines with sweat. A space opens
around them, and people watch them, clapping as the band plays faster and
faster.

FABRIZIO AND HELGA. Dancing has obviated the need for a common language. He
whirls her, then she responds by whirling him... Fabrizio's eyes go wide
when he realizes she's stronger than he is.

The tune ends in a mad rush. Jack steps away from Rose with a flourish,
allowing her to take a bow. Exhilarated and slightly tipsy, she does a
graceful ballet ployer, feet turned out perfectly. Everyone laughs and
applauds. Rose is a hit with the steerage folks, who've never had a lady
party with them.

They move to a table, flushed and sweaty. Rose grabs Fabrizio's cigarette
and takes a big drag. She's feeling cocky. Fabrizio is grinning, holding
hands with Helga.

                                   JACK

How you two doin'?

                                 FABRIZIO

I don't know hwat she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along
fine.

Tommy walks up with a pint for each of them. Rose chugs hers, showing off.

                                   ROSE

You think a first class girl can't drink?

Everybody else is dancing again, and Bjorn Gundersen crashes into Tommy,
who sloshes his beer over Rose's dress. She laughs, not caring. But Tommy
lunges, grabbing Bjorn and wheeling him around.

                                   TOMMY

You stupid bastard!!

Bjorn comes around, his fists coming up... and Jack leaps into the middle
of it, pushing them apart.

                                   JACK

Boys, boys! Did I ever tell you the one about the Swede and the Irishman
goin' to the whorehouse?

Tommy stands there, all piss and vinegar, chest puffed up. Then he grins
and claps Bjorn on the shoulder.

                                   ROSE

So, you think you're big tough men? Let's see you do this.

In her stocking feet she assumes a ballet stance, arms raised, and goes up
on point, taking her entire weight on the tips of her toes. The guys gape
at her incredible muscle control. She comes back down, then her face screws
up in pain. She grabs one foot, hopping around.

                                   ROSE

Oooowww! I haven't done that in years.

Jack catches her as she loses her balance, and everyone cracks up.

THE DOOR to the well deck is open a few inches as Lovejoy watches through
the gap. He sees Jack holding Rose, both of them laughing.

LOVEJOY closes the door.

                                                                   CUT TO:

88 EXT. BOAT DECK - NIGHT

The stars blaze overhead, so bright and clear you can see the Milky Way.
Rose and Jack walk along the row of lifeboats. Still giddy from the party,
they are singing a popular song "Come Josephine in My Flying Machine".

                                 JACK/ROSE

Come Josephine in my flying machine

And it's up she goes! Up she goes!

In the air she goes. Where? There she goes!

They fumble the words and break down laughing. They have reached the First
Class Entrance, but don't go straight in, not wanting the evening to end.
Through the doors the sound of the ship's orchestra wafts gently. Rose
grabs a davit and leans back, staring at the cosmos.

                                   ROSE

Isn't it magnificent? So grand and endless.

She goes to the rail and leans on it.

                                   ROSE

They're such small people, Jack... my crowd. They think they're giants on
the earth, but they're not even dust in God's eye. They live inside this
little tiny champagne bubble... and someday the bubble's going to burst.

He leans at the rail next to her, his hand just touching hers. It is the
slightest contact imaginable, and all either one of them can feel is that
square inch of skin where their hands are touching.

                                   JACK

You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.

                                   ROSE

A mistake?

                                   JACK

Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.

                                   ROSE

                                (laughing)

I did, didn't I?

                                  (MORE)

                               ROSE (CONT'D)

                            (pointing suddenly)

Look! A shooting star.

                                   JACK

That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it
was a soul going to heaven.

                                   ROSE

I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it?

Jack looks at her, and finds that they are suddenly very close together. It
would be so easy to move another couple of inches, to kiss her. Rose seems
to be thinking the same thing.

                                   JACK

What would you wish for?

After a beat, Rose pulls back.

                                   ROSE

Something I can't have.

                            (she smiles sadly)

Goodnight, Jack. And thank you.

She leaves the rail and hurries through the First Class Entrance.

                                   JACK

Rose!!

But the door bangs shut, and she is gone. Back to her world.

                                                                   CUT TO:

89 INT. ORSE AND CAL'S SUITE / PRIVATE PROMENADE - DAY

SUNDAY APRIL 14, 1912. A bright clear day. Sunlight splashing across the
promenade. Rose and Cal are having breakfast in silence. The tension is
palpable. Trudy Bolt, in her maid's uniform, pours the coffee and goes
inside.

                                    CAL

I had hoped you would come to me last night.

                                   ROSE

I was tired.

                                    CAL

Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.

                                   ROSE

                               (stiffening)

I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.

                                    CAL

You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?

                                   ROSE

I'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am your
fiancee--

Cal explodes, sweeping the breakfast china off the table with a crash. He
moves to her in one shocking moment, glowering over her and gripping the
sides of her chair, so she is trapped between his arms.

                                    CAL

Yes! You are! And my wife... in practice, if not yet by law. So you will
honor me, as a wife is required to honor her husband! I will not be made
out a fool! Is this in any way unclear?

Rose shrinks into the chair. She sees Trudy, frozen, partway through the
door bringing the orange juice. Cal follows Rose's glance and straightens
up. He stalks past the maid, entering the stateroom.

                                   ROSE

We... had a little accident. I'm sorry, Trudy.

                                                                   CUT TO:

90 INT. RUTH'S SUITE - DAY

Rose is dressed for the day, and is in the middle of helping Ruth with her
corset. The tight bindings do not inhibit Ruth's fury at all.

                                   RUTH

You are not to see that boy again, do you understand me Rose? I forbid it!

Rose has her knee at the base of her mother's back and is pulling the
corset strings with both hands.

                                   ROSE

Oh, stop it, Mother. You'll give yourself a nosebleed.

Ruth pulls away from her, and crosses to the door, locking it. CLACK!

                                   RUTH

                             (wheeling on her)

Rose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money's
gone!

                                   ROSE

Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!

                                   RUTH

Your father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a good
name. And that name is the only card we have to play.

Rose turns her around and grabs the corset strings again. Ruth sucks in her
waist and Rose pulls.

                                   RUTH

I don't understand you. It is a fine match with Hockley, and it will insure
our survival.

                                   ROSE

                              (hurt and lost)

How can you put this on my shoulders?

Rose turns to her, and we see what Rose sees-- the naked fear in her
mother's eyes.

                                   RUTH

Do you want to se me working as a seamstress? Is that what you want? Do you
want to see our fine things sold at an auction, our memories scattered to
the winds? My God, Rose, how can you be so selfish?

                                   ROSE

It's so unfair.

                                   RUTH

Of course it's unfair! We're women. Our choices are never easy.

Rose pulls the corset tighter.

                                                                   CUT TO:

91 INT. FIRST CLASS DINING SALOON

At the divine service, Captain Smith is leading a group in the hymn
"Almighty Father Strong To Save." Rose and Ruth sing in the middle of the
group.

Lovejoy stands well back, keeping an eye on Rose. He notices a commotion at
the entry doors. Jack has been halted there by two stewards. He is dressed
in his third class clothes, and stands there, hat in hand, looking out of
place.

                                  STEWARD

Look, you, you're not supposed to be in here.

                                   JACK

I was just here last night... don't you remember?

                    (seeing Lovejoy coming toward him)

He'll tell you.

                                  LOVEJOY

Mr. Hockley and Mrs. DeWitt Bukater continue to be most appreciative of
your assistance. They asked me to give you this in gratitude--

He holds out two twenty dollar bills, which Jack refuses to take.

                                   JACK

I don't want money, I--

                                  LOVEJOY

--and also to remind you that you hold a third class ticket and your
presence here is no longer appropriate.

Jack spots Rose but she doesn't see him.

                                   JACK

I just need to talk to Rose for a--

                                  LOVEJOY

Gentlemen, please see that Mr. Dawson gets back where he belongs.

                   (giving the twenties to the stewards)

And that he stays there.

                                  STEWARD

Yes sir!

                                 (to Jack)

Come along you.

END ON ROSE, not seeing Jack hustled out.

                                   ROSE

                                 (singing)

O hear us when we cry to thee for those in peril on the sea.

                                                                   CUT TO:

92 INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY

An Edwardian nautilus room. There are machines we recognize, and some
don't. A woman pedals a stationary bicycle in a long dress, looking
rediculous. Thomas Andrews is leading a small tour group, including Rose,
Ruth and Cal. Cal is wroking the oars of a stationary rowing machine with a
well trained stroke.

                                    CAL

Reminds me of my Harvard days.

T.W. McCAULEY, the gym instructor, is a bouncy little man in white
flannels, eager to show off his modern equipment, like his present-day
counterpart on an "Abflex" infomercial. He hits a switch and a machine with
a saddle on it starts to undulate. Rose puts her hand on it, curious.

                                 MCCAULEY

The electric horse is very popular. We even have an electric camel.

                                 (to Ruth)

Care to try your hand at the rowing, m'am?

                                   RUTH

Don't be absurd. I can't think of a skill I should likely need less.

                                  ANDREWS

The next stop on our tour will be bridge. This way, please.

                                                                   CUT TO:

93 EXT. AFT WELL DECK, B-DECK AND A-DECK - DAY

Jack, walking with determination, is followed closely by Tommy and
Fabrizio. He quickly climbs the steps to B-Deck and steps over the gate
separating 3rd from 2nd class.

                                   TOMMY

She's a goddess amongst mortal men, there's no denyin'. But she's in
another world, Jackie, forget her. She's closed the door.

Jack moves furtively to the wall below the A-Deck promenade, aft.

                                   JACK

It was them, not her.

                        (glancing around the deck)

Ready... go.

Tommy shakes his head resignedly and puts his hands together, crouching
down. Jack steps into Tommy's hands and gets boosted up to the next deck,
where he scrambles nimbly over the railing, onto the First Class deck.

                                   TOMMY

He's not bein' logical, I tell ya.

                                 FABRIZIO

Amore is'a not logical.

                                                                   CUT TO:

94 EXT. A-DECK / AFT - DAY

A man is playing with his son, who is spinning a top with a string. The
man's overcoat and hat are sitting on a deck chair nearby. Jack emerges
from behind one of the huge deck cranes and calmly picks up the coat and
bowler hat. He walks away, slipping into the coat, and slicks his hair back
with spit. Then puts the hat on at a jaunty angle. At a distance he could
pass for a gentlemen.

                                                                   CUT TO:

95 INT. BRIDGE / CHARTROOM - DAY

HAROLD BRIDE, the 21 year old Junior Wireless Operator, hustles in and
skirts around Andrews' tour group to hand a Marconigram to Captain Smith.

                                   BRIDE

Another ice warning, sir. This one from the "Baltic".

                                   SMITH

Thankyou, Sparks.

Smith glances at the message then nonchalantly puts it in his pocket. He
nods reassuringly to Rose and the group.

                                   SMITH

Not to worry, it's quite normal for this time of year. In fact, we're
speeding up. I've just ordered the last boilers lit.

Andrews scowls slightly before motioning the group toward the door. They
exit just as SECOND OFFICER CHARLES HERBERT LIGHTOLLER comes out of the
chartroom, stopping next to First Officer Murdoch.

                                LIGHTOLLER

Did we ever find those binoculars for the lookouts?

                           FIRST OFFICER MURDOCH

Haven't seen them since Southampton.

                                                                   CUT TO:

96 EXT. BOAT DECK / STARBOARD SIDE - DAY

Andrews leads the group back from the bridge along the boat deck.

                                   ROSE

Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats
times the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there are
not enough for everyone aboard.

                                  ANDREWS

About half, actually. Rose, you miss nothing, do you? In fact, I put in
these new type davits, which can take an extra row of boats here.

                        (he gestures along the eck)

But it was thought... by some... that the deck would look too cluttered. So
I was over-ruled.

                                    CAL

                       (slapping the side of a boat)

Waste of deck space as it is, on an unsinkable ship!

                                  ANDREWS

Sleep soundly, young Rose. I have built you a good ship, strong and true.
She's all the lifeboat you need.

As they are passing Boat 7, a gentlemen turns from the rail and walks up
behind the group. It is Jack. He taps Rose on the arm and she turns,
gasping. He motions and she cuts away from the group toward a door which
Jack holds open. They duck into the--

                                                                   CUT TO:

97 INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY

Jack closes the door behind her, and glances out through the ripple-glass
window to the starboard rail, where the gym instructor is chatting up the
woman who was riding the bike. Rose and Jack are alone in the room.

                                   ROSE

Jack, this is impossible. I can't see you.

He takes her by the shoulders.

                                   JACK

Rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that
you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl
I've ever known and--

                                   ROSE

Jack, I--

                                   JACK

No wait. Let me try to get this out. You're amazing... and I know I have
nothing to offer you, Rose. I know that. But I'm involved now. You jump, I
jump, remember? I can't turn away without knowin' that you're goin' to be
alright.

Rose feels the tears coming to her eyes. Jack is so open and real... not
like anyone she has ever known.

                                   ROSE

You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really.

                                   JACK

I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and
you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause
you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.

                                   ROSE

It's not up to you to save me, Jack.

                                   JACK

You're right. Only you can do that.

                                   ROSE

I have to get back, they'll miss me. Please, Jack, for both our sakes,
leave me alone.

                                                                   CUT TO:

98 INT. FIRST CLASS LOUNG - DAY

The most elegant room on the ship, done in Louis Quinze Versaille style.
Rose sits on a divan, with a group of other women arrayed around her. Ruth,
the Countess Rothes and Lady Duff-Gordon are taking tea. Rose is silent and
still as a porcelain figurine as the conversation washes around her.

                                   RUTH

Of course the invitations had to be sent back to the printers twice. And
the bridesmaids dresses! Let me tell you what an odyssey that has been...

TRACKING SLOWLY IN on Rose as Ruth goes on.

REVERSE, ROSE'S POV: A tabeau of MOTHER and DAUGHTER having tea. The four
year old girl, wearing white gloves, daintily picking up a cookie. The
mother correcting her on her posture, and the way she holds the teacup. The
little girl is trying so hard to please, her expression serious. A glimpse
of Rose at that age, and we see the relentless conditioning... the pain to
becoming an Edwardian geisha.

ON ROSE. She calmly and deliberately turns her teacup over, spilling tea
all over her dress.

                                   ROSE

Oh, look what I've done.

                                                                   CUT TO:

99 EXT. TITANIC - DAY

TITANIC STEAMS TOWARD US, in the dusk light, as if lit by the embers of a
giant fire. As the ship looms, FILLING FRAME, we push in on the bow. Jack
is there, right at the apex of the bow railing, his favorite spot. He
closes his eyes, letting the chill wind clear his head.

Jack hears her voice, behind him...

                                   ROSE

Hello, Jack.

He turns and she is standing there.

                                   ROSE

I changed my mind.

He smiles at her, his eyes drinking her in. Her cheeks are red with the
chill wind, and her eyes sparkle. Her hair blows wildly about her face.

                                   ROSE

Fabrizio said you might be up--

                                   JACK

Sssshh. Come here.

He puts his hands on her waist. As if he is going to kiss her.

                                   JACK

Close your eyes.

She does, and he turns her to face forward, the way the ship is going. He
presses her gently to the rail, standing right behind her. Then he takes
her two hands and raises them until she is standing with her arms
outstetched on each side. Rose is going along with him. When he lowers his
hands, her arms stay up... like wings.

                                   JACK

Okay. Open them.

Rose gasps. There is nothing in her field of vision but water. It's like
there is no ship under them at all, just the two of them soaring. The
Atlantic unrolls toward her, a hammered copper shield under a dusk sky.
There is only the wind, and the hiss of the water 50 feel below.

                                   ROSE

I'm flying!

She leans forward, arching her back. He puts his hands on her waist to
steady her.

                                   JACK

                             (singing softly)

Come Josephine in my flying machine...

Rose cleses her eyes, feeling herself floating weightless far above the
sea. She smiles dreamily, then leans back, gently pressing her back against
his chest. He pushes forward slightly against her.

Slowly he raises his hands, arms outstretched, and they meet hers...
fingertips gently touching. Then their fingers intertwine. Moving slowly,
their fingers caress through and around each other like the bodies of two
lovers.

Jack tips his face forward into her blowing hair, letting the scent of her
wash over him, until his cheek is agianst her ear.

Rose turns her head until her lips are near his. She lowers her arms,
turning further, until she finds his mouth with hers. He wraps his arms
around her from behind, and they kiss like this with her head turned and
tilted back, surrendering to him, to the emotion, to the inevitable. They
kiss, slowly and tremulously, and then with building passion.

Jack and the ship seem to merge into one force of power and optimism,
lifting her, buoying her forward on a magical journey, soaring onward into
a night without fear.

100 IN THE CROW'S NEST, high above and behind them, lookout FREDERICK FLEET
nudges his mate, REGINALD LEE, pointing down at the figures in the bow.

                                   FLEET

Wish I had those bleedin' binoculars.

101 JACK AND ROSE, embracing at the bow rail, DISSOLVE SLOWLY AWAY, leaving
the ruined bow of the WRECK--

                                                                   CUT TO:

102 INT. KELDYSH IMAGING SHACK

OLD ROSE blinks, seeming to come back to the present. She sees the wreck on
the screen, the sad ghost ship deep in the abyss.

                                   ROSE

That was the last time Titanic ever saw daylight.

Brock Lovett changes the tape in the minicassette recorder.

                                   BROCK

So we're up to dusk on the night of the sinking. Six hours to go.

                                  BODINE

Don't you love it? There's Smith, he's standing there with the iceberg
warning in his fucking hand...

                            (remembering Rose)

... excuse me... in his hand, and he's ordering more speed.

                                   BROCK

26 years of experience working against him. He figures anything big enough
to sink the ship they're going to see in time to turn. But the ship's too
big, with too small a rudder... it can't corner worth shit. Everything he
knows is wrong.

ROSE is ignoring this conversation. She has the art-nouveau comb with the
jade butterfly on the handle in her hands, turning it slowly. She is
watching a monitor, which shows the ruins of Suite B-52/56. PUSH IN until
the image fills frame.

                                                               TRANSITION:

103 INT. ROSE'S SUITE

... 1912. Like in a dream the beautiful woodwork and satin upholstery
emerge from the rusted ruin. Jack is overwhelmed by the opulence of the
room. He sets his sketchbood and drawing materials on the marble table.

                                   ROSE

Will this light do? Don't artists need good light?

                                   JACK

                            (bad French accent)

Zat is true, I am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions.

                          (seeing the paintings)

Hey... Monet!

He crouches next to the paintings stacked against the wall.

                                   JACK

Isn't he great... the use of color? I saw him once... through a hole in
this garden fence in Giverny.

She goes into the adjoining walk-in wardrobe closet. He sees her go to the
safe and start working the combination. He's fascinated.

                                   ROSE

Cal insist on luggin this thing everywhere.

                                   JACK

Should I be expecting him anytime soon?

                                   ROSE

Not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out.

CLUNK! She unlocks the safe. Glancing up, she meets his eyes in the mirror
behind the safe. She opens it and removes the necklace, then holds it out
to Jack who takes it nervously.

                                   JACK

What is it? A sapphire?

                                   ROSE

A diamond. A very rare diamond, called the Heart of the Ocean.

Jack gazes at wealth beyond his comprehension.

                                   ROSE

I want you to draw me like your French girl. Wearing this.

                            (she smiles at him)

Wearing only this.

He looks up at her, surprised, and we CUT TO:

104 ROSE'S BEDROOM. ON THE BUTTERFLY COMB as Rose draws it out of her hair.
She shakes her head and her hair falls free around her shoulders.

105 IN THE SITTING ROOM Jack is laying out his pencils like surgical tools.
His sketchbook is open and ready. He looks up as she comes into the room,
wearing a silk kimono.

                                   ROSE

The last thing I need is another picture of me looking like a china doll.
As a paying customer, I expect to get what I want.

She hands him a dime and steps back, parting the kimono. The blue stone
lies on her creamy breast. Her heart is pounding as she slowly lowers the
robe.

Jakc looks so stricken, it is almost comical. The kimono drops to the floor
(this is all in cuts, lyrical).

                                   ROSE

Tell me when it looks right to you.

She poses on the divan, settling like a cat into the position we remember
from the drawing... almost.

                                   JACK

Uh... just bend your left leg a little and... and lower your head. Eyes to
me. That's it.

Jack starts to sketch. He drops his pencil and she stifles a laugh.

                                   ROSE

I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet
blushing.

                                   JACK

                                (sweating)

He does landscapes.

TIGHT ON JACK as his eyes come up to look at her over the top edge of his
sketchpad. We have seen this image of him before, in her memory. It is an
image she will carry the rest of her life.

Despite his nervousness, he draws with sure strokes, and what emerges is
the best thing he has ever done. Her pose is languid, her hands beautiful,
and her eyes radiate her energy.

PUSH SLOWLY IN ON ROSE'S FACE...

                                                               TRANSITION:

106 INT. KELDYSH / IMAGING SHACK

MATCH DISSOLVE/MORPH to Rose, 101 years old. Only her eyes are the same.

                                 OLD ROSE

My heart was pounding the whole time. It was the most erotic moment of my
life... up till then at least.

CUT TO REVERSE: A semicircle of listeners staring in rapt, frozen silence.
The story of Jack and Rose has finally and completely grabbed them.

                                  BODINE

What, uh... happened next?

                                 OLD ROSE

                                 (smiling)

You mean, did we "do it"?

                                                                   CUT TO:

107 INT. ROSE AND CAL'S SUITE - NIGHT

BACK TO 1912. Jack is signing the drawing. Rose, wearing her kimono again,
is leaning on his shoulder, watching.

                              OLD ROSE (V.O.)

Sorry to disappoint you Mr. Bodine.

Rose gazes at the drawing. He has X-rayed her soul.

                                   ROSE

Date it, Jack. I want to always remember this night.

He does: 4/14/1912. Rose meanwhile scribbles a note on a piece of Titanic
stationary. We don't see what it says. She accepts the drawing from him,
and crosses to the safe in the wardrobe.

She puts the diamond back in the safe, placing hte drawing and the note on
top of it. Closes the door with a CLUNK!

                                                                   CUT TO:

108 INT. FIRST CLASS SMOKING ROOM - NIGHT

Lovejoy enters from the Palm Court through the revolving door and crosses
the room toward Hockley. A fire is blazing in the marble fireplace, and the
usual fatcats are playing cards, drinking and talking. Cal sees Lovejoy and
detaches from his group, coming to him.

                                  LOVEJOY

None of the stewards have seen her.

                                    CAL

                            (low but forceful)

This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her.

                                                                   CUT TO:

109 EXT. ATLANTIC - NIGHT

TITANIC glides across an unnatural sea, blakc and calm as a pool of oil.
The ships lights are mirrored almost perfectly in the black water. The sky
is brilliant with stars. A meteor traces a bright line across the heavens.

110 ON THE BRIDGE, Captain Smith peers out at the blackness ahead of the
ship. QUARTERMASTER HITCHINS brings him a cup of hot tea with lemon. It
steams in the bitter cold of the open bridge. Second Officer Lightoller is
next to him, staring out at the sheet of black glass the Atlantic has
become.

                                LIGHTOLLER

I don't think I've ever seen such a flat calm, in 24 years at sea.

                                   SMITH

Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.

                                LIGHTOLLER

It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.

                                   SMITH

Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.

                                LIGHTOLLER

Yes sir.

                                   SMITH

And wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree
doubtful.

                                                                   CUT TO:

111 INT. ROSE AND CAL'S SUITE

Rose, fully dressed now, returns to the sitting room. They hear a key in
the lock. Rose takes Jack's hand and leads him silently through the
bedrooms. Lovejoy enters by the sitting room door.

                                  LOVEJOY

Miss Rose? Hello?

He hears a door opening and goes through Cal's room toward hers.

                                                                   CUT TO:

112 INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUITE

Rose and Jack come out of her stateroom, closing the door. She leads him
quickly along the corridor toward the B deck foyer. They are halfway across
the open space when the sitting room door opens in the corridor and Lovejoy
comes out. The valet sees Jack with Rose and hustles after them.

                                   ROSE

Come on!

She and Jack break into a run, surprising the few ladies and gentlemen
about. Rose leads him past the stairs to the bank of elevators. They run
into one, shocking the hell out of the OPERATOR.

                                   ROSE

Take us down. Quickly, quickly!

The Operator scrambles to comply. Jack even helps him close the steel gate.
Lovejoy runs up as the lift starts to descend. He slams one hand on the
bars of the gate. Rose makes a very rude and unladylike gesture, and laughs
as Lovejoy disappears above. The Operator gapes at her.

                                                                   CUT TO:

113 INT. E-DECK FOYER / ELEVATORS

Lovejoy emerges from another lift and runs to the one Jack and Rose were
in. The Operator is just closing the gate to go back up. Lovejoy runs
around the bank of elevators and scans the foyer... no Jack and Rose. He
tries the stairs going down to F-Deck.

                                                                   CUT TO:

114 INT. F-DECK CORRIDORS / FAN ROOM

A functional space, with access to a number of machine spaces (fan rooms,
boiler uptakes). Jack and Rose are leaning against a wall, laughing.

                                   JACK

Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.

                                   ROSE

He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble...
to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch,
after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town...

                                   JACK

Kinda like we're doin' right now-- uh oh!

Lovejoy has spotted them from a cross-corridor nearby. He charges toward
them. Jack and Rose run around a corner into a blind alley. There is one
door, marked CREW ONLY, and Jack flings it open.

115 They enter a roaring RAN ROOM, with no way out but a ladder going down.
Jack latches the deadbolt on the door, and Lovejoy slams against it a
moment later. Jack grins at Rose, pointing to the ladder.

                                   JACK

After you, m'lady.

                                                                   CUT TO:

116 INT. BOILER ROOM FIVE AND SIX

Jack and Rose come down the escape ladder and look around in amazement. It
is like a vision of hell itself, with the roaring furnaces and black
figures moving in the smoky glow. They run the length of the boiler room,
dodging amazed stokers, and trimmers with their wheelbarrows of coal.

                                   JACK

                          (shouting over the din)

Carry on! Don't mind us!

They run through the open watertight door into BOILER ROOM SIX. Jack pulls
her through the fiercely hot alley between two boilers and they wind up in
the dark, out of sight of the working crew. Watching from the shadows, they
see the stokers working in the hellish glow, shovelling coal into the
insatiable maws of the furnaces. The whole place thunders with the roar of
the fires.

                                                                   CUT TO:

117 INT. FIRST CLASS SMOKING ROOM

Amid unparalled luxury, Cal sits at a card game, sipping brandy.

                              COLONEL GRACIE

We're going like hell I tel you. I have fifty dollars that says we make it
into New York Tuesday night!

Cal looks at his gold pocket watch, and scowls, not listening.

                                                                   CUT TO:

118 OMITTED

119 INT. BOILER ROOM SIX

The furnaces roar, silhouetting the glistening stokers. Jack kisses Rose's
face, tasting the sweat trickling down from her forehead. They kiss
passionately in the steamy, pounding darkness.

                                                                   CUT TO:

120 INT. HOLD #2

Jack and Rose enter and run laughing between the rows of stacked cargo. She
hugs herself against the cold, after the dripping heat of the boiler room.

They come upon William Carter's brand new RENAULT touring car, lashing down
to a pallet. It looks like a royal coach from a fairy tale, its brass trim
and headlamps nicely set off by its deep burgundy color.

Rose climbs into the plushly upholstered back seat, acting very royal.
There are cut crystals bud vases on the walls back there, each containing a
rose. Jack jumps into the driver's seat, enjoying hte feel of the leather
and wood.

                                   JACK

Where to, Miss?

                                   ROSE

To the stars.

ON JACK as her hands come out of the shadows and pull him over the seat
into the back. He lands next to her, and his breath seems loud in the quiet
darkness. He looks at her and she is smiling. It is the moment of truth.

                                   JACK

Are you nervous?

                                   ROSE

Au contraire, mon cher.

He strokes her face, cherishing her. She kisses his artist's fingers.

                                   ROSE

Put your hands on me Jack.

He kisses her, and she slides down in the seat under his welcome weight.

                                                                   CUT TO:

121 INT. WIRELESS ROOM

A BRILLIANT ARC OF ELECTRICITY fills frame-- the sparks gap of the Marconi
instrument as SENIOR WIRELESS OPERATOR JACK PHILLIPS (24) rapidly keys out
a message. Junior Operator Bride looks through the huge stack of outgoing
messages swamping them.

                                   BRIDE

Look at this one, he wants his private train to meet him. La dee da.

                             (slaps them down)

We'll be up all bloody night on this lot.

Phillips start to receive an incoming message from a nearby ship, the
Leyland frieghter CALIFORNIAN, which jams his outgoing signal. At such
close range, the beeps are deafening.

                                 PHILLIPS

Christ! It's that idiot on the Californian.

Cursing, Phillips furiously keys a rebuke.

                                                                   CUT TO:

122 INT. / EXT. WIRELESS SHAK / FREIGHTER CALIFORNIAN

Wireless Operater CYRIL EVANS pulls his earphone off his ear as the
Titanic's spark deafens him. he translates the message for THIRD OFFICER
GROVES.

                                   EVANS

Stupid bastard. I try to warn him about the ice, and he says "Keep out.
Shut up. I'm working Cape Race."

                                  GROVES

Now what's he sending?

                                   EVANS

"No seasickness. Poker business good. Al". Well that's it for me. I'm
shutting down.

As Evans wearily switches off his generator, Groves goes out on deck. PAN
oFF Him to reveal the ship is stopped fifty yards from the edge of a field
of pack ice and icebergs stretching as far as the eye can see.

                                                                   CUT TO:

123 EXT. OCEAN / TITANIC

ON TITANIC, steaming hellbent through the darkness, hurling up white water
at the bows. The bow comes straight at us, until the bow wave WIPES THE
FRAME--

                                                                   CUT TO:

124 INT. HOLD #2

PUSHING IN on the rear window of the Renault, which is completely fogged
up. Rose's hand comes up and slams against the glass for a moment, making a
handprint in the veil of condensation.

INSIDE THE CAR, Jack's overcoat is liek a blanket over them. It stirs and
Rose pulls it down. They are huddled under it, intertwined, still mostly
clothed. Their faces are flushed and they look at each other wonderingly.
She puts her hand on his face, as if making sure he is real.

                                   ROSE

You're trembling.

                                   JACK

It's okay. I'm alright.

He lays his cheek against her chest.

                                   JACK

I can feel your heart beating.

She hugs his head to her chest, and just holds on for dear life.

                              OLD ROSE (V.O.)

Well, I wasn't the first teenage girl to get seduced in the backseat of a
car, and certainly not the last, by several million. He had such fine
hands, artists' hands, but strong too... roughened by work. I remember
their touch even now.

                                                                   CUT TO:

125 EXT. ATLANTIC / TITANIC - NIGHT

The bow sweeps under us, and the CAMERA CLIMBS toward the foremast and the
tiny half-cylinder of the crow's nest, which grows as we push in on
lookouts Fleet and Lee. They are stamping their feet and swinging their
arms, trying to keep warm in the 22 knot freezing wind, which whips capor
of their breath away behind.

                                   FLEET

You can smell ice, you know, when it's near.

                                    LEE

Bollocks.

                                   FLEET

Well I can.

                                                                   CUT TO:

126 INT. BOILER ROOM SIX

Without hearing hte words over the roar of the furnaces, we see stokers
telling TWO STEWARDS which way Rose and Jack went. The stewards move off
toward the forward holds.

                                                                   CUT TO:

127 INT. CAL AND ROSE'S SUITE

Cal stands at the open safe. He stares at the drawing of Rose and his face
clenches with fury. He reads the not again: "DARLING, NOW YOU CAN KEEP US
BOTH LOCKED IN YOUR SAFE, ROSE".

Lovejoy, standing behind him, looks over his shoulder at the drawing. Cal
crumples Rose's not, then takes the drawing in both hands as if to rip it
in half. He tenses to do it, then stops himself.

                                    CAL

I have a better idea.

                                                                   CUT TO:

128 INT. HOLD #2 - NIGHT

The two stewards enter. They have electric torches and play the beams
around the hold. They spot the Renault with its fogged up rear window and
approach it slowly.

FROM INSIDE we see the torch light up Rose's passionate handprint, still
there on the fogged up glass. One steward whips open the door.

                                  STEWARD

Got yer!

REVERSE: the back seat is empty.

                                                                   CUT TO:

129 EXT. FORWARD WELL DECK AND CROW'S NEST - NIGHT

Rose and Jack, fully dressed, come through a crew door onto the deck. They
can barely stand, they are laughing so hard.

UP ABOVE THEM, IN THE CROW'S NEST, lookout Fleet hears the disturbance
below and looks around and back down to the well deck, where he can see two
figures embracing.

Jack and Rose stand in each others arms. Their breath clouds around them in
the now freezing air, but they don't even feel the cold.

                                   ROSE

When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you.

                                   JACK

This is crazy.

                                   ROSE

I know. It doesn't make any sense. That's why I trust it.

Jack pulls her to him and kisses her fiercely.

130 IN THE CROW'S NEST Fleet nudges Lee.

                                   FLEET

Cor... look at that, would ya.

                                    LEE

They're a bloody sight warmer than we are.

                                   FLEET

Well if that's what it takes for us two to get warm, I'd rather not, if
it's all the same.

They both have a good laugh at that one. It is Fleet whose expression falls
first. Glancing forward again, he does a double take. The color drains out
of his face.

FLEET'S POV: a massive iceberg right in their path, 500 yards out.

                                   FLEET

Bugger me!!

Fleet reaches past Lee and rings the lookout bell three times, then grabs
the telephone, calling the bridge. He waits precious seconds for it to be
picket up, never taking his eyes off the black mass ahead.

                                   FLEET

Pick up, ya bastard.

                                                                   CUT TO:

131 INT. / EXT. BRIDGE

Inside the enclosed wheelhous, SIXTH OFFICER MOODY walks unhurriedly to the
telephone, picking it up.

                               FLEET (V.O.)

Is someone there?

                                   MOODY

Yes. What do you see?

                                   FLEET

Iceberg right ahead!

                                   MOODY

Thankyou.

                       (hangs up, calls to Murdoch)

Iceberg right ahead!

Murdoch sees it and rushes to the engine room telegraph. While signaling
"FULL SPEED ASTERN" he yells to Quartermaster Hitchins, who is at the
wheel.

                                  MURDOCH

Hard a' starboard.

                                   MOODY

                        (standing behind Hitchins)

Hard'a starboard. The helm is hard over, sir.

CRASH SEQUENCE / SERIES OF CUTS:

132 CHIEF ENGINEER BELL is just checking the soup he has warming on a steam
manifold when the engine telegraph clangs, then goes... incredibly... to
FULL SPEED ASTERN. He and the other ENGINEERS just stare at it a second,
unbelieving. Then Bell reacts.

                                   BELL

Full astern! FULL ASTERN!!

The engineers and greasers like madmen to close steam valves and start
braking the mighty propeller shafts, big as Sequias, to a stop.

133 IN BOILER ROOM SIX, Leading Stoker FREDERICK BARRETT is standing with
2nd Engineer JAMES HESKETH when the red warning light and "STOP" indicator
come on.

                                  BARRETT

Shut all dampers! Shut 'em!!

134 FROM THE BRIDGE Murdoch watches the burg growing... straight ahead. The
bow finally starts to come left (since the ship turns the reverse of the
helm setting).

MURDOCH'S jaw clenches as the bow turns with agonizing slowness. He holds
his breath as the horrible physics play out.

135 IN THE CROW'S NEST Frederick Fleet braces himself.

136 THE BOW OF THE SHIP thunders right at CAMERA and--

KRUUUNCH!! The ship hits the berg on its starboard bow.

137 UNDERWATER we see the ice smashing in the steel hull plates. The
iceberg bumps and scrapes along the side of the ship. Rivets pop as the
steel plate of the hull flexes under the load.

138 IN #2 HOLD the two stewards stagger as the hull buckles in four feet
with a sound like THUNDER. Like a sledgehammer beating along outside the
ship, the berg splits the hull plates and the sea pour in, sweeping them
off their feert. The icy water swirls around the Renault as the men
scramble for the stairs.

139 ON G-DECK forward Fabrizio is tossed in his bunk by the impact. He
hears a sound like the greatly amplified squeal of a skate on ice.

140 IN BOILER ROOM SIX Barret and Hesketh stagger as they hear the ROLLING
THUNDER of the collision. They see the starboard side of the ship buckle in
toward them and are almost swept off their feet by a rush of water coming
in about two feet above the floor.

141 ON THE FORWARD WELL DECK Jack and Rose break their kiss and look up in
astonishment as the berg sails past, blocking out the sky like a mountain.
Fragments break off it and crash down onto the deck, and they have to jump
back to avoid flying chunks of ice.

142 ON THE BRIDGE Murdoch rings the watertight door alarm. He quicky throws
the switch that closes them.

                                  MURDOCH

Hard a 'port!

Judging the berg to be amidships, he is trying to clear the stern.

143 BARRETT AND HESKETH hear the DOOR ALARM and scramble through the
swirling water to the watertight door between Boiler Rooms 6 and 5. The
room is full of water vapor as the cold sea strikes the red hot furnaces.
Barrett yells to the stokers scrambling through the door as it comes down
like a slow guillotine.

                                  BARRETT

Go Lads! Go! Go!

He dives through into Boiler Room 5 just before the door rumbles down with
a CLANG.

144 JACK AND ROSE rush to the starboard rail in time to see the berg moving
aft down the side of the ship.

145 In his stateroom, surrounded by piles of plans while making notes in
his ever-present book, Andrews looks up at the sound of a cut-crystal light
fixture tinkling like a windchime.

He feels the shudder run through the ship. And we see it in his face. Too
much of his soul is in this great ship for him not to feel its mortal
wound.

146 IN THE FIRST CLASS SMOKING ROOM Gracie watches his highball vibrating
on the table.

147 IN THE PALM COURT, with its high arched windows, Molly Brown holds up
her drink to a passing waiter.

                                   MOLLY

Hey, can I get some ice here, please?

Silently, a moving wall of ice fills the window behind her. She doesn't see
it. It disappears astern.

148 OMITTED

149 IN THE CROW'S NEST Fleet turns to his Lee...

                                   FLEET

Oy, mate... that was a close shave.

                                    LEE

Smell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ!

                                                                   CUT TO:

150 INT. / EXT. BRIDGE

CLOSE ON MURDOCH. The alarm bells still clatter mindlessly, seeming to
reflect his inner state. He is in shock, unable to get a grip on what just
happened. He just ran the biggest ship in history into an iceberg on its
maiden voyage.

                                  MURDOCH

                            (stiffly, to Moody)

Note the time. Enter it in the log.

Captain Smith rushes out of his cabin onto the bridge, tucking in his
shirt.

                                   SMITH

What was that, Mr. Murdoch?

                                  MURDOCH

An iceberg, sir. I put her hard a' starboard and run the engines full
astern, but it was too close. I tried to port around it, but she hi... and
I--

                                   SMITH

Close the emergency doors.

                                  MURDOCH

The doors are closed.

Together they rush out onto the starboard wing, and Murdoch points. Smith
looks into the darkness aft, then wheels around to FOURTH OFFICER BOHALL.

                                   SMITH

Find the Carpenter and get him to sound the ship.

                                                                   CUT TO:

151 INT. G-DECK FORWARD

In steerage, Fabrizio comes out into the hall to see what's going on. He
sees dozens of rats running toward him in the corridor, fleeing the
flooding bow. Fabrizio jumps aside as the rats run by.

                                 FABRIZIO

Ma-- che cazzo!

152 IN HIS STATEROOM Tommy gets out of his top bunk in the dark and drops
down to the floor. SPLASH!!

                                  TOMMMY

Cor!! What in hell--?!

He naps on the light. The floor is covered with 3 inches of freezing water,
and more coming in. He pulls the door open, and steps out into the
corridor, which is flooded. Fabrizio is running toward him, yelling
something in Italian. Tommy and Fabrizio start pounding on doors, getting
everybody up and out. The alarm spreads in several languages.

                                                                   CUT TO:

153 INT. FIRST CLASS CORRIDOR / A-DECK

A couple of people have come out into the corridor in robes and slippers. A
STeWARD hurries along, reassuring them.

                                   WOMAN

Why have the engines stopped? I felt a shudder?

                                STEWARD #1

I shouldn't worry, m'am. We've likely thrown a propeller blade, that's the
shudder you felt. May I bring you anything?

THOMAS ANDREWS brushes past them, walking fast and carrying an armload of
rolled up ship's plans.

                                                                   CUT TO:

154 EXT. FORWARD WELL DECK

Jack and Rose are leaning over the starboard rail, looking at the hull of
the ship.

                                   JACK

Looks okay. I don't see anything.

                                   ROSE

Could it have damaged the ship?

                                   JACK

It didn't seem like much of a bump. I'm sure we're okay.

Behind them a couple of steerage guys are kicking the ice around the deck,
laughing.

                                                                   CUT TO:

155 INT. STEERAGE FORWARD

Fabrizio and Tommy are in a crowd of steerage men clogging the corridors,
heading aft away from the flooding. Many of them have grabbed suitcases and
duffel bags, some of which are soaked.

                                   TOMMY

If this is the direction the rats were runnin', it's good enough for me.

                                                                   CUT TO:

156 INT. CORRIDOR ON B DECK

Bruce Ismay, dressed in pajamas under the topcoat, hurries down the
corridor, headed for the bridge. An officious steward named BARNES comes
along the other direction, getting the few concerned passengers back into
their rooms.

                              STEWARD BARNES

There's no cause for alarm. Please, go back to your rooms.

He is stopped in his tracks by Cal and Lovejoy.

                              STEWARD BARNES

Please, sir. There's no emergency--

                                    CAL

Yes there is, I have been robbed. Now get the Master at Arms. Now you
moron!

                                                                   CUT TO:

157 INT. BRIDGE / CHARTROOM

C.U. CAPTAIN SMITH studying the commutator.

He turns to Andrews, standing behind him.

                                   SMITH

A five degree list in less than ten minutes.

SHIP'S CARPENTER JOHN HUTCHINSON enters behind him, out of breath and
clearly unnerved.

                                HUTCHINSON

She's making water fast... in the forepeak tank and the forward holds, in
boiler room six.

ISMAY enters, his movements quick with anger and frustration. Smith glances
at him with annoyance.

                                   ISMAY

Why have we stopped?

                                   SMITH

We've struck ice.

                                   ISMAY

Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?

                                   SMITH

                                 (glaring)

Excuse me.

Smith pushes past him, with Andrews and Hutchinson in tow.

                                                                   CUT TO:

158 INT. BOILER ROOM 6

Strokers and firemen are struggling to draw the fires. They are working in
waist deep water churning around as it flows into the boiler room, ice cold
and swirling with grease from the machinery. Chief Engineer Bell comes
partway down the ladder and shouts.

                                   BELL

That's it, lads. Get the hell up!

They scramble up the escape ladders.

                                                                   CUT TO:

159 EXT. B-DECK FORWARD / WELL DECK

The gentlemen, now joined by another man, leans on the forward rail
watching the steerage men playing soccer with chunks of ice.

                                 GENTLEMAN

I guess it's nothing too serious. I'm going back to my cabin to read.

A 20ish YALE MAN pops through the door wearing a topcoat over pajamas.

                                   YALEY

Say, did I miss the fun?

Rose and Jack come up the steps from the well deck, which are right next to
the three men. They stare as the couple climbs over the locked gate.

A moment later Captain Smith rounds the corner, followed by Andrews and
Carpenter Hutchinson. They have come down from the bridge by the outside
stairs. The three men, their faces grim, crush right past Jack and Rose.
Andrews barely glances at her.

                                   SMITH

Can you shore up?

                                HUTCHINSON

Not unless the pumps get ahead.

The inspection party goes down the stairs to the well deck.

                                   JACK

                               (low, to her)

It's bad.

                                   ROSE

We have to tell Mother and Cal.

                                   JACK

Now it's worse.

                                   ROSE

Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?

                                   JACK

Right.

Jack follows Rose through the door inside the ship.

                                                                   CUT TO:

160 INT. B-DECK FOYER / CORRIDOR

Jack and Rose cross the foyer, entering the corridor. Lovejoy is waiting
for them in the hall as they approach the room.

                                  LOVEJOY

We've been looking for you miss.

Lovejoy follows and, unseen, moves close behind Jack and smoothly slips the
diamond necklace into the pocket of his overcoat.

                                                                   CUT TO:

161 INT. ROSE AND CAL'S SUITE

Cal and Ruth wait in the sitting room, along with the Master at Arms and
two stewards (Steward #1 and Barnes). Silence as Rose and Jack enter. Ruth
closes her robe at her throat when she sees Jack.

                                   ROSE

Something serious has happened.

                                    CAL

That's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that
one is back...

                       (he looks from Rose to Jack)

... I have a pretty good idea where to fine the other.

                            (to Master at Arms)

Search him.

The Master at Arms steps up to Jack.

                              MASTER AT ARMS

Coat off, mate.

Lovejoy pulls at Jack's coat and Jack shakes his head in dismay, shrugging
out of it. The Master at Arms pats him down.

                                   JACK

This is horseshit.

                                   ROSE

Cal, you can't be serious! We're in the middle of an emergency and you--

Steward Barnes pulls the Heart of the Ocean out of the pocket of Jack's
coat.

                              STEWARD BARNES

Is this it?

Rose is stunned. Needless to say, so is Jack.

                                    CAL

That's it.

                              MASTER AT ARMS

Right then. Now don't make a fuss.

He starts to handcuff Jack.

                                   JACK

Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!

                                   ROSE

                                (uncertain)

He couldn't have.

                                    CAL

Of course he could. Easy enough for a professional. He memorized the
combination when you opend the safe.

FLASHBACK: Rose at the safe, looking in the mirror and meeting Jack's eyes
as he stands behind her, watching.

                                   ROSE

But I was with him the whole time.

                                    CAL

                        (just to her, low and cold)

Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.

                                   JACK

They put it in my pocket!

                                  LOVEJOY

                           (holding Jack's coat)

It's not even your pocket, son.

                                 (reading)

"Property of A. L. Ryerson".

Lovejoy shows the coat to the Master at Arms. There is a label inside the
collar with the owner's name.

                              MASTER AT ARMS

That was reported stolen today.

                                   JACK

I was going to return it! Rose--

Rose feels utterly betrayed, hurt and confused. She shrinks away from him.
He starts shouting to her as Lovejoy and the Master at Arms drag him out
into the hall. She can't look him in the eye.

                                   JACK

Rose, don't listen to them... I didn't do this! You know I didn't! You know
it!

She is devastated. Her mother lays a comforting hand on her shoulder as te
tears well up.

                                   RUTH

Why do women believe men?

                                                                   CUT TO:

162 INT. MAIL SORTING ROOM / HOLD

Smith and Andrews come down the steps to the Mail Sorting Room and finds
the clerks scrambling to pull mail from the racks. They are furiously
hauling wet sacks of mail up from the hold below.

Andrews climbs partway down the stairs to the hold, which is almost full.
Sacks of mail float everywhere. The lights are still on below the surface,
casting an eerie glow. The Renault is visible under the water, the brass
glinting cheerfully. Andrews looks down as the water covers his shoe, and
scrambles back up the stairs.

                                                                   CUT TO:

163 INT. BRIDE / CHARTROOM

Andrews unrolls a big drawing of the ship across the chartroom table. It is
a side elevation, showing all the watertight bulkheads. His hands are
shaking. Murdoch and Ismay hover behind Andrews and the Captain.

                                   ISMAY

When can we get underway, do you think?

Smith glares at him and turns his attention to Andrews' drawing. The
builder points to it for emphasis as he talks.

                                  ANDREWS

Water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all
three holds... and in boiler room six.

                                   SMITH

That's right.

                                  ANDREWS

Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments
breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water
will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the
next... back and back. There's no stopping it.

                                   SMITH

The pumps--

                                  ANDREWS

The pumps buy you time... but minutes only. From this moment, no matter
what we do, Titanic will founder.

                                   ISMAY

But this ship can't sink!

                                  ANDREWS

She is made of iron, sir. I assure you, she can. And she will. It is a
mathematical certainty.

Smith looks like he has been gutpunched.

                                   SMITH

How much time?

                                  ANDREWS

An hour, two at most.

Ismay reels as his dream turns into his worst nightmare.

                                   SMITH

And how many aboard, Mr. Murdoch?

                                  MURDOCH

Two thousand two hundred souls aboard, sir.

A long beat. Smith turns to his employer.

                                   SMITH

I believe you may get your headlines, Mr. Ismay.

                                                                   CUT TO:

164 EXT. BOAT DECK

Andrews is striding along the boat deck, as seamen and officers scurry to
uncover the boats. Steam is venting from pipes on the funnes overhead, and
the din is horrendous. Speech is difficult adding to the crew's level of
disorganization. Andrews sees some men fumbling with the mechanism of one
of the Wellin davits and yells to them over the roar of steam.

                                  ANDREWS

Turn to the right! Pull the falls taut before you unchock. Have you never
had a boat drill?

                                  SEAMAN

No sir! Not with these new davits, sir.

He looks around, disguisted as the crew fumble with the davits, and the
tackle for the "falls"... the ropes which are used to lower the boats. A
few passengers are coming out on deck, hesitantly in the noise and bitter
cold.

                                                                   CUT TO:

165 INT. ROSE AND CAL'S SUITE

From inside the sitting room they can hear knocking and voices in the
corridor.

                                   RUTH

I had better go dress.

Ruth exits and Hockley crosses to Rose. He regards her coldly for a moment,
then SLAPS her across the face.

                                    CAL

It is a little slut, isn't it?

To Rose the blow is inconsequential compared to the blow her heart has been
given. Cal grabs her shoulders roughly.

                                    CAL

Look at me, you little--

There is a loud knock on the door and an urgent voice. The door opens and
their steward puts his head in.

                              STEWARD BARNES

Sir, I've been told to ask you to please put on your lifebelt, and come up
to the boat deck.

                                    CAL

Get out. We're busy.

The steward persists, coming in to get the lifebelts down from the top of a
dresser.

                                  STEWARD

I'm sorry about the inconvenience, Mr. Hockley, but it's Captain's orders.
Please dress warmly, it's quite cold tonight.

                       (he hands a lifebelt to Rose)

Not to worry, miss, I'm sure it's just a precaution.

                                    CAL

This is ridiculous.

In the corridor outside the stewards are being so polite and obsequious
they are conveying no sense of danger whatsoever. However, it's another
story in...

                                                                   CUT TO:

166 INT. STEERAGE BERTHING AFT

BLACKNESS. Then BANG! The door is thrown open and the lights snapped on by
a steward. The Cartmell family rouses from a sound sleep.

                                STEWARD #2

Everybody up. Let's go. Put your lifebelts on.

IN THE CORRIDOR outside, another steward is going from door to door along
the hall, pouncing and yelling.

                                STEWARD #2

Lifebelts on. Lifebelts on. Everybody up, come on. Lifebelts on...

People come out of the doors behind the steward, perplexed. In the
foreground a SYRIAN WOMAN asks her husband what was said. He shrugs.

                                                                   CUT TO:

167 INT. WIRELESS ROOM

ON PHILLIPS, looking shocked.

                                 PHILLIPS

CQD, sir?

                                   SMITH

That's right. The distress call. CQD. Tell whoever responds that we are
going down by the head and need immediate assistance.

Smith hurries out.

                                 PHILLIPS

Blimey.

                                   BRIDE

Maybe you ought to try that new distress call... S.O.S.

                                (grinning)

It may be our only chance to use it.

Phillips laughs in spite of himself and starts sending history's first
S.O.S. Dit dit dit, da da da, dit dit dit... over and over.

                                                                   CUT TO:

168 EXT. BOAT DECK

Thomas Andrews looks around in amazement. The deck is empty except for the
crew fumbling with the davits. He yells over the roar of the steam to First
Officer Murdoch.

                                  ANDREWS

Where are all the passengers?

                                  MURDOCH

They've all gone back inside. Too damn cold and noisy for them.

Andrews feels like he is in a bad dream. He looks at his pocketwatch and
heads for the foyer entrance.

                                                                   CUT TO:

169 INT. A-DECK FOYER

A large number of First Class passengers have gathered near the staircase.
They are getting indignant about the confusion. Molly Brown snags a passing
YOUNG STEWARD.

                                   MOLLY

What's doing, sonny? You've got us all trussed up and now we're cooling our
heels.

The young steward backs away, actually stumbling on the stairs.

                               YOUNG STEWARD

Sorry, mum. Let me go and find out.

The jumpy piano rhythm of "Alexander's Ragtime Band" comes out of the first
class lounge a few yards away. Band leader WALLACE HARTLEY has assembled
some of his men on Captain's orders, to allay panic.

Hockley's entourage comes up to the A-deck foyer. Cal is carrying the
lifebelts, almost as an afterthought. Rose is like a sleepwalker.

                                    CAL

It's just the God damned English doing everything by the book.

                                   RUTH

There's no need for language, Mr. Hockley.

                                (to Trudy)

Go back and turn the heater on in my room, so it won't be too cold when we
get back.

Thomas Andrews enters, looking around the magnificent room, which he knows
is doomed. Rose, standing nearby, sees his heartbroken expression. She
walks over to him and Cal goes after her.

                                   ROSE

I saw the iceberg, Mr. Andrews. And I see it in your eyes. Please tell me
the truth.

                                  ANDREWS

The ship will sink.

                                   ROSE

You're certain?

                                  ANDREWS

Yes. In an hour or so... all this... will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.

                                    CAL

My God.

Now it is Cal's turn to look stunned. The Titanic? Sinking?

                                  ANDREWS

Please tell only who you must, I don't want to be responsible for a panic.
And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about
the boats?

                                   ROSE

Yes, I understand. Thankyou.

Andrews goes off, moving among the passengers and urging them to put on
their lifebelts and get to the boats.

                                                                   CUT TO:

170 INT. MASTER AT ARMS OFFICE

Lovejoy and the Master at Arms are handcuffing Jack to a 4" WATER PIPE as a
crewman rushes in anxiously and almost blurts to the Master at Arms--

                                  CREWMAN

You're wanted by the Purser, sir. Urgently.

                                  LOVEJOY

Go on. I'll keep an eye on him.

Lovejoy pulls a pearl handled Colt .45 automatic from under his coat. The
Master at Arms nods and tosses the handcuff key to Lovejoy, then exits with
the crewman. Lovejoy flips the key in the air. Catches it.

                                                                   CUT TO:

171 INT. BRIDGE

Junior Wireless Operator Bride is relaying a message to Captain Smith from
the CUNARD LINER CARPATHIA.

                                   BRIDE

Carpathia says they're making 17 knots, full steam for them, sir.

                                   SMITH

And she's the only one who's responding?

                                   BRIDE

The only one close, sir. She says they can be here in four hours.

                                   SMITH

Four hours!

The enormity of it hits Smith like a sledgehammer blow.

                                   SMITH

Thank you, Bride.

He turns as Bride exits, and looks out onto the blackness.

                                   SMITH

                               (to himself)

My God.

                                                                   CUT TO:

172 EXT. BOAT DECK - NIGHT

Lightoller has his boats swung out. He is standing amidst a crowd of
uncertain passengers in all states of dress and undress. One first class
woman is barefoot. Others are in stockings. The maitre of the restaurant is
in top hat and overcoat. Others are still in evening dress, while some are
in bathrobes and kimonos. Women are wearing lifebelts over velvet gowns,
then topping it with sble stoles. Some brought jewels, others books, even
small dogs.

Lightoller sees Smith walking stiffly toward him and quickly goes to him.
He yells into the Captain's ear, through cupped hands, over the roar of the
steam...

                                LIGHTOLLER

Hadn't we better get the women and children into the boats, sir?

Smith just nods, a bit abstractly. The fire has gone out of him. Lightoller
sees the awesome truth in Smith's face.

                                LIGHTOLLER

                               (to the men)

Right! Start the loading. Women and children!

The appalling din of escaping steam abruptly cuts off, leaving a sudden
unearthly silence in which Lightoller's voice echoes.

ON WALLACE HARTLEY raising his violin to play.

                                  HARTLEY

Number 26. Ready and--

The band has reassembled just outside the First Class Entrance, port side,
near where Lightoller is calling for the boats to be loaded. They strike up
a waltz, lively and elegant. The music wafts all over the ship.

                                LIGHTOLLER

Ladies, please. Step into the boat.

Finally one soman steps across the gap, into the boat, terrified of the
drop to the water far below.

                              WOMAN IN CROWD

You watch. They'll put us off in these silly little boats to freeze, and
we'll all be back on board by breakfast.

Cal, Rose and Ruth come out of the doors near the band.

                                   RUTH

My brooch, I left my brooch. I must have it!

She turns back to go to her room but Cal takes her by the arm, refusing to
let her go. The firmness of his hold surprises her.

                                    CAL

Stay here, Ruth.

Ruth sees his expression, and knows fear for the first time.

                                                                   CUT TO:

173 INT. STEERAGE BERTHING AFT / CORRIDORS AND STAIRWELL

It is chaos, with stewards pushing their way through narrow corridors
clogged with peopel carrying suitcases, duffel bags, children. Some have
lifebelts on, others don't.

                                STEWARD #2

                              (to Steward #3)

I told the stupid sods no luggage. Aw, bloody hell!

He throws up his hand at the sight of a family, loaded down with cases and
bags, completely blocking the corridor.

Fabrizio and Tommy push past the stewards, going the other way. They rech a
huge crowd gathered at the bottom of the MAIN 3RD CLASS STAIRWELL. Fabrizio
spots Helga with the rest of the Dahl family, standing patiently with
suitcases in hand. He reaches her and she grins, hugging him.

Tommy pushes to where he can see what's holding up the group. There is a
steel gate across the top of the stairs, with several stewards and seamen
on the other side.

                                  STEWARD

Stay calm, please. It's not time to go up to the boats yet.

Near Tommy, an IRISHWOMAN stands stoically with two small children and
their battered luggage.

                                LITTLE BOY

What are we doing, mummy?

                                   WOMAN

We're just waiting, dear. When they fiish putting First Class people in the
boats, they'll be startin' with us, and we'll want to be all ready, won't
we?

                                                                   CUT TO:

174 EXT. STARBOARD SIDE

Boat 7 is less than half full, with 28 aboard a boat made for 65.

                           FIRST OFFICER MURDOCH

Lower away! By the left and right together, stady lads!

The boat lurches as the falls start to pay out through the pulley blocks.
The women gasp. The boat descends, swaying and jerking, toward the water 60
feet below. The passengers are terrified.

                                                                   CUT TO:

175 EXT. / INT. TITANIC HULL AND MASTER AT ARMS OFFICE

TRACKING along the rows of portholes angling down into the water. Under the
surface, they glow green. PUSHING IN on one porthole which is have
submerged. Inside we see Jack, looking apprehensively at the water rising
up the glass.

INSIDE THE MASTER AT ARMS' OFFICE Jack sits chained to the waterpipe, next
to the porthole. Lovejoy sits on the edge of a desk. He puts a .45 bullet
on the desk and watches it roll across and fall off. He picks up the
bullet.

                                  LOVEJOY

You know... I believe this ship may sink.

                             (crosses to Jack)

I've been asked to give you this small token of our appreciation...

He punches Jack hard in the stomach, knocking the wind out of him.

                                  LOVEJOY

Compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley.

Lovejoy flips the handcuff key in the air, catches it and puts it in his
pocket. He exits. Jack is left gasping, handcuffed to the pipe.

                                                                   CUT TO:

176 EXT. BOAT DECK / STARBOARD SIDE, FORWARD

At the stairwell rail on the bridge wing, Fourth Officer Boxhall and
Quartermaster Rowe light the first distress rocket. It shoots into the sky
and EXPLODES with a thunderclap over the ship, sending out white starbursts
which light up the entire deck as they fall.

WHIP PAN off the starbursts to Ismay. The Managing Director of White Star
Line is cracking. Already at the breaking point from his immense guilt, the
rocket panics him. He starts shouting at the officers struggling with the
falls of BOAT 5.

                                   ISMAY

There is no time to waste!

                       (yelling and waving his arms)

Lower away! Lower away! Lower away!

FIFTH OFFICER LOWE, a baby-faced 28, and the youngest officer, looks up
from the tangled falls at the madman.

                                   LOWE

Get out of the way, you fool!

                                   ISMAY

Do you know who I am?

Lowe, not having a clue nor caring, squares up to Ismay.

                                   LOWE

You're a passenger. And I'm a ship's bloody officer. Now do what you're
told!

                                  (MORE)

                               LOWE (CONT'D)

                              (turning away)

Steady men! Stand by the falls!

                                   ISMAY

                          (numbly, backing away)

Yes, quite right. Sorry.

                                                                   CUT TO:

177 EXT. BOAT DECK / PORT SIDE

SECOND OFFICER LIGHTOLLER is loading the boat nearest Cal and Rose... Boat
6.

                                LIGHTOLLER

Women and children only! Sorry sir, no men yet.

Another rocket bursts overhead, lighting the crowd. Startled faces turn
upward. Fear now in the eyes.

DANIEL MARVIN has his Biograph camera set up, cranking away... hoping to
get an exposure off the rocket's light. he has Mary posed in front of the
scene at the boats.

                                  MARVIN

You're afraid, darling. Scared to death. That's it!

Either she suddenly learned to act or she is petrified.

ROSE watches the farewells taking pace right in front of her as they step
closer to the boat. Husbands saying goodbye to wives and children. Lovers
and friends parted. Nearby MOLLY is getting a reluctant woman to board the
boat.

                                   MOLLY

Come on, you heard the man. Get in the boat, sister.

                                   RUTH

Will the lifeboats be seated according to class? I hope they're not too
crowded--

                                   ROSE

Oh, Mother shut up!

                        (Ruth freezes, mouth open)

Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enough
boats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die.

                                    CAL

Not the better half.

PUSH IN ON ROSE'S FACE as it hits her like a thunderbolt. Jack is third
class. He doesn't stand a chance. Another rocket bursts overhead, bathing
her face in white light.

                                   ROSE

You unimaginable bastard.

                                   MOLLY

Come on, Ruth, get in the boat. These are the first class seats right up
here. That's it.

Molly practically hands her over to Lightoller, then looks around for some
other women who might need a push.

                                   MOLLY

Come on, Rose. You're next, darlin'.

Rose steps back, shaking her head.

                                   RUTH

Rose, get in the boat!

                                   ROSE

Goodbye, mother.

Ruth, standing in the tippy lifeboat, can do nothing. Cal grabs Rose's arm
but she pulls free and walks away through the crowd. Cal catches up to Rose
and grabs her again, roughly.

                                    CAL

Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be a whore to that gutter rat?

                                   ROSE

I'd rather be his whore than your wife.

He clenches his jaw and squeezes her arm viciously, pulling her back toward
the lifeboat. Rose pulls out a hairpin and jabs him with it. he lets go
with a curse and she runs into the crowd.

                                LIGHTOLLER

Lower away!!

                                   RUTH

Rose! ROSE!!

                                   MOLLY

Stuff a sock in it, would ya, Ruth. She'll be along.

The boat lurches downward as the falls are paid out.

TRACKING WITH ROSE, as she runs through the clusters of people. She looks
back and a furious Cal is coming after her. She runs breathlessly up to two
proper looking men.

                                   ROSE

That man tried to take advantage of me in the crowd!

Appalled, they turn to see Cal running toward them. Rose runs on as the two
men grab Cal, restraining him. She runs throught the First Class entrance.

Cal breaks free and runs after her. He reaches the entrance, but runs into
a knot of people coming out. He pushes rudely through them...

                                                                   CUT TO:

178 INT. BOAT DECK FOYER / STAIRCASE / A-DECK FOYER

Cal runs in, and down to the landing, pushing past the gentlemen and ladies
who are filling up the stairs. He scans the A-deck foyer. Rose is gone.

                                                                   CUT TO:

179 EXT. OCEAN / TITANIC / BOAT 6

The hull of Titanic looms over Boat 6 like a cliff. Its enormous mass is
suddenly threatening to those in the tiny boat. Quartermaster Hitchins, at
the tiller, wants nothing but to get away from the ship. Unfortunately his
two seamen can't row. They flail like a duck with a broken wing.

                                 HITCHINS

Keep pulling... away from the ship. Pull.

                                   MOLLY

Ain't you boys ever rowed before? Here, gimme those oars. I'll show ya how
it's done.

She climbs over Ruth to get at the oars, stepping on her feet.

Around them the evacuation is in full swing, with boats in the water,
others being lowered.

                                                                   CUT TO:

180 INT. MASTER AT ARMS OFFICE / CORRIDOR

Jack pulls on the pipe with all his strength. It's not budging. He hears
gurgling sound. Water pours under the door, spreading rapidly across the
floor.

                                   JACK

Shit.

He tries to pull one hand out of the cuffs, working until the skin is
raw... no good.

                                   JACK

Help!! Somebody!! Can anybody hear me?!

                               (to himself)

This could be bad.

181 THE CORRIDOR outside is deserted. Flooded a couple of inches deep.
Jack's voice comes faintly through the door, but there is no one to hear
it.

                                                                   CUT TO:

182 INT. FIRST CLASS CORRIDOR

Thomas Andrews is opening stateroom doors, checking that people are out.

                                  ANDREWS

Anyone in here?

Rose runs up to him, breathless.

                                   ROSE

Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under
arrest?!

                                  ANDREWS

What? You have to get to a boat right away!

                                   ROSE

No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take
longer.

                                  ANDREWS

                                  (beat)

Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage,
then make a right.

                                   ROSE

Bottom, left, right. I have it.

                                  ANDREWS

Hurry, Rose.

                                                                   CUT TO:

183 INT. FOYER / ELEVATORS

Rose runs up as the last Elecator Operator is closing up his lift to leave.

                                 OPERATOR

Sorry, miss, lifts are closed--

Without thinking she grabs him and shoves him back into the lift.

                                   ROSE

I'm through with being polite, goddamnit!! I may never be polite the rest
of my life! Now take me down!!

The operator fumbles to close the gate and start the lift.

                                                                   CUT TO:

184 EXT. OCEAN / BOAT 6

Molly and the two seamen are rowing, and they've made it a hundret feet or
so. Enough to see that the ship is angled down into the water, with the bow
rail less than ten feet above the surface.

                                   MOLLY

Come on girls, join in, it'll keep ya warm. Let's go Ruth. Grab an oar!

Ruth just stares at the spectacle of the great liner, its rows of lights
blazing, slanting down into the sullen black mirror of the Atlanic.

                                                                   CUT TO:

185 INT. FIRST CLASS ELEVATOR / CORRIDORS

Through the wrought iron door of the elevator car Rose can see the decks
going past. The lift slows. Suddenly ICE WATER is swirling around her legs.
She SCREAMS in surprise. So does the operator.

The car has landed in a foot of freezing water, shocking the hell out of
her. She claws the door open and splashes out, hiking up her floor-length
skirt so she can move. The lift goes back up, behind her, as she looks
around.

                                   ROSE

Left, crew passage.

She spots it and slogs down the flooded corridor. The place is
understandably deserted. She is on her own.

                                   ROSE

Right, right... right.

She turns into a cross-corridor, splashing down the hall. A row of doors on
each side.

                                   ROSE

Jack? Jaaacckk??

                                                                   CUT TO:

186 INT. MASTER AT ARMS OFFICE / CORRIDOR

Jack is hopelessly pulling on the pipe again, straining until he turns red.
He collapses back on the bench. realizing he's screwed. Then he hears her
through the door.

                                   JACK

ROSE!! In here!

187 IN THE HALL Rose hears his voice behind her. She spins and runs back,
locating the right door, then pushes it open, creating a small wave.

She splashes over Jack and puts her arms around him.

                                   ROSE

Jack, Jack, Jack... I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

They are so happy to see each other it's embarrassing.

                                   JACK

That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.

                                   ROSE

I know, I know.

                                   JACK

See if you can find a key for these. Try those drawers. It's a little brass
one.

She kisses his face and hugs him again, then starts to go through the desk.

                                   JACK

So... how did you find out I didn't do it?

                                   ROSE

I didn't.

                            (she looks at him)

I just realized I already knew.

They share a look, then she goes back to ransacking the room, searching
drawers and cupboards. Jack sees movement out the porthole and looks out.

A LIFEBOAT hits the surface of the water, seen from below.

                                                                   CUT TO:

188 EXT. TITANIC / BOAT ONE

While the seamen detach the falls, Boat One rocks next to the hull. Lucile
and Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon sit with ten others in a boat made for four times
that many.

                                  LUCILE

I despise small boats. I just know I'm going to be seasick. I always get
seasick in small boats. Good Heavens, there's a man down there.

In a lit porthole beneath the surface she sees Jack looking up at her... a
face in a bubble of light under the water.

                                                                   CUT TO:

189 INT. MASTER AT ARMS OFFICE

Rose stops trashing the room, and stands there, breathing hard.

                                   ROSE

There's no key in here.

They look around at the water, now almost two feet deep. Jack has pulled
his feet up onto the bench.

                                   JACK

You have to go for help.

                                   ROSE

                                 (nodding)

I'll be right back.

                                   JACK

I'll wait here.

She runs out, looking back at him once from the doorway, then splashes
away. Jack looks down at the swirling water.

                                                                   CUT TO:

190 INT. STAIRWELL AND CORRIDORS

Rose splashes down the hall to a stairwell going up to the next deck. She
climbs the stairs, her long skirt leaving a trail like a giant snail. The
weight of it is really slowing her down. She rips at the buttons and
shimmies quickly out of the thing. She bounds up the stairs in her
stockings and knee-length slip, to find herself in--

191 A LONG CORRIDOR... part of the labyrinth of steerage hallways forward.
She is alone here. A long groan of stressing metal echoes along the hall as
the ship continues to settle. She runs down the hall, unimpeded now.

                                   ROSE

Hello? Somebody?!

She turns a corner and runs along another corridor in a daze. The hall
slopes down into water which, shimmers, reflecting the light. The margin of
the water creeps toward her. A YOUNG MAN appears, running through the
water, sending up geysers of spray. He pelts past her without slowing, his
eyes crazed...

                                   ROSE

Help me! We need help!

He doesn't look back. It is like a bad dream. The hull gongs with
terrifying sounds.

The lights flicker and go out, leaving utter darkness. A beat. Then they
come back on. She finds herself hyperventilating. That one moment of
blackness was the most terrifying of her life.

A STEWARD runs around the nearest corner, his arms full of lifebelts. He is
upset to see someone still in his section. He grabs her forcefully by the
arm, pulling her with him like a wayward child.

                                  STEWARD

Come on, then, let's get you topside, miss, that's right.

                                   ROSE

Wait. Wait! I need your help! There's--

                                  STEWARD

No need for panic, miss. Come along!

                                   ROSE

No, let me go! You're going the wrong way!

He's not listening. And he won't let her go.

She SHOUTS in his ear, and when he turns, she punches him squarely in the
nose. Shocked, he lets her go and staggers back.

                                  STEWARD

To Hell with you!

                                   ROSE

See you there, buster!

The steward runs off, holding his bloody nose. She spits after him. Just
the way Jack taugh: her.

She turns around, SEES: a glass case with a fire-axe in it. She breaks the
glass with a battered suitcase which is lying discarded nearby, and seizes
the axe, running back the way she came.

192 AT THE STAIRWELL she looks down and gasps. The water has flooded the
bottom five steps. She goes down and has to crouch to look along the
corridor to the room where Jack is trapped.

Rose plunges into the water, which is up to her waist... and powers
forward, holding the axe above her head in two hands. She grimaces at the
pain from the literally freezing water.

                                                                   CUT TO:

193 INT. MASTER AT ARMS OFFICE

Jack has climbed up on the bench, and is hugging the waterpipe. Rose wades
in, holding the axe above her head.

                                   ROSE

Will this work?

                                   JACK

We'll find out.

They are both terrified, but trying to keep panic at bay. He positions the
chain connecting the two cuffs, stretching it taut across the steel pipe.
The chain is of course very short, and his exposed wrists are on either
side of it.

                                   JACK

Try a couple practice swings.

Rose hefts the axe and thunks it into a wooden cabinet.

                                   JACK

Now try to hit the same mark again.

She swings hard and the blade thunks in four inches from the mark.

                                   JACK

Okay, that's enough practice.

He winces, bracing himself as she raises the axe. She has to hit a target
about an inch wide with all the foce she can muster, with his hands on
either side.

                                   JACK

                              (sounding calm)

You can do it, Rose. Hit it as hard as you can, I trust you.

Jack closes his eyes. So does she.

The axe comes down. K-WHANG! Rose gingerly opens her eyes looks... Jack is
grinning with two separate cuffs.

Rose drops the axe, all the strength going out of her.

                                   JACK

Nice work, there, Paul Bunyan.

He climbs down into the water next to her. He can't breathe for a second.

                                   JACK

Shit! Excuse my French. Ow ow ow, that is cold! Come on, let's go.

They wade out into the hall. Rose starts toward the stiars going up, but
Jack stops her. There is only about a foot of the stairwell opening
visible.

                                   JACK

Too deep. We gotta find another way out.

                                                                   CUT TO:

194 EXT. BOAT 6 AND TITANIC

TIGHT ON THE LETTERS TITANIC painted two feet high on the bow of the doomed
steamer. Once 50 feet above the waterline, they now quietly slip below the
surface. We see them, gold on black, rippling and dimming to a pale green
as they go deeper.

195 IN BOAT SIX, Ruth looks back at the Titanic, transfixed by the sight of
the dying liner. The bowsprit is now barely above the waterline. Another of
Boxhall's rockets EXPLODES overhead. K-BOOM! It lights up the whole area,
and we see half a dozen boats in the water, spreading out from the ship.

                                   MOLLY

Now there's somethin' you don't see every day.

                                                                   CUT TO:

196 INT. SCOTLAND ROAD / E-DECK

The widest passageway in the ship, it is used by crew and steerage alike,
and runs almost the length of the ship. Right now steerage passengers move
along it like refugees, heading aft.

CRASH! A wooden doorframe splinters and the door bursts open under the
force of Jack's shoulder. Jack and Rose stumble through, into the corridor.
A STEWARD, who was nearby herding people along, marches over.

                                  STEWARD

Here you! You'll have to pay for that, you know. That's White Star Line
property--

                               JACK AND ROSE

                            (turning together)

Shutup!

Jack leads her past the dumbfounded steward. They join the steerage
stragglers going aft. In places the corridor is almost completely blocked
by large families carrying all their luggage.

AN IRISH WOMAN gives Rose a blanket, more for modesty than because she is
blue-lipped and shivering.

                                IRISHWOMAN

Here, lass, cover yerself.

Jack rubs her arms and tries to warm her up as they walk along. The woman's
husband offers them a flask of whiskey.

                                 IRISHMAN

This'll take the chill off.

Rose takes a mighty belt and hands it to Jack. He grins and follows suit.
Jack tries a number of DOORS and IRON GATES along the way, finding them all
locked.

                                                                   CUT TO:

197 EXT. BOAT DECK

ON THE BOAT DECK, the action has moved to the aft group of boats, numbers
9, 11, 13 and 15 on the starboard side, and 10, 12, 14 and 16 on the port
side. The pace of work is more frantic. You see crew and officers running
now to work the davits, their previous complacency gone.

CAL pushes through the crowd, scanning for Rose. Around him is chaos and
confusion. A woman is calling for a child who has become seperated from the
crowd. A man is shouting over people's heads. A woman takes hold of Second
Officer Lightoller's arm as he is about to launch Boat 10.

                                   WOMAN

Will you hold the boat a moment? I have to run back to my room for
something--

Lightoller grabs her and shoves her bodily into the boat. Thomas Andrews
rushes up to him just then.

                                  ANDREWS

Why are the boats being launched half full?!

Lightoller steps past him, helping a seaman clear a snarled fall.

                                LIGHTOLLER

Not now, Mr. Andrews.

                                  ANDREWS

                       (pointing down at the water)

There, look... twenty or so in a boat built for sixty five. And I saw one
boat with only twelve. Twelve!

                                LIGHTOLLER

Well... we were not sure of the weight--

                                  ANDREWS

Rubbish! They were tested in Belfast with the weight of 70 men. Now fill
these boats, Mr. Lightoller. For God's sake, man!

The shot HANDS OFF to Cal, who sees Lovejoy hurrying toward him through the
aisle connecting the port and starboard sides of the boat deck.

                                  LOVEJOY

She's not on the starboard side either.

                                    CAL

We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet...

                          (indicating Lightoller)

...isn't letting any men in at all.

                                  LOVEJOY

The one on the other side is letting men in.

                                    CAL

Then that's our play. But we're still going to need some insurance.

                          (he starts off forward)

Come on.

Cal charges off, heading forward, followed by Lovejoy. The SHOT HANDS OFF
to a finely dressed elderly couple, IDA and ISADOR STRAUSS.

                                  ISADOR

Please, Ida, get into the boat.

                                    IDA

No. We've been together for forty years, and where

                                  (MORE)

                               IDA (CONT'D)

you go, I go. Don't argue with me, Isador, you know it does no good.

He looks at her with sadness and great love. They embrace gently.

                                LIGHTOLLER

Lower away!!

                                                                   CUT TO:

198 EXT. BRIDGE / FORWARD WELL DECK / FOC'SLE

AT THE BOW... the place where Jack and Rose first kissed... the bow railing
goes under water water. Water swirls around the captsans and windlasses on
the foc'sle deck.

Smith strides to the bridge rail and looks down at the well deck. Water is
shipped over the sides and the well deck is awash. Two men run across the
deck, their feet sending up spray. Behind Smith, Boxhall fires another
rocket. WHOOSH!

                                                                   CUT TO:

201 INT. E-DECK CORRIDORS AND STAIRWELL

Fabrizio, standing with Helga Dahl and her family, hears Jack's voice.

                                   JACK

Fabrizio! Fabri!

Fabrizio turns and sees Jack and Rose pushing through the crowd. He and
Jack hug like brothers.

                                 FABRIZIO

The boats are all going.

                                   JACK

We gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy?

Fabrizio points over the heads of the solidly packed crowd to the
stairwell.

Tommy has his hands on the bars of the steel gate which blocks the head of
the stairwell. The crew open the gate a foot or so and a few women are
squeezing through.

                                STEWARD #2

Women only. No men. No men!!

But some terrified men, not understanding English, try to rush through the
gap, forcing the gate open. The crewmen and stewards push them back,
shoving and punching them.

                                STEWARD #2

Get back! Get back you lot!

                             (to the crewmen)

Lock it!!

They struggle to get the gate closed again, while Steward #2 brandishes a
small revolver. Another holds a fire axe. They lock the gate, and a cry
goes up among the crowd, who surge forward, pounding against the steel and
shouting in several languages.

                                   TOMMY

For the love of God, man, there are children down here! Let us up, so we
can have a chance!

But the crewmen are scared now. They have let the situation get out of
hand, and now they have a mob. Tommy gives up and pushes his way back
through the crowd, going down the stairs. He rejoins Jack, Rose and
Fabrizio.

                                   TOMMY

It's hopeless that way.

                                   JACK

Well, whatever we're goin' to do, we better do it fast.

Fabrizio turns to Helga, praying he can make himself understood.

                                 FABRIZIO

                       (with a lot of hand gestures)

Everyone... all of you... come with me now. We go to the boats. We go to
the boats. Capito? Come now!

They can't understand what he's saying. They can see his urgency, but OLUF
DAHL, the patriarch of the family, shakes his head. He will not panic, and
will not let his family go with this boy. Fabrizio turns to Helga.

                                 FABRIZIO

Helga... per favore... please... come with me, I am lucky. Is my destiny to
go to America.

She kisses him, then steps back to be with her family. Jack lays a hand on
his shoulder, his eyes saying "Let's go".

                                 FABRIZIO

I will never forget you.

He turns to Jack, who leads the way out of the crowd. Looking back Fabrizio
sees her face disappear into the crowd.

                                                                   CUT TO:

204 INT. CAL AND ROSE'S SUITE

CLUNK! Cal opens his safe and reaches inside. As Lovejoy watches, he pulls
out two stacks of bills, still banded by bank wrappers. Then he takes out
"Heart of the Ocean", putting it in the pocket of his overcoat, and locks
the safe.

                                    CAL

                       (holding up stacks of bills)

I make my own luck.

                                  LOVEJOY

                    (putting the .45 in his waistband)

So do I.

Cal grins, putting the money in his pocket as they go out.

                                                                   CUT TO:

205 INT. STEERAGE, AFT

Jack, Rose, Fabrizio and Tommy are lost, searching for a way out. They push
past confused passengers... past a mother changing her baby's diaper on top
of an upturned steamer trunk... past a woman arguing heatedly with a man in
Serbo-Croatian, a wailing child next to them... past a man kneeling to
console a woman who is just sitting on the floor, sobbing... and past
another man with an English/Arabic dictionary, trying to figure out what
the signs mean, while his wife and children wait patiently.

Jack et al come upon a narrow stairwell and they go up two decks before
they are stopped by a small group pressed up against a steel gate. The
steerage men are yelling at a scared STEWARD.

                                  STEWARD

Go to the main stairwell, with everyone else. It'll all get sorted out
there.

Jack takes one look at this scene and finally just loses it.

                                   JACK

God damn it to Hell son of a bitch!!

He grabs one end of a bench bolted to the floor on the landing. He starts
pulling on it, and Tommy and Fabrizio pitch in until the bolts shear and it
breaks free. Rose figures out what they are doing and clears a path up the
stairs between the waiting people.

                                   ROSE

Move aside! Quickly, move aside!

Jack and Tommy run up the steps with the bench and RAM IT INTO THE GATE
with all their strength. It rips loose from its track and falls outward,
narrowly mssing the steward. Led by Jack, the crowd surges though. Rose
steps up to the cowering steward and says in her most imperious tone:

                                   ROSE

If you have any intention of keeping your pathetic job

                                  (MORE)

                               ROSE (CONT'D)

with the White Star Line, I suggest you escort these good people to the
boat deck... now.

Class wins out. He nods dumbly motions form them to follow.

                                                                   CUT TO:

206 EXT. BOAT 6 / TITANIC - NIGHT

Ruth rows with Molly Brown, two other women and the incompetent sailors.
She rests on her oars, exhausted, and looks back at the ship.

It slants down into the water, still ablaze with light. Nothing is above
water forward of the bridge except for the foremast. Another rocket goes
off, lighting up the entire area... there are a dozen boats moving outward
from the ship.

207 AT THE BOAT DECK RAIL Captain Smith is shouting to Boat 6 through a
large metal megaphone.

                                   SMITH

Come back! Come back to the ship!

CHIEF OFFICER WILDE joins him, blowing his silver whistle.

208 FROM BOAT 6 the whistle comes shrilly across the water. Quartermaster
Hitchins grips the rudder in fear.

                                 HITCHINS

The suction will pull us right down if we don't keep going.

                                   MOLLY

We got room for lots more. I say we go back.

                                 HITCHINS

No! It's our lives now, not theirs. And I'm in charge of this boat! Now
row!!

209 CAPTAIN SMITH, at the rail of the boat deck, lowers his megaphone
slowly

                                   SMITH

The fools.

                                                                   CUT TO:

210 INT. A-DECK FOYER

As Cal and Lovejoy cross the foyer encounter Benjamin Guggenheim and his
valet, coth dressed in white tie, tail-coats and top hats.

                                    CAL

Ben, what's the occasion?

                                GUGGENHEIM

We have dressed in our best and are prepared to go down like gentlemen.

                                    CAL

That's admirable, Ben.

                               (walking on)

I'll sure and tell your wife... when I get to New York.

                                                                   CUT TO:

211 INT. FIRST CLASS SMOKING ROOM

There are still two cardgames in progress. The room is quiet and civilized.
A silver serving cart, holding a large humidor, begins to roll slowly
across the room. One of the cardplayers takes a cigar from it as it rolls
by.

                                CARDPLAYER

It seems we've been dealt a bad hand this time.

                                                                   CUT TO:

212 EXT. / INT. A-DECK PROMENADE

Cal and Lovejoy are walking aft with a purposeful stride. They pass CHIEF
BAKER JOHGHIN, who is working up a sweat tossing deck chairs over the rail.
After they go by, Joughin takes a break and pulls a bottle of scotch from a
pocket, opening it. He drains it, and tosses it over the side too, then
stands there a little unteadily.

                                                                   CUT TO:

213 EXT. BOAT DECK AND A-DECK, AFT

PANIC IS SETTING IN around the remaining boats aft. The crowd here is now a
mix of all three classes. Officers repeatedly warn men back from the boats.
The crowd presses in closer.

Seamen SCAROTT brandishes the tiller of boat 14 to discourage a close press
of men who look ready to rush the boat. Several men break ranks and rush
forward.

Lightoller pulls out his Webley revolver and aims it at them.

                                LIGHTOLLER

Get back! Keep order!

The men back down. Fifth Officer Lowe standing in the boat, yells to the
crew.

                                   LOWE

Lower away left and right!

Lightoller turns away from the crowd and, out of their sight, breaks his
pistol open. Letting out a long breath, he starts to LOAD IT.

                                                                   CUT TO:

214 EXT. BOAT DECK, STARBOARD SIDE, AFT

Cal and Lovejoy arrive in time to see Murdoch lowering his last boat.

                                    CAL

We're too late.

                                  LOVEJOY

There are still some boats forward. Stay with this one... Murdoch. He seems
to be quite... practical.

215 IN THE WATER BELOW there is another panic. Boat 13, already in the
water but still attached to its falls, is pushed aft by the discharge water
being pumped out of the ship. It winds up directly under boat 15, which is
coming downt he right on top of it.

The passengers shout in panic to the crew above to stop lowering. They are
ignored. Some men put their hands up, trying futilely to keep the 5 tons of
boat 15 from crushing them.

Fred Barrett, the stoker, gets out his knife and leaps to the after falls,
climbing rudely over people. He cuts the aft falls while another crewman
cuts the forward lines. 13 drifts out from beneath 15 just seconds before
it touches the water with a slap.

Cal, looking down from the rail hears GUNSHOTS--

                                                                   CUT TO:

216 EXT. BOAT DECK / A-DECK, PORT, AFT

Fifth Officer Lowe, in Boat 14 is firing his gun as a warning to a bunch of
men threatening to jump into the boat as it passes the open promenade on
A-Deck.

                                   LOWE

Stay back you lot!

BLAM! BLAM!

                                                                   CUT TO:

217 EXT. BOAT DECK, STARBOARD, AFT

The shots echo away.

                                    CAL

It's starting to fall apart. We don't have much time.

Cal sees three dogs run by, including the black French bulldog. Someone has
released the pets from the kennels.

Cal sees Murdoch turn from the davits of boat 15 and start walking toward
the bow. He catches up and falls in beside him.

                                    CAL

Mr. Murdoch, I'm a businessman, as you know, and I have a business
proposition for you.

                                                                   CUT TO:

218 OMITTED

219 EXT. BOAT DECK, PORT

Jack, Rose et al burst out onto the boat deck from the crew stairs just aft
of the third funnel. They look at the empty davits.

                                   ROSE

The boats are gone!

She sees Colonel Gracie chugging forward along the deck, escorting two
first class ladies.

                                   ROSE

Colonel! Are there any boats left?

                                  GRACIE

                     (staring at her bedraggled state)

Yes, miss... there are still a couple of boats all the way forward. This
way, I'll lead you!

Jack grabs her hand and they sprint past Gracie, with Tommy and Fabrizio
close behind.

ANGLE ON THE BAND... incredibly they are still playing. Jack, Rose and the
others run by.

                                   TOMMY

Music to drown by. Now I know I'm in First Class.

                                                                   CUT TO:

220 EXT. BOAT DECK, STARBOARD, FORWARD

Water pours like a spillway over the forward railing on B-Deck. CAMERA
SWEEPS UP past A-Deck to the Boat Deck where Murdoch and his team are
loading Collapsible Car the forward-most davits.

NOTE: There are four so-called collapsibles, or Engelhardts boats,
including two which are stored on the roof of the officer's quarters.

The crowd is sparse, with most people still aft. Cal slips his hand out of
hte pocket of his overcoat and into the waist pocket of Murdoch's
greatcoat, leaving the stacks of bills there.

                                    CAL

So we have an understanding then?

                                  MURDOCH

                             (nodding curtly)

As you've said.

Cal, satisfied, steps back. He finds himself waiting next to J. Bruce
Ismay. Ismay does not meet his eyes, nor anyone's. Lovejoy come sup to Cal
at that moment.

                                  LOVEJOY

I've found her. She's just over on the port side. With him.

                                  MURDOCH

Women and children? Any more women and children?

                             (glancing at Cal)

Any one else, then?

Cal looks longingly at his boat... his moment has arrived.

                                    CAL

God damn it to hell! Come on.

He and Lovejoy head for the port side, taking a short-cut through the
bridge.

Bruce Ismay, seeing his oppurtunity, steps quickly into Collapsible C. He
stares straight ahead, not meeting Murdoch's eyes.

                                  MURDOCH

                            (staring at Ismay)

Take them down.

                                                                   CUT TO:

221 EXT. BOAT DECK / PORT SIDE - NIGHT

ON THE PORT SIDE Lightoller is getting people into Boat 2. He keeps his
pistol in his hand at this point. Twenty feet below them the sea is pouring
into the doors and windows of B deck staterooms. They can hear the roar of
water cascading into the ship.

                                LIGHTOLLER

Women and children, please. Women and children only. Step back, sir.

Even with Jack's arms wrapped around her, Rose is shivering in the cold.
Near her a WOMAN with TWO YOUNG DAUGHTERS looks into the eyes of a HUSBAND
she knows she may not see again

                                  HUSBAND

Goodbye for a little while... only for a little while.

                         (to his two little girls)

Go with mummy.

The woman stumbles to the boat with the children, hiding her tears from
them. Beneath the false good cheer, the man is choked with emotion.

                                  HUSBAND

Hold mummy's hand and be a good girl. That's right.

Some of the women are stoic, others are overwhelmed by emotion and have to
be helped into the boats. A MAN scribbles a note and hands it to a woman
who is about to board.

                                    MAN

Please get this to my wife in DeMoines, Iowa.

Jack looks at Tommy and Fabrizio.

                                   JACK

You better check out the other side.

They nod and run off, searching for a way around the deckhouse.

                                   ROSE

I'm not going without you.

                                   JACK

Get in the boat, Rose.

Cal walks up just then.

                                    CAL

Yes. Get in the boat, Rose.

She is shocked to see him. She steps instinctively to Jack. Cal looks at
her, standing there shivering in her wet slip and stockings, a shocking
display in 1912.

                                    CAL

My God, look at you.

                           (taking off his boat)

Here, put this on.

She numbly shrugs into it. He is doing it for modesty, not the cold.

                                LIGHTOLLER

Quickly, ladies. Step into the boat. Hurry, please!

                                   JACK

Go on. I'll get the next one.

                                   ROSE

No. Not without you!

She doesn't even care that Cal is standing right there. He sees the emotion
between Jack and Rose and his jaw clenches. But then he leans close to her
and says...

                                    CAL

                                   (low)

There are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. Jack and I can
get off safely. Both of us.

                                   JACK

                         (he smiles reassuringly)

I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to
catch.

                                    CAL

Get in... hurry up, it's almost full.

Lightoller grabs her arm and pulls her toward the boat. She reaches out for
Jack and her fingers brush his for a moment. Then she finds herself
stepping down into the boat. It's all a rush and blur.

                                LIGHTOLLER

Lower away!

The two men watch at the rail as the boat begins to descend.

                                    CAL

                                   (low)

You're a good liar.

                                   JACK

Almost as good as you.

                                    CAL

I always win, Jack. One way or another.

                          (looks at him, smiling)

Pity I didn't keep that drawing. It's going to be worth a lot more by
morning.

Jack knows he is screwed. He looks down at Rose, not wanting to waste a
second of his last view of her.

222 ROSE'S PERCEPTION... IN SLOW MOTION: The ropes going through the
pulleys as the seamen start to lower. All sound going away... Lightoller
giving orders, his lips moving... but Rose hears only the blood pounding in
her ears... this cannot be happening... a rocket bursts above in
slow-motion, outlining Jack in a halo of light... Rose's hair blowing in
slow motion as she gazes up at him, descending away from him... she sees
his hand trembling, the tears at the corners of his eyes, and cannot
believe the unbearable pain she is feeling...

Rose is still staring up, tears pouring down her face.

SUDDENLY SHE IS MOVING. She lunges across the women next to her. Reaches
the gunwale, climbing it...

Hurls herself out of the boat to the rail of the A-Deck promenade, catching
it, and scrambling over the rail. The Boat 2 continues down. But Rose is
back on Titanic.

                                   JACK

No Rose! NOOOO!!

Jack spins from the rail, running for the nearest way down to A-Deck.

Hockley too has seen her jump. She is willing to die for this man, this
gutter scum. He is overwhelmed by a rage so all consuming it eclipses all
thought.

                                                                   CUT TO:

223 INT. GRAND STAIRCASE

TRACKING WITH JACK as he bangs through the doors to the foyer and sprints
down the stairs. He sees her coming into A-deck foyer, running toward him,
Cal's long coat flying out behind her as she runs.

They meet at the bottom of the stairs, and collide in an embrace.

                                   JACK

Rose, Rose, you're so stupid, you're such an idiot--

And all the while he's kissing her and holding her as tight as he can.

                                   ROSE

You jump, I jump, right?

                                   JACK

Right.

Hockley comes in and runs to the railing. Looking down he sees them locked
in their embrace. Lovejoy comes up behind Cal and puts a restraining HAND
on him, but Cal whips around, grabbing the pistol from Lovejoy's waistband
in one cobra-fast move.

He RUNS along the rail and down the stairs. As he reaches the landing above
them he raises the gun. SCREAMING in rage, he FIRES.

The carved cherub at the foot of the center railing EXPLODES. Jack pulls
Rose toward the stairs going down to the next deck. Cal fires again,
running down the steps toward them. A bullet blows a divet out of the oak
panelling behind Jack's head as he pulls Rose down the next flight of
stairs.

Hockley steps on the skittering head of the cherub statue and goes
sprawling. The gun clatters across the marble floor. He gets up, and
reeling drunkenly goes over to retrieve it.

                                                                   CUT TO:

224 INT. D-DECK RECEPTION ROOM

The bottom of the grand staircase is flooded several feet deep. Jack and
Rose come down the stairs two at a time and run straight into the water,
fording across the room to where the floor slopes up, until they reach dry
footing at the entrance to the dining saloon.

STEADICAM WITH HOCKLEY as he reels down the stairs in time to see Jack and
Rose splashing through the water toward the dining saloon. He FIRES twice.
Big gouts of spray near them, but he's not a great shot.

The water boils up around his feet and he retreast up the stairs a couple
of steps. Around him the woodward groans and creaks.

                                    CAL

                             (calling to them)

Enjoy your time together!!

Lovejoy arrives next to him. Cal suddenly remembers something and starts to
laugh.

                                  LOVEJOY

What could possible be funny?

                                    CAL

I put the diamond in my coat pocket. And I put my coat... on her.

He turns to Lovejoy with a sickly expression, his eyes glittering.

                                    CAL

I give it to you... if you can get it.

He hands Lovejoy the pistol and goes back up the stairs. Lovejoy thinks
about it... then slogs into the water. The icewater is up to his waist as
he crosses the pool into the dining saloon.

                                                                   CUT TO:

225 INT. DINING SALOON

Lovejoy moves among the tables and ornate columns, searching...
listening... his eyes tracking rapidly. It is a sea of tables, and they
could be anywhere. A silver serving tolley rolls downhill, bumping into
tables and pillars.

He glances behind him. The water is following him into the room, advancing
in a hundred foot wide tide. The reception room is now a roiling lake, and
the grand staircase is submerged past the first landing. Monstrous groans
echo through the ship.

ON JACK AND ROSE, crouched behind a table, somewhere in the middle. They
see the water advancing toward them, swirling over the floor. They crawl
ahead of it to the next row of tables.

                                   JACK

                               (whispering)

Stay here.

He moves off as--

Lovejoy moves over one row and looks along the tables. Nothing.

The ship GROANS and CREAKS. He moves another row.

ANGLE ON A METAL CART... five feet tall and full of stacks of china dishes.
It starts to roll down the aisle between tables.

ON ROSE as the cart rolls toward her. It hits a table and the stacks of
dishes topple out, EXPLODING across the floor and showering her.

She scrambles out of the way and--

Lovejoy spins, seeing her. He moves rapidly toward her, keeping the gun
aimed--

That's when Jack tackles him from the side. They slam together into a
table, crashing over it, and toppling to the floor. They land in the water
which is flowing rapidly between the tables.

Jack and Lovejoy grapple in the icy water. Jack jams his knee down on
Lovejoy's hand, breaking his grip on the pistol, and kicks it away. Lovejoy
scrmbles up and lunges at him, but Jack GUTPUCHES him right in the solar
plexus, doubling him over.

                                   JACK

Compliments of the Chippewa Falls Dawsons.

He grabs Lovejoy and slams him into an ornate columb. Lovejoy drops to the
floor with a splas, stunned.

                                   JACK

Let's go.

Jack and Rose run aft... uphill... entering the galley. Behind them the
tables have become islands in a lake... and the far end of the room is
flooded up to the ceiling.

Lovejoy gets up and looks around for his gun. He pulls it up out of the
water and wades after them.

                                                                   CUT TO:

226 INT. GALLEY / STAIRWELL

They run throught the galley and Rose spots the stairs. She starts up and
Jack grabs her hand. He leads her DOWN.

They crouch together on the landing as Lovejoy runs to the stairs. Assuming
they have gone up (who wouldn't?) he clombs up them two at a time.

They wait for the footstep to recede. A long CREAKING GROAN. Then they hear
it... a CRYING CHILD. Below them. They go down a frew steps to looks along
the next deck.

                                                                   CUT TO:

227 INT. E-DECK CORRIDORS

The corridor is awash, about a foot deep. Standing against the wall, about
50 feet away, is a little BOY, aobut 3. The water swirls around his legs
and he is wailing.

                                   ROSE

We can't leave him.

Jack nods and they leave the promise of escape up the stairwell to run to
the child. Jack scoops up the kid and they run back to the stairs but--

A torrent of water comes pouring down the stairs like rapids. In seconds it
is too powerful for them to go against.

                                   JACK

Come on.

Charging the other way down the flooding corridor, they blast up spray with
each footstep. At the end of the hall are heavy double doors. As Jack
approaches them he sees water spraying through the gap between the doors
right up to the ceiling. The doors groan and start to crack under the tons
of pressure.

                                   JACK

Back! Go back!!

Rose pivots and runs back the way they came, taking a turn into a
cross-corridor. A MAN is coming the other way. He sees the boy in Jack's
arms and cries out, grabbing him away from Jack. Starts cursing him in
Russian. He runs on with the boy--

                                   ROSE

No! Not that way! Come back!

228 DOUBLE DOORS BLAST OPEN. A wall of water thunders into the corridor.
The father and child DISAPPEAR instantly.

Jack and Rose run as a wave blasts around the corner, foaming from floor to
ceiling. It gains on them like a locomotive. They make it to a stairway
going up.

                                                                   CUT TO:

229 INT. STAIRWELL

Jack and Rose pound up the steps as white water swirls up behind them. PULL
BACK to reveal that a steel gate blocks the top of the stairs. Jack SLAMS
against the fate, gripping the bars.

A terrified steward standing guard on the landing above turns to run at the
sight of the water thundering up the stairs.

                                   JACK

Wait! Wait! Help us! Unlock the gate.

The steward runs on. The water wells up around Jack and Rose, pouring
through the gate and slamming them against it. In seconds it is up to their
waist.

                                   ROSE

Help us! Please!

The steward stops and looks back. He sees Jack and Rose at the gate, their
arms raching through... sees the water POURING through the gate onto the
landing.

                                  STEWARD

Fucking 'ell!

He runs back, slogging against the curretn. He pulls a key ring from his
belt and struggles to unlock the padlock as the water fountains up around
them.

The lights short out and the landing is plunged into darkness.

The water rises over the lock and he's doing it by feel.

                                   JACK

Come on! Come on!

Jack and Rose are right up against the ceiling...

Suddenly the gate gives and SWINGS OPEN. They are pushing through by the
force of the water. They make it to stairs on the other side of the landing
and follow the steward up to the next deck.

                                                                   CUT TO:

230 EXT. BOAT DECK, STARBOARD SIDE

Cal comes reeling out of the first class entrance, looking wild-eyed. The
lurches down the deck toward the bridge. Waltz music wafts over the ship.
Somewhere the band is still playing.

CAL'S POV: A little girl, maybe two years old, is crying along in the
alcove. She looks up at Cal beseechingly. Cal moves on without a glance
back... reaching a large crowd clustered around COLLAPSIBLE A just aft of
the bridge. He sees Murdoch and a number of crewmen struggling to drag the
boat to the davits, with no luck.

Cal pushes forward, trying to signal Murdoch, but the officer ignores him.
Nearby Tommy and Fabrizio are being pushed forward by the crowd behind.
PURSER MCELROY pushes them back, getting a couple of seamen to help him. He
brandishes his gun, waving it in the air, yelling for the crowd to stay
back.

                                                                   CUT TO:

231 EXT. BOAT DECK, PORT SIDE / ROOF OF OFFICERS' QUARTERS

Lightoller, with a group of crew and passengers, is trying to get
Collapsible B down from the roof. They slide it down a pair of oars leaned
against the deck house.

                                LIGHTOLLER

Hold it! Hold it!

The weight of the boat snaps the oars and it crashes to the deck, upside
down. The two Swedish cousins, OLAUS and BJORN GUNERSEN, jump back as the
boat nearly hits them.

                                                                   CUT TO:

232 OMITTED

233 INT. STAIRWELL

Jack and Rose run up seemingly endless stairs as the ship groans and
torgues around them.

                                                                   CUT TO:

234 EXT. BOAT DECK, STARBOARD SIDE

Murdoch, at Collapsible A, is no longer in control. The crowd is
threatening to rush the boat. They push and jostle, yelling and shouting at
the officers. The pressure from behind pushes them forward, and one guy
falls off the edge of the deck into the water less than ten feet below.

                                   TOMMY

Give us a chance to live, you limey bastards!

Murdoch fires his Webley twice in the air, then point it at the crowd.

                                  MURDOCH

I'll shoot any man who tries to get past me.

Cal steps up to him.

                                    CAL

We had a deal, damn you.

Murdoch pushes him back, pointing the pistol at Cal.

                                  MURDOCH

Get back!

A man next to Tommy rushes forward, and Tommy is shoved from behind.
Murdoch SHOOTS the first man, and seeing Tommy coming forward, puts a
bullet into his chest.

Tommy collapses, and Fabrizio grabs him, holding him in his arms as his
life flows out over the deck.

Murdoch turns to his men and salutes smartly. Then he puts the pistol to
his temple and... BLAM! He drops like a puppet with the strings cut and
topples over the edge of the boat deck into the water only a few feet
below.

Cal stares in horror at Murdoch's body bobbing in the black water. The
MONEY FLOATS out of the pocket of his greatcoat, the bills spreading across
the surface.

The crew rush to get the last few women aboart the boat.

                              PURSER MCELROY

                       (calling above the confusion)

Any more women or children?!

THE CHILD crying in the alcove. Cal scoops her up and runs forward,
cradling her in his arms.

                                    CAL

                    (forcing his way through the crowd)

Here's a child! I've got a child!

                               CAL (CONT'D)

                               (to McElroy)

Please... I'm all she has in the world.

McElroy nods curtly and pushes him into the boat. He spins with his gun,
brandishing it in the air to keep the other men back. Cal gets into the
boat, holding the little girl. He takes a seat with the women.

                                    CAL

There, there.

                                                                   CUT TO:

235 INT. FIRST CLASS SMOKE ROOM

Thomas Andrews stands in front of the fireplace, staring at the large
painting above the mantle. The fire is still going in the fireplace.

The room is empty except for Andrews. An ashtray falls off the table.
Behind him Jack and Rose run into the room, out of breath and soaked. They
run through, toward the aft revolving door... then Rose recognizes him. She
sees that his lifebelt is off, lying on a table.

                                   ROSE

Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?

                                  ANDREWS

                       (a tear rolls down his cheek)

I'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.

                                   JACK

                                 (to her)

It's going fast... we've got to keep moving.

Andrews picks up his lifebelt and hands it to her.

                                  ANDREWS

Good luck to you, Rose.

                                   ROSE

                               (hugging him)

And to you, Mr. Andrews.

Jack pulls her away and they run through the revolving door.

                                                                   CUT TO:

236 EXT. BOAT DECK AND VARIOUS LOCATIONS

The band finishes the waltz. Wallace Hartley looks at the orchestra
members.

                                  HARTLEY

Right, that's it then.

They leave him, walking forward along the deck. Hartley puts his violin to
his chin and bows the first notes of "Nearer My God to Thee". One by one
the band memebers turn, hearing the lonely melody.

Without a word they walk back and take their places. They join in with
Hartley, filling out the sound so that it reaches all over the ship on this
still night. The vocalist begins: "If in my dreams I be, nearer my God to
thee..."

THE HYMN PLAYS OVER THE FOLLOWING SEQUENCE:

237 A seaman pulls off his lifebelt and catches up to Captain Smith as he
walks to the bridge. He proffers it, but Smith seems to stare through him.
Without a word he turns and goes onto the bridge. He enters the enclosed
WHEELHOUSE and closes the door. He is alone, surrounded by the gleaming
brass instruments. He seems to inwardly collapse.

238 IN THE FIRST CLASS SMOKING ROOM Andrews stands like a statue. He pulls
out his pocketwatch and checks the time. Then he opens the face of the
mantle clock and adjusts it to the correct time: 2:12 a.m. Everything must
be correct.

239 IN CAL'S PARLOUR SUITE water swirls in from the private promenade deck.
Rose's paintings are submerged. The Picasso tranforms under the water's
surface. Degas' colors run. Monet's water lilies come to life.

240 DOWNANGLE on the two figures lying side by side, fully clothed, on a
bed in a FIRST CLASS CABIN. Elderly Ida and Isador Strauss stare at the
ceiling, holding hands like young lovers. Water pours into the room through
a doorway. It swirls around the bed, two feet deep rising fast.

241 IN A STEERAGE CABIN somewhere in the bowels of the ship, the young
IRISH MOTHER, seen earlier stoically waiting at the stairs, is tucking her
two young children into bed. She pulls up the covers, making sure they are
all warm and cozy. She lies down with them on the bed, speaking soothingly
and holding them.

                                                                   CUT TO:

EXT. BOAT DECK / BRIDGE

242 IN A WIDE SHOT we see a wave travel up the boat deck as the bridge
house sinks into the water.

243 ON THE PORT SIDE Collapsible B is picked up by water. Working
frantically, the men try to detach it from the falls so the ship won't drag
it under. Colonel Gracie hands Lightoller a pocket knife and he saws
furiously at the ropes as the water swirls around his legs. The boat, still
upside down, is swept off the ship. Men start diving in, swimming to stay
with it.

244 IN COLLAPSIBLE A Cal sits next to the wailing child, whom he has
completely forgotten. He watches the water rising around the men as they
work, scrambling to get the ropes cut so the ship won't drag the
collapsible under.

Fabrizio removes the lifebelt from Tommy's body and struggles to put it on
as the water rises around him.

245 CAPTAIN SMITH, standing near the wheel, watches the black water
climbing the windows of the enclosed wheelhouse. He has the stricken
expression of a damned sould on Judgment Day. The windows burst suddenly
and a wall of water edged with shards of glass slams into Smith. He
disappears in a vortex of foam.

246 Collapsible A is hit by a wave as the bow plunges suddenly. It
partially swamps the boat, washing it along the deck. Over a hundred
passengers are plunged into the freezing water and the area around the boat
becomes a frenzy of splashing, screaming people.

As men are trying to climb into the callapsible, Cal grabs an oar and
pushes them back into the water.

                                    CAL

Get back! You'll swamp us!

Fabrizio, swimming for his life, gets swirled under a davit. The ropes and
pulleys tangle around him as the davit goes under the water, and he is
dragged down. Underwater he struggles to free himself, and then kicks back
to the surface. He surfaces, gasping for air in the freezing water.

247 WALLACE HARTLEY sees the water rolling rapidly up the deck toward them.
He holds the last note of the hymn in a sustain, and then lowers his
violin.

                                  HARTLEY

Gentlemen, it has been a previlege playing with you tonight.

                                                                   CUT TO:

248 EXT. A-DECK AFT, PORT SIDE

Jack and Rose run out of the PALM COURT into a dense crowd. Jack pushes his
way to the rail and looks at the state of the ship. The bridge is under
water and tehre is chaos on deck. Jack helps her put her lifebelt on.
People stream around them, shouting and pushing.

                                   JACK

Okay... we keep moving aft. We have to stay on the ship as long as
possible.

They push their way aft through the panicking crowd.

                                                                   CUT TO:

249 EXT. FORWARD FUNNEL

Collapsible A is whirled like a leaf in the currents around the sining
ship. It slams against the side of the forward funnel.

                                    CAL

                         (to the crew in the boat)

Row! Row you bastards!!

250 NEARBY: Fabrizio is drawn up against the grating of a STOKEHOLD VENT as
water pours through it. The force of tons of water roaring down the ship
traps him against it, and he is dragged down under the surface as the ship
sinks. He struggles to free himself but cannot.

Suddenly there is a concussion deep in the bowels of the ship as a furnace
explodes and a blast of hot air belches out of hte ventilator, ejecting
Fabrizio. He surfaces in a roar of foam and keeps swimming.

                                                                   CUT TO:

251 EXT. A-DECK / B-DECK / WELL DECK, AFT

Jack and Rose clamber over the A-Deck aft rail. Then, using all his
strength, he lowers her toward the deck below, holding on with one hand.
She dangles, then falls. Jack jumps down behind her.

They join a crush of people literally clawing and scrambling over each
other to get down the narrow stairs to the well deck... the only way aft.

Seeing that the stairs are impossible, Jack climbs over the B-Deck railing
and helps Rose over. He lowers her again, and she falls in a heap. Baker
Joughin, now three sheets to the wind, happens to be next to her. He hauls
Rose to her feet. Jack drops down and the three of them push through the
crowd across the well deck. Near them, at the rail, people are jumping into
the water.

The ship GROANS and SHUDDERS. The man ahead of Jack is walking like a
zombie.

                                    MAN

Yeah, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death--

                                   JACK

You wanna walk a little faster through that valley, fella?

                                                                   CUT TO:

252 EXT. FORWARD FUNNEL

The stay cables along the top of the funnel snap, and they lash like steel
whips down into the water. Cal watches as the funnel topples from its
mounts. Falling like a temple pillar twenty eight feet across it whomps
into the water with a tremendous splash. People swimming underneath it
disappear in an instant.

Fabrizio, a few feet away, is hurled back by a huge wave. He comes up,
gasping... still swimming. The water pouring into the open end of the
funnel draws in several swimmers. The funnel sinks, disappearing, but--

Hundreds of tons of water pour down through the 30 foot hole where the
funnel stood, thundering down into the belly of the ship. A whirlpool
forms, a hole in the ocean, like at enormous toiler-flush. T. W. McCauley,
the gym instructor swims in a frenzy as the vortex draws him in. He is
sucked down like a spider going down a drain.

Fabrizio, nearby, swims like Hell as more people are sucked down behind
him. He manages to get clear. He's going to live no matter what it takes.

                                                                   CUT TO:

253 INT. BOAT DECK FOYER / GRAND STAIRCASE

Water raors through the doors and windows, cascading down the stairs like a
rapids. John Jacob Astor is swept down the marble steps to A-Deck, which is
already flooded... a roiling vortex. He grabs the headless cherub at the
bottom of the staircase and wraps his arms around it.

Astor looks up in time to see the 30 foot glass dome overhead EXPLOSE
INWARD with the wave of water washing over it. A Niagara of sea water
thunders down into the room, blasting through the first class opulence. IT
is the Armageddon of elegance.

                                                                   CUT TO:

254 OMITTED

255 INT. BELOWDECKS

The flooding is horrific. Walls and doors are splintered like kindling.
Water roars down corridors with pile-driver force.

The CARTMELL FAMILY is at the top of a stairwell, jammed against a locked
gate like Jack and Rose were. Water boils up the stairwell behind them.
Bert Cartmell shakes the gate futilely, shouting for help. Little Cora
wails as the water boils up around them all.

                                                                   CUT TO:

256 EXT. STERN

Rose and Jack struggle to climb the well deck stairs as the ship tilts.
Drunk Baker Joughin puts a hand squarely on Rose's butt and shoves her up
onto the deck.

                                  JOUGHIN

Sorry, miss!

Hundreds of people are already on the poop deck, and more are pouring up
every second. Jack and Rose cling together as tehy struggle across the
tilting deck.

257 As the bow goes down, the STERN RISES. IN BOAT 2, which is just off the
stern, passengers gape as the giant bronze propellers rise out of the water
like gods of the deep, FILLING FRAME behind them.

People are JUMPING from the well deck, the poop deck, the gangway doors.
Some hit debris in the water and are hurt or killed.

258 OMITTED

259 OMITTED

260 EXT. STERN

ON THE POOP DECK Jack and Rose struggle aft as the angle increases.
Hundreds of passengers, clinging to every fixed object on deck, huddle on
their knees around FATHER BYLES, who has his voice raised in prayer. They
are praying, sobbing, or just staring at nothing, their minds blank with
dread.

Pulling himself from handhold to handhold, Jack tugs Rose aft along the
deck.

                                   JACK

Come on, Rose. We can't expect God to do all the work for us.

They struggle on, pushing through the praying people. A MAN loses his
footing ahead and slides toward them. Jack helps him.

261 THE PROPELLERS are twenty feet above the water and rising faster.

262 JACK AND ROSE make it to the stern rail, right at the base of the
flagpole. They grip the rai, jammed in between other people. It is the spot
where Jack pulled her back onto the ship, just two night... and a
liftime... ago.

Above the wailing and sobbing, Father Byles' voice carries, cracking with
emotion.

                               FATHER BYLES

...and I saw new heavens and a new earth. The former heavens and the former
earth had passed away and the sea was no longer.

The lights flicker, threatening to go out. Rose grips Jack as the stern
rises into a night sky ablaze with stars.

                               FATHER BYLES

I also saw a new Jerusalem, the holy city coming down out of heaven from
God, beautiful as a bride prepared to meet her husband. I heard a loud
voice from the throne ring out this is God's dwelling among men. He shall
dwell with them and they shall be his people and He shall be their God who
is alway with them.

Rose stares about her at the faces of the doomed. Near them are the DAHL
FAMILY, clinging together stoically. Helga looks at her briefly, and her
eyes are infinitely sad.

Rose sees a young mother next to her, clutching her five year old son, who
is crying in terror.

                                  MOTHER

Shhh. Don't cry. It'll be over soon, darling. It'll all be over soon.

                               FATHER BYLES

He shall wipe every tear from their eyes. And there shall be no more death
or mourning, crying out or pain, for the former world has passed away.

                                                                   CUT TO:

INT. SHIP-- VARIOUS

As the ship tilts further everything not bolted down inside shifts.

263 CUPBOARDS burst open in the pantry showering the floor with tons of
china. A PIANO slides across the floor, crashing into a wall. FURNITURE
tumbles across the Smoking Room floor.

264 ON THE A-DECK PROMENADE passengers lose their grip and slide down the
wooden deck like a bobsled run, hundreds of feet before they hit the water.
TRUDY BOLT, Rose's maid, slips as she struggles along the railing and
slides away screaming.

265 AT THE STERN the propellers are 100 feet out of the water and rising.
Panicking people leap from the poop deck rail, fall screaming and hit the
water like mortar rounds. A man falls from the poop deck, hitting the
bronze hub of the starboard propeller with a sickening smack.

266 SWIMMERS LOOK UP and see the stern towering over them like a monolith,
the propellers rising against the stars. 110 feet. 120.

267 AT THE STERN RAIL a man jumps. IN HIS POV we fall seemingly forever,
right past one of the giant screws. The water rushes up--

                                                                   CUT TO:

EXT. TITANIC / BOAT 6

268 TRACKING SLOWLY IN on Ruth as the sounds of the dying ship and the
screaming people come across the water.

269 REVERSE / HER POV: IN A WIDE SHOT we see the spectacle of the Titanic,
her lights blazing, reflecting in the still water. Its stern is high in the
air, angles up over forty five degrees. The propellers are 150 feet out of
the water. Over a thousand passengers cling to the decks, looking from a
distance like a swarm of bees.

The image is shocking, unbelieveable, unthinkable. Ruth stares at the
spectacle, unable to frame it or put it into any proportion.

                                MOLLY BROWN

God Almighty.

The great liner's lights flicker.

                                                                   CUT TO:

270 INT. ENGINE ROOM

In darkness Chief Engineer Bell hangs onto a pipe at the master braker
panel. Around him men climb through tilted cyclopean mahcines with electric
hand-torches. It is a black hell of breaking pipes, spraying water, and
groaning machinery threatening to tear right out of its bedplates.

Water sprays down, hitting the breaker panel, but Bell will not leave his
post. CLUNK. The breakers kick. He slams them in again and-- WHOOM! a blast
of light! Something melts and arcing fills the engine room with nightmarish
light--

                                                                   CUT TO:

271 EXT. TITANIC

WIDE SHOT. The lights go out all over the ship. Titanic becomes a vast
black silhouette against the stars.

IN COLLAPSIBLE C: BRUCE ISMAY has his back to the ship, unable to watch the
great steamer die. He is catatonic with remorse, his mind overloaded. He
can avert his eyes, but he can't block out the sounds of dying people and
machinery.

A loud CRACKING REPORT comes across the water.

                                                                   CUT TO:

272 EXT. BOAT DECK

Near the third funnel a man clutches the ship's rail. He stares down as the
DECK SPLITS right between his feet. A yawning chasm opens with a THUNDER of
breaking steel

LOVEJOY is clutching the railing on the roof of the Officers' Mess. He
watches in horror as the ship's structure RIPS APART right in front of him.
He gapes down into a widening maw, seeing straight down into the bowels of
the ship, amid a BOOMING CONCUSSION like the sound of artillery. People
falling into the widening crevasse look like dolls.

The stay cables on the funnel part and snap across the decks like whips,
ripping off davits and ventilators. A man is hit by a whipping cable and
snatched OUT OF FRAME. Another cable smashes the rail next to Lovejoy and
it rips free. He falls backward into the pit of jagged metal.

Fires, explosions and sparks light the yawning chasm as the hull splits
down through nine decks to the keel. The sea pours into the gaping wound--

                                                                   CUT TO:

273 INT. ENGINE ROOM

It is a thundering black hell. Men scream as monstrous machinery comes
apart around them, steel frames twisting like taffy. Their torches
illuminate the roaring, foaming demon of water as it races at the through
the manchines. Trying to climb they are overtaken in seconds.

                                                                   CUT TO:

274 EXT. TITANIC - NIGHT

The STERN ALF of the ship, almost four hundred feet long, falls back toward
the water. On the poop deck everyone screams as they feel themselves
plummeting. The sound goes up like the roar of fans at a baseball stadium
when a run is scored.

Swimming in the water directly under the stern a few unfortunates shriek as
they see the keel coming down on them like God's bootheel. The massive
stern section falls back almost level, thundering down into the sea and
pushing out a mighty wave of displaced water.

Jack and Rose struggle to hole onto the stern rail. They feel the ship
seemingly RIGHT ITSELF. Some of those praying think it is salvation.

                              SEVERAL PEOPLE

We're saved!

Jack looks at Rose and shakes his head, grimly.

Now the horrible mechanics play out. Pulled down by the awesome weight of
the flooded bow, the buoyant stern tilts up rapidly. They feel the RUSH OF
ASCENT as the fantail angles up again. Everyone is clinging to benches,
railings, ventilators... anything to keep from sliding as the stern lifts.

The stern goes up and up, past 45 degrees, then past sixty.

People start to fall, sliding and tumbling. They skid down the deck,
screaming and flailing to grab onto somehting. They wrench other people
loose and pull them down as well. There is a pile-up of bodies at the
forward rail. The DAHL FAMILY falls one by one.

                                   JACK

We have to move!

He climbs over the stern rail and reaches back for Rose. She is terrified
to move. He grabs her hand.

                                   JACK

Come on! I've got you!

Jack pulls her over the rail. It is the same place he pulled her over the
rail two nights earlier, going the other direction. She gets over just as
the railing is going HORIZONTAL, and the deck VERITCAL. Jack grips her
fiercely.

The stern is now straight up in the air... a rumbling black monolith
standing against the stars. It hangs there like that for a long grace note,
its buoyancy stable.

Rose lies on the railing, looking down fifteen stories to the boiling sea
at the base of the stern section. People near them, who didn't climb over,
hang from the railing, their legs dangling over the long drop. They fall
one by one, plummeting down the vertical face of the poop deck. Some of
them bounce horribly off deck benches and ventilators.

Jack and Rose lie side by side on what was the vertical face of the hull,
gripping the railing, which is now horizontal. Just beneath their feet are
the gold letters TITANIC emblazoned across the stern.

Rose stares down terrified at the black ocean waiting below to claim them.
Jack looks to his left and sees Baker Joughin, crouching on the hull,
holding onto the railing. It is a surreal moment.

                                  JOUGHIN

                           (nodding a greeting)

Helluva night.

The final relentless plunge begins as the stern section floods. Looking
down a hundred feet to the water, we drop like an elevator with Jack and
Rose.

                                   JACK

                              (talking fast)

Take a deep breath and hold it right before we go into the water. The ship
will suck us down. Kick for the surface and keep kicking. Don't let go of
my hand. We're gonna make it Rose. Trust me.

She stares at the water coming up at them, and grips his hand harder.

                                   ROSE

I trust you.

Below them the poop deck is disappearing. The plunge gathers speed... the
boiling surface engulfs the docking bridge and then rushes up the last
thirty feet.

278 IN A HIGH SHOT, we see the stern descend into the boiling sea. The name
TITANIC disappears, and the tiny figures of Jack and Rose vanish under the
water.

Where the ship stood, now there is nothing. Only the black ocean.

                                                                   CUT TO:

279 EXT. OCEAN / UNDERWATER AND SURFACE

Bodies are whirled and spun, some limp as dolls, others struggling
spasmodically, as the vortex sucks them down and tumbles them.

280 Jack rises INTO FRAME F.G. kicking hard for the surface... holding
tightly to Rose, pulling her up.

281 AT THE SURFACE: a roiling chaos of screaming, thrashing people. Over a
thousand people are now floating where the ship went down. Some are
stunned, gasping for breath. Others are crying, praying, moaning,
shouting... screaming.

Jack and Rose surface among them. They barely have time to gasp for air
before people are clawing at them. People driven insane by the water, 4
degrees below freezing, a cold so intense it is indistinguishable form
death by fire.

A man pushes Rose under, trying to climb on top of her... senselessly
trying to get out of the water, to climb onto anything. Jack PUNCHES him
repeatedly, pulling her free.

                                   JACK

Swim, Rose! SWIM!

She tries, but her strokes are not as effective as his because of her
lifejacket. They break out of the clot of people. He has to find some kind
of flotation, anything to get her out of the freezing water.

                                   JACK

Keep swimming. Keep moving. Come one, you can do it.

All about them there is a tremendous wailing, screaming and moaning... a
chorus of tormented souls. And beyond that... nothing but black water
stretching to the horizon. The sense of isolation and hopelessness is
overwhelming.

                                                                   CUT TO:

282 OMITTED

283 EXT. OCEAN

Jack strokes rhythmically, the effort keeping him from freezing.

                                   JACK

Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.

                                   ROSE

It's so cold.

                                   JACK

I know. I know. Help me, here. Look around.

His words keep her focused, taking her mind off the wailing around them.
Rose scans the water, panting, barely able to draw a breath. She turns
and... SCREAMS.

A DEVIL is right in from of her face. It is the black FRENCH BULLDOG,
swimming right at her like a seamonster in the darkness, its coal eyes
bugging. It motors past her, like it is headed for Newfoundland.

Beyond it Rose sees somehting in the water.

                                   ROSE

What's that?

Jack sees what she is pointing to, and they make for it together. It is a
piece of wooden debris, intricately carved. He pushes her up and she
slithers onto it belly down.

But when Jack tries to get up onto the thing, it tilts and submerges,
almost dumping Rose off. It is clearly only big enough to support her. He
clings to it, close to her, keeping his upper body out of the water as best
he can.

Their breath floats around them in a cloud as they pant from exertion. A
MAN swims toward them, homing in on the piece of debris. Jack warns him
back.

                                   JACK

It's just enough for this lady... you'll push it under.

                                    MAN

Let me try at least, or I'll die soon.

                                   JACK

You'll die quicker if you come any closer.

                                    MAN

Yes, I see. Good luck to you then.

                              (swimming off)

God bless.

                                                                   CUT TO:

284 EXT. COLLAPSIBLE A / OCEAN

The boat is overloaded and half-flooded. Men cling to the sides in the
water. Others, swimming, are drawn to it as their only hope. Cal, standing
in the boat, slaps his oar in the water as a warning.

                                    CAL

Stay back! Keep off!

Fabrizio, exhausted and near the limit, makes it almost to the boat. Cal
CLUBS HIM with the oar, cutting open his scalp.

                                 FABRIZIO

You don't... understand... I have... to get... to America.

                                    CAL

                          (pointing with the oar)

It's that way!

CLOSE ON FABRIZIO as he floats, panting each breath agony. You see the
spirit leave him.

FABRIZIO'S POV: Cal in SLOW MOTION, yelling and wielding the oar. A demon
in a tuxedo. The image fades to black.

                                                                   CUT TO:

285 EXT. OCEAN

JACK AND ROSE still float amid a chorus of hte damned. Jack sees the ship's
officer nearby, CHIEF OFFICER WILDE. He is blowing his whistle furiously,
knowing the sound will carry over the water for miles.

                                   JACK

The boats will come back for us, Rose. Hold on just a little longer. They
had to row away for the suction and now they'll be coming back.

She nods, his words helping her. She is shivering uncontrollably, her lips
blue and her teeth chattering.

                                   ROSE

Thank God for you Jack.

People are still screaming, calling to the lifeboats.

                                   WOMAN

Come back! Please! We know you can hear us. For God's sake!

                                    MAN

Please... help us. Save one life! SAVE ON LIFE!

                                                                   CUT TO:

286 EXT. LIFEBOATS / OCEAN

IN BOAT 6: Ruth has her ears covered against the wailing in the darkness.
The first class women in the boat sit, stunned, listening to the sounds of
hundreds screaming.

                                 HITCHINS

They'll pull us right down I tell ya!

                                   MOLLY

Aw knock it off, yer scarin' me. Come on girls, grab your oars. Let's go.

                              (nobody moves)

Well come on!

The women won't meet her eyes. They huddle into their ermine wraps.

                                   MOLLY

I don't understand a one of you. What's the matter with you? It's your men
back there! We got plenty a' room for more.

                                 HITCHINS

If you don't shut that hole in yer face, there'll be one less in this boat!

Ruth keeps her ears covered and her eyes closed, shutting it all out.

287 IN BOAT ONE: Sir Cosmo and Lucile Duff-Gordon sit with ten other people
in a boat that is two thirds empty. They are two hundred yards from the
screaming in the darkness.

                            FIREMAN HENDRICKSON

We should do something.

Lucile squeezes Cosmo's hand and pleads him with her eyes. She is
terrified.

                                 SIR COSMO

It's out of the question.

The crewmembers, intimidated by a nobleman, acquiesce. They hunch guiltily,
hoping the sound will stop soon.

TWENTY BOATS, most half full, float in the darkness. None of them make a
move.

                                                                   CUT TO:

288 EXT. OCEAN

Jack and Rose drift under the blazing stars. The water is glassy, with only
the faintest undulating swell. Rose can actually see the stars reflecting
on the black mirror of the sea.

Jack squeezes the water out of her long coat, tucking it in tightly around
her legs. He rubs her arms. His face is chalk with in the darkness. A low
MOANING in the darknes around them.

                                   ROSE

It's getting quiet.

                                   JACK

Just a few more minutes. It'll take them a while to get the boats
organized...

Rose is unmoving, just staring into space. She knows the truth. There won't
be any boats. Behind Jack she sees that Officer Wilde has stopped moving.
He is slumped in his lifejacket, looking almost asleep. He has died of
exposure already.

                                   JACK

I don't know about you, but I intend to write a strongly worded letter to
the White Star Line about all this.

She laughs weakly, but it sounds like a gasp of fear. Rose finds his eyes
in the dim light.

                                   ROSE

I love you Jack.

He takes her hand.

                                   JACK

No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it.

                                   ROSE

I'm so cold.

                                   JACK

You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going
to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady,
warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?

                                   ROSE

I can't feel my body.

                                   JACK

Rose, listen to me. Listen. Winning that ticket was the best thing that
ever happened to me.

Jack is having trouble getting the breath to speak.

                                   JACK

It brought me to you. And I'm thankful, Rose. I'm thankful.

His voice is trembling with the cold which is working tis way to his heart.
But his eyes are unwavering.

                                   JACK

You must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you will
never give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless...
promise me now, and never let go of that promise.

                                   ROSE

I promise.

                                   JACK

Never let go.

                                   ROSE

I promise. I will never let go, Jack. I'll never let go.

She grips his hand and they lie with their heads together. It is quiet now,
except for the lapping of the water.

                                                                   CUT TO:

289 EXT. LIFEBOATS / OCEAN - NIGHT

Fifth Officer Lowe, the impetuous young Welshman, has gotten Boats 10, 12
and Collapsible D together with his own Boat 14. A demon of energy, he's
had everyone hold the boats together and is transferring passengers from 14
into the others, to empty his boat for a rescue attempt.

As the women step gingerly across the other boats, Lowe sees a shawled
figure in too much of a hurry. He rips the shawl off, and finds himself
staring into the face of a man. He angrily shoves the stowaway into another
boat and turns to his crew of three.

                                   LOWE

Right, man the oars.

                                                                   CUT TO:

290 EXT. OCEAN / BOAT 14

The beam of an electric torch plays across the water like a searchlight as
boat 14 comes toward us.

ANGLE FROM THE BOAT as the torch illuminates floating debris, a poignant
trail of flotsam: a violin, a child's wooden soldier, a framed photo of a
steerage family. Daniel Marvin's wooden Biograph camera.

Then, their white lifebelts bobbing in the darkness like signoposts, the
first bodies come into the torch's beam. The people are dead but not
drowned, killed by the freezing water. Some look like they could be
sleeping. Others stare with frozen eyes at the stars.

Soon bodies are so thick the seamen cannot row. They hit the oars on the
heads of floating men and women... a wooden thunk. One seaman throws up.
Lowe sees a mother floating with her arms frozen around her lifeless baby.

                                   LOWE

                      (the worst moment of his life)

We waited too long.

                                                                   CUT TO:

291 EXT. OCEAN

IN A HOVERING DOWNANGLE we see Jack and Rose floating in the black water.
The stars reflect in the mill pond surface, and the two of them seem to be
floating in interstellar space. They are absolutely still. Their hands are
locked together. Rose is staring upwards at the canopy of stars wheeling
above her. The music is transparent, floating... as the long sleep steals
over Rose, and she feels peace.

CLOSE ON Rose's face. Pale, like the faces of the dead. She seems to be
floating in a void. Rose is in a semi-hallucinatory state. She knows she is
dying. Her lips barely move as she sings a scrap of Jack's song:

                                   ROSE

"Come Josephine in my flying machine..."

ROSE'S POV: The stars. Like you've never seen them. The Milky Way a
glorious band from horizon to horizon.

A SHOOTING STAR flares... a line of light across the heavens.

TIGHT ON ROSE again. We see that her hair is dusted with frost crystals.
Her breathing is so shallow, she is almost motionless. Her eyes track down
from the stars to the water.

ROSE'S POV... SLOW MOTION: The silhouetter of a boat crossing the stars.
She sees men in it, rowing so slowly the oars lift out of the syrupy water,
leaving weightless pearls floating in the air. The VOICES of the men sound
slow and DISTORTED.

Then the lookout flashes his torch toward her and the light flares across
the water, silouetting the bobbing corpses in between. It flicks past her
motionless form and moves on. The boat is 50 feet away, and moving past
her. The men look away.

Rose lifts her head to turn to Jack. We see that her hair has frozen to the
wood under her.

                                   ROSE

                             (barely audible)

Jack.

She touches his shoulder with her free hand. He doesn't respond. Rose
gently turns his face toward her. It is rimed with frost.

He seems to be sleeping peacefully.

But he is not asleep.

Rose can only stare at his still face as the realization goes through her.

                                   ROSE

Oh, Jack.

All hope, will and spirit leave her. She looks at the boat. It is further
away now, the voices fainter. Rose watches them go.

She closes her eyes. She is so weak, and there just seems to be no reason
to even try.

And then... her eyes snap open.

She raises her head suddenly, cracking the ice as she rips her hair off the
wood. She calls out, but her voice is so weak they don't hear her. The boat
is invisible now, the torch light a star impossibly far away. She struggles
to draw breath, calling again.

292 IN THE BOAT Lowe hears nothing behind him. He points to something
ahead, turning the tiller.

293 ROSE struggles to move. Her hand, she realizes, is actually frozen to
Jack's. She breaths on it, melting the ice a little, and gently unclasps
their hands, breaking away a thin tinkling film.

                                   ROSE

I won't let go. I promise.

She releases him and he sinks into the black water. He seems to fade out
like a spirit returning to some immaterial plane.

Rose rolls off the floating staircase and plunges into the icy water. She
swims to Chief Officer Wilde's body and grabs his whistle. She starts to
BLOW THE WHISTLE with all the strength in her body. Its sound slaps across
the still water.

294 IN BOAT 14 Lowe whips around at the sound of the whistle.

                                   LOWE

                           (turning the tiller)

Row back! That way! Pull!

Rose keeps blowing as the boat comes to her. She is still blowing when Lowe
takes the whistle from her mouth as they haul her into the boat. She slips
into uncosciousness and they scramble to cover her with blankets...

                                                              DISSOLVE TO:

295 INT. IMAGING SHACK / KELDYSH

EXTREME CLOSEUP of Rose's ancient, wrinkled face. Present day.

                                 OLD ROSE

Fifteen hundred people went into the sea when Titanic sank from under us.
There were twenty boats floating nearby and only one came back. One. Six
were saved from the water, myself included. Six out of fifteen hundred.

As she speaks THE CAMERA TRACKS slowly across the faces of Lizzy and the
salvage crew on KELDYSH. Lovett, Bodine, Buell, the others... the reality
of what happened here 84 years before has hit them like never before. With
her story Rose has put them on Titanic in its final hours, and or the first
time, they do feel like graverobbers.

Lovett, for the first time, has even forgotten to ask about the diamond.

                                 OLD ROSE

Afterward, the seven hundred people in the boats had nothing to do but
waith... wait to die, wait to live, wait for an absolution which would
never come.

                                                              DISSOLVE TO:

296 EXT. LIFEBOATS / OPEN SEA - PRE-DAWN

MATCHING MOVE as the camera tracks along the faces of the saved.

DISSOLVE TO: ANOTHER BOAT, and then ANOTHER, seeing faces we know among the
survivors: Ismay in a trance, just staring and trembling... Cal, sipping
from a hip flask offered to him by a black-faced stoker... Ruth hugging
herself, rocking gently.

IN BOAT 14: CLOSE ON ROSE, lying swaddled. Only her face is visile, white
as the moon. The man next to her jumps up, pointing and yelling. Soon
everyone is looking and shouting excitedly. In Rose's POV it is all silent,
SLOW MOTION.

IN SLOW-MOTION SILENCE we see Lowe light a green flare and wave it as
everyone shouts and cheers. Rose doesn't react. She floats beyond all human
emotion.

                                                              DISSOLVE TO:

298 EXT. LIFEBOATS / OPEN SEA - DAWN

Golden lgiht washes across the white boats, which gloat in a calm sea
reflecting the rosy sky. All around them, like a flotilla of sailing ships,
are icebergs. The CARPATHIA sits nearby, as boats row toward her.

                                                              DISSOLVE TO:

299 EXT. LIFEBOATS / OCEAN / CARPATHIA MONTAGE - DAY

IMAGES DISSOLVE into one another: a ship's hull looming, with the letters
CARPATHIA visible on the bow... Rose watching, rocked by the sea, her face
blank... seamen helping survivors up the rope ladder to the Carpathia's
gangway doors... two women crying and hugging each other inside the ship...
ALL SILENT, ALL IN SLOW-MOTION. There is just music, so gentle and sad,
part elegy, part hymn, part aching song of love lost forever.

THE IMAGES CONTINUE to music... Rose, outside of time, outside of herself,
coming into Carpathia, barely able to stand... Rose being draped wtih warm
blankets and given hot tea... BRUCE ISMAY climbing aboard. He has the face
and eyes of a damned soul.

As Ismay walks along the hall, guided by a crewman toward the doctor's
cabin, he passes rows of seated and standing widows. He must run the
gauntlet of their accusing gazes.

                                                                   CUT TO:

300 EXT. DECK / CARPATHIA - DAY

It is the afternoon of the 15th. Cal is searching the faces of the widows
lining the deck, looking for Rose. The deck of Carpathia is crammed with
huddled people, and even the recovered lifeboats of Titanic. On a hatch
cover sits an enormous pile of lifebelts.

He keeps walking toward the stern. Seeing Cal's tuxedo, a steward
approaches him.

                             CARPATHIA STEWARD

You won't find any of your people back here, sir. It's all steerage.

Cal ignores him and goes amongst this wrecked group, looking under shawls
and blankets at one bleak face after another.

Rose is sipping hot tea. Her eyes focus on him as he approaches her. He
barely recognizes her. She looks like a refugee, her matted hair hanging in
her eyes.

                                   ROSE

Yes, I lived. How awkward for you.

                                    CAL

Rose... your mother and I have been looking for you--

She holds up her hand, stopping him.

                                   ROSE

Please don't. Don't talk. Just listen. We will make a deal, since that is
something you understand. From this moment you do not exist for me, nor I
for you. You shall not see me again. And you will not attempt to find me.
In return I will keep my silence. Your actions last night need never come
to light, and you will get to keep the honor you have carefully purchased.

She fixes him with a glare as cold and hard as the ice which changed their
lives.

                                   ROSE

Is this in any way unclear?

                                    CAL

                            (after a long beat)

What do I tell your mother?

                                   ROSE

Tell her that her daughter died with the Titanic.

She stands, turning to the rail. Dismissing him. We see Cal stricken with
emotion.

                                    CAL

You're precious to me, Rose.

                                   ROSE

Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley.

We see that in his way, the only way he knows, he does truly love her.

After a moment, he turns and walks away.

                              OLD ROSE (V.O.)

That was the last time I ever saw him. He married, of course, and inherited
his millions. The crash of 28 hit his interests hard, and he put a pistol
in his mouth that year. His children fought over the scraps of his estate
like hyenas, or so I read.

301 ANGLE ON ROSE, at the railing of the Carpathia, 9pm April 18th. She
gazes up at the Statue of Liberty, looking just as it does today, welcoming
her home with her glowing torch. It is just as Fabrizio saw it, so clearly,
in his mind.

302 LATER CARPATHIA DISCORGES THE SURVIVORS at the Cunard pier, Pier 54.
Over 30,000 people line the dock and fill the surrounding streets. The
magnesium flashes of the photographers go off like small bombs, lighting an
amazing tableau.

Several hundred police keep the mob back. The dock is packes with friends
and reletives, officials, ambulances, and the press--

Reporters and photographers swarm everywhere... 6 deep at the foot of the
gangways, lining the tops of cars and trucks... it is the 1912 equicalent
of a media circus. They jostle to get close to the survivors, tugging on
them as they pass and shouting over each other to ask them questions.

Rose is covered with a whoollen shawl and walking with a group of steerage
passengers. Immigration officers are asking them questions as they come off
the gangway.

                            IMMIGRATION OFFICER

Name?

                                   ROSE

Dawson. Rose Dawson.

The officer steers her toward a holding area for processing. Rose walks
forward with the dazed immigrants. The BOOM! of photographer's magnesium
flashes cause them to flinch, and the glare is blinding. There is a sudden
disturbance near her as two men burst through the cordon, running to
embrace an older woman along the survivors, who cries out with joy. The
reporters converge on this emotional scene, and flashes explode.

Rose uses this moment to slip away into the crowd. She pushes through the
jostling people, moving with purpose, and none challenges her in the
confusion.

                              OLD ROSE (V.O.)

Can you exchange one life for another? A caterpillar turns into a
butterfly. If a mindless insect can do it, why couldn't I? Was it any more
unimaginable than the sinking of the Titanic?

TRACKING WITH HER as she walks away, further and further until she flashes
and the roar are far behind her, and shi is till walking, determined.

                                                                   CUT TO:

303 INT. IMAGING SHACK / KELDYSH

Old Rose sits with the group in the Imaging Shack, lit by the blue glow of
the screens. She holds the haircomb with the jade butterfly on the handle
in her gnarled hands.

                                  BODINE

We never found anything on Jack. There's no record of him at all.

                                 OLD ROSE

No, there wouldn't be, would there? And I've never spoken of him until now,
not to anyone.

                                (to Lizzy)

Not even your grandfather. A woman's heart is a deep ocean of secrets. But
now you all know there was a man named Jack Dawson, and that he saved me,
in every way that a person can be saved.

                            (closing her eyes)

I don't even have a picture of him. He exists now only in my memory.

                                                                   CUT TO:

304 OMITTED

305 EXT. OCEAN FLOOR / TITANIC WRECK

The Mir submersibles make their last pass over the ship. We hear Yuri the
pilot on the UQC:

                                   YURI

Mir One returning to surface.

The sub rises off the deck of the wreck, taking its light with it, leaving
the Titanic once again it its fine and private darkness.

                                                                   CUT TO:

306 EXT. KELDYSH DECK

A desultory wrap party for the expedition is in progress. There is music
and some of the (co-ed) Russian crew are dancing. Bodine is getting drunk
in the aggressive style of Baker Joughin.

Lovett stands at the rail, looking down into the black water. Lizzy comes
to him, offering him a beer. She puts her hand on his arm.

                                   LIZZY

I'm sorry.

                                  LOVETT

We were pissin' in the wind the whole time.

Lovett notices a figure move through the lights far down at the stern of
the ship.

                                  LOVETT

Oh shit.

                                                                   CUT TO:

307 EXT. KELDYSH STERN DECK

Rose walks through the shadows of the deck machinery. Her nightgown blows
in the wind. Her feet are bare. Her hands are clutched at her chest, almost
as if she is praying.

ON LOVETT AND LIZZY running down the stairs from the top deck, hauling ass.

ROSE reaches the sern rail. Her gnarled fingers wrap over the rail. Her
ancient foot steps up on the gunwale. She pushes herself up, leaning
forward. Over her shoulder, we see the black water glinting far below.

LOVETT AND LIZZY run up behind her.

                                   LIZZY

Grandma, wait!! Don't--

ROSE TURNS her head, looking at them. She turns further, and we see she has
something in her hand, something she was about to drop overboard.

It is the "Heart of the Ocean".

Lovett sees his holy grail in her hand and his eyes go wide. Rose keeps it
over the railing where she can drop it anytime.

                                   ROSE

Don't come any closer.

                                  LOVETT

You had it the entire time?!

FLASH CUT TO: A SILENT IMAGE OF YOUNG ROSE walking away from Pier 54. The
photographers' flashes go off like a battle behind her. She has her hands
in her pockets. She stops, feeling something, and pulls out the necklace.
She stares at it in amazement.

BACK ON KELDYSH, Rose smiles at Brock's incomprehension.

                                   ROSE

The hardest part about being so poor, was being so rich. But every time I
though of selling it, I though of Cal. And somehow I always got by without
his help.

She holds it out over the water. Bodine and a couple of the other guys come
up behind Lovett, reacting to what is in Rose's hand.

                                  BODINE

Holy shit.

                                  LOVETT

Don't drop it Rose.

                                  BODINE

                            (a fierce whisper)

Rush her.

                                  LOVETT

                                (to Bodine)

It's hers, you schmuck.

                                 (to her)

Look, Rose, I... I don't know what to say to a woman who tries to jump off
the Titanic when it's not sinking, and jumps back onto it when it is...
we're not dealing with logic here, I know that... but please... think about
this a second.

                                   ROSE

I have. I came all the way here so this could go back where it belongs.

The massive diamond glitters. Brock edges closer and holds out his hand...

                                  LOVETT

Just let me hold it in my hand, Rose. Please. Just once.

He comes closer to her. It is reminiscent of Jack slowly moving up to her
at the stern of Titanic.

Surprisingly, she calmly places the massice stone in the palm of his hand,
while still holding onto the necklace. Lovett gazes at the object of his
quest. An infinity of cold scalpels glint in its blue depths. It is
mesmerizing. It fits in his hand just like he imagined.

                                  LOVETT

My God.

His grip tightens on the diamond.

He looks up, meeting her gaze. Her eyes are suddenly infinitely wise and
deep.

                                   ROSE

You look for treasures in the wrong place, Mr. Lovett. Only life is
priceless, and making each day count.

His fingers relax. He opens them slowly. Gently she slips the diamond out
of his hand. He feels it sliding away.

Then, with an impish little grin, Rose tosses the necklace over the rail.
Lovett gives a strangled cry and rushes to the rail in time to see it hit
the water and disappear forever.

                                  BODINE

Aww!! That really sucks, lady!

Brock Lovett goes through ten changes before he settles on a reaction... HE
LAUGHS. He laughs until the tears come to his eyes. Then he turns to Lizzy.

                                  LOVETT

Would you like to dance?

Lizzy grins at him and nods. Rose smiles. She looks up at the stars.

308 IN THE BLACK HEART OF THE OCEAN, the diamond sinks, twinkling end over
end, into the infinate depths.

                                                                   CUT TO:

309 INT. ROSE'S CABIN / KELDYSH

A GRACEFUL PAN across Rose's shelf of carefully arranged pictures:

Rose as a young actress in California, radiant... a theatrically lit studio
publicity shot... Rose and her husband, with their two children... Rose
with her son at his college graduation... Rose with her children and
grandchildren at her 70th birthday. A collage of images of a life lived
well.

THE PAN STOPS on an image filling frame. Rose, circa 1920. She is at the
beach, sitting on a horse at the surfline. The Santa Monica pier, with its
rollercoaster is behind her. She is grinning, full of life.

We PAN OFF the last picture to Rose herself, warm in her bunk. A profile
shot. She is very still. She could be sleeping, or maybe something else.

                                                                   CUT TO:

BLACKNESS

310 THE WRECK OF TITANIC looms like a ghost out of the dark. It is lit by a
kind of moonlight, a light of the mind. We pass over the endless forecastle
deck to the superstructure, moving faster than subs can move... almost like
we are flying.

WE GO INSIDE, and the echoing sound of distant waltz music is heard. The
rust fades away from the walls of the dark corridor and it is
transformed... WE EMERGE onto the grand staircase, lit by glowing
chandelier. The music is vibrant now, and the room is populated by men in
tie and tails, women in gowns. It is exquisitely beautiful.

IN POV we sweep down the staircase. The crowd of beautiful gentlmen and
ladies turn as we descend toward them. At the bottom a man stands with his
back to us... he turns and it is Jack. Smiling he holds his hand out toward
us.

IN A SIDE ANGLE Rose goes into his arms, a girl of 17. The passengers,
officers and crew of the RMS Titanic smile and applaud in the utter silence
of the abyss.

                                                                   FADE OUT

               Britain the Dark Ages

               The Roman Empire has fallen.

               The land lies in ruins, divided amoung feuding tribes.

               To the west, Ireland has flourished untouched by the Romans, 
               protected by the sea.
 
               Led by their powerful and ruthless King, the Irish have subdued 
               the Britons.
 
               Knowing that if Ireland is to prosper, the tribes must never 
               be allowed to unite.

                         Just as the Irish like us. But if we 
                         were one land united, we would out number 
                         them two to one. We could defeat them 
                         once and for all. That is why we are 
                         here today, to sign this treaty of unification.

                         time. You're in Ireland. Did you know 
                         that? Shh... It's alright. You're safe 
                         here. No one knows. Don't be scared.

                         got this? Too many questions. Here keep

                         We seek him as I speak. Hopefully it 
                         is just his rotted corpse we'll find, 
                         for he has slain your betrothed. Morholt 
                         is dead. Fallen in battle. Isolde? Bragnae,

                         tribe with the maximum force you speak 
                         of? I will not confront them again until

                         On behalf of Cornwall, I offer your 
                         daughter a place on our throne. The 
                         throne of England, united behind one 
                         leader.

                         Isolde! Perhaps it is just that he who 
                         took a husband provides one.

                         No. Tristan of Aragon has won you on 
                         behalf of Lord Marke of Cornwall.

                         the wedding I'll disavow Isolde, the 
                         alliance will crumble.

                         I can't. I won you in my King's name.

                         burning in me, I feel on fire and guilt 
                         and I can't get rid of either. Does

                         and in the end all they hold is days 
                         and days without love. Love is made

                         That he will not make any more mistakes 
                         and that it is time for him to move

                         It will be undone.

                         TristanIm for the wormsswear to me 
                         that you are true.

                         Goodbye my friend.

               [Marke and his generals leave and Isolde goes to Tristans side]

                         Know that I love you Tristan. And wherever 
                         you go, whatever you see, I will always 
                         be with you.
 
                                     TRISTAN
                         You were right. I do not know if life 
                         is greater than death, but love was 
                         more than either.
 
               [Tristan dies and Isolde weeps. We see Tristan and Isolde back 
               in the hut in Ireland as she reads to him]

                         "My face in thine eyes, thine in mine 
                         appears,
 
               And true plain hearts do in the faces rest;

               Where can we find two better hemispheres,

               Without sharp north, without declining west?

               Whatever dies, was not mixed equally;

               If our two loves be one, or thou and I.

               Love so alike, that none can slacken, none can die."

               [They kiss]

               

               Their love did not bring down a kingdom. Legend says that Marke 
               defeated the Irish, rebuilt Castle Dor and reigned in peace until 
               the end of his days.
 
               Isolde laid Tristan beneath the ashes of the Roman ruin, planted 
               his grave with two willows that grew forever intertwined... then 
               disappeared.
